Abstract 
The construction of mathematical models includes a variety of strategies for closing the gap between the model and 
real-time data. This study uses a data mining technique to expand mathematical model construction to include 
simulation optimization. At the same time, this procedure is used to verify the mathematical model. In addition to 
dynamic property validation, the paper suggests mathematical programming as a static property validation method. 
The validated mathematical model is compared and examined with real-time data, and the results show that the 
mathematical model applies to real-time systems. The mathematical model has a low error margin estimate and can 
be used to forecast. The paper's main contribution is to investigate simulation optimization, mathematical 
programming, and mathematical models to handle the increasing complexity of variables to improve prediction 
capabilities and lay a solid foundation for tackling factory planning issues.

1. Introduction
Much research has addressed the mathematical model in manufacturing systems (Abazari et al., 2012; Bagheri and 
Bashiri, 2014; Leitão and Restivo, 2008; X. Li et al., 2010; Shen and Yao, 2015). The issues of mathematical model 
development relate to integrating multiple variables and various constraints into one mathematical model and model 
effectiveness under a real-time system's unpredictable and dynamic nature. To find a solution to the issue, many 
researchers studied various methods to develop a mathematical model that narrows the gap between the model and 
the real-time data. The existing methods are data mining (Arif et al., 2013; Chincholkar and Herrmann, 2008; Kim

3. Finding and Discussion 
The study shows that validation of the simulation model with real-time data plays a very important role in improving the 
mathematical model application in a real-time system. The main reason for the improvement in model prediction in this study is 
due to the revised methodology that envelopes the mathematical model development through data mining using simulation 
optimization data and its concurrent mathematical programming validation  
 
The study shows the importance of validating the model's static and dynamic properties. The mathematical model development 
through data mining on simulation optimization has performed validation of dynamic properties as the mathematical model is 
producing the acceptance statistical analysis data as a simulation optimization result (see Tables 4 and 5). The dynamic properties 
of the model reflect the actual environment that is affected by time and describe the change from one state to another. The 
integration between mathematical model development and its validation using simulation optimization has advantages to reducing 
procedure in this proposed methodology and a higher probability of producing closer results to real-time data since the simulation 
is a reflection tool of the actual manufacturing system. Simulation replicates the behavior and exhibits the changes in nature, 
representing the real-time manufacturing system. While it is a popular validation tool among researchers, the study argues the 
limitation and less effectiveness of having one validation due to a lack of prediction effectiveness. 
 
In order to improve the mathematical model’s effectiveness, it is proposed to validate the static properties. The static properties 
calculate the model performance in a time-invariant steady-state, and the change takes place instantaneously.  Using the input 
setting from simulation optimization, the mathematical model and mathematical programming comparison show similar data for 
each experiment of various input settings (see Tables 5 and 6). This method reinforces the validation of static properties as evidence 
to improve mathematical model robustness for prediction effectiveness. The importance of this validation reveals that the 
manufacturing system contains both dynamic and static properties, which are required in the proposed mathematical model. 
 
Based on the results, we conclude that the model has a high satisfactory quality estimate and is acceptable for performing 
prediction. The error between the mathematical model and sampling real-time data in the study is in the range 0%–9.9% marginally, 
which is a relatively high-quality estimate (Eickemeyer et al., 2014). Based on the findings, it is recommended that simulation 
optimization is the better alternative data mining when compared with other methods as it exhibits the dynamic properties of the 
system. It is also recommended to use additional static properties of the model for validation to demonstrate prediction effectiveness 
to fit into the system's behavior. The inclusion of static properties of validation in parallel with dynamic properties enhances the 
effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model to produce closer results in manufacturing systems exhibiting both types of 
behavior.   
 
The effectiveness of the mathematical model includes its capability to adapt the changes in various input values of higher number 
of variables and at the same time, it can produce acceptable error of the output variable. Two other key elements that led to this 
contribution are randomness in 25 experiments and the acceptance of other real-time input variables in the simulation model 
(validation of individual processes). Due to this result, the study proposes this enhanced methodology to establish a more effective 
mathematical model in manufacturing systems to address the limitations that the previous studies faced.  
 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, an enhanced methodology that involves mathematical model development through simulation optimization and its 
concurrent static validation properties is proposed to improve the mathematical model in manufacturing systems. The main goal 
of the mathematical model is to minimize the gap between theory and practice. The data mining on simulation optimization is used 
for the mathematical model development. The developed mathematical model is further validated with static properties of 
mathematical programming. The paper emphasizes the quantitative analysis during the mathematical model development and 
validation. The effectiveness of the developed mathematical model is evaluated with real-time data. The mathematical model and 
real-time data result show that the model is satisfactory and acceptable for prediction analysis in the manufacturing system. Future 
studies must focus on enhancing the proposed methodology for the mathematical model development and its validation to narrow 
the gap between the mathematical model and real-time data. The findings can be used to continuously enhance the developed 
mathematical model and apply the model in real-time manufacturing systems in the future. Although this methodology is an 
improved version of current literature, the mixture of data mining on dynamic properties of the simulation model and static 
properties of mathematical programming in this proposed methodology provides a new platform for researchers to address further 
these limitations for future enhancement of the mathematical model.

Abstract 
Existing production planning models plan throughput to meet customer demand. However, there are limitations, such 
as a lack of quantitative correlation between process parameters and throughput shortage and emphasis on qualitative 
exercises in productivity improvements to recover throughput shortage. Most notably, recent developments show little 
attention is paid to quantitative means of throughput shortage recovery. This will result in jeopardizing the goal of 
meeting the demand. The study aims at developing and validating a production planning model incorporating 
throughput shortage recovery using mathematical programming. The literature review identifies opportunities such as 
the inclusion of process parameters and throughput shortage in the production planning model, which are integrated 
to develop a feasible production planning model. The study objectives are to perform throughput estimation and 
recover throughput shortage in a series of processes. The model encompasses three stages. In the first stage, the 
mathematical model of make span is developed as a function of process parameters for a series of processes. The 
mathematical model is formulated based on simulation data using statistical software (JMP). In the second stage, the 
mathematical model of planned throughput is formulated from the mathematical model of make span and validated 
with simulation-optimization throughput and mathematical programming throughput. In the third stage, a two-stage 
production planning model utilizes the mathematical model of planned throughput and mathematical programming to 
search for optimized process parameters to meet both planned throughput and throughput shortage. In the first stage 
of production planning, the model compares planned throughput with actual throughput for each day to identify actual 
throughput shortage. If there is a throughput shortage, on the subsequent day at the 2nd stage of production planning, 
the mathematical programming search for optimized process parameters to estimate attained throughput that can at 
least meet the projected throughput. The projected throughput is the summation of planned throughput from the current 
day and the actual throughput shortage from the previous day. If there is a throughput shortage available, the 
mathematical programming procedure for the next day is repeated. The simulated throughput shortage at 2nd stage of 
production is further carried forward to the subsequent day for the mathematical programming to estimate the attained 
throughput that can meet the projected throughput. If there is no simulated throughput shortage, the 2nd stage of 
production planning is terminated, and the 1st stage of production planning is repeated for the subsequent day. The 
mathematical programming in this study is to adjust process parameter values within the range of the allowable values 
when there is a throughput shortage. The model is validated in a manufacturing system for a period. The results show 
that, compared to existing production planning models with no throughput shortage recovery, the proposed model can 
reduce accumulated throughput shortage incurred over each period. The study introduces the novelty of formulating 
multiple processes parameters in mathematical programming to recover throughput shortage at the 2nd stage of 
production planning. The streamlining of the throughput shortage reduction approach indirectly enables manufacturers 
to reduce inventory buffers, optimize cycle time, and meet customer due dates.

Abstract 
Reliability concerns the extent to which a measurement of a phenomenon provides a stable and consistent result. 
Reliability is also concerned with repeatability. For example, a test will be reliable if measurement is repeated and 
conducted under constant conditions, hence will give the same result. This article attempts to present the result of a 
reliability study in the development of the Covid-19 risk management system in a Malaysia Institution of Higher 
Learning. The system is called C19-HIRAO. Two types of reliability study were explored for this purpose namely 
interrater reliability study and test-retest method. Interrater reliability study consists of Cohen’s Kappa statistic and 
percent agreement (conventional method). Interrater Cohen’s Kappa and Test-retest method were performed by the 
raters from Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP). The result proved that the developed C19-HIRAO has achieved an 
almost perfect agreement (0.92), moderate agreement (0.75) and very high relationship (1.00) for Interrater percentage 
agreement, Interrater Cohen’s Kappa and test-retest method respectively. In conclusion, although this system is still 
newly developed, the risk rating value obtained is consistent among different raters. The value of this risk rating is 
also stable and reliable over the time when test-retest reliability is conducted within the stipulated time frame by the 
same rater.

1. Introduction
Universities should be a safe place from Covid-19 virus transmission due to the availability of research experts and 
its conducive environment, however, with the presence of a large number of staff and students, the result could turn 
the other way round. According to Nivette et al. (2021), Oosterhoff & Palmer (2020) and Tomczyk et al. (2020), 
Covid-19 SOP non-compliance practice mostly contributed from the student (young adult) which lead to the spreading 
of Covid-19 infection. In relation to this, hygiene (handwashing and coughing behavior) is one of the behavioral 
perspectives that has driven a higher percentage in non-compliance practice among the students across 10 countries 
in Europe (Wismans et al., 2020).  
Working out the feasibility of the unparalleled worldwide measures to limit the coronavirus spread is now one of the 
scientists’ most pressing questions. Among several techniques to avoid spreading Covid-19 discussed globally, there 
are four successful approaches. Firstly, the social, economic, government and educational institutions sector’s 
restriction of movement (Han et al., 2020). Secondly, through systematic risk assessment which emphasizes all Covid-
19 potential infections and the determination of appropriate risk control (Randolph & Barreiro, 2020). Thirdly an

reliability is the influence of both the dynamic nature of the construct being measure over time and the duration of the 
time interval (Haynes et al., 2019). Most of the other factors that drive the stability of this result are due to 
psychological phenomena such as mood, poor memory, and the failure of the observer to understand the concepts to 
be conveyed in the relevant exercises (Geisinger, 2013). The test-retest reliability result may as well be contributed 
from both memory effect and practice effect. One example of memory effect is an individual may simply recall their 
responses from the first test occasion when attempting the re-test occasion while practice effect is defined as the 
familiarization of similar test which merely on a cognitive-type test. Thus, it is important to ensure that training can 
be delivered in such an interesting way to ensure the participant can fully understand the gist of the training concept. 
Another factor to be considered is the observer selection criteria such as their knowledge, expertise, and their time 
commitment. On top of that, the time gap between test 1 and test 2 should be ensured not taken too long and match 
the topics presented in the exercises conducted.

5. Conclusion 
In short, the developed C19-HIRAO meets all respective risk assessment criteria that emphasized hazard and risk 
recognition, a full assessment of risk, and dynamic opportunities plan to mitigate the risk to the acceptance level which 
may less harm to the staff and student in the university. The objective of this paper which is to present the result of a 
reliability analysis in the development of the C19-HIRAO in Malaysia Higher Learning Institution meets its purpose 
throughout the result discussed earlier on. A better result can be achieved by ensuring less guessing among the raters 
when the reliability study is conducted, it is important to ensure that each participant is given comprehensive training 
through a clear conceptual understanding of the system developed and their understanding of the training attended 
should be well assessed. Finally, it can be concluded that both inter-rater consistency (Cohen’s Kappa analysis and 
percentage agreement) and test-retest reliability capable to measure the agreement between rater either the stability of 
scores between 2 points of time within the same raters. In addition to this conclusion, another method that can be 
suggested to measure reliability is known as Fleiss Kappa Analysis (FPA). FPA can be applied to determine the level 
of agreement between two or more raters as long as it meets a few basic requirements and assumptions of Fleiss’

kappa. Cohen’s kappa only limited the researcher with the measurement between two raters which can be replaced by 
FPA for future research development in the same context of this study. This paper is very useful as previous studies 
related to the development of a risk management system at the workplace had overlook the reliability assessment. This 
is often happening due to less exposure among the researcher to the reliability assessment concept emphasized on 
semi-quantitative analysis. Therefore, this paper can be used as a reference to explore the reliability analysis concept 
that can be applied in the related-risk management system at the workplace.

Abstract 
DKI Jakarta often experiences flood disasters when the rainy season hits. The floods caused a number of residents to 
be affected so that residents needed to evacuate to safer places, such as refugee posts. Citizens who secure themselves 
at the post certainly need some necessary needs such as humanitarian logistics goods. Humanitarian logistics goods 
need to be distributed quickly and precisely so that optimal distribution lines are needed. This research aims to find 
out the route of distribution of humanitarian logistics goods that occur in Jakarta, especially East Jakarta. This problem 
is solved by using the Saving Matrix Method with the Nearest Neighbour and Nearest Insertion Method as a route 
sorting method. The results of the route determination are known that the optimal distribution path is obtained from 
the first alternative using the Nearest Neighbour Method with a total distance of 130.25 m.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a country that has geographical, geological, hydrological, and demographic conditions that can lead to 
potential disasters. The disasters can be caused by natural, non-natural, and social factors. The disaster that occurred 
is certainly needed readiness from various parties to help the victims of natural disaster to reduce disasters experienced 
by the victims, such as humanitarian logistics. The logistics itself is goods that can be used by the victims that include 
goods for food, clothing, etc. This research will discuss the disaster preparedness in humanitarian logistics that 
occurred in DKI Jakarta, specifically in East Jakarta. According to data from the National Disaster Management 
Agency or Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB) in Indonesia, there has been a serious flood disaster in 
January 2020. Jakarta province has 31 flood points, each of which has urgent needs that need to be met. In addition, 
there are negative impacts for residents due to floods that have occurred in early 2020. Therefore, an evaluation is 
needed related to the handling of the disaster, especially related to the distribution route of logistics goods delivery or 
humanitarian logistics. Good distribution of humanitarian logistics is the distribution of logistics goods that can reach 
those who need (victims) in a short time so that victims can immediately use those goods. Humanitarian logistics 
distribution must certainly have a strategic route and location so that the distribution of goods from upstream to 
downstream can operate optimally, efficiently, effectively, and beneficially for various parties. For humanitarian 
logistics distribution activities to run well, research is needed so that it can help get the desired results., Vehicle 
Routing Problem (VRP) can be used to determine distribution routes to get optimal results. VRP completion can be 
done by collecting the necessary data, such as data on the location of natural disasters, places of refuge, and locations 
from distribution centers. This research aims to analyze the route of humanitarian logistics distribution activities in 
Jakarta that focused on East Jakarta. In addition, to determine how to optimize the distance on the route of 
humanitarian logistics distribution activities in Jakarta with the VRP Method, such as Saving Matrix, Nearest 
Neighbor, and Nearest Insertion.

between alternative 2 and alternative 3 can be seen on route 2 where the intended location in alternative 2 is JT5 to 
JT10, while in alternative 2 is JT5 to JT8 post. This happens because the total distance to go and return from the 
warehouse to JT5 to JT10 and to JT8 has the same distance and is the shortest distance when compared to the total 
distance to other postal locations. The total distance from the 3rd alternative is 139.1 m. 
 
Based on the discussion that has been described, through this research, the government can find out the routes that can 
help flood victims to get humanitarian logistics goods effectively and efficiently. In addition, the government can use 
these alternative routes to be taken into consideration in choosing the route to be used. Therefore, the government can 
implement the proposed alternative if the government wants to use an effective and efficient route. 
 
6. Conclusion  
There are several conclusions that can be drawn based on this research, namely: 
1. East Jakarta is a very affected area in 2020 because East Jakarta has 50 wards out of a total of 157 wards affected 
by flooding in DKI Jakarta. So that, there are 5 routes formed based on the Saving Matrix Method, namely W-
JT23-JT20-JT22-JT11-JT24-JT26-JT25-JT27-W, W-JT5-JT10-JT7-JT6-JT13-JT2-JT14-JT8-W, W-JT12-JT9-
JT16-JT1-JT15-W, W-JT17-JT18-W, and W-JT3-JT19-JT4-JT21-W.  
2. There is one alternative route that is formed based on route sequencing using the Nearest Neighbor Method. The 
route for the 1st alternative has a total distance of 130.25 m. There are 2 alternative routes formed based on route 
sequencing using the Nearest Insertion Method. The route for the 2nd alternative has a total distance of 137.65 
m, while the total distance for the 3rd alternative is 139.1 m. If both routes based on the Nearest Insertion Method 
are compared, then the shortest route is obtained on the 2nd alternative route. Based on the three alternatives 
formed, it is known that the alternative route using the Nearest Neighbor Method has the shortest total distance 
when compared to all the alternatives formed. The shortest total distance of the three alternatives has 130.25 m.  
 
The advice that can be given based on this research is that the DKI Jakarta government can consider determining the 
route using the Saving Matrix Method with the Nearest Neighbor Method as a method of sorting the route.

Abstract 
This paper introduces the use of PjBL (Project Based Learning) to improve engineering student soft skill. Soft skill in 
the engineering student includes problem solving, creativity, critical thinking, initiative, analytical thinking, 
communication skill, responsibility, discipline, and attitude. These abilities will really impact to their future career 
and need to be engage in student course in the curriculum. The method used to improve them when lecturer give the 
subject that can be developed through several methods of teaching and learning approaches, for example PjBL. This 
research aims to find out how PjBL will affect student soft skill and performance. Due to Covid 19, there were less 
movement in lecturer's view, to apply the method during online learning. Most PjBL were used in direct teaching or 
onsite where the student must visit the class along with the facilitator. When lecturer face online teaching there are 
some difficulties in applying teaching method esspecially in undergraduate student which concern about high order 
thinking (HOT). The research starts form developing framework, defining student who will participate the treatment 
and developing assessment test to evaluate the study outome. There are 38 student form Project Management class 
that will be given serial project activites based on PjBL method. The research shows that PjBL could increase student 
softskill particularly analytical thinking and problem solving.

1. Introduction
Project-based learning (PBL) is a student-cantered pedagogy that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it 
is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems. 
Students learn about a subject by working for an extended period to investigate and respond to a complex question, 
challenge, or problem. It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote 
memorization, teacher-led classrooms where students complete one worksheet after another. It contrasts with lectures 
where the teacher stands in front of the classroom and talks while students passively listen and take notes. Whether in 
the classroom or at home, project-based learning is a great way to help students make real-world connections to their 
skills and build a deep understanding of important concepts. Well-designed project-based learning (or PBL) can

In managing a project, reporting is not spared, besides that communication is also needed in daily internship activities, 
both project-related communication and social and general communication. The very high value of field supervisors 
indicates that students' communication skills in the field are very good both in WFO internships (face to face in the 
office) and WFH (online). Sometimes students can communicate flexibly with colleagues or superiors at the 
internship, but some students are a little nervous when communicating with lecturers. The lecturer's assessment is 
lower because the assessment of the presentation once a week online with limited time and in formal classes makes 
students less able to convey well. 
 
Student initiatives in the field are high, this indicates the existence of Project Based Learning, with direction from 
lecturers it can be implemented and developed by students in the field. The thinking ability of students in analyzing a 
problem is good even though the value is smaller than initiative and creativity, this indicates that there is still a need 
for direction for students to analyze more deeply related to problems in the field. Students' analytical skills can be 
developed over time, students' analytical skills will also be trained as the project progresses to the end. In the early 
stages, students are still looking for the right technique and adaptation to the new environment, especially the world 
of work or fields that are different from campus life. 
 
Students in the productive age range and want to find a lot of experience is one of the factors driving the high scores 
for aspects of critical thinking. This is in line with good communication skills, students do not hesitate to ask questions 
and express interest in new things. 
 
  
Figure.3 PjBL review process of the proposal 
 
The results show that the attitude of students is very good, this is a positive value that we can get on the image of 
students in the work environment. The lowest score is discipline, so it is necessary to increase student discipline in 
work, especially related to time management. Some students who are late for lectures must begin to improve 
themselves while in the work environment or in the field, the rules in the field regarding working hours must always 
be obeyed by students during project work. (Figure 3). 
 
Conclusion 
As the conclusion, the success rate of the PjBL in virtual class be seen from the comparison between the achievement 
of stage 1 and the achievement of stage 2. In accordance with the purpose of the grant, namely increasing student 
understanding regarding the application of project management theory in the field. Improvement in the affective aspect 
of lecturer assessment in the second stage, from 4.88 to 5.44. While in the field supervisor's assessment there was a 
slight decrease, but not significant, namely from 5.77 it decreased to 5.65.

In the lecturer's assessment there was an increase in all aspects, this was due to the progress of students in reporting 
the results of project work that had been carried out. Students are increasingly understanding and mastering certain 
fields (related to each student's field project). At stage 1 students are still in the adaptation period so they are still 
familiar with field conditions, in stage 2 students have learned and are starting to understand field conditions so that 
reporting to lecturers also goes well. This is what causes an increase in student scores from all aspects.

The assessment of the field supervisor has decreased from several aspects, only the analytical thinking aspect has 
increased. The decrease in value is not significant, which is in the range of 0.1 – 0.2 points. Along with the 
development of the pandemic and the existence of a government program to limit students from coming to the 
office/field, it became an obstacle for students. One of them, communication with field supervisors decreased, not as 
intense as the communication if face to face. The data collection process also takes a longer time than internship 
students directly in the office/field. However, this obstacle can be overcome even though the internship runs on a 
WFH basis. After completing stage 2, students have a complete picture of the problems in the field and their solutions. 
Most of the students continued the data into data in the Final Project. Students' analytical skills get better or increase 
because students see direct practice references in the field. The average assessment of field supervisors is still higher 
than that of lecturers (academic supervisors) because field supervisors are more intense, directly involved, and more 
aware of student conditions in each project process. 
 
The aspect of problem solving, carried out by students in the internship project is scored higher by company 
supervisors than lecturers. This means that students can apply project-related materials in solving problems in the 
internship’s activity. In addition, the assessment score from the supervisor is also higher than lecturer's score because 
students had the more often face-to-face meeting, both physically or virtual using Zoom or virtual meeting platform 
which increase the task responsibility and trust. Most problem occurred due to the proper and right method, tools/ 
techniques which fit to the actual problem. There was a huge gap between theory and the actual one so the student can 
learn the implementation of the right solution and the challenges which was not learned in the class meeting.  
 
The value of the field supervisor is higher because in the field it will be more visible how student creativity and 
improvisation of problem solving. Meetings with class lecturers are held once a week so that lecturers are less able to 
assess in detail the creative process carried out by students in the field. Therefore, the application of the project Based 
Learning method in this course is very helpful to explore the potential of students and increase students' understanding 
of projects.

1. Introduction
Flood in Jakarta has become an annual problem that always occurs in the beginning of the year. Jakarta as the capital 
city of Indonesia has a population of 10,562,088 in 2020 and Jakarta is one of the most populous cities in Indonesia 
(Badan Pusat Statistik Provinsi DKI Jakarta, n.d.). The number of districts in Jakarta is 44 districts which 30 of them 
were declared flood prone area in 2014 (KOMINFO, 2015).  
Flood in Jakarta gives a negative impact on the people of Jakarta both in the terms of economy and health such as the 
damage to houses, vehicles, public transportation, public facilities, disrupting community mobility and causing 
potential flood victims. Major floods in Jakarta occurred in 2002, 2007 and 2013 where Jakarta suffered losses of Rp 
5.4 trillion in 2002, Rp 5.2 trillion in 2007 and Rp 7.5 trillion in 2013 (Ratriani, 2021). The Jakarta government stated 
that there were 5 flood victims consisting of children and elderly (Tim detikcom – detikNews, 2021). 
One of the important mitigations during flood in Jakarta is the implementation of flood logistics command posts, flood 
logistics command posts in Jakarta are able to ease the burden on the community when floods in Jakarta occur by 
providing resting place, health checking, food and drink distribution center and other useful items (Badan Nasional 
Penanggulangan Bencana, 2020). This study provides solution which it become mitigation to reduce the bad impact 
of flood by finding the best location for flood logistics command posts based on population of Jakarta per district and 
flood prone area per district with the smallest distribution time and calculating the maximum handling of flood 
refugees carried out by each flood logistics command posts per administrative city in Jakarta and calculating the 
number of humanitarian logistics vehicles that need to be prepared for each flood logistics command post. 
The general objective of this research is to find solution to reduce the bad impact of flood in Jakarta by determining 
the strategic location of flood logistics command posts, calculating the number of victims handling at each flood

The results of the calculation using mathematical model (3) which it is supported by Microsoft Excel software results 
in the conclusion that the flood logistics command post in Central Jakarta needs to prepare 7 humanitarian logistics 
vehicles so that the time span of humanitarian logistics vehicles to flood logistics command post is an average of 50 
minutes. The flood logistics command post in North Jakarta needs to prepare 4 humanitarian logistics vehicles so that 
the time span of humanitarian logistics vehicles to flood logistics command post is an average of 50 minutes. The 
flood logistics command post in West Jakarta needs to prepare 5 humanitarian logistics vehicles so that the time span 
of humanitarian logistics vehicles to flood logistics command post is an average of 50 minutes. The flood logistics 
command post in South Jakarta needs to prepare 6 humanitarian logistics vehicles so that the time span of humanitarian 
logistics vehicles to flood logistics command post is an average of 50 minutes. The flood logistics command post in 
East Jakarta needs to prepare 8 humanitarian logistics vehicles so that the time span of humanitarian logistics vehicles 
to flood logistics command post is an average of 50 minutes. The distribution time policy of 50 minutes is allocated

for all administrative cities in Jakarta so it is hoped that wherever someone is in area in Jakarta, humanitarian logistics 
vehicle can reach their destination and take refugees to flood logistics command post for 50 minutes. If the situation 
is required for flood logistics command post to distribute relief goods to flood prone area in Jakarta, the assumption 
that can be used is one half of 50 minutes which it is 25 minutes. It is expected wherever someone is in area in Jakarta, 
humanitarian logistics vehicle can reach their destination and bring relief goods for 25 minutes. The consideration of 
choosing the number of humanitarian logistics vehicle is based on the area, population, number of flood prone area 
and the number of selected flood logistics command post in Jakarta so as to create justice both in terms of time and 
capacity of flood logistics command post. Capacity of flood logistics command post is based on number of victim 
handling or humanitarian logistics vehicles. The using of humanitarian logistics vehicle in large number can reduce 
waiting time significantly but it is necessary to pay attention to the area, population and the ability to provide 
humanitarian logistics vehicles. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Handling flood in Jakarta requires mitigation to reduce the bad impact of flood in Jakarta where the recommendation 
of mitigation is determining the strategic location of flood logistics command post in district which can also reach 
other district within an administrative city in Jakarta, calculating the number of handling victim at each flood logistics 
command post and calculating the number of humanitarian logistics vehicle that must be prepared before the flood 
occurs in Jakarta. Determination of the location of flood logistics command post in Central Jakarta is Tanah Abang 
(the wards are Bendungan Hilir, Gelora, Kampung Bali, Kebon Kacang dan Kebon Melati), the location of flood 
logistics command post in North Jakarta are Tanjung Priok (the wards are Kebon Bawang, Papanggo, Sungai Bambu, 
Sunter Agung, Sunter Jaya, Warakas, Ancol, Pademangan Timur) and Pademangan (the wards are Ancol, Pademangan 
Timur), the location of flood logistics command post in West Jakarta are Grogol Petamburan (the wards are Grogol, 
Jelambar, Tanjung Duren Selatan, Tanjung Duren Utara, Tomang) and Kembangan (the wards are Meruya Selatan, 
Meruya Utara, Srengseng), the location of flood logistics command post in South Jakarta are Mampang Prapatan (-), 
Kebayoran baru (the wards are Gandaria Utara, Gunung, Kramat Pela, Melawai, Pulo, Rawa Barat, Selong, Senayan) 
and Cilandak (the wards are Cipete Selatan, Gandaria Selatan), the location of flood logistics command post in East 
Jakarta are Duren Sawit (the wards are Duren Sawit, Klender, Malaka Jaya, Malaka Sari, Pondok Kelapa, Podok 
Kopi), Jatinegara (the wards are Bali Mester, Cipinang Besar Utara, Cipinang Cempedak, Rawa Bunga) and Makasar 
(-). The number of victims handling at each flood logistics command post in each district is served or distributed by 
flood logistics command post and after it is calculated, the results are that each number of victim handling at each 
flood logistics command post in each administrative city in Central Jakarta is 24 affected people by flood, North 
Jakarta is 68 affected people by flood, West Jakarta is 105 affected people by flood, South Jakarta is 177 affected 
people by flood and East Jakarta is 188 affected people by flood. The number of handling victim is used as the basis 
for designing the size of flood logistics command post in each administrative city in Jakarta. Suggestions for the 
number of humanitarian logistics vehicle that must be prepared are Central Jakarta is 7 humanitarian logistics vehicles 
with an average distribution time of 50 minutes, North Jakarta is 4 humanitarian logistics vehicles with an average 
distribution time of 50 minutes, West Jakarta is 5 humanitarian logistics vehicles with an average distribution time of 
50 minutes, South Jakarta is 6 humanitarian logistics vehicles with an average distribution time of 50 minutes and 
East Jakarta is 8 humanitarian logistics vehicles with an average distribution time of 50 minutes. It is hoped that with 
the number of humanitarian logistics vehicles that are prepared, flood refugees can visit the flood logistics command 
post in 50 minutes and if it is only distribution of relief goods that is needed, it will take 25 minutes.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on the application of the Student-Centred Learning method in three architecture courses conducted 
in 2021 with online learning. As Covid 19 pandemic hit, online learning became compulsory and all stakeholders have 
to adjust to the situation. The main difficulties with online learning are that the students become less active, and more 
difficult to control the quality of learning. Another difficulty such as the lack of internet access in remote areas also 
present. To deal with those problems, we use synchronized learning through Video Conferenceing Software (VCS) –
with video off- to encourage interactions. The Student-Centred Learning (SCL) method was used to activate the 
students so that the lecturers can control the output. We used three courses with different states of application of  SCL 
in comparison. Out of three courses, two of them are theory-based and another is studio-based which is very different 
to that from the former. We used a similar method for three of them, which is the Jigsaw method. Despite the 
differences in the conditions of each course, students become more active in learning. The course which has full 
student-centred learning has more benefits than the others in which the method was only applied partially. In the 
studio-based course, however, SCL brings the smallest effect, which is due to the nature of the studio-based learning 
which is more hands-on on individual projects. Generally, the students are happier dan appreciative of the application 
of the student-centred learning method.

1. Introduction
The global Covid 19 pandemic has forced schools and universities around the world to switch to online learning in 
2020 and 2021 (Iranmanesh and Onur 2021; Komarzyńska-Świeściak et al. 2021). Students and teachers were forced 
to learn new skills and adjust accordingly to the new situations which vary from one place to another. The challenges 
brought by the pandemic on online learning are varied from one country to another. They are mainly human resources, 
the lack of direct interaction, and resource issues.  
The teachers or instructors, along with the students had to learn new skills to optimize the new media for online 
learning. Students usually have no problem with using technology as they are more familiar with digital media. The 
teachers and instructors, on the other hand, had to embrace new skills (Hickling et al. 2021). In developing countries 
like Indonesia where digital skills in the older generation are low, the shift to online learning makes it difficult for 
them. Another challenge related to human resources is stress and mental health during the pandemic which can 
intervene in teaching and learning (Mukhtar et al. 2020).

Figure 3.  The Feedback at the end of the course for the ADS2 
From the cases of the three courses above, it can be seen that the Jigsaw method is quite effective in being used in 
theory-based learning. In the case of APDM and ABP courses, this method speeds up the student learning process 
through group work. Students in the APDM course can learn eight general urban design theories in half a semester, 
which is almost impossible for individual students to do alone. In addition, this Jigsaw method can fill the disadvantage 
of online lectures where students in online lectures usually become more individual because of the disconnection of 
communication with other students. The ability to work together is made possible in the Jigsaw method because each 
group must solve problems in the form of questions given by the lecturer in a limited time. This limited time is also 
an exercise for students to read quickly. This was acknowledged by students in their evaluation of the APDM course, 
where they wrote down several skills they had learned in APDM, namely: 'speed reading', 'quick thinking’, 'teamwork', 
'discussion', and 'improving English' because the works of literature provided by the lecturer were in English. This 
shows that this method not only gives students a way to build their own knowledge but also gives them collaboration 
skills, reading skills in international languages, and discussion skills, which are considered soft skills. Online and 
conventional learning cannot provide these soft skills, while by slightly changing the learning method these soft skills 
can be achieved by the students. The use of small groups in ADS2 courses which should be in the form of studio 
learning, although not the Jigsaw method, can still activate students in their respective groups. This small change made 
in the middle of the second semester managed to overcome several problems in learning studio courses online at ADS2 
such as the lack of communication between students which can affect design performance, the long waiting time for 
each student and the exhaustion of the lecturers. This learning also gives students the ability to communicate and 
empathize with one another. However, in this ADS2 course, the dominance of the lecturers is still visible because 
students are still very dependent on the lecturers as seen in the results of the evaluation of the learning process where 
students ask the lecturers to provide targets and provide non-contradictory feedback. This requires further evaluation 
for future architectural design studio learning which is more active and more student-oriented.  
5. Conclusion
The adoption of Student Centred Learning in online courses during the Covid 19 pandemic can help to increase their 
effectiveness. This can be seen from what happened in three architectural courses with different characters and at 
different stages of adoption.  APDM, which was designed to be SCL based in the first place shows a very good 
outcome and satisfaction from the students. ABP and ADS2 which adopted SCL in mid-semester also show 
improvement even when not optimal. ADS2 which is a studio-based course shows the least satisfaction, which is 
mainly due to the character of design studio learning that needs more interactions among the students and instructors 
to yield a better outcome.

ABSTRACT 
 
Entrepreneurship skills need to be possessed by vocational school students in the face of competition in the world of 
work. The urgency of entrepreneurship education can be seen by the increasing number of schools and colleges 
providing entrepreneurship education. Entrepreneurship education communication is very important so that teaching 
is not just a concept but also a practice. Insan Cendikia Vocational School (SMK) seeks to implement entrepreneurship 
education by developing a chips business from processed salak. The initial business of salak-based snacks has 
potential for schools as well as student learning facilities. The purpose of this paper is to describe how the importance 
of communication in entrepreneurship education is carried out by vocational schools. The method used was qualitative 
for the emergent entrepreneurship education in SMK Insan Cendikia. The result: Teaching factory teaching in 
entrepreneurship education can continue to be optimized for SMK. Teachers must have roles and mindsets that support 
the development of entrepreneurial skills. Teachers can communicate entrepreneurship education appropriately.

ABSTRACT 
 
This paper aims to explore how vocational schools (SMK) adopt digital marketing in promoting their food product.  
SMK 1 Tapung Hulu has successfully treated tankos waste as a mushroom growing medium. The crispy mushroom 
production innovation, named Ojaki, has proven to be popular with the local community. The production of crispy 
mushrooms is an educational tool to increase entrepreneurship skills. To promote crispy mushrooms, they have used 
digital marketing.  This paper uses the concepts and theories of marketing communication. The research method used 
is qualitative with prime data through interviews and observations. Secondary data is a literature study. In the research 
process, micro-analysis is also carried out through SWOT (strengths, weakness, opportunity, and Thread) analysis and 
BCG (Boston Consulting Group). The results showed that SMK 1 Tapung Hulu had used digital media to promote its 
products. SMK 1 Tapung Hulu had done digital marketing through social media, such as WhatsApp story, Instagram, 
and Facebook. The use of digital media has not been optimal due to concerns about the unpreparedness of human 
resources for many products. The challenge is that schools must be able to prepare human resources involved in the 
production and digital promotion.

Abstract 
Various fintech services have sprung up along with the changing lifestyle of the Indonesian people who are now 
completely online because of the fast and easy-to-use factor. One of the discoveries in the fintech industry is by 
transacting using a feature called PayLater. This study aims to analyze the effect of Perceive Usefulness, Perceived 
Risk and Perceived Trust either directly or through the mediating variable Attitude Towards Using on Intention to Use 
Traveloka PayLater. The total number of respondents used in this study was 417 respondents. Based on the data that 
has been collected and has passed the testing process with the Multiple Linear Regression method using Smart PLS 3 
software. The results obtained from the hypothesis prove that Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Risk, and Perceived 
Trust influence Intention to Use Traveloka PayLater. This research has limitations, it only covers one Fintech, which 
is Traveloka PayLater and the research results cannot be generalized to other fintechs. In future research, the researcher 
suggests getting more respondents and covering a wider area to produce more accurate data.

1. Introduction
The business environment is now dynamic and undergoing rapid changes due to a massive influx of new technologies 
and innovations, along with increasing demands from customers. As businesses become complex with changing 
conditions and an unpredictable economic climate, innovation is inevitable for businesses to stay competitive. Finance 
is one of the important sectors aided by the ever-evolving development of information technology, which plays an 
important role in a country's economy and continues to grow in line with community needs. Financial Technology 
refers to the application of information technology in the financial sector (Fintech). Fintech, according to Bank 
Indonesia (2020), is the result of a combination of financial services and technology that ultimately changes the 
business model from traditional to modern, which initially requires us to make face-to-face payments and carry some 
money. Cash is no longer required for remote transactions because payments can be made in seconds. 
(www.bi.go.id:2020). 
Various fintech services have sprung up along with the changing lifestyle of the Indonesian people who are now 
completely online because of the fast and easy-to-use factor. One of the breakthroughs in the fintech industry is the 
ability to transact using a feature called Pay Later. Pay Later functions and provides the same benefits as a credit card. 
Pay Later is essentially a solution for people who are hesitant to use a credit card or who want a credit card but the 
application process is rejected by the bank for a variety of reasons. 
Traveloka provides access for the public to search for and order various transportation ticket services, hotels, and 
various popular activities, as well as launching the Pay Later feature to make it easier for people to pay for these 
services. provided. Except for bill payment products and top-up credit, the Pay Later feature is available on all

Traveloka is expected to be able to maintain a situation where users can feel the benefits of existing applications, while 
at the same time getting a sense of security when transacting and placing high trust in the Traveloka company itself. 
Through this research, it can also be seen that Traveloka Pay Later can be accepted by its users because it cannot be 
separated from the influence of the Traveloka company itself, where Traveloka is a lifestyle SuperApp company that 
has been established for 10 years ago, and consistently provides the best service through the products they have. 
Therefore, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
1.
There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Usefulness variable directly on Attitude Towards
Using. Thus, the first hypothesis can be accepted.
2.
There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Usefulness variable directly on Intention to Use.
Thus, the second hypothesis can be accepted.
3.
There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Risk variable directly on Attitude Towards Using.
Thus, the third hypothesis is rejected.
4.
There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Risk variable directly on Intention to Use. Thus,
the fourth hypothesis is rejected.
5.
There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Trust variable directly on Attitude Towards Using.
Thus, the fifth hypothesis can be accepted.
6.
There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Trust variable directly on Intention to Use. Thus,
the sixth hypothesis can be accepted.
7.
There is a positive and significant effect of the Attitude Towards Using variable directly on Intention to Use.
Thus, the seventh hypothesis can be accepted.
8.
There is a positive and significant influence from the Attitude Towards Using variable which mediates the
indirect relationship between Perceived Usefulness and Intention to Use. Thus, the eighth hypothesis can be
accepted.
9.
There is a positive and significant influence from the Attitude Towards Using variable which mediates the
indirect relationship between Perceived Risk and Intention to Use. Thus, the ninth hypothesis can be
accepted.
10. There is a positive and significant effect of the Attitude Towards Using variable which mediates the indirect
relationship between Perceived Trust and Intention to Use. Thus, the tenth hypothesis can be accepted.
Based on the analysis obtained from this study and the results of the distributed questionnaires, there are several 
suggestions that can be taken into consideration by the company. There are also suggestions as an advice for further 
research, as well as for users who will use the results of this research, as follows: 
1.
This study only covers one fintech, Traveloka Pay Later and the results of the study cannot be generalized to
other fintechs, because the name of the company that makes the fintech product can also affect the
respondents' answers.
2.
In future research, the researcher suggests getting more respondents and covering a wider area to produce
more accurate data.
3.
The number of respondents will also be influenced by the number of Traveloka users when this research
begins, so that the number of users in the future will increase from before.
4.
The pandemic situation has also reduced the frequency of using the Traveloka application and has an impact
on the use of Pay Later.

Abstract 
This article discusses the improvement of Aqidawati & Sutopo's (2017) article, related to the analysis of the feasibility 
of investing in facilities that meet the standards to obtain Safe, Healthy, Whole, and Halal Beef at the Surakarta 
Slaughterhouse. Previous studies evaluated using a technical-economic approach with investment feasibility criteria 
indicated by the value of NPV>0, PP <20 years (economic age), B/C ratio 1, and production yields greater than the 
amount of BEP. Then, a proposed improvement is made by adding aspects of the techno-economic study by 
considering exchange rates and sensitivity analysis. As a result, the best alternative is obtained; namely alternative 
level 1-C with an NPV value of Rp 88,462,036, MARR < IRR (3% < 7.23%), BC ratio value of 1.06, and a payback 
period that meets company requirements (11.15 < 20). So it can be concluded that the investment can be said to be 
feasible. In addition, the sensitivity analysis results also show that the Annual Worth (AW) is the most sensitive to 
changes in retribution prices so that it considers the government in determining the decision on the amount of the 
retribution price.

1. Introduction
Providing beef in traditional markets has become a problem for every region. The problems usually occur due to 
quality beef, cleanliness, and health. The government has launched a standardization program for a safe, healthy, 
whole (ASUH) and halal beef to improve beef quality (Adawiyah et al., 2022). The slaughter process influences the 
quality of beef at the Slaughterhouse (RPH) and the handling method during the distribution process to the market. 
RPH must have excellent clean facilities and infrastructures to improve beef quality (Lupita et al., 2017). Facilities 
and infrastructure can support it through unique clothes, plastic aprons, head coverings, nose covers, and boots. In 
addition, it is also necessary to have a box equipped with a cooling device that can maintain the inside temperature of 
the fresh meat at 7°C and the inside temperature of the viscera at 3°C (SNI 01-6159-1999). Then, the government 
must carry out ante and post-mortem inspection controls on beef cuts. 
Based on Aqidawati & Sutopo's research (2017), RPH in Surakarta City has weaknesses in the meat slaughtering, 
handling, packaging, and distribution system that does not meet SNI 01-6159-1999 regarding the technical standards

Based on the graph above, we can understand the effect of changing the value of a variable on the obtained AW 
quantity. Initial investment and annual costs have the same relationship with AW, a negative relationship. An increase 
in initial investment or annual fee will decrease the AW received and vice versa. While the retribution price has a 
positive relationship with AW, adding the retribution price will cause an increase in the AW received, and vice versa. 
In addition, from the gradient (steepness) of the line, the AW value is the most sensitive to changes in the retribution 
price. From the graph, if the retribution price is reduced by 10%, AW will be negative, which means the project will 
not profit. As for the initial investment and annual costs, when the variable increases by approximately 10%. So that 
the company can find out the range of addition and subtraction of the three variables before the project becomes 
unfeasible or does not generate profits. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis of the improvements, the are some conclusions to answer the objective of the research: 
 
a. 
The analysis produces the best alternative, which is still the same as Aqidawati & Sutopo's (2017) article, namely 
the level 1-C alternative. Choose alternative 1-C because it met the NPV > 0, PP < 20 years, IRR < MARR, and 
the shortest payback period than the other alternatives. However, with different values, one example is the NPV 
value of Rp.88,462,036, compared to the original article, which had an NPV of Rp.206,107,298, etc. This different 
value can occur because several additional factors include in the analysis, namely the tax factor and the conversion 
of actual values. It expects to provide a more definitive conclusion and align with the situation. 
b. The relationship between the two alternatives that meet all the requirements, namely 1-C and 2-C, has a delta or 
the difference in the annual worth of the cash flows of the two alternatives, which is always constant. It can 
happen because both have the same level of effectiveness; the two alternatives only have differences in annual 
costs and initial investment. So alternative 1-C will always be better in all intervals compared to alternative 2-C. 
c. Initial investment and annual costs have the same relationship with AW, a negative relationship. An initial 
investment or annual fee increase will decrease the AW received and vice versa. While the retribution price has 
a positive relationship with AW, adding the retribution price will cause an increase in the AW received, and vice 
versa. In addition, from the gradient (steepness) of the line, the AW value is the most sensitive to changes in the 
retribution price.

Abstract 
The rapid advancement of technology has encouraged the emergence of digital banks, which provide all their services 
via mobile phone. The researchers are curious about the factors that influence the tendency of public acceptance of 
digital banks. The findings of this research are expected to provide insights for digital banks to pay more attention to 
these factors, in order to improve customer acquisition and financial performance. A model was developed based on 
the Technology Acceptance Model with additional constructs. Quantitative survey of 459 digital bank users from 
Indonesia was collected to assess the proposed framework. This research uses a partial least squares structural equation 
modeling technique to empirically validate the model. The results show perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, 
attitude towards the service, and social influence have a positive effect on the intention to use. Meanwhile, trust has a 
negative effect on perceived risk and perceived risk has a negative effect on attitude towards the service. The limitation 
of current research is the data only based on questionnaires which was not evenly distributed across all regions in 
Indonesia. In addition, future research can be developed by including other variables that may influence customer 
interest in using digital bank services.

1. Introduction
The extensive development of mobile phone technology provides a huge opportunity for businesses in the banking 
industry, especially in terms of communication and transactions (Singh & Srivastava, 2010). McKinsey and 
Company’s research of 900 financial service consumers in Indonesia shows that digital channels will become 
increasingly important in building loyalty and generating growth for financial institutions. The research also stated 
that digital penetration in Indonesia reached 58%, driven by the rapid increase in Internet adoption, smartphones, e-
commerce growth, and strong digitalization efforts from Indonesian banks, which have driven public demand for 
digital channels (Barquin, Guillaume, Vinayak, & Shrikhande, 2019). The sophistication of technology and analysis 
that affects the entire financial services industry became the originator of the concept of Banking as a Platform 
(BAAP). BAAP is better known as digital banking, which is a digital banking service that is digitized to eliminate the 
needs of people visiting bank branch offices (Kayrouz, 2021). 
The acceleration of digital transformation is driven by digital opportunities, digital behavior, and digital transactions 
(OJK, 2021), so it cannot be denied that banking in the future will be a target for millennials who cannot escape digital 
development as a daily necessity (Elisabeth, 2021). This is driving the banking industry to carry out digital 
transformation. Commercial banks are racing to provide digital banking services. This digital banking service is more 
than just an online and mobile banking service, but it is for all banking services including services in branch offices 
that allow customers to perform self-service. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, ecosystem changes and stakeholder expectations of digital services are increasingly 
massive (OJK, 2021). Along with this, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) as Indonesia’s banking regulator provides 
support through granting permission for financial service institutions to have fully digital businesses (digital banks) 
and encourages the implementation of advanced digital banks. Digital bank services can also be interpreted as a

Abstract 
Technology commercialization (TC) is crucial to companies’ survival and progress in the rigorous and competitive 
market environment. Thus, it is vital to understand the factors that impact the successful commercialization of 
developed products. This paper presents a systematic analysis of literature on TC. The transformation of ideas to 
marketable products or technology encompasses the steps involved in TC. This study also focuses on the incubators 
or channels for commercializing developed technologies. The contributions of incubators such as universities and 
research institutes, start-up firms, and established firms in developing the technologies and selling the products are 
explicitly presented. The systematic literature review was conducted on factors that influence technology 
commercialization through the means of analysing relevant indexed and peer-reviewed journal articles. The purpose 
of this technique is to make the process of gathering the literature data more apparent and minimize the inconsistency 
of the researchers concerning the analyses. This paper adds to the knowledge by analysing the major factors that 
impact the success of TC in an industrial firm and aids the researchers to establish the theoretical and empirical analysis 
of TC.

1. Introduction
Technology development (TD) has been well known as the driving force behind the production of goods and services, 
market competitiveness, improved standard of living of the populace, and prospects of enhanced trade especially 
during the era of the reliant global economy (Balachandra et al., 2010). Nevertheless, technological development can 
promote the growth of the economy only if the technologies or products are commercialized (Van Rooyen et al., 
2020). Many stakeholders such as the government, researchers, marketers, and entrepreneurs are involved in 
determining the future successes of TC (Afful-Dadzie et al., 2017). Determining the success of TC is significant to 
the stakeholders or decision-makers to grasp the likely growth potential of a technology or product in a vigorous and 
competitive environment.  Invested products or technologies with high TC contribute to the economy and growth of 
the nation (Altuntas and Dereli, 2012). Numerous benefits are being derived from the successful commercialization 
of a new concept or idea such as job creation, job security, financial incentives, contribution toward the company's 
long-term stability, generation of revenue, and profit among others (Dhewanto and Sohal, 2015). 
Technology commercialization (TC) is defined as the means of transferring technologies or innovative products from 
the conception phase to the markets for acceptance and usage. It is one of the basic aspects of technology management 
purposes (Ravi and Janodia, 2021). Newly developed technologies are considered necessary to be transferred and 
integrated into the market through organizations such as technology start-ups, established firms, and universities and 
research institutes that can either function as technology developers and/or business entities that bring the technologies 
to the market (Kirchberger and Pohl, 2016). TC is a two-phase process that entails the technology-based phase which 
involves the production of products or technologies (Jiang et al., 2020), and the marketing phase that involves the 
marketing and commercialization of the produced technologies (Mukhtarova et al., 2016). The production of new 
products or technology involved R&D which spans from the development of the idea that undergoes basic and applied 
research to the technology manufacturing phase. The developed technologies are commercialized through different

Abstract 
E-learning as the main system that supports the learning process in higher education turns out to have several problems 
such as inadequate compatibility between service technology design and the psychological components of the learning
process, shallowness in learning caused by various methodologies, certain types of reduction of the relationship
between learners, between themselves and the lecturer, the possibility of a loss of direct communication and direct
collaboration. On the other hand, big data can determine and analyze the causes of a problem that occurs in the system,
including the e-learning system. The purpose of this research is to help higher education optimize e-learning by using
big data. The research method uses a qualitative approach through literature review to find e-learning problems in
universities. While the qualitative approach is through observation to analyze alternative solutions with a big data
approach.

1. Introduction
E-Learning has an important role to support the learning process in many institutions including universities. E-learning
has several advantages such as: Flexibility; meaning that students are free to choose the time and place to access
lessons so that E-learning enables students to individually control the achievement of their learning (Regmi and Jones
2020). E-learning also improves cost effectiveness. E-learning reduces the cost of management for planners, the cost
of providing physical infrastructure and learning facilities, and the transport expenses and lodging for classmates [
(Alenzi 2020). Some e-learning is built with high customization, Customization of learning related to the needs of the
learner (Shi et al. 2020). [3] (Shi et al. 2020). However, some research shows problems related to the implementation
of e- Difficulties with various learning styles, for example (Khamparia and Pandey 2020) (Rasheed et al.2020). There

5. Conclusion  
Based on observations of the implementation of e-learning in several universities and literature reviews, e-learning 
provides a lot of convenience in the learning process, especially in universities, but the existing problems cannot be 
solved comprehensively. The use of big in e-learning not only solves e-learning problems but can increase the 
competitive advantage of higher education from the output of big data because it will have an impact on many aspects 
such as student satisfaction, lecturers, staff, and all other stakeholders

degrees Celsius, 22 degrees Celsius, and 31 degrees Celsius), light (150 lumens per meter square, 250 lumens per 
meter square, and 500 lumens per meter square), and noise levels (20 decibels, 50 decibels, and 90 decibels) in 27 
sessions in a simulated indoor setting. 67% accuracy was achieved for KNN model. Accuracy can be increased with 
increasing amount of data of participants. Furthermore, the effects of temperature on heart rate were more substantial 
than the effects of noise. Overall, noise for longer duration has a stronger negative impact on working memory of 
male, whereas temperature has a more severe influence on neurophysiological response of female. On other hand, 
male performed well in high temperature than female. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine 
the relationship between ECG and IEQ. The study culminated with directions for further studies.

1. Introduction
Due to current pandemic situation, 90% people usually spend most of their time in enclosed locations such as their 
homes and offices [1]. Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) mainly include lighting, temperature and noise level, 
which could have a significant impact on occupants' neurobehavioral, health, and job performance. The term 
neurobehavioral refers to the impact of the brain on emotion, behavior, and learning to do tasks of varying degrees of 
complexity. Human behavior is influenced by the interior environment, which has a major impact on human 
performance [2]. However, the effects of a certain IEQ factor on human neurobehavioral are highly upon job of 
individuals. As a result, it is critical to understand the influence of indoor environment on mental and physical state 
of human body. 
Previous research has shown that excellent IEQ enhances occupant happiness and productivity in general [3, 4]. 
However, there has been contradictory data on the impact of individual IEQ variables on various performance and 
productivity measures. In addition, a review of current research in this subject indicates that the majority of studies 
have focused on the individual impacts of specific environmental variables on human perception, such as the thermal, 
auditory, visual, and air quality aspects [5, 6]. Few researchers have looked at the connections between various indoor 
environmental variables and human perception [7-10].  
As reported by [11], combined effect of noise and temperature using heart rate, and skin temperature were analyzed 
only on 35 male participants which make their results gender biased. In [12], the connection between light environment 
on mood and alertness was studied using illuminance range is 100-1000 lx. In [13], a microcontroller-based Arduino 
was used to measure and process the ECG signals. The primary contribution of this research is the transmission of an 
ECG to a particular smart mobile phone for monitoring by a doctor, but irrespective of indoor environment. Similarly, 
some authors used noise, light or temperature but combined effect of IEQ with respect to age, gender and profession

Comparison of female and male performance under different room conditions with normal ECG shown in Fig.2. 
Female performed well under high noise and low performance under high temperature. Male performed very well 
under high temperature but performance decrease in noisy environment. Both male and female performed well under 
250 luminance value. Indoor condition does not affect memory of participants, due to mainly majority of participants  
are young and energetic and 5-10 min indoor environment doesn’t affect their memory. If we increase time for 
simulated environment this may affect memory as well.

4.  Conclusion   
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between ECG and IEQ. Human brain 
and heart behave differently under different environmental conditions. Our focus is to make a correlation between 
ECG, light, noise and temperature. First, we convert automatically all ECG images into numerical columns and then 
we apply machine learning algorithms to make final prediction.  
 
The emphasis in this study is on detecting and extracting patterns from Electrocardiogram picture reports. The 
requirement for time-consuming human intervention to understand the report can be avoided by digitizing ECG 
recordings. The automation of diagnosis and analysis may be accomplished more quickly with digitalization. We 
achieved 67% accuracy for KNN model. Accuracy can be increased with increasing amount of data of participants. 
ECG images were transformed into 1D data and then we add more information about memory condition, age, gender, 
profession after experiments of noise, temperature and light.  
 
From results noise mainly effect male as compared to female. Females show positive attitude when they were exposure 
to high noise. On other hand, male show outstanding performance when they exposed to high temperature. Light has 
natural effect. If we increased light intensity this effect headache but overall, on 200-500 Luminance is best for office 
work environment. Noise cannot be removed in any office completely so people are used to it. Temperature can be 
managed and mainly this effect our breathing and hence effect our ECG and brain working. 
 
Working memory and neurophysiological responses were disrupted in the investigated experiment settings as 
temperature and noise increased. The results showed that noise had a substantial influence on working memory when 
compared to air temperature. The combined impacts of noise, light and temperature were greater than the influence of 
each factor alone. The rise in light intensity had no effect on reaction accuracy in the context of high noise levels. 
However, in the presence of loud noise, the increase in temperature exacerbated the mean value of neurophysiological 
reactions.

5. Discussion and future work
Due to pandemic situation, we capture data for less people. In future, this work can be done on a greater number of 
people, which increase our ML model accuracy. This system 49 can be further implemented in hospitals to monitor 
patient ECG and we can make better room for patient regarding his/her age, gender, profession etc. In addition, this 
model can be implemented in schools, classrooms and offices to make better indoor environment and hence this will 
be good for brain and heart working.  
Automatically digitizing ECG record to 1D data and then further categorized this into normal or abnormal heartbeat 
is helpful for doctors. This will save their time and help them to make accurate and efficient decision about patients. 
This will reduce workload of doctors by manually inspecting ECG graphs. In future, this work can be used in homes 
to make them better place, save energy and comfortable environment for living. Once we will gather more data, 
unsupervised model can be used for model training and testing. This will reduce burden of manually annotation 
process of ECG images into normal or abnormal. More profession can be added in future to have versatile data about 
participants. As profession mainly effect human stress level. In every job stress level is different and based on job type 
and age, environmental factors effect differently on individuals under the same roof.

1. Introduction
Career selection is a process or activity of individuals in an effort to prepare themselves to enter a career related to 
work through a series of activities that are directed.  and systematic, so as to be able to choose a career as appropriate 
as desired. When choosing a career, it would be better if someone is looking for information about the profession.  
The development of the business world must be responded to by a quality and ready-made accounting education 
system in the world of work. In order to achieve these goals, the design of accounting education must be relevant to 
the world of work, especially for undergraduate accountants.  Various types of careers that can be pursued by 
accounting scholars show that every accountant scholar is free to choose what career he will pursue. Most of what we 
already know in general is that in a career in an accountant there are several routes, including Public Accountant or 
we can say as auditors. external, nonpublic accountants or internal auditors, educational accountants or teachers, and 
government accountants or accountants working in government sectors. (Amrain, Hambali, & Wuryandini, Pengaruh 
Gender, Pertimbangan Pasar Kerja, Lingkungan Kerja, 2021)  
 According to educational institutions such as universities, it is important to know what factors influence the career 
choices of accounting students. Careers in accounting are quite broad and diverse in the consideration of students in 
choosing the right profession after graduating from their education. 
The career selection of the accountant profession is influenced by several factors, including the intrinsic factor of 
employment, financial rewards, the balance of the job market, social values, and the work environment.  An intrinsic 
profession is the satisfaction received by the individual when or after he does the work, the intrinsic factor of the work 
can be measured through appreciation, the opportunity to get a promotion, job responsibilities, intellectual challenges 
and job training (Nuraini, Manajemen Sumber Daya Manusia, 2013). 
 Currently, the number of accounting workers in Indonesia is not comparable to the number of accounting graduates, 
even though the accounting department opens very wide employment opportunities for accountants.  Based on data

could have happened due to different area and samples taken, Job market consideration (X4)  have no influence on the 
career selection of  public accountants accountants this result is different from (Amrain, Hambali, & Wuryandini, 
2021) research which states that Job market consideration have an influence on the career selection as public 
accountant this could have happened due to different area and samples taken.  Students Perception (X3) having an 
influence on the selection of public accountant careers this research is supported by (Lukman & Carolina, 2016) 
research which stated Job Market have an influence with career selection as public accountant. 
 
From these conclusions, the suggestion that can be given are as follows: 
1. 
Gender does not affect career choice, therefore there is no limit in terms of gender when you want to 
become a public accountant 
2. 
The influence of parents does not affect career choice; therefore, students have their own considerations 
in choosing the career they want to get 
3. 
Student perceptions affect career choice, this is in accordance with the variable X2 where the influence 
of parents has no impact on choosing a career 
4. 
Job market considerations have no effect because students are not dependent on what is needed in the 
job market, but they want to become public accountants because of their own opinion

Abstract 
Higher education is an educational institution that provides educational services and offers many courses tailored to 
the needs of students and industry. The large number of skilled workforces needs in the industry requires higher 
education to prepare these skilled workers by building and offering various majors at universities. However, many 
students do not know the right major that suits their needs and desires that are aligned with industry needs. On the 
other hand, Big Data is a technology that collects very large amounts of data in real time which is then processed to 
produce important information that is needed by the user. exist in universities by using Big Data. The research method 
uses a qualitative approach through observation related to the difficulty in determining the choice of majors at the 
university. Literature studies are used to find alternative solutions with an information technology approach.

carried out in real time (Di et al. 2020) (Wang et al. 2018) (Wang et al. 2018). 
iii. 
Data migration is the process of moving or transforming data from one context to another. The 
context can be in the form of data structures, data formats, technology platforms, or locations. In the 
proposed model, data migration from higher education, psychological institutions, company 
employee data and streaming data from the internet is converted according to the data structure, data 
format, technology platform, or location that has been determined (Mazumdar et al. 2019) (Hababeh 
et al. 2018) (Manogaran et al. 2020). 
 
b. The second process is Storage and processing. This process includes data validation from higher education, 
psychology institutions, company employee data and streaming data from the internet. Then the data also 
goes through a clean process, normalization. The last process is curation. Data curation is the process of 
creating, organizing, and maintaining data sets so they can be accessed and used by people looking for 
information. 
c. 
The result of the Big Data process is in the form of visualization of information that can be tailored to the 
needs of the user. Big data can predict and recommend students about careers, skills that are tailored to 
students' talents and abilities. Big data can also generate major recommendations that are in line with students' 
future career plans.

5. Conclusion  
The adoption of big data to provide recommendations for majors in higher education for students will solve the 
problem of students' confusion to plan their future. Combining data and information based on student psychology and 
talent, students' abilities with career information in the company and streaming data based on existing employee 
profiles will produce comprehensive information for students or prospective workers so that they can plan their careers 
in the future. Future career planning starts from determining the major in higher education that is in accordance with 
the talents and abilities of students.

Abstract 
The simulation analyses numerous situations to discover if the layout would be more effective for the workers to work 
at the workstations. The main objective of this paper is to design a proper facility layout for the Erul Food Industry 
according to Makanan Tanggungjawab Industri (MeSTI). A simulation is needed regarding the facility layout designed 
for optimizing the time and cost by using FlexSim software. This paper was held at Erul Food Industry, a small 
industry that produces frozen smoked meats located at Rembau, Negeri Sembilan. SketchUp and FlexSim software 
are the tools used to design and analyze the developed layout for Erul Food Industry. Besides, processor stay time, 
processor operation, content against time, processor time, and financial analysis data are being gathered and observed. 
, The total running time for current layout design, Design 1, and Design 2 was recorded in minutes which are 765, 
741, and 730 respectively. Meanwhile, the cost analysis recorded for the current layout design, Design 1, and Design 
2 are RM22893.68, RM21908.75, and RM21542.81 respectively. The percentage improvement of the time analysis 
shows the current layout design, Design 1, and Design 2 are 1.9%, 5%, and 6.4% respectively. Finally, a comparison 
was done to select the developed layout with efficient time and cost analysis. The chosen developed layout: Design 2, 
is then proposed to Erul Food Industry based on the lowest time and cost. This paper is anticipated to assist Erul Food 
Industry in developing the real layout to optimize the time and cost analysis at the workstations.

1. Introduction
As an important part of improving the production logistics system, facility planning refers to meet the required 
restrictions in a specific production environment and identifying the suitable layout form, and position of the 
equipment by the production goals (Id et al., 2020). The small and medium enterprise (SMEs) food industry grows 
and changes continuously, re-evaluates product specification changes accordingly with customer needs, technology 
that quickly keeps growing every day, and workers going in and out of a company. The food industry is experiencing 
a far more competitive environment and is under pressure as a result of rising market demands and changing client 
preferences (Ibrahim et al., 2018). The main concept behind this layout design is to minimize costs and ensure 
workforces finish their work quicker while meeting the expectations and demands of consumers. This paper is a 
collaboration with the Erul Food Industry as a reference for SMEs' business information sources. Erul Food Industry

millisecond. The processing time between the designs is impacted by the shaped line manufacturing in the three layout 
designs. However, based on the overall production time, the best design for Erul Food Industry might well be chosen 
for implementation. Based on the analysis and result of the two developed layouts, it shows that the cost for layout 
Design 2 is lower than others which is according to the financial analysis of the simulation. 
Besides, according to the simulation's financial analysis, the cost analysis demonstrating that it flows through the 
workstations by state time that is in this workstation is RM 29.92 per time for each workstation. This state time 
represented the overall cost of all processors during the duration of the product flow. The overall cost includes the 
price of each processor in the workstation. This financial estimate was also influenced by the form of the workstation 
manufacturing line and the time it took for the product to be completed. It is reasonable to deduce that the shorter the 
entire running time of manufacturing, the cheaper the production cost. Table 2 shows the simulation data and 
percentage of efficiency of layout design. The time duration to complete the frozen food product in minutes for the 
current layout design, Design 1, and Design 2 are 765, 741, and 730 respectively. The cost for the complete one cycle 
of the process for the current layout design, Design 1, and Design 2 are RM 22893.68, RM 21908.75, and RM 
21542.81 respectively. Based on Table 2, the percentage improvement in time analysis demonstrates that the facility 
layout has been successfully designed and enhanced over the current production setup and Design 2 is a higher 
percentage of efficiency.

6. Conclusion
Hence, the facility layout design for Erul Food Industry was successfully developed utilizing the SketchUp software. 
To develop the required facility layout, measurements for workstations were taken to ensure the design was 
appropriate for the layout. Two development layouts were designed to be submitted to Erul Food Industry. These 
facility layouts were designed by adhering to the MeSTI and Halal JAKIM checklist requirements for SMEs while 
building layouts.  
The current layout has been observed in terms of additional machines and the workflow is disorganized which results 
in certain workers being unable to do their tasks efficiently. Two proposed layouts are being prepared and analyzed. 
The reduction in time may be considered an achievement when the time for each layout is less than the starting time 
for producing a single batch of products. A comparison of the proposed and current layouts is presented to optimize 
the time, cost, and efficiency of the production process. Significant improvement is predicted based on data from the 
simulation by using FlexSim software for time and cost comparison with the current layout. The simulation of the 
proposed layout is projected to reduce time and cost for Erul Food Industry's workstations. According to the analysis, 
altering the layout percentage of efficiency improvement for the time analysis showed Design 2 had the highest 
percentage improvement which is 6.4% compared to other designs. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the objectives 
were met by lowering the time and expenses. Based on the current design and the two proposed designs, Design 2 is 
more appropriate since it takes the least amount of time and costs the least amount of money. Design 2 layout will be 
recommended to Erul Food Industry for consideration to ensure that Erul Food Industry has a good facility layout to 
improve work efficiency. Besides, an appropriate layout is required to provide a smooth and consistent flow of 
manufacturing. The layout of the facility is designed to ensure that workers operate in a productive workflow and that 
the equipment is in the proper location. 
In addition, improvements in the quality of facilities layout and increasing productivity are critical in today's global 
competition. This could be accomplished by resolving constraints in both the production process and the layout. It 
was discovered that the proposed layout improved both cycle time and expenses while enabling significant capacity 
for the production and helping to avoid any repetition movement in the production process which could improve 
employee health and productivity. Also, a well-organized of facilities layout helps to eliminate the bottleneck which 
are allowing employees to work faster, reduce idle time, increase production rates, increase efficiency in the 
production process, and reduce the injury risk of workers or any other damage. However, it should be emphasized that

this study has limitations, including: (1) the measurements of workstations may be inaccurate and imprecise owing to 
a variety of unforeseeable issues. The instrument uncertainty measurement is one of the factors that contribute to 
workstation measurements that are not precise. (2) The research scope of facilities does not include multiple 
production levels.

Abstract 
Manufacturing Industries nowadays are looking for a possible competitive advantage to increase their production line 
output while lowering costs by adopting condition-based maintenance (CBM). One of the initiatives taken to address 
this issue is to study the condition monitoring solutions which, are becoming more popular for predicting machine 
problems through Predictive Intelligence systems in production machines such as motors and drives. This will prevent 
sudden equipment failures and unscheduled downtime. Tapping the vibration signals at the various section of the 
motor and drives and analyzing them is one of the most effective methods for preempting and early detection of 
equipment failures. Vibration analysis is a process that detects a machine's vibration level and frequency and then 
analyses the machine and its components' health conditions. The development of IoT-based machines and drive 
vibration sensor detection helps to increase production efficiency by minimizing unscheduled machine downtime. The 
captured vibration signals are analyzed by using Sliding Window Technique to study the variations with respect to the 
machine speed and running time. Based on the studies, the vibration of a machine increases as the speed of the machine 
increases but stabilizes over a period. Any continuous abnormal signals denote that the machines warrant further 
investigations and maintenance.

1. Introduction
Vibration analysis is a method of detecting and analysing a machine’s vibration levels and frequency, as well as the 
conditions of the machines and their components. Vibrations are produced by the machine when it is in use, and it can 
affect the durability of the machine resulting in issues like damage or anomalous halting (Chaudbury et al. 2014). 
When a vibration sensor is attached to a machine, it will generate a signal that is proportional to the amount of vibration 
and the frequency of vibration produced. The vibration sensor data will send to the data collector, which converts the

4.4 Proposed Improvements 
Two improvements can be made to improve the vibration monitoring IoT system. The first improvement is using the 
MLX90640 infrared thermal sensor instead of the DHT22 temperature sensor. The purpose of using this sensor is to 
monitor the motor's exterior surface temperature, which is a good indicator of the interior temperature. As the inside of 
the motor gets hotter, the exterior surface also gets hotter. The second improvement is using a 4G GPRS modem instead 
of using a Wi-Fi connection. The vibration monitoring IoT systems are highly dependent on the Wi-Fi connection, the 
system can’t function without a Wi-Fi connection. Hence, the 4G GPRS modem is to replace the Wi-Fi connection as 
it uses a SIM card to provide an internet connection. Vibration monitoring IoT systems can be used indoors or outdoors 
without restrictions by using an internet connection provided by a SIM card. 
5. Conclusion
The development of an IoT-based machine vibration monitoring system is said to be successful despite some 
improvements that can be made. The IoT-based machine’s vibration monitoring system is capable of remote monitoring 
vibration data by using a wireless connection and web-based application to remote monitoring anywhere using smart 
devices. Hence, the objective is achieved. The system is beneficial for its proper measurement to analyse the 
continuation of vibration signals and temperature. The sliding window technique used in this system has resulting more 
accurate data to analyse the changed behaviour of vibration signals and temperature. Finally, the IoT-based machine’s 
vibration monitoring system is yet to be improved to provide more precise data for analysis. MLX90640 infrared 
thermal sensor was considered to replace DHT22 temperature, it is also to observe the effect and impact it could bring 
to the vibration IoT monitoring IoT system.

Abstract 
The learning method is a method used to support learning activities that are tailored to the learning objectives, student 
perspectives, technological support, and other very diverse factors. This condition makes it difficult for teachers or 
educational institutions to choose and decide the best learning method that will be used to support learning activities. 
Decision Support System is a computer system that is used to support decision making by considering assessment 
criteria and alternative solutions. Thus, the Decision Support System can be used by educational institutions to 
determine learning methods that are suitable for school conditions. The purpose of this research is to help the best 
educational institutions according to the conditions of schools, teachers and students by using the Decision Support 
System. The research method uses a qualitative approach through observations to educational institutions about the 
difficulty of determining learning methods that are in accordance with school needs. Literature studies are used to 
strengthen problem findings and identify alternative solutions with information technology.

1. Introduction
Learning objectives can be achieved if all the supporting components can be implemented and one of the important 
factors supporting the achievement of learning objectives is the learning method. learning method is the whole series 
of presentation of teaching materials which includes all aspects before, during and after the learning carried out by the 
teacher as well as all related facilities that are used directly or indirectly in the teaching and learning process to achieve 
learning objectives (Puspita et al. 2019) (Aliyah et al. 2020) (Kioupi and Voulvoulis 2019).

5. Conclusion
The implementation of DSS for educational institutions to determine the right learning model to support the learning 
process in their institutions will help educational institutions based on the priority scale of several predetermined 
criteria. The resulting alternative learning model does not absolutely have to be used because basically DSS only helps 
decision makers make choices from several available options and the final decision rests with the decision maker. 
DSS helps decision makers develop a hierarchy of criteria and give weight to each component and in the end will offer 
alternative learning methods that have been arranged based on the highest score.

Abstract 
Agile manufacturing (AM) is the result of manufacturing strategy evolution in the manufacturing industry, which 
continues to develop and respond to the challenges of rapid global market changes. The manufacturing industry 
sectors in many countries, such as the chemical industry, pump manufacturing, steel industry, electronics industry, 
and automotive industry, have implemented agile manufacturing and positively impacted operational and business 
performance. Nevertheless, the shipbuilding industry, which differs from a typical manufacturing industry with 
specific characteristics such as market volatility, customized job orders, and customer-driven, has partially 
implemented the AM concept at the functional level. However, increasing the company's performance depends on 
its ability to find and manage the vital factors of agile manufacturing. Therefore, 13 related scientific articles were 
reviewed in this study, and their proposed factors were comparatively analyzed. The result shows that numbers of 
vital factors have significant influences in creating an effective implementation of AM in the shipbuilding business. 
The vital factors of AM are classified into seven groups: technologies, organizational culture, empowerment, 
manufacturing system, supplier relationship, customer focus, and core competence. These vital factors are 
considered appropriate for developing an agile manufacturing model in the shipbuilding industry, including the 
correlation of the vital factors to the operational performance, which is a challenge for further research.

1. Introduction
Global business competition and market disruption have become a global challenge for all industrial sectors, 
including the shipbuilding industry. The shipbuilding industry has unique characteristics: capital-intensive, labor-
intensive, technology-intensive, and customized job orders (Mandal 2017). In addition, the market for new 
shipbuilding is always volatile due to strongly influenced by several factors, including economic growth, seaborne 
trade, oil prices, global steel production output, exploration, and utilization of natural resources, as well as the use of 
the sea for recreational activities (Hossain and Zakaria 2017; Bruce 2021). Hence, the global shipbuilding market 
from 2010 to 2019 was very volatile, with a significant decline from 129.9 million DWT in 2010 to 73.2 million 
DWT in 2019 (BRS Group 2020). Furthermore, even the Covid-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, has 
decreased new shipbuilding orders at global shipyards by 41 percent compared to 2019 (VesselsValue 2020). 
Considering the characteristics of the shipbuilding industry and market that are constantly fluctuating, customized 
job orders, and customer-driven, the shipbuilding industry needs to implement agile manufacturing (AM) as an 
alternative strategy that has become a solution for the manufacturing industry to rapid market changes. AM is 
defined as the ability to explore the main factors of competitiveness (speed, flexibility, innovation, quality, and

developed business practice difficult to copy, as one of the company's competitive advantages. Besides that, virtual 
enterprise tools could be used to fulfill owner requirements for complex new products developed through a global 
network and work collaboratively with other companies. 
 
Many benefits are obtained from AM implementation, such as improved quality of products, competitive cost of 
products, and better delivery speed (Kumar et al., 2020b). These benefits are related to the indicators of shipyard 
operational performance, that are the quality of the products should be met to customer requirements, the realization 
of costs that do not exceed the budget, and delivery of products must be on time according to the contract. Therefore, 
achieving these indicators will make shipyards more competitive in today's disruption era. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendation 
AM becomes a challenge for the shipbuilding industry as an alternative solution to resolve the problem of a 
fluctuating market environment. As a result of the comparative analysis of AM factors proposed in 13 scientific 
articles, several factors were considered appropriate vital factors in creating an effective implementation of AM in 
the shipbuilding industry at the business level. The practical implementation of agile manufacturing positively 
impacted the operational performance of shipyards. These vital factors are classified into seven groups: 
technologies, organizational culture, empowerment, manufacturing system, supplier relationship, customer focus, 
and core competence. Furthermore, the correlation between the vital factors will help the shipyard formulate a 
strategy to improve operational performance and increase shipyards' competitiveness amid increasingly disruptive 
global competition. This study provides appropriate vital factors of agile manufacturing for the shipbuilding industry 
at the business level distinct from previous research at the functional level. In further research, the agile 
manufacturing model in the shipbuilding industry may be developed using these vital factors, including the 
correlation of vital factors and the operational performance of the shipyard.

Abstract 
Companies or organizations that have successfully implemented quality management and carried out continuous 
improvement will try to get quality awards to become the best company or organization and can increase global 
competition. There are 3 Excellence Models in the world, namely the Deming Prize (DP), Malcolm Baldrige 
National Quality Award (MBNQA), and the European Foundation Quality Management (EFQM) which have 
been widely applied and adopted by quality awards in several countries. Previous studies researched the 
similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the three Excellence Models. It is not easy for 
companies or organizations to apply or meet the criteria of the Excellence Model, so we need a model that is more 
flexible, easier to understand, and also applied, especially by companies or organizations in Indonesia. To fill this 
gap, it is necessary to study literature based on related research from 2010 to 2021. Vos viewer software was used 
for data processing and the main keywords were Excellence Model, Deming Prize, MBNQA, and EFQM. To be 
able to compare the three Excellence Models and more conical then included keywords such as relation, 
sustainability, interaction, quality improvement, difference, with limitations on subject areas are Business, 
Management and Accounting, Engineering, and Social Sciences. The results will be analyzed based on the study 
of literature, and comparisons are made based on the objectives, criteria, grouping criteria, award categories, 
assessment process, and the score weight. This comparison will be the basis for the formation of a model that can 
represent the three Excellence Models that are suitable for companies and organizations in Indonesia.

Abstract 
P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri is a manufacturing company enganged in the furniture sector. In the spring beds 
production line, several problems occur with the old Layout as high material handling costs. The distance between 
workstations is far from each other, and alternating process flow made the production less efficient. In creating a new 
alternative Layout, a systematic layout planning method was used. In creating a new alternative Layout, the first thing 
to do is to measure the floor area, make production flow, and measure the production standard time to make the flow 
process chart and operation process chart. After that, the following process is to forecast the product demand for the 
next year, which would be used on the routing sheet. The routing sheet is used to calculate the number of machines 
needed to fulfil the product demand. After that, the alternative Layout can be made using the S.L.P. method by making 
Activity Relationship Chart, Activity Template Block Diagram, Activity Relationship Diagram, and Area Allocation 
Diagram. After the new alternative Layout is created, the next step is counting the material handling costs and moving 
moments to find the Layout with minimum material handling costs and moving moments. Then the last step is using 
the Promodel software to simulate the new alternative Layout and old Layout to find the increase of products that can 
be made by using a new alternative  layout before the new Layout is implemented in the factory.

1. Introduction
P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri is a manufacturing company engaged in the furniture sector to produce cots, 
bedframes, spring beds, pillows, etc. The production process on each production line has a different layout based on 
the process flow and based on the material flow pattern. The reason for using a design in the form of serpentine is that 
the production process flow is longer than the area to overcome the limited space. Poor Layout can hinder the smooth 
production process and result in an increase in the time required in the production process, an increase in the time 
needed in the production process, and an increase in the cost of moving materials. P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri 
uses a serpentine material flow pattern in it’s spring beds production line.  
The Layout used at P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri is a layout based on the process. This flow was used because 
of flexibility in allocating equipment and plant operators, minimising the risk of stopping production activities, and 
being very flexible in producing various types of products. In the spring beds production line at P.T. Alpha Jaya 
Manunggal Mandiri, several problems occur regarding material handling costs. The distance between workstations is 
far from each other and has an alternating process flow, making it less efficient. Based on the results of the research 
conducted with Layout at spring beds production line, the following are the objectives in designing new Layout at 
spring beds production, which are as follows:

7. Conclusion  
From the new alternative layout created by using Systematic Layout Planning (S.L.P.) Method. The new alternative 
layout has been made in 2 forms called alternative layout 1 and alternative layout 2. The material handling costs and 
moving moments on the spring beds production line was significantly reduced from the alternative Layout. Alternative 
Layout 1 decreases the material handling costs become $ 113.35 with moving moments 985.79 meters, and alternative 
layout 2 decrease the material handling costs to Rp. $ 109.05  with moving moments 979.2 meters. The choosen 
Layout was alternative layout 2 because having the least material handling costs per week and the least moving 
moments. The old layout and chosen alternative layout were simulated using Promodel software. From the simulation, 
by  implementing the new alternative Layout, the total production that can be made is increased from 8639 units each 
year to 9013 units each year. Total production of the spring beds was incereased by 4.54%, the average time in the 
system of spring beds production decreased from 181.71 minutes to 157.33 minutes, which lowered the average time 
in the system by 13.42%. The average time in operation of spring beds production decreased from 153.49 minutes to 
142.17 minutes, which lowered the average time in operation by 7.37%. The material handling costs decreased from 
$ 179.25 to $ 109.05 which decreased the material handling costs by 39.16%. The moving moments and distance on 
springbed production process also decreased. The moving moments decreased from 1172.76 m to 979.2 m which 
decreased by 16.51%, and the distance decreased from 73 m to 34 m which decreased by 53.42%.

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a manufacturing company specializing in creating and producing plastic jars. Usually, a company has to 
plan the requirement of raw resources, including the quantity and delivery timetable of raw materials to meet the 
consumer's needs. Henceforth, to determine the consumer's needs, the company must do thorough calculations to find 
the optimal quantity of required raw materials. In most cases, there's a chance for any company to receive an 
unexpected request that comes abruptly. As a result, a safety stocks calculation is carried out to prevent the materials 
from running out. The main problem of PT. XYZ lies in material requirement planning, which is conducted solely 
using experience estimation. Hence, a new material requirement calculation needs to be performed utilizing Material 
Requirement Planning (MRP) and Lot Sizing methods to determine the best quantity and proper delivery timetable 
while considering the most optimal cost of required raw materials. The most optimal method for procurement of raw 
materials is the method that has the lowest total cost of procurement. According to the result, the best Lot sizing 
method is the silver Meal method, with a total cost of USD 35.67 which can reduce the total cost of procurement to 
50,8%. Thus, MRP is an effective way to reduce the cost of raw material procurement compared to the usual method 
used in the company.

1. Introduction
PT. XYZ is a manufacturing company specializing in creating and producing plastic jars. PT. XYZ needs several 
materials to produce and assemble the product. PT accommodates production orders. XYZ in two ways: make-to-
order and make-to-stock. The availability of materials becomes very important to maintain the flow of production. 
Thus, the total amount of required raw materials to conduct the output for the coming periods must be calculated with 
the forecast calculation. Therefore, it's common for PT. XYZ to get uncertain orders from customers abruptly, which 
can't be prevented. Unfortunately, PT. XYZ does not implement the calculation to determine the required raw

USD 36.86 or equivalent to 50.8% more efficient than the total cost of procurement before the implementation of 
MRP. 
 
In order to prove the effectiveness of MRP despite its simplicity, some comparisons from other research are presented 
in the discussion section. According to the journal “Application of MRP System for Control of Raw Material Inventory 
with EOQ Lot Sizing” (Christifan and Gozali, 2020), the use of MRP with Lot sizing can be concluded EOQ, in this 
case, will result in lower costs than not using it. The cost of ordering and holding raw materials if using the EOQ 
method can be reduced by USD 726.12 or equivalent to 54.18%. On the other side, in the journal titled “Aggregate 
and Disaggregate Production Planning, Material Requirement, and Capacity Requirement” (Lefta et al., 2020), among 
the various lot sizing methods that were used, Algorithm Wagner Within (AWW) with the total cost of procurement 
in USD 155,341.48 of all grades. In the third journal titled “Production Planning and Control Industry 4.0 on Plastic 
Bottles with the Blow Molding Process (Case Study: PT. Peace Industrial Packaging)” (Chandra et al. 2021), the lot-
sizing method that has been chosen for calculating MRP is the silver Meal method with total cost reduction by 8% 
with a total price of USD 2,891,982.42. In the last journal titled “Material Requirement Planning on Y-Strainer 
Production (Case study at PT. XYZ)”, the best lot sizing method of the research is AWW (Wagner Within Algorithm) 
which can reduce the total cost by USD 86.40 or equivalent to 19% compared to the usual method that is used in the 
company (Putri and Gozali, 2021). 
 
From the comparison of the various research conducted, every research that implemented the MRP calculation has a 
different best method of lot-sizing used. The chosen method is the best method for the company that wants to 
implement the MRP because the method has the most optimal cost of procurement of raw materials. Each applied 
approach is proven effective in reducing the total cost of procurement. As a result, MRP with applied lot sizing 
methods can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of material planning, particularly in terms of the cost of 
procurement. The results of MRP have shown its flexibility to adapt to the issue scenarios that arise in each company 
by developing the optimal approach to raw materials procurement according to the problems, mainly by considering 
the most optimal total cost of procurement of raw materials. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From this research, we can conclude that the required quantity of safety stocks is able to be determined where General 
Purpose Polystyrene (GPPS) is 2 tons of raw materials and Polypropylene (PP) is 1 ton of raw materials. Every lot-
sizing method used in this research can determine the optimal quantity based on its method applied in the MRP 
timetable. As a result, the best lot sizing method is Silver Meal because it has the most optimal cost of procurement 
of raw materials with USD 35.67. Before the implementation of MRP, the total cost of procurement of raw is USD 
72.53. We can conclude that the implementation of MRP, is able to reduce the total cost of procurement of raw 
materials by USD 36.86 or equivalent to 50.8%. The result has shown MRP's flexibility to adapt to the issue scenarios 
that happened in the company by developing the optimal approach to raw materials procurement according to the 
problems. Despite its simplicity, MRP has a significant impact and contributions to a company to improve production 
flow efficiency. Particularly regarding the total cost of raw material procurement.

Abstract 
This study focused on the development and factorial validation of an instrument as a skills for employment of technical 
education graduate   in northern Nigeria. The author adopted Goleman (2002) model of emotional intelligence 
consisted of self-awareness, self-management or regulation, social-awareness and relationship management to 
generate the items for study. The study adopted exploratory and descriptive research design and was carried out in 
northern Nigeria. The samples of the study are 45 final year students that are used as the pilot sample from institutions 
offering technical education in northern Nigeria. The main instrument is a set of questionnaire which consisted of 95 
items that were used as the draft copy of the instrument and were validated by 5 experts. The factor analysis was 
applying to analyze the result of the validation. The factorial validation was chosen because this method help the 
researcher to clarify the number of factors within a set of items. The 95 items draft copy of the instrument had factor 
loadings ranged from 0.598 to 0.790 and were above the factor loading of 0.50 at 10% over lapping variance with one 
component, with reliability coefficients ranged from 0.76-0.89, given total of 0.914 Cronbach alpha coefficient of 
internal consistency reliability in the four components computed, with this result its indicated that the scale was a 
refined test. Consequently, this shows that, 95 items are valid enough to develop the emotional intelligence 
competency scale as a skills for employments of technical education in northern Nigeria and as well were also highly 
reliable as a skills for employments of technical education in northern Nigeria.  Therefore, the developed and validated 
emotional intelligence competency scale could be used to gauge the amount of emotional intelligence competence of 
students and graduates of technical education if is use by appropriate authority.

1. Introduction
Developing measuring instrument for emotional intelligence is widely encouraged by scholars as it’s very important 
and more appropriate to measure emotional intelligence base on individual settings for certainty of measured abilities. 
Instruments as a generic term in education, its outcome need to be consistent, dependable, reliable, valid and useable, 
and it has two classification for researchers and their subject (Biddix 2006).Nigerian technical education graduate as 
the subject in the study is a skilled individual that need to be aware of his/her emotional state, appropriately regulate 
his/her emotions and socially associate with others and manage his relationship and this can only be achieve through 
the development of appropriate tools especially on emotional intelligence (Ranganat 2011). Ogwo and Oranu (2006) 
defined an instrument as a data collection device and information gathering tools in education. Afolabi (2017) stated 
that it is appropriate for every researcher to use appropriate instruments to assess emotional intelligence.  
Emotional intelligence is termed to be an intellectual talent involved in one’s personal behavior, an individual’s ability 
to be aware of his/her emotions, understand and use the emotional competence on his/herself and others to achieve a 
specific goals (Boyatzis and Fabio 2004). Developing an instrument to suit individual context and individual social 
dorms should be the major issues for  scholars globally, as  studies emphases on  the relevance of developing an 
emotional intelligence instrument to suit the context and individual’s social norms (Nguye 2019: Aforlabi 2017). 
Ability for one’s to recognize his/her emotional state and those of others is a motivating factors, in maintaining our 
relationships with others. Emotional intelligence as an individual capacity to perform well in one choosing career

The result of the analysis as presented in Table 5.2 shown the items’ Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficients of 0.867 
for Self-Awareness Competency, 0.809 for Self-Regulation Competency, 0.832 for Social-Awareness Competency 
and 0.913 for Relationship Management Competency respectively. This parameters are considered satisfactory 
reliability because according to Hair, Anderson, Tatham & Black (1995) and Cohen et al. (2010), a Cronbach’s alpha 
scale of at least 0.70 is acceptable for the internal consistency reliability of the items and can therefore be accepted for 
study’s purpose. These criteria served as the guidelines in interpreting the internal consistency-reliability coefficients 
in this research. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the literature review, the study identified the need for the development of precise instrument to measure 
emotional intelligence competencies as a skills requirement for the employment of technical education graduates in 
northern Nigeria, due to the absence of precise instrument for measuring emotional intelligence competency of 
technical education graduate in northern Nigeria, and that cause high rate of unemployment among the graduates. In 
consequence, the study successfully developed and validated the emotional intelligence competency scale and the 
scale which were found valid and reliable. Thus it could be considered for use in assessing emotional intelligence 
competencies as needed for employment of technical education graduates in northern Nigeria. Furthermore, the 
emotional intelligence competency scale developed should be used as a skills for employment of technical education 
graduates. It’s also   recommended that, the developed emotional intelligence competency scale should be employed 
to use in schools and training centres for retrain technical education graduates and interested individuals at skill 
acquisition centres in northern Nigeria and the country at large.

Abstract 
Due to increasing concern of environmental degradation by various supply chain activities such as sourcing, 
transportation, inventory holding, manufacturing, and distribution, industries have begun redesigning their supply 
chain network to integrate recycling and reuse of product returns.  The combination of the forward movement of goods 
from raw materials to the end user and the reverse movement of goods from the end user to the manufacturer, or even 
back into raw materials through recycling is entitled as Closed Loop Supply Chains (CLSC). In this paper a multi 
objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed to determine the optimal locations of the 
facilities and the distribution of flows between the facilities in the CLSC. The sustainability goals addressed in this 
research include minimizing cost (economic goal), minimizing carbon emission (environment goal) and maximizing 
the employment (social goal).  The proposed MILP has been validated using a randomly generated data set.

Abstract 
Church is an institution which is devoted in promotion of God’s word to the Parishioners. As an institution, they 
provide different services to their customers, the Parishioners. Philippines is one of the country known for Christianity 
around the world with Roman Catholicism as the predominant. According to a consensus conducted by Philippines 
Statistics Authority last 2010, there are 74, 211, 896 followers of Roman Catholic Church or 80.6% of the Philippine 
population which has grown about 19.96% over the past 10 years from 61, 862, 898 since 2000. With the continuous 
growth in members of the Catholic Church, the demand to meet the members’ need is also increasing. In this study, 
Church Ministry Portfolio Management Matrix was used with the aim to improve the resource allocation of the 
different ministry of the church. Two important variables are being considered: Parishioner’s Perspective and 
Resource Demand. First, the significant factors in segmenting the church were obtained using the One Sample t-test 
in order to get the P-Value which resulted to all factors being significance since p-value < 0.05. To know the most 
effective motivational method, Analytical Hierarchy Process was used. The result shows that all methods are effective 
in motivating the ministries to add value to the church except Recognizing achievements and efforts. Lastly, Cost and 
Benefit Analysis was used to analyze the impact of using CMPM Matrix to the ministries of the church which result 
shows that the church can save from unexpected expenses, easier and faster access to funds, increase in parishioners’ 
interaction within the church and improve ministry members’ performance. However, there is insufficient evidence to 
prove that Church Ministry Portfolio Management matrix has significant impact in the operation of the church in terms 
of performance of each ministry therefore further studies must be conducted.

Abstract 
In the era of industrial development 4.0, it is undeniable that the existence of digital and communication technology 
is an important element. The demands of the development of industry 4.0 and changes in people’s behavior in 
communicating provide new challenges for companies engaged in the telecommunications industry. One of the efforts 
of telecommunications industry to respond for this situation is by adjusting the quality management system that is 
being implemented to keep it in tune with these changes. The implementation of upgraded quality management or 
termed quality management 4.0, is important for telecommunications industry to meet customer expectations in the 
industrial era 4.0. One of the guidelines for the implementation of quality management that is often used is ISO 
9001:2015. However, some companies experience difficulties in implementing ISO 9001:2015, due to the inadequate 
level of performance of human resources in carrying out their functions and obligations. This encourages the need for 
companies to measure the performance of their staff in order to evaluate and improve the system that is run and can 
be used as the basis for the company in improving the quality of staff performance. This research aims to formulate a 
model of staff competency in the successful implementation of ISO 9001:2015 with an industrial 4.0 concept approach 
in telecommunications industry. The selection of research variables was carried out by elaborating the criteria for 
quality management ISO 9001:2015 with indicators on growth skills for industry 4.0.

Abstract 
Service quality is one of the main online food delivery services (OFDS) factors, especially related to the satisfaction 
and loyalty of the customer. Since the industry 4.0 era and the COVID-19 pandemic hit, society has been through a 
lot of changes including the customer standard of satisfaction and loyalty to products or services. For this condition, 
the SERVQUAL model for the OFDS industry needs to be expanded with two additional new criteria related to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and industry 4.0 (digital technology). This research purpose is to build the conceptual model 
based on the P-SERVQUAL 4.0, -Pandemic Service Quality in Industry 4.0 Era, -to evaluate customer satisfaction 
and loyalty of the OFDS in Indonesia. This conceptual model could be utilized as a basis to further empirical study of 
OFDS industry in Indonesia and to formulate the OFDS strategies in keeping up with the development of digital 
technology as well as adapting and overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic situation.

1. Introduction
On March 11th, 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared Sars-Cov2 or Corona Virus (COVID-19) as global 
pandemic (Cucinotta and Vanelli 2020). Since then, society have been through a lot of changes including behaviors, 
lifestyles, trends, habits, and many other things. One of the most obvious changes in society is the social distancing 
behavior. Social distancing is one of the steps decided by the government that effectively could prevent the COVID-
19 virus spreads (Milne and Xie 2020). The access of almost every public service that barely important, store, 
restaurant, etc are limited as the implementation of social distancing (Nguyen and Vu 2020). This includes society 
restrictions for dine in. However, the regulation causes negative impact for the business owner and public. Therefore, 
Online Food Delivery Services (OFDS) became solutions in fulfilling public needs of food and maintain the business.

H7 : Pandemic (X7) have positive and significant impact towards customer satisfaction (Y1) 
H14 : Pandemic (X7) have positive and significant impact towards customer loyalty (Y2) 
The relationship between the SERVQUAL dimensions towards customer loyalty with customer satisfaction as 
mediating role. Previous research with focus on examining the effect of service quality on customer loyalty by 
mediating customer satisfaction has been carried out by various researchers such as Kurniawan et al 2020, Permatasari 
and Purwanto 2022, Rizqiningsih and Widodo 2021. Based on some of these research results, the following hypotheses 
can be built. 
H8-12 : Service quality dimensions have positive and significant impact towards customer loyalty (Y2) with 
customer satisfaction (Y1) as mediating role. 
5. Conclusion
Based on the findings in the conceptual model and previous research it can be concluded that service quality has 
positive significant impact towards customer satisfaction and loyalty. The expected output of this study is a service 
quality improvement strategy. This strategy is considered capable of providing improvements in service quality to 
increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. The propositions described are expected to be a reference in further studies. 
Where the focus of this research is the development of a conceptual model that analyzes the relationship between 
service quality and customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Previous research that is used as a reference for the service quality model of this final project is the research by 
Tumsekcali et al 2021. In this study, a new service quality model was initiated that considers technological advances 
and the COVID-19 pandemic, namely the P-SERVQUAL 4.0 model. This study aims to analyze the best alternative 
public transportation that can be used during a pandemic using the IVIF AHP-WASPAS method. Hence, the proposed 
conceptual model for this study can be seen in Figure 1.

Based on the conceptual model, the fourteen hypotheses can be obtained that provide direction for future research. 
These hypotheses will be discussed as follows. 
 
The relationship between the SERVQUAL dimensions towards customer satisfaction. Many studies with focus 
on analyzing the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction have been carried out. Al-Tit 2015 
conducted a study on the effect of service quality on customer satisfaction at restaurants in Jordan City with results 
showing that tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy have a significant positive effect on 
customer satisfaction. Other studies are used as references such as Leong et al 2015, Fida et al 2020, and Ge et al 
2021. Based on some of these research results, the following hypotheses can be built. 
 
H1-5 : Service quality dimensions have positive and significant impact towards customer satisfaction (Y1) 
 
The relationship between industry 4.0 dimension towards customer satisfaction & loyalty. Research with a focus 
related to technology has been carried out by various researchers such as Akbar et al 2021, Kunadi and Wuisan 2021, 
Suhartanto et al 2019, and others. These three studies examine the relationship between e-service quality (related to 
technology) and consumer satisfaction in food delivery services and e-wallet and the results show that e-service quality 
has a significant positive effect on consumer satisfaction. Based on some of these research results, the following 
hypotheses can be built. 
 
H6 : Industry 4.0 (X6) have positive and significant impact towards customer satisfaction (Y1) 
 
H13 : Industry 4.0 (X6) have positive and significant impact towards customer loyalty (Y2) 
 
The relationship between pandemic dimension towards customer satisfaction & loyalty. Various studies have 
been carried out by considering the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on service quality on consumer behavior, for 
example Ali et al 2021, Prasetyo et al 2021, Tumsekcali et al 2021. The results of this study indicate that the pandemic 
has a significant positive effect on consumer behavior. Based on some of these research results, the following 
hypotheses can be built.

Abstract 
The Borobudur Temple tourism is targeted by the Indonesian government as one of the “Ten New Bali” in 2025. 
Currently, the service quality in Borobudur Temple is still perceived as low by tourists, which is shown in many bad 
reviews on social media, reflecting the lack of visitor satisfaction in Borobudur Temple, especially during the 
pandemic Covid-19 and the new normal era. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the factors that affect visitor's 
satisfaction in order to improve the tourism service quality in Borobudur Temple during the Covid-19 pandemic and 
the new normal era. Four pillars of tourism namely attraction, accessibility, amenity, and ancillary are analyzed using 
a Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) approach to formulating the best configurations model to 
improve the visitor’s satisfaction. This research found the configurational model that consists of two factors 
combinations that produces a high visitor satisfaction and three factors combinations that result in low visitor 
satisfaction. Further analyses are made based on those configurational models to propose service quality 
improvements in Borobudur Temple.

1. Introduction
Tourism sector in Indonesia plays a high role in contributing to the nation’s gross domestic product and the nation’s 
foreign exchange (Kemenparekraf 2021) while Bali still become the main tourism destination icon in Indonesia, 
proven by almost half of the number tourism arrival is to Bali (Ollivaud and Haxton 2019). This shows how popular 
Bali is but on the other hand also indicates the other destinations are less popular despite having many great potencies. 
Because of that, in 2017 the government announced the new development of the priority tourism destination as the” 
Ten New Balis” to boost the other destinations to be the new icon of Indonesian tourism destination. Borobudur

(fANC) is low, the outcome will show low satisfaction (the negation of high satisfaction). This is proven by 
fATT*fACC*fAMN*~fANC or high attraction, high accessibility, high amenity, and high ancillary as the second 
configuration in the truth table of high satisfaction. The second configuration shows that even the ancillary is low 
(~fANC), the configuration still produces high satisfaction. 
On the practical advice, of course the Borobudur Temple’s management must enhance all four pillars of tourism 
development. However, the management can pay more attention to enhance the amenity aspects because amenity is 
presence on all solution configurations both high and low level of satisfaction, indicating that this aspect is very 
important to presence. Although it is not a necessary condition, amenity has the highest coverage and consistency 
based on the necessary condition analysis. For high satisfaction, the condition is high amenity (fAMN) with 0,775808 
in consistency and 0,806608 in coverage while for low satisfaction, the condition is low amenity (~fAMN) with 
0,810500 in consistency and 0,780151 in coverage. 
To achieve the high level of visitor’s satisfaction, the management also can focus on enhancing other aspects based 
on the high satisfaction solution configuration especially first solution configuration (fATT*fACC*fAMN) because 
this configuration has higher consistency with value of 0,880819 than the second solution configuration 
(fATT*fAMN*fANC) with 0,86694 in consistency. Furthermore, to avoid the occurrence of low visitor’s satisfaction, 
the management must highly maintain all four pillars of tourism in the implementation and ensure that no aspects in 
those four pillars can construct even one of the three solution configurations of low satisfaction. 
6. Conclusion
This research aims to find the best configuration to improve the visitor’s satisfaction and found two configurations 
that produces high visitor’s satisfaction and three configuration that produces low visitor’s satisfaction. Amenity 
become the aspect that could be given more consideration due to its presence on all solution configuration and the 
high value of consistency and coverage. This research also finds some configuration that must be avoided so the low 
level of visitor’s satisfaction doesn’t occur. However, in the future this research must be compared to other research 
which conducted when the pandemic era is over to see how far the relevance of this research when the condition is 
back to normal.

Abstract 
As of February 2020, Covid-19 has spread in Indonesia. Since then, people's behavior started to change. The spread 
of the virus required people to do a physical distance and stay at home. The offline activity started to be shifted into 
online activities. Working from home, learning from home, and buying from home are the new lifestyle. In this 
situation, people depend more on a wifi connection, and it could be seen as an opportunity for the internet service 
provider company. In fact, providing the best service quality to customers is still a challenge faced by the internet 
service provider as there are still a lot of complaints from customers. Therefore, companies need to measure their 
service quality performance based on their customer's testimonials. One of the ways to see customers' opinions 
regarding the service quality is to do text mining, more specifically sentiment analysis from Twitter because people 
tend to give more honest testimonials in their tweets. The service quality research with text mining to do the analysis 
of people's sentiment related to the company's service quality is potentially utilized for this study due to its being 
considered more efficient than using a questionnaire. A literature exploration from previous research was conducted 
to identify whether using text mining and sentiment analysis to measure the service quality provided by ISP company 
is possible to do. Six papers were then reviewed. Result shows that using text mining and sentiment analysis to identify 
the service quality provided by companies is possible to do. Out of six papers that were reviewed, only two of them 
using ISP as the main object. Service quality literature which use text mining and sentiment analysis to define the 
quality of service provided in ISP industry is still rarely done by researcher. Meanwhile, public’s need for internet 
service is growing. This should be seen as an opportunity for researcher to do more research regarding the service 
quality of ISP companies so they could improve.

Table  1 Literature Review Result 
From the Table 1 above, it is known that using text mining and sentiment analysis to define the service quality provided 
by companies is possible to do. There is several software that could help calculating the sentiment analysis such as 
Python, R Studio, NetMiner 4,0, and RapidMiner. Out of six papers that were reviewed, only two of them use ISP 
companies as the research object. This implies that the service quality literature which use text mining and sentiment 
analysis to define the quality of service provided in ISP industry is still rarely done by researcher. Meanwhile, public’s 
need for internet service is growing. This should be seen as an opportunity for researcher to do more research regarding 
the service quality of ISP companies so they could improve.   
6. Conclusions
This paper tries to review the existing research related to service quality using text mining as data collection tool 
especially in an ISP industry. Paper searching was done by exploring the reputable source such as Scopus, Google 
Scholar, Emerald and ResearchGate. Papers were then filtered by the title and abstract. The requirement of the papers 
to be reviewed including using service quality as the main topic, using text mining and sentiment analysis as a tool to 
define the quality of service provided by companies. Six papers were then reviewed. Result shows that using text 
mining and sentiment analysis to identify the service quality provided by companies is possible to do. Out of six papers

that were reviewed, only two of them using ISP as the main object. Service quality literature which uses text mining 
and sentiment analysis to define the quality of service provided in ISP industry is still rarely done by researcher. 
Meanwhile, public’s need for internet service is growing. This should be seen as an opportunity for researcher to do 
more research regarding the service quality of ISP companies so they could improve.

Abstract 
This study aimed to develop a method for prioritizing resource allocation at universities based on the results of 
measuring resource efficiency and the market position of study programs. The efficiency was measured using the Data 
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, followed by mapping the market position of the study program using the 
growth-share matrix (Boston Consulting Group/BCG) and the GE McKinsey matrix. Those methods were combined 
to create a priority order for allocating organizational resources. The objects of this research were 12 undergraduate 
programs as the Decision Making Unit (DMU) at the Engineering Faculty of Diponegoro University. The efficiency 
measurement result showed that five departments were inefficient: Civil Engineering, Urban and Regional Planning, 
Electrical Engineering, and Geodetic Engineering. Based on market position mapping results, Industrial Engineering 
and Urban and Regional Planning were categorized as stars. Computer Engineering, Environmental Engineering, 
Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Geodetic Engineering were classified as question mark 
categories. The remaining department, Geological Engineering and Marine Engineering were denoted by lose 
category. The integration of the DEA method with BCG and GE McKinsey matrix to determine resource allocation 
matrix based on efficiency and market position was the scientific contribution of this study. The research was 
conducted based on a business perspective, with the university as a profit institution and the study program as a 
business unit. This research is intriguing because the indicators used to measure efficiency in a higher education 
institution are very different from those of a business organization.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, in the age of a knowledge-based economy, universities have a vital role in developing a country. The 
primary goal of the university is to explore and disseminate knowledge. It can be achieved by advancing research, 
teaching, and learning activities between lecturers and students (Kao and Hung 2006). The public universities, most 
of their funding comes from the state budget, must be able to offer the best value for money. Resource allocation and 
usage efficiency are two essential points that are interrelated in evaluating the use of resources in a university (Visbal-
Cadavid et al. 2017). The university resources are human, financial, and material or tools that support university

Abstract 
Based on a preliminary study, it was found that several catering businesses have not managed waste cooking oil 
properly. Waste cooking oil that is not managed correctly can cause environmental pollution, and if it is still used, it 
will cause health problems. This study explored the driving factors that motivate catering entrepreneurs to manage 
used cooking oil using the DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial Evaluation and Laboratory) approach. Fifteen 
catering businesses in the eastern part of Yogyakarta are the objects of this research. The results showed that public 
health was the dominant driving factor influencing other driving factors, most often found in the catering businesses 
studied, although some catering showed different results. Another result of this study is that the availability of 
facilities is the factor that has the greatest relationship with other factors. Furthermore, the management's 
commitment and increasing company profit are also factors that can influence other driving factors. Environmental 
awareness, social awareness, government regulation, and product innovation are independent factors. One of the 
benefits of the results is that the government can use it in regulating the used cooking oil management by taking into 
account these driving factors.

1. Introduction
Yogyakarta is one of the big cities in Indonesia, with a population of 441,295 people (Central Bureau of Statistics 
Yogyakarta City, 2019). Therefore, the city of Yogyakarta is the right place for business actors as a profitable 
opportunity. One of the business opportunities is in the food and beverage sector. The economic growth of the food 
and beverage business industry is a sector with a reasonably significant contribution in the city of Yogyakarta, 
namely 5.81% of gross regional domestic product (Central Bureau of Statistics Yogyakarta City, 2016). Catering is 
an option for food and beverage businesses 
The process of preparing food in catering indeed cannot be separated from the use of cooking oil. The more 
processed food, the more used cooking oil is produced. Cooking oil that is used repeatedly can harm health and the 
environment if not managed properly. According to Ardhany & Lamsiyah (2018), used cooking oil can indirectly 
cause death if consumed continuously because used cooking oil is a trigger for various diseases such as coronary 
heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and cancer. If used cooking oil is thrown away at the water disposal, it will clog 
the pipe and damage it (Linarti et al., 2019).  
The catering business actor's role in managing the used cooking oil produced is crucial. However, from the initial 
study results for this research, catering entrepreneurs have not adequately managed used cooking oil. As mentioned 
in Nugroho's research (2020), the main obstacle for business actors in Yogyakarta is their lack of knowledge in 
managing used cooking oil. 
Cooking oil management that is carried out correctly will reduce the waste of used cooking oil produced and provide 
financial benefits. Some of the practices of using used cooking oil include being used as raw material for making 
biodiesel (Darmawan & Susila, 2013) and as an ingredient for making bath soap (Kusumaningtyas et al., 2018). 
304","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
smallest relationship with other factors is the Social awareness factor (D2). Thus, these two factors must still be 
present in the management of used cooking oil but do not affect other factors. 
 
Furthermore, when viewed from the results of each catering based on Table 5, it can be seen that each catering has a 
different position of the driving factor. All catering has a driving factor in quadrant I, while several caterings do not 
have factors in quadrant II, III, or IV. For this reason, each catering must pay attention to the factors that are in 
quadrant I, which most of the caterers have, which are Increasing company profit (D6), Public health (D7), and 
Availability of facilities (D8). 
 
The factors in quadrant II mean that they have a low level of prominence with a high level of relationship. This 
factor has a value (R+C) smaller than the average threshold value and (R-C) positive. It means that these factors 
have a greater influence on other factors than are influenced by other factors. However, this influence does not 
impact other factors because the value (R+C) is less than the threshold value. The factors in quadrant IV mean that 
they have a high level of prominence with a low level of relationship. This factor has a value (R+C) greater than the 
threshold value, and (R-C) is negative. It means that other factors than influencing other factors more dominantly 
influence these factors, but these factors have an impact on other factors. 
 
From the analysis of the DEMATEL method with the application of analysis to all catering and each catering, it can 
be seen that the public health factor (D7) is the most dominant driving factor that appears in quadrant I. For that 
reason, this factor can be said to be a driving factor in the management of used cooking oil in the catering business, 
which will affect other factors in encouraging used cooking oil management activities. Therefore, the manager or 
owner of catering must always consider public health when using cooking oil for serving food. These considerations 
can refer to the dangers that can be caused by the repeated use of used cooking oil, as mentioned in Noriko et al. 
(2012), Liu et al. (2018), and Ardhany & Lamsiyah (2018).   
 
The results of this study do not cover all catering in the city of Yogyakarta or other areas in the Special Region of 
Yogyakarta Province. In addition, this research also does not cover all types of food service businesses that have the 
potential to produce used cooking oil. For this reason, research can be developed for areas and business units that 
this study has not reached. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The behavior of the catering manager or owner is that the used cooking oil produced has not been managed 
independently but acts as a supplier and cooperates with third parties, namely used cooking oil collectors. Most 
catering managers or owners have sufficient knowledge about the management of used cooking oil even though they 
feel some internal and external obstacles in managing used cooking oil. The results showed that the public health 
factor was the most prominent in the management of used cooking oil in the research area. Meanwhile, the factor 
that has the greatest relationship with other factors is the availability of facilities. In addition, two other factors, 
internal policy/ management commitment and increasing company profit affect other driving factors. Meanwhile, 
environmental awareness, social awareness, external policy/ government regulation, and product innovation are 
independent factors.

Abstract 
The flow of urbanization is increasing every year. This increase in urbanization has led to increased e-commerce users 
in urban areas involving the movement of goods from sellers to buyers, called logistic activities. It means urbanization 
will cause an increase in the number of vehicles passing through urban areas. The number of passing vehicles 
increases, but the road capacity remains, which causes congestion. Congestion will cause inefficiency in fuel and 
travel time. One of the solutions to this problem is crowd-shipping. Crowd-shipping reduces the number of vehicles 
by involving occasional drivers in delivery activities to minimize courier delivery activities. This study provides a 
literature review and integration framework between crowd-shipping and smart logistics. The literature review defines 
the research clusters of crowd-shipping, the challenge of implementing crowd-shipping according to previous 
research, and the measurement of crowd-shipping success. This research was conducted using co-occurrence analysis 
on 949 articles containing the keyword crowd-shipping to generate the research cluster. This paper categorizes it into 
four research clusters, i.e., the crowd-shipping actor, the basis of crowd-shipping, the requirement to implement 
crowd-shipping, and urban mobility. The integration framework of crowd-shipping and smart logistics is developed 
by comparing the crowd-shipping process and its requirement with the smart logistics components. The result found 
that all of the requirements of the crowd-shipping process can be fulfilled by smart logistics. The literature review 
results in six challenges and ten parameter success measures of crowd-shipping implementation.

1. Introduction
Nowadays most of peoples are preferring to live in urban areas than in rural areas. This phenomenon is often referred 
to as urbanization. More than half of the World’s population now lives in urban areas (Chourabi et al., 2014). In 2050, 
around of 70% population in the world will live in urbans and neighboring regions (United nations, 2015). The desire 
to improve the quality of life (Yi et al., 2021), the need for education, and the availability of employment opportunities 
(Hofmann et al., 2013) are the major factors that encourage most people to urbanize. The increase in the number of 
urban residents is also followed by an increase in several problems (Han et al., 2014). The mass migration to the cities 
will increase the number of densely populated areas, further complicating urban mobility and logistics (OECD, 2012). 
Rapid urbanization also harms the environment. Although cities occupy 2% of the planet, they already account for 
60% to 80% of energy consumption and 75% of carbon dioxide emissions. Although goods transport is responsible 
for 14% of the vehicle kilometers, 19% of energy use, and 21% of CO2 emissions in urban areas, city logistics needs 
are often neglected in urban planning (Nocerino et al., 2016). The rapid growth in the use of e-commerce in urban 
areas has contributed to the number of logistics activities, especially for last mile deliveries. The growth of the used 
of e-commerce caused an increase of goods transportation in the city center, impacting traffic congestion, the 
environment and energy consumption. (Correira, 2022). There is no city can work well as long as the logistics activities 
inside it are inefficient (Kauf, 2016). 
There are several kinds of inefficiencies in logistics activities, such as inefficiency in fuel use, inefficiency in travel 
routes, inefficiency in vehicle capacity utilization, and so on. Inefficient logistics activities have an impact on poor 
service for public transportation, traffic congestion, death or disability due to pollution, and scarcity of resources in 
the future (Miranda, 2012). Traffic density is the result of inefficiency in the utilization of vehicle capacity where all

allow for an increase in traffic density and CO2 emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to measure whether the 
implementation of crowd shipping is successful or not. 
Based on the literature review that has been carried out, the results show that there are 10 parameters that can be 
used to ensure the successful implementation of crowd shipping. If crowd shipping is successful, the delay and 
average travel time of public transportation will decrease. in addition, CO emissions, CO2, traffic noise will 
decrease due to the reduced number of passing vehicles. The decrease in the number of passing vehicles should also 
have an impact on the decrease in fuel consumption and the average distance traveled by the total vehicle.

Abstract 
This research aims to test and analyze whether job satisfaction has a role in mediating the relationship between 
compensation and benefit and transformational leadership towards the OCB level of the intern. The collected 
respondents were 220, consisting of people who experienced internships in Bandung and around Jakarta. This research 
is a non-probability sampling through the purposive sampling method and uses quantitative analysis. The calculation 
uses SmartPLS3 to get the SEM model and the results of the hypothesis. Based on the results obtained, all the 
hypotheses are accepted. Compensation and benefit and transformational leadership have a significant influence on 
job satisfaction. Both also affect OCB. Job satisfaction also shows a significant impact on OCB. Among all the three 
variables (compensation and benefit, transformational leadership, and job satisfaction), compensation and benefits 
have the most significant effect on OCB.

Since 2018, young people, commonly called the millennial generation, are starting to dominate companies (Yunita 
and Saputra, 2019). To create their career, many of them used internship programs before they continued being an 
employee for the company. This generation requires special treatment, attracting the attention of newcomers and

Abstract 
This paper extends the research on understanding of the essence and specification, as well as the relevance of the 
online service industry that affects customer loyalty in relation to their satisfaction in the Philippine context. 
Quantitative method was utilized in the study by quantifying four hundred Filipino online shopper’s respondents to 
provide a comprehensive information of which from 9 dimensions of mobile service quality (Efficiency, System 
Availability, Content, Privacy, Fulfillment, Responsiveness, Compensation, Contact, and Billing) positively affects 
the customer satisfaction and understand the level of customer loyalty under the covid-19 pandemic. The results were 
drafted and analyzed using Service Quality Gaps, Ordinal Logistic Regression, and Spearman Correlation Analysis. 
The modified model found the surge of online sales under the pandemic can impact the overall expectation and 
perception of customers towards online shopping. It is further concluded that the significant factors that have a major 
influence on the customer satisfaction and loyalty are efficiency, fulfillment, and content. The results also suggest that 
the customer’s loyalty are antecedents of customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Online shopping platforms are growing rapidly and has become a trend for business ideas in the Philippines with the 
emerging technology of m-commerce, especially during the time of pandemic. The demand for online shopping for a 
wide variety of products, from essential goods to luxury goods has been rapidly increasing. The greatest challenge for 
mobile service providers is the delivery of high-quality service (Veloso et al., 2017). A strategic objective based on 
services is a crucial success factor for survival in a strong competitive e-environment (Rita et. al., 2019). In this regard, 
mobile service providers pay particular attention to monitoring and improving service quality that significantly 
influence customer satisfaction and loyalty, which are determinant variables in maximizing profit and establishing 
competitive edge (Elizar et. al., 2020). The quality improvement greatly influences customer satisfaction and loyalty, 
in both manufacturing and service industries. It implies that companies must first receive a favorable response from 
its customer before customer satisfaction and loyalty is established (Yusra and Agus, 2019). Mobile service providers 
aiming to deliver excellent services must consider how users view their mobile services, and this awareness includes 
a way of evaluating the efficiency of their services (Huang, 2015). However, it is still critical for service providers to 
have a good and clear understanding of exactly what the customer expectations and perceptions. In a continuously 
changing world, the expectation of customers changes rapidly. (Pankaj, et al., 2018). It has become imperative for 
service providers to assess whether they meet customer needs and expectations which is measured by aspects like 
online service quality, satisfaction and loyalty to customers. Numerous studies in the service industry have 
investigated that service quality is a significant antecedent of satisfaction (Cronin and Taylor, 1992; Veloso et al., 
2017; Zaibaf et al., 2012; Zhang and Prybutok, 2005). The key to customer satisfaction lies in identifying and assessing 
customer perception and expectation (Parasuraman, et.al., 1985).

Figure 4 shows the scatter plot between overall satisfaction and loyalty. It indicates a moderate positive relationship 
between two variables as the graph shows an uphill trend. It suggests that when customer’s satisfaction increases 
(moving to the right), the chance of customer retention is also increasing (moving upward) which indicates high quality 
of m-service. It is also observed that the correlation coefficient between overall satisfaction and loyalty lies between

6. Conclusion 
Indeed, COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the consumer trends in the Philippines and, globally due to inevitable 
adaptation to digitalization, Ecommerce have embraced the digital phenomenon. It is obvious that this shift demand 
challenges to satisfy customers’ need which is represents a key driving force in enhancing competitive and delivering 
service quality. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the factors affecting customer online shopping 
satisfaction in relation to customer loyalty from the response of 400 online shopping customers. 
 
Research question 1: What is the respondent’s level of online shopping satisfaction in terms of the 9 dimensions of 
mobile service quality? 
 
The level of online satisfaction in terms of nine dimensions of mobile service quality was measured using service 
quality gap. The scores of nine M-ServQual dimensions were all negative, indicating that the performance failed to 
reach the customers’ expectations mainly on contact and responsiveness dimension which has the largest gaps. The 
two dimensions are associated with the availability and efficiency of customer service assistance of the platform. 
Therefore, the customers were dissatisfied with all the service performance provided by the online shopping platforms 
during the pandemic as it was perceived not to meet customer expectation in the M-ServQual dimensions. 
 
Research question 2: What are the significant factors that have a major influence on customer's online shopping 
satisfaction and loyalty? 
 
In order to identify significant factors that have the major influence on customers’ online shopping satisfaction and 
loyalty, the Ordinal Logistic Regression was used. As generated from the results of the ordinal logistics regression, 
the Efficiency and the Fulfillment are both factors that significantly affect the customer satisfaction out of the 9 
dimensions of mobile service quality mentioned. While for customer loyalty, the factors that have a major influence 
are the Efficiency and the Content. The online service providers should focus on improving the said dimension in 
order to satisfy and retain the loyalty of their customers. In conclusion, the significant factors that have a major 
influence on the customer satisfaction and loyalty are Efficiency, Fulfillment, and Content. 
 
Research question 3: What is the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty? 
The relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty towards online shopping platforms are validated through 
correlation analysis. Through spearman’s rho correlation analysis, the association between two variables was 
determined. The result suggests that overall satisfaction and loyalty have a strong relationship. As the correlation 
coefficient lies between the strong positive ratio. The authors also argued that customer loyalty are great antecedents 
of customer satisfaction. Moreover, the link between customer satisfaction and loyalty supports the theory which 
states that the positive or negative purchase experience of a customer influences their purchase behavior. Therefore, 
the researcher concluded that there is a strong relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. The test 
significance also supported our conclusion, as the test significant value of the relationship is less than 0.05 (p = 
<.001), which suggests to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. 
 
6.1 Recommendation 
By fulfilling the purpose of the study, the researchers aim to help the online shopping platforms, businesses and 
providers of m-commerce and future researchers to further expand the applicability of the research topic. 
 
Provided by the impact of 9 dimensions and relationship of customer satisfaction and loyalty, the m-commerce 
providers or any online shopping platforms can use the research study as a basis for more efficient and effective service 
quality after pandemic. The service quality has two core elements, the customer expectation and perception. Closing 
or eliminating the gaps between expectation and perception on the service quality can provide the highest customer 
satisfaction. By identifying what factors affect service quality, it provides understanding of which customers’ 
expectations are fulfilled and which factors need to be satisfied. It can also help platforms, businesses and service

providers to understand customer’s needs or wants and create strategies to fill the gap in order to satisfy the customers. 
Thus, service quality is the ultimate measurement of customer satisfaction. Only the customer can define the quality 
of service or product. This study determined the service quality gaps of online shopping services using the M-ServQual 
model. It is found that all dimensions namely; Efficiency, System Availability, Content, Fulfillment, Privacy, 
Responsiveness, Compensation, Content and Billing has a negative satisfaction level towards online shopping 
services.  
From the findings, it is clear that with the surge of online sales during the COVID-19 Pandemic, the customer 
perception did not exceed customer expectation. In order to satisfy the quality service of online shopping platforms, 
the researchers recommend online shopping platforms, businesses, or service providers to enhance the quality 
dimension under M- Serv-Qual specifically on Responsiveness and Contact dimension. Thus, service providers must 
strive to improve m-service quality. In order to improve their customer service assistance, service providers should be 
always available to attend to customer's concern and orders. Moreover, providing high service quality increases 
customer satisfaction, which further increases customer loyalty towards online shopping platforms. Thus, a satisfied 
customer tends to have high probability to repurchase and use the platform again which leads to customer retention or 
loyalty. This way, it will help the business, to not only retain customers, it also helps the company to expand its profit 
and its business. The researchers recommend service providers to take preparatory measures to ensure the highest 
quality service, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, to maintain customer satisfaction and establish customer 
relationships. The nine dimensions of mobile service quality used in this study could use service providers as a measure 
to implement strategies to improve their quality service. Therefore, e-loyalty or loyalty in general is not solely about 
customers repurchase behavior nor about commitment, but the quality of service they provide should be considered. 
This study contributes to the existing literature of Mobile Service Quality model, customer loyalty and satisfaction on 
online platform services during COVID-19 pandemic, and greater opportunity for improvement are expected as the 
m-commerce in the Philippines are continuously growing. For future researchers and further enhancement of this
study, the researchers recommend to explore on different E-commerce platforms or markets. This would proffer a
more in-depth analysis of how customer satisfaction or loyalty can be affected depending on the location or service.
The researcher also recommends to examine the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic in relation to E-commerce’s
customer satisfaction and loyalty. Lastly, they can consider the use of other statistical tools and analysis to strengthen
the claims of the result.

Abstract 
This study is intended to design a motorcycle seat with Sorbothane insert using the MSCQ, QFD, and historical 
anthropometric data, to strategically reduce overall vibration exposure and motorcycle riding discomfort of riders. The 
researchers collected data from commercial and non-commercial motorcyclists through the form of an online MSCQ. 
The data is then subjected to ANOVA and correlation analysis tests which showed that scooter and standard type 
motorcycles show no significant differences between their vibration damping and discomfort reducing properties. 
Sorbothane, together with the properties as studied through the MSCQ analysis are then used in the QFD-HOQ model 
where the functional requirements are set for the new motorcycle seat design where local, historical anthropometric 
data was also considered. In the end visual and observational comparisons between current motorcycle seat designs 
and the new design were put to light in reference to the objectives of this study.

1. Introduction
In recent years, logistics, warehousing, and freight requirements in small and medium enterprises driven by a rise in 
consumer spending brought about a massive increase in the demand for motorcycle heavy, Point-to-point Ridesharing, 
Express Courier/Parcel Delivery Services, and Food Delivery services in the Philippines as a relative effect of the 
continuous increase in the number of the middle class in the country. Motorcycles have become very popular and

new motorcycle seat design can also be done to further enhance the new design. It is also recommended that further 
studies on the product marketing, feasibility, and safety be done in future. 
 Lastly, the researchers recommend that future studies consider expanding the HOQ model via the inclusion of a more 
comprehensive comparative analysis among other competitors for the better appreciation of the product material. 
While the study can be used as basis and/comparison, similar studies using the same or an improved version of 
methodology can be conducted for a broader set of motorcycle types.

Abstract 
The entrepreneurial ecosystem, a set of multidimensional factors that interact in an entrepreneurial environment, is 
one of the constellations that can strengthen entrepreneurial activity and support sustainable economic growth. Despite 
the importance of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is a void in research about how the entrepreneurial ecosystem 
can also help enterprises improve digitalization and innovation performance. These performances are essential in all 
fields of enterprises to sustain in this industrial 4.0 era, especially for MSMEs. Thus, this study aims to explain the 
mediating effect of digitalization and innovation on the relationship between the entrepreneurial ecosystem and 
sustainability among MSMEs in Indonesia. This study utilized four well-known entrepreneurial ecosystem 
frameworks to assess how entrepreneurial ecosystem elements are indispensable in enhancing MSMEs' digitalization 
and innovation which will end up amplifying sustainability. This research uses a structured survey questionnaire-
based data collection method with Indonesian MSME actors as respondents. This study contributes by providing a 
mediation analysis of digitalization and innovation in channeling the entrepreneurial ecosystem element to boost 
operational, economic, and marketing sustainability. Through this study, EE elements such as the government, higher 
education institutions, professional infrastructure, and entrepreneurs themselves are suggested to collaborate to 
improve Indonesian EE quality by adopting digitalization and nurturing innovation to reinforce sustainability growth 
in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Entrepreneurship policies around the world are currently transitioning from increasing the quantity of entrepreneurship 
to improving the quality of entrepreneurship. These policies are implemented through the support of strengthening 
elements of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, be it MSMEs, startups, or large-scale industries. This entrepreneurial 
ecosystem approach is defined as a new framework that accommodates policy transitions and is capable of supporting 
significant economic development. This approach begins with the emphasis on entrepreneurs being able to bring about 
social and economic transformation (Cavallo et al., 2019). 
In this case, elements of technology, innovation, and entrepreneurs are key players in creating an ecosystem and 
keeping the existing ecosystem healthy (Dhewanto et al., 2015). Technological advances and innovation in the 
entrepreneurial ecosystem allow for integration along the value chain to create a dynamic production system based on 
real-time data on demand and supply levels. Also, implementing innovative technology enables the acceleration of 
the overall production system so that companies will be able to optimize production time, which will impact 
production costs (Gao et al., 2021; Zang and Li, 2017). 
This study focuses on MSMEs because the number of MSMEs in Indonesia is significant. They can become the 
backbone of the economy by contributing to the National GDP. However, the business climate in Indonesia during 
the COVID-19 pandemic is very diverse and full of uncertainty. MSMEs in the accommodation, food and beverage

Abstract 
Supplier selection is a decision-making process that considers many criteria. The industry has developed and 
implemented many Multi-criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods for supplier selection. The Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) method is one of the most widely used methods, however, the AHP method requires a lot of pairwise 
comparisons between criteria and alternatives, which will be more complex when there is interdependence between 
criteria and alternatives. In order to produce better decisions, the AHP method is often implemented with other 
methods like the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method. The SAW method applies simple calculations and does 
not require complicated computer programs. In previous studies, a single decision-maker carried out AHP and SAW 
together in the manufacturing industry. In this study, a decision-making method was developed by several decision-
makers (DMs) by integrating the AHP and SAW methods. The results of integrating AHP and SAW with multiple 
decision-makers were tested at a wood trading company called UD BSA for supplier selection. In this study, 3 
alternative suppliers were considered. The literature results and brainstorming with the company resulted in 5 criteria 
and 8 sub-criteria that were considered in selecting suppliers at UD BSA with 2 DMs: the owner as DM1 and 
experienced purchasing staff as DM 2. The DM weighting was determined by considering each DM’s expertise in 
assessing the criteria and sub-criteria. The integration of the AHP and SAW methods with 2 DM produces the output 
weight of each DM and the calculation results of the supplier's assessment with the highest ranking. Based on the 
calculation results, DM2 has a higher weight of 56.13%, which means that DM 2 is more expert in assessing criteria 
and sub-criteria. In addition, the best-selected supplier is PP, with the highest overall score of 0.8354. From this case 
study, UD BSA designed a supplier ranking system, which the company can use if there are new suppliers or future 
supplier performance changes

1. Introduction
The use of several multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tools simultaneously has been widely used in decision-
making. Two well-known tools are Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW). 
These two tools have been used simultaneously in decision- making, for example, for the assessment of pharmaceutical 
supply chain risk in Iran (Jaberidoost et al. 2015), recommendation optimization (Kurniawati, Lenti, and Nugroho 
2021), and supplier selection (Kumar et al. 2019).  
In general, in previous studies, the use of several tools simultaneously was processed separately, and the decision-
maker was carried out by one Decision-Maker (DM). However, in practice, decisions are often not made by one person 
but by more than one person. In cases with more than one DM, the decisions are often the result of compromise or 
voting. 
Compromise or voting is a decision taken by ignoring the reality that among DMs, there are those whose knowledge 
or capabilities are better than other DMs. Realizing this, we need a tool that distinguishes the weight of DMs in making 
decisions. This study integrates AHP and SAW by considering more than one decision-maker, so-called group 
decision-making. This integration was applied to the supplier selection case. The AHP method was used in weighting

supplier for UD Berkat Syukur Abadi and will not be selected even though there is a change in the weight of the 
decision-maker. 
 
Supplier Ranking System Design 
The system design was made to ease UD Berkat Syukur Abadi to determine the best supplier based on ranking using 
the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method according to the criteria and sub-criteria that have been carried out 
using the AHP method. In the future, the company can see changes in the performance of each supplier or new 
suppliers that the company can consider, so this system design is needed. In addition, the decision-making process in 
supplier selection is also faster and easier. The following is a design view of the supplier ranking system that has been 
designed using Microsoft Excel. (Figure 3)

5. Conclusion 
The supplier ranking system design that has been designed by integrating AHP and SAW can facilitate and speed up 
the decision-making process of the two decision-makers in supplier selection. 
 
Based on the results of the research that has been done, it is found two decision-makers from UD Berkat Syukur 
Abadi, namely DM1 and DM2 considered several criteria and sub-criteria in supplier selection, namely the cost criteria 
with the sub-criteria of price suitability and payment convenience; quality criteria with sub-criteria of product quality 
and quality consistency, delivery criteria with sub-criteria of delivery time and product suitability, responsiveness 
criteria with sub-criteria of ease of communication and accuracy of completion, and flexibility criteria. In addition, 
the results of the DM's Importance Weights calculation show that DM2, as the company's administration, has the 
largest weight, which signifies that DM2 is more expert in providing assessments on each of the existing criteria and 
sub-criteria.

Abstract 
This research presents a model of structural equations to evaluate the effects of capacity, financial, technological, and 
organizational performance achieved when developing suppliers. The information was obtained from a questionnaire 
applied to engineers and managers working in manufacturing companies in Ciudad Juárez, Chih. Mexico already has 
a specific list of suppliers and collaborators; 200 completed questionnaires were obtained from approximately 50 
companies. The results indicate that, when it is intended to develop existing suppliers, it is important first to measure 
and evaluate the technological performance that they have achieved by participating as a strategic company, and 
secondly, to consider organizational and capacity performance, since together all of them will directly and positively 
influence the financial performance obtained in companies. This referer to industrial practice, to incorporate suppliers 
through a supplier development program, a key factor is the assessment of the performances that they have achieved 
in a certain time, with the purpose that the long-term strategy between company-supplier works properly to remain 
competitive, especially in costs. The model presented validates the fact that when selecting suppliers to develop them, 
the choice and the prior evaluation of their performance in the short-, medium- or long-term influences.

1. Introduction
Today, supply chains are complex and extensive, and controlling each logistics activity becomes difficult to overcome. 
A supply chain (SC) is conceptualized as multiple networks of material suppliers located in different geographical 
locations. Multiple production companies and distribution centers assemble and transform products to distribute to 
their customers (Sawik, 2018). All are connected by flows of materials, information, services, and money. Here 
logistics plays a key role in planning, implementing, and controlling the effective and efficient flow of materials from 
their origin to the destination to meet customers' needs. Managing logistics across the organization and its operations 
to optimize material and supply flows throughout the SC is a very complex planning process that requires some shared 
information (Christopher & Holweg, 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to develop certain competencies such as 
managing customers and suppliers, using integrative technologies, increasing collaboration, and improving operations. 
Concerning supplier management, the ideal is to promote real-time synchronization of buyers' requirements and 
supplier capabilities to reduce costs and improve quality to meet customers' expectations (Ross, 2015). Creating

5.4 Validation  
The information shown in Table 6 indicates the statistical decisions made according to the analysis of the relationships 
in the model, so they are accepted as there is no statistical evidence that the information provided by the people who 
answered the questionnaire is different from what was suggested in the model. For example, in H1, we have the 
statistical evidence to affirm with a 99% confidence level that there is a positive and direct relationship between 
technological performance and organizational performance with a value of 0.563. This means that for every standard 
deviation that the first changes, in that same proportion, the second will change. In the same way, each hypothesis is 
analyzed to evaluate whether it is accepted or rejected. It is observed that for all cases, the hypotheses are accepted 
because the inferences of the theory shown by the researcher about these relationships are supported by the information 
obtained from the companies; therefore, there is statistical evidence to prove that decisions to develop existing 
suppliers should consider complementary evaluations about both technological performances, of capacity and 
organization obtained in said suppliers.

6. Conclusion 
In the model of structural equations, it was found as the most important factor that technological performance is crucial 
to improve the rest of the aspects since it has direct and positive effects, and when it changes to a proportion of one 
standard deviation, everything will change positively in the proportion shown, 0.563, 0.332, 0.324 and 0.165 
respectively. It means that all model aspects are key to obtaining greater economic benefits for companies and 
improving supply chain performance. In general, there is an acceptable level of interest in evaluating these 
performances in the suppliers that currently collaborate in the manufacturing companies in the region studied; however 
it is necessary to deepen the methods of monitoring suppliers methods since the incorporation of suppliers in supplier 
development programs in the manufacturing industry in Ciudad Juarez is scarce, it is required on the one hand to 
define a method of selection of suppliers and on the other, one of evaluation of the performance of the same. 
Companies adapt to their particularities to incorporate suppliers; a standardized procedure is not followed that includes 
most of the criteria or requirements that a supplier must meet as a long-term collaborator who works together for the 
same organizational objectives. 
 
For future research, it is recommended to expand the study to achieve a larger sample size, include other 
complimentary items and incorporate the methodology used to develop the providers. These would allow us to 
investigate more about how it is currently carried out, and thus, we will propose new strategies to develop suppliers.

Abstract 
Whilst the Industry 4.0 concept emerges, practices and benefits of this new digital phenomenon is still vague for 
many enterprises and researchers. One of the most important reasons for this vagueness is that there is no strict 
consensus for the definition of the industry 4.0. As the concept can be defined as digitalization of production 
processes, thanks to the emerging technologies day by day, Industry 4.0 still may be confusing for many businesses 
and researchers. In the name of clarifying this vagueness, in this study, it has been aimed to investigate the practices 
of the industry 4.0 concept in the companies. “What kind of technologies are used for which activities in the 
companies under the industry 4.0 concept?” is the main question for this study. To answer this question companies 
which are listed as the “Top 500 hundred Industrial Enterprises” by the İstanbul Chamber of Industry have been 
investigated. After reviewing annual reports of these companies, it has been detected that 30 of them are dealing 
with Industry 4.0 concept as a strategy and/or application practice. In this study, results of this qualitative analysis 
will be presented to identify what kind of technological concepts are being used in the Turkish companies. 
According to the results, artificial intelligence and the robotic applications are the most popular Industry 4.0 
technologies used in the reviewed companies.

1. Introduction
Since the Industry 4.0 term has been coined in 2011, many practitioners and academicians are challenging to define 
the concepts and principles of the phenomenon.  As the Industry 4.0 concept is highly related with the technological 
developments, new technologies and infrastructures have the capacity of adding new definitions to the term. With all 
definitions, Industry 4.0 concept can be briefly described as digitalization of manufacturing and services (Elibal and 
Özceylan, 2020) via the technologies as shown in Figure-1. 
According to Hoffman et al. (2018) the research community did not reach a unanimous consensus towards a 
definition of Industry 4.0 and several authors have raised concern over this lack of agreement. Kane et al. (2018) 
emphasized that one of the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution is to identify a common language, that 
makes it possible to find a common ground or at least a starting point for the discussions. Industry 4.0 is not so far 
adequately standardized, spread, and lacks the clear boundaries (Schuh et al. 2017). Despite the current discussion in 
research and practice, the different perceptions and characterizations of Industry 4.0 show that there is currently no 
clear definition (Schott et al., 2018). Stefan et al. (2018) declared that there are some number of concepts and 
technologies that are associated with Industry 4.0. Some of them are even used synonymously for the term Industry

6. Conclusion  
In this study 30 Turkish companies which are selected from the “Top 500 hundred Industrial Enterprises” list, that 
has been published by İstanbul Chamber of Industry, has been reviewed to clarify what kind of Industry 4.0 
technologies are used in the companies. The aim of study is to clarify the industry 4.0 applications with real life 
stories rather than analyzing the situation of companies. 
 
Results showed us artificial intelligence and the robotic applications are the common Industry 4.0 applications. 
 
Results that are mentioned in Section 4 should not be generalized to all Turkish companies. The possibility of not 
covering all the industry 4.0 aspects in the reviewed companies is the main limitation of this study, so as future 
research, this study may be expanded with other techniques such as interviews and questionnaires which can be 
conducted to the reviewed companies.

Telemedicine is a technology that can make it easier for patients to interact with doctors through online media. The 
influence of the doctor on the patient in real life can occur physiologically at any time. Therefore, patients must choose 
a suitable doctor to communicate with to get the right and appropriate health services. Many previous studies have 
focused on patient-physician matching, but such technical implementations have not been carried out in much 
healthcare, especially the remote healthcare domain. Currently, the selection of doctors for telemedicine depends only 
on the available doctor information while the number of doctors there is not small, which causes patients difficulties 
in choosing a doctor. The recommendation system can be helpful in providing doctor recommendations. This study 
created software that can provide recommendations for matching doctor patients in telemedicine using a hybrid 
filtering method that combines two methods, namely the collaborative filtering method using rating parameters and 
the Content-based filtering method using the availability of content contained in the doctor's profile. The study was 
conducted on the get-well app. From the results of the calculation process that has been carried out, the content-based 
filtering method can recommend new doctors who have never treated patients and have no previous ratings, while 
collaborative filtering methods can recommend doctors who have a history and have had a rating from patients. After 
the implementation, we conducted a test of accuracy. The test was carried out using a confusion matrix with the 
accuracy results obtained, which was 91 %. In these results, the hybrid filtering method can help choose the right 
doctor according to the criteria and needs of the patient. For future research, it can use other parameters in providing 
recommendations, such as comments or likes and dislikes.

1. Introduction
It is difficult for Indonesians to get quality health services due to the uneven distribution of health workers and 
facilities. On the other hand, the ever-increasing development of technology provides many benefits in various fields, 
especially in the fields of communication and health. One of the uses of technology in the field of communication and 
health is the construction of telemedicine, which is a system that allows patients to communicate with doctors through 
online media (Haleem et al. 2021). By using this system, patients get the correct treatment from experts without having 
to visit hospitals or health centers so as to save costs and energy, considering that not all diseases require medical 
treatment. In telemedicine, a process of interaction between the patient and the doctor occurs. The influence of the 
doctor on the patient in real life can occur physiologically at any time, so the interaction between the patient and the 
doctor is considered important in the process of consultation and treatment. Accuracy in the selection of doctors can 
improve the quality of care and patient satisfaction with doctors, considering that the process of curing diseases is 
usually quite time-consuming, which allows for a lot of interaction between patients and doctors(Ju and Zhang 2021).

of the word available in the doctor's data. Content-based filtering methods can recommend new doctors who have 
never treated patients and do not have a previous rating. 
3.4 Confusion matrix 
The next stage is testing to determine the level of accuracy in the software that has been made. Tests were carried out 
using the Confusion Matrix. One study entitled ""A hybrid recommender system for e-learning based on context 
awareness and sequential pattern mining"" uses a Confusion matrix to determine the level of Accuracy, Precision, and 
recall of the e-learning recommendation system using 1200 student data in the study. Recall, Accuracy, and Precision 
are rated on a scale of 1-5. E-learning rated 1-3 is considered ""irrelevant,"" while those rated 4-5 are considered 
""relevant"" (Tarus, Niu, and Kalui 2018).  This study uses 100 test data with a ratio of 7: 3, where 70 data is 
recommended, and 30 data is not recommended. Calculation of Accuracy, Recall, and Precision is calculated based 
on the doctor's rating on a scale of 1-5. The predicted rating results given a rating of 1-3 are considered ""not 
recommended,"" while those given a rating of 4-5 are considered ""Recommended."" Figure 6 displays the results of the 
test data using a confusion matrix. 
Figure 6. Results of the test data using a confusion matrix 
The results of the test data are then used to calculate accuracy, Precision, and recall; the calculation results are shown 
in Table 11.  
Table 11. Evaluation result 
Recall 
91,4 % 
Precision 
95,5 % 
Accuracy 
91 % 
Based on the results of tests that have been carried out using the confusion matrix, it displays the results of Recall by 
91.4%, Precision by 95.5%, and accuracy by 91 %, so that the recommendation system for matching patients and 
doctors has good results and can be implemented into a recommendation system that can help patients in finding 
doctors who are suitable for their needs. 
4. Conclusion
Based on the results of this study, it is stated that the content-based filtering method can recommend new doctors who 
have never treated patients and did not have a previous rating, while the collaborative filtering method can recommend 
doctors who have a history and already have ratings from patients. After implementation, the next step is to test the 
accuracy. The test was carried out using a confusion matrix with an accuracy of 91%. In this result, the hybrid filtering 
method can help choose the right doctor according to the criteria and patient needs. For further research, other 
parameters can be used in providing recommendations, such as comments or likes and dislikes.

Abstract 
Gamification focuses on applying game mechanics to non-gaming contexts for audience participation and incorporates 
little fun from routine activities other than generating motivational and perceptual benefits. Businesses, schools, 
universities, and many other types of organizations have harnessed the potential of gamification. Digital health 
services also take advantage of emerging trends such as remote monitoring of the elderly during the COVID-19 
pandemic. As we read all this information, nothing is made especially for kids. This paper aims to apply gamification 
in COVID-19 learning and measure the increase in children's knowledge, especially from 6 to 8 years. We performed 
two measurements; The first is an internal context measurement to test whether the system follows the original design 
or not. The second is on students. Thirty-five students at several schools participated in the implementation and were 
surveyed using their automated activity logs and then conducted a seven-day monitoring survey. The results showed 
a significant increase in the total increase in the average score from the first experiment compared to the best 
experiment, namely 1.26 times in the corona jump, 2.00 times in the corona quiz, and 1.10 times in the corona 
labyrinth. On the other hand, we found a 28.57% decrease (10 of 35 children) in quitting the game. This condition 
proves that children need a lot of scenarios and content to enjoy the gamification process in the long term to achieve 
all abilities and need to take advantage of game mechanics skills and psychological effects.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has limited all activities worldwide, and the coronavirus's spread rate has rapidly increased 
(Benvenuto et al. 2020). It affects all areas of life, one of which is the field of education which is the focus of current 
research (Ariessanti et al., 2020). Nadiem Makarim, as a Minister of Culture and Education in Indonesia, conveyed to 
teaching staff, both teachers and lecturers, that teaching and learning activities can be done at home and utilize existing 
technology (Ariessanti et al. 2020). Using technology to help the learning process is Google Classroom and Microsoft 
Teams to help collect student assignments, class management, and communication between students and teachers 
(Shampa 2016). Technology also gives students much access to information and knowledge sharing, but it requires 
teachers to work on finding ways to increase student motivation and engagement (Shampa 2016). 
Teachers must be more innovative and more creative in carrying out learning, especially for students who are in 
elementary school, because it is considered the best period for children to learn their potential (Wu et al. 2019). 
Elementary school students are generation Z, or net generation, with different characteristics from the previous

4. Conclusion  
This study proposed implementing a gamification method to improve users' knowledge of COVID-19. Providing 
gamified software to our users of 6-8 years old was challenging, especially on how to create interest with, in the end, 
improving the knowledge. The results indicate that gamification can increase the involvement of participants who 
interact or engage in the game and encourage those who do not have previous knowledge of COVID-19. We created 
three types of gamifications on COVID-19 to define COVID-19, describing its behavior, its symptoms, and how to 
take preventive actions. The improvement recorded was significant, as it can go as high as 2.25 times on average on 
the game of the corona quiz and as low as 1.04 times on the set of corona labyrinth. The corona jump and corona 
labyrinth were less improved than the corona quiz since the two games need more motoric involvement than the latter. 
 
Consequent to its rapid development time, this gamification also had its limitation. After conducting A 7-day 
monitoring survey of 35 users (children who played the game), we found a 28.57% decrease (10 children), leaving 
only 25 children still playing the game. This condition proves that children need a massive variety of scenarios and 
content for them to be able to enjoy the gamification process in the long run.  For our gamification effort to reach its 
full potential, it is necessary to exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics on the 
children who will play the game. 
 
Acknowledgment 
We send our highest gratitude to all the students, parents, and teachers involved in this study, albeit with 
minimum engagement in discussions, testing, and evaluating the game due to the pandemic.

Abstract 
The impact of the Covid-19 virus cases continues to increase and impacts many lives, including young children. 
Schools are closed, and students are studying from home. Using online platforms is advantageous because it helps the 
teaching and learning process. Even though it is online learning, must be evaluated students' work. Similar research 
has occurred in vocational education but is considered boring and has not been standardized. This study combines 
gamified Software as a practical application among lower primary students to provide interesting evaluations on 
STEM learning, which is considered helpful for evaluation for many schools. We built the Software using a 6D 
framework with stages of development, starting from determining business goals and describing the target's behavior 
until deploying the Software. The evaluation period was carried out for 7 days using 30 respondents by analyzing Pre-
test Vs. Post-test and activity logs. The results individually showed significant improvements in science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics, with an average of more than 20% and 13%, respectively. Finally, through this study, 
we confirm that carefully designed gamified Software for lower primary school students has helped achieve non-
gaming-related goals and improved evaluation techniques for online learning.

1. Introduction
The Covid-19 pandemic that occurred at the beginning of 2020 in Indonesia continued to increase (Benvenuto et al. 
2020); in the circumstances that occurred at this time, there have been many efforts that the community can make to 
adapt and make lifestyle changes in the ongoing pandemic conditions (Mailizar et al. 2020). The pandemic has given 
new regulations in many countries, including Indonesia; school-from-home regulations have been implemented 
starting the first week of March 2020. The learning and teaching process is conducted online to avoid the broader 
spread of the Covid-19 virus (Mailizar et al., 2020). Such conditions make educators have to be creative in providing 
learning and teaching systems so that they can be accepted more easily and well by students (Alhammad, Software, 
and 2018 2018), especially for elementary school students. Teachers have used various online applications to help 
make it easier for teachers to teach and students to learn from home (Sari et al., 2020). Such as the google classroom 
application, which teachers use to make it easier to provide teaching materials, and assignments and manage classes 
online to make it easier for students to access them(Iftakhar 2016). There is a previous case study that teachers evaluate 
learning with students using platforms such as Quizziz (Bidarra, Figueiredo, and Natálio 2015) and Kahoot (Iwamoto 
et al. 2017), and Proprofs (Hanbidge, Sanderson, and Tin 2016). However, in previous studies, evaluations were 
carried out by teachers to find out how the progress, development, and success of students in following the learning 
process that had been determined had not been standardized, and most teachers did not know how the evaluation was

The results above show that the top-5 leaderboard shows that these players not only use the application once or twice 
a day but regularly play more than twice a day. This condition results in 3 of the five highest scores having a playing 
leveling and are ranked as the five best in the frequency of playing this application. We have proven other research 
that shows that more daily participation in gamified Software will increase the knowledge of most users (Buckley and 
Doyle 2016). An excellent gamified software design will most users' knowledge most users (Sardi, Idri, and 
Fernández-Alemán 2017). 
 
4. Conclusion 
We researched the effect of gamification on students' evaluation experience, which ultimately aimed to increase their 
knowledge, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We build gamified Software by 
carefully assessing what features should be included in the game to increase their motivation to evaluate learning, 
keep practicing achieving a better understanding of a subject, and raise the standard of grades in each school. The 
three objectives are broken down into features and measured quantitatively during the implementation phase. The 
results show that by adding gamification to the Software, we can achieve all the goals and increase user knowledge. 
The target audience is elementary school children who enjoy fun, motivation, and stimulation while doing their 
learning activities. The increase in knowledge individually and groups was quite significant, with an average of more 
than 20% and 13%, respectively. Lastly, choosing a suitable method for creating gamified Software. We chose the 6D 
framework developed by Werbach and Hunter, which carefully describes the stages and variables to consider in 
creating gamified Software.

Abstract 
The development of internet users in Indonesia has increased in recent years. The rapidly increasing internet users 
support e-commerce businesses and online shopping. Online shopping is a shopping activity carried out by 
consumers through media or intermediaries namely social networks that have been provided by sellers, both products 
in the form of goods and services. This study uses the Systematic Literature Review method. The study aims to find 
out there are differences in consumer decisions and consumer satisfaction in doing online and offline shopping. 
Consumer decisions in choosing online and offline shopping have no difference because they both have balanced 
advantages and disadvantages. This certainly comes back to consumer preferences in choosing online shopping or 
offline shopping. the level of consumer satisfaction in doing offline shopping is higher compared to online shopping. 
This is also based on the results of previous research as a literature review for our research.

1. Introduction
With the Covid-19 pandemic that hit the whole world in early 2020, people cannot and are afraid to get out of the 
house and forced them to do almost all their activities online, including shopping. The number of internet users 
in the world continues to experience rapid growth that has an impact on business activities through the internet, 
so it is known as e-commerce (Nuraini and Evianah, 2019). The online business movement that occurred in 
Indonesia began in 2010 which was marked by the existence of online transportation applications (Astuty, 
Winatha, and Putri, 2020). Along with the progress of the times let alone entering the industrial revolution 4.0, 
online shopping activities have developed very rapidly, so that shopping activities have become more practical 
and easier. People are more likely to be interested in doing shopping activities online because it can be done 
anywhere and anytime. Based on the results of research from Wardoyo and Intan Andini stated that the advantages 
of doing online shopping are that it can provide convenience, especially in making payments. This happens 
because when shopping online, the payment method that can be done is through ATM or mobile banking (Fauzi 
and Sicily, 2020).
Basically, online and offline shopping activities have something in common, namely both doing product purchase 
activities. However, the thing that distinguishes is from how to buy it. Online and offline shopping activities have 
their own advantages and disadvantages. This certainly comes back to consumer preferences (Nuraini and 
Evianah, 2019).

happen due to satisfactory service, quality products, and affordable prices. 
Based on the results of research from 2 literature related to the question consisting of a Comparative Study of 
Online-Based Consumer Satisfaction and Offline Shopping for Consumer Loyalty (Irene Vikining Astuty R, I. K., 
2020) and An Analysis of Differences in Consumer Satisfaction with Online and Offline Clothing Product 
Purchases (Dewi Nuraini, E., 2019) turned out to be Offline shopping can have a significant influence on consumer 
satisfaction. However, from the results of the study that consumer satisfaction in doing online and offline shopping 
has a difference where in the test results that the level of consumer satisfaction in offline shopping is higher 
compared to online shopping.
6. Conclusion
Online shopping or commonly referred to as e-commerce is a shopping activity carried out by consumers through 
media or intermediaries, namely social networks that have been provided by sellers, both products in the form of 
goods and services. Meanwhile, offline shopping is a shopping activity carried out by consumers directly without 
the presence of media or intermediaries and sellers can offer their products directly to consumers. 
Basically, consumer decisions in choosing online and offline shopping have no difference because they both have 
balanced advantages and disadvantages. This certainly comes back to consumer preferences in choosing online 
shopping or offline shopping. 
The results of our study also state that the level of consumer satisfaction in doing offline shopping is higher 
compared to online shopping. This is also based on the results of previous research as a literature review for our 
research.
7. Recommendations
Online and offline shopping have their advantages and disadvantages. This of course goes back to consumer 
preferences about where to shop online or offline. 
Consumers must be wise in determining their decision to do online or offline shopping. Consumers must also be 
careful and continue to seek information about products and services in doing online or offline shopping.
Services provided by sellers, both through online and offline have the same goal of providing consumer satisfaction. 
In addition, the role of digital needs to be increased again so that the level of online shopping satisfaction also 
increases.

Abstract 
The Indonesian government has committed to build a strong manufacturing industry with the launch of Making 
Indonesia 4.0 in April 2018 to increase productivity and to improve Indonesia's competitiveness globally. The priority 
industrial sectors such as automotive industry are expected to implement industry 4.0 technologies in their production, 
such as the internet of things (IoT), big data analytics and artificial intelligence. 
One implementation of Industry 4.0 solutions is predictive maintenance. There are two types of maintenance carried 
out in the manufacturing industry currently, namely corrective maintenance and preventive maintenance. Both types 
of maintenance have weaknesses, such as unpredicted machine breakdowns which causes production stop or unneeded 
replacement of machine spart parts which causes high maintenance cost. Therefore, it is necessary to apply predictive 
maintenance using sensor data that is analyzed by machine learning model. 
Bearing industry is one of important suppliers to priority industrial sectors. Ball bearing production with critical 
machines needs to implement predictive maintenance, to be competitive and to fulfill customer quality requirements. 
This research aims to determine which machine learning approach to be implemented in the ball bearing production. 
The chosen model will be developed based on machine condition data from sensors and product quality information.  
This research has focus on answering questions such as how machine learning models can ensure the manufacturing 
process to produce the product that meets quality standard. At the same time predictive maintenance is expected to 
reduce machine down time and maintenance cost compared to corrective and preventive maintenance.

Abstract 
P.T. Prima Sanitary is a private company located in Marunda, Bekasi City, producing portable washbins for public 
facilities. Activities carried out by the community during the COVID-19 pandemic require handwashing facilities 
provided in public places. This research begins with a market survey and conceptualization based on community 
needs. Based on the demand forecast with the quadratic method, P.T. Prima Sanitary will produce 6 units of product 
in a day with a selling price of Rp 3,550,000. To support product manufacturing, P.T. Prima Sanitary requires 25 
office employees and 25 factory workers. P.T. Prima Sanitary uses a systematic layout planning method in making 
the layout to ensure the most efficient possible material movement distance. After that, a business feasibility study 
was carried out, with an initial capital of Rp 2,383,189,000. Then P.T. Prima Sanitary took 3.21 years or sold 9798 
units of products to achieve a return on investment. Based on sensitivity analysis, it is not appropriate to run a business 
when the price of raw material costs increases by 40%, the cost of goods sold increases by 12%, and total revenue 
decreases by 10%.

1. Introduction
Daily activities of the community, especially interactions in public places, have the potential to become a means of 
transmitting COVID-19 (Aprilita et. al. 2021; Joes et.al. 2021). Therefore, the provision of handwashing facilities is 
one of the absolute conditions for opening public places. Even the DKI Jakarta provincial government has made it 
mandatory for seven sectors to provide handwashing facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic: households, schools, 
offices, health facilities, public places, places of worship, and modes of transportation. Facilities in the form of 
handwashing facilities currently available still use conventional water taps that must be touched by hands so that they 
can become a means of transmitting the virus. In addition, its unattractive shape makes it unsuitable to be placed in 
middle-class public places such as malls, hospitals, and schools. Therefore we propose a design of portable washbins 
for public facilities. This washbin can be used indoors or outdoors; easy to move, has minimal maintenance, and its 
minimalist shape makes it suitable to be placed in public places. Portable Washbin created by P.T. Prima Sanitary can 
be seen in Figure 1.

the cost of goods sold increases by 12%, and total revenue decreases by 10%.

Abstract 
Along the years, sustainability concept has been increasingly relevant to tackle the problem of fulfilling the growing 
human needs with limited resources. Aside from it, Circular Economy (CE) has also been recognized as one of the 
initiatives to achieve sustainability. As the two concepts expand, researches that bridge both concepts and develop 
assessment tools keep flourishing. In this context, this research aims to suggest a framework integrating Life Cycle 
Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) and Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) to produce an aggregate index reflecting 
all aspects of triple bottom lines and circularity. Moreover, this research intends to implement LCSA for circular 
business. Literature review was done to build the framework by combining a couple existing methods. Following it, 
a study case was conducted to implement the framework. The study case’s object was Company XYZ in Jakarta, a 
company leasing silicone containers as a substitute for single use plastic food takeaway packaging. The integrated 
framework produced single scores for the following aspects: environment (5.231), economy (0), social (0.534), and 
circularity (0.392). Through normalization and weighting, a final single score ranging from 0 (worst) to 1 (best) was 
constructed. Using this index, companies can attain easier communication and more straightforward comparison for 
all triple bottom lines and circularity, making it more convenient to design improvements. All things considered, the 
framework and index are more suitable for micro scale analysis due to its data intensiveness.

1. Introduction
As technology advances and human population grows, the human needs to be fulfilled also increases. On the other 
hand, Earth has a limit to sustain all those needs. According to Global Footprint Network (Lin et al., 2021), human 
needs 1.7 area of Earth to fulfill its needs in 2021. Earth Overshoot Day 2021 fell on July 29th, which on this very date 
human’s annual needs equal the Earth’s restore for one year. The reason why earth is so exhausted is because humans 
use too much resource too quickly. Humans also exploit nature, dispose a fully-functioning products, and produce 
many untreated wastes. It can be said the current society heavily adopts the linear economy, which follows the “take-
make-dispose” process (Lacy et al., 2020). Linear economy is deemed wasteful and also causes several environmental 
damages such as climate change, air and water pollution, erosion, and loss of biodiversity (Liu and Ramakrishna, 
2021).  
Realizing the importance to make a change and innovate to avoid further damage as well as maintaining the earth’s 
existence, numerous initiatives were done and new concepts emerged, including sustainability. Not only focusing on 
environmental well-being, being sustainable also considers economic and social well-being. These three pillars, better 
known as triple bottom line or 3P (people, planet, and profit) are connected and reinforce each other (Kuhlman & 
Farrington, 2010). Other emerging concept is circular economy (CE), the opposite of the unsustainable linear 
economy. Circular economy attempts to retain product’s value and use as high and as long as possible, as well as 
maintain resource’s purity and value (Stahel and McArthur, 2019). It aims to narrow, slow, close, and regenerate 
materials and energy flows of products and services (Konietzko et al., 2020). With its the advantages, CE is becoming 
an attractive and viable alternative to actualize sustainable development (Azevedo et al., 2017), making sustainability

5. Conclusion 
In this research, LCSA was implemented in circular business while adapting it to a more circular setting by integrating 
it with MCI, adjusting the LCA with material circularity, as well as replacing the conventional LCC that has not yet 
considered circular strategies with the CE-LCC. The assessment of the other two sustainability pillars, environment 
and social, was carried out using the standardized LCA ISO 14040 and S-LCA by UNEP/SETAC 2020 with the RS 
S-LCIA impact assessment method. Through data processing and analysis, four single scores from each assessment 
were obtained. In addition, these four scores were then normalized and weighted to generate a single aggregated score 
(final single score) that reflects the sustainability and circularity performance in the range of 0 (not sustainable and 
circular) to 1 (very sustainable and circular).  
 
The object of study case in this research is Company XYZ in Jakarta, Indonesia that leases silicone container as a 
substitute for single-use takeaway plastic container used by the partner merchants. Company XYZ mainly implement 
the reuse strategy in its business by picking up the silicone container after being used by customers to be washed and 
used again by another customers. According to the conducted LCA, Company XYZ scored 5.231 point in 
environmental aspect (ReCiPe single score). CE-LCC calculation showed a total cost of IDR1,594,310.60 per 
container during its assumed 3 years lifespan. On the other hand, Company XYZ scored 0.534 on social assessment 
and 0.392 in circularity assessment done with MCI. Through normalization and weighting, each aspect’s score was 
normalized to: 0.025 for environment aspect, 0 for economic aspect, 0.534 for social aspect, and 0.392 for circularity. 
The final single score of 0.231 was also acquired, which means that Company XYZ still relatively far from being 
sustainable. This is due to the fact that Company XYZ has just been established, meaning that Company XYZ is still 
at its very early stage and has a huge room for improvements, either in increasing the number of customers or partner 
merchants across Jakarta or even Indonesia.  
 
There are some limitations occurred in this research that might be considered for improvements of upcoming 
researches. The first limitation is related to the availability of environmental impact database and threshold, which in 
this research is needed during the normalization step. The second limitation is related to study case’s object’s scale 
and industry. This LCSA and aggregate indicator are more suitable for micro-scale analysis due to the data 
intensiveness and relatively time consuming. It is also more preferable to have a manufacturing industry as the study 
case object rather than a service industry because the assessment frameworks under LCSA are mostly more suitable 
for manufacturing industry. Other suggestions are compiling preceding LCA results and building a database to 
simplify impact comparison and compliance, also polishing the normalization and weighting method (for environment 
and economic aspect which have no constant threshold) to be easier and more straightforward.

1. Introduction
Covid-19 pandemic entered Indonesia on March 2, 2020. This situation has an impact on the entire life structure of 
the Indonesian people, one of which is the manufacturing industry sector. Many manufacturing companies experienced 
a decline in demand and production. Not a few companies have laid off their employees during this pandemic(Ropidin, 
2020). 
As the pandemic period begins to subside, the order of life, business, and including in the manufacturing industry 
is no longer the same as it was before the pandemic. All sectors have new challenges in the context of the new 
normal(Blessings)et al., 2020). According to the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia, the manufacturing 
industry in Indonesia also needs to make efforts to recover and face challenges in the new normal era. The recovery 
of the manufacturing industry sector needs to be balanced with better production processes to welcome the new 
competitive market era. Every company needs to prepare for market competition in the new normal era, where global

of each department is to update the master production schedule. In addition, the company needs to develop a 
production and control SOP that integrates the three departments to prevent problems arising from the three 
departments in the future.

Abstract 
In determining the right pattern to increase entrepreneurial skills in the field of ideas generation. There is a stimulus 
that is used to inspire business students in the business guidance process. This study aims to understand whether news 
about entrepreneurial success stories can inspire or not. This study uses a qualitative approach, by collecting data from 
open-ended questions from 97 students who have a business at a university in Bandung, Indonesia. Data is processed 
and analyzed using qualitative data analysis software. The results showed that 2/3 of the respondents admitted that 
they were inspired to develop the targets to be achieved, try, cultivate, and understand the workings of the people in 
the story. Then respondents who feel uninspired because they run their own business, are inspired by their families, 
and get inspiration directly from the market. This research is useful for business assistants to understand the inspiration 
patterns obtained by students in processing ideas. Then, this research is useful for developing patterns of strengthening 
entrepreneurial skills for students in terms of improving the quality of entrepreneurship education during a pandemic 
era.

Abstract 
In the entrepreneurship education process, the ideation process is the first step for business owners to find, process, 
and validate their ideas. However, often the process does not run smoothly because there are still obstacles that make 
it difficult for this business owner to explore ideas and find new potentials in his business. This study aims to determine 
the obstacles faced by business owners to find ideas. The study was conducted on 68 students who have MSMEs 
businesses through open-ended survey questions which were processed using qualitative data analysis software. The 
results of the study indicate that there are influencing factors such as courage and lack of motivation, ideas already 
running, time division problems, and the process of realizing ideas. This research is useful for business mentors and 
coaches to find out the patterns that occur in business owners. So that they can provide solutions according to their 
needs, such as providing a model or stimulus so that ideas can flow and also reduce the obstacles faced so far.

Abstract 
Creative tools are used to help someone get better ideas in the idea’s generation process. Currently, many creative 
tools are used by creative people. This study aims to understand how the habits of using creative tools by MSME 
entrepreneurs with different business backgrounds are. This research was conducted on 87 young entrepreneurs in the 
MSMEs category through a survey of open-ended questions. Research shows that design thinking, brainstorming, 
scampering, and other support tools can help these entrepreneurs be more creative in running their businesses. The 
benefit of this research is to provide an overview of creative tools patterns that are often used by early-stage 
entrepreneurs in the current pandemic era. In addition, in terms of entrepreneurship education, creative tools are an 
important key in increasing the entrepreneurial skills of an entrepreneur.

Abstract 
In supporting the entrepreneurial ecosystem, skill improvement can be done by providing support that can increase 
ideation capabilities and can help quickly increase the number of ideas obtained through an effective medium. 
Understanding the behaviour of tenants who are undergoing programs at the Business Incubator is needed in order to 
provide targeted stimuli. This study aims to understand what medium is used and make it easier for early-stage 
entrepreneurs to get ideas. The research was conducted on 87 young entrepreneurs through a survey of open-ended 
questions. The data is processed by qualitative analysis. The findings show that video dominates as the medium that 
makes it easier for respondents to get ideas, followed by images, social media experience, and audio and text which 
have less influence. This research is useful for business incubator managers to provide insights and inspiration so that 
tenants can be facilitated in finding, processing, and realizing their ideas. This research also provides additional 
knowledge in improving entrepreneurial skills.

Abstract 
In the journey of finding and processing ideas, there are many factors that can influence inspiration, the growth of 
ideas, and how the process of making them happen. Different ways are needed to provide a stimulus for the birth of 
new ideas. This study aims to understand the pattern that occurs, whether a character can provide new ideas in the 
ideas generation process. By collecting data from 87 students who run businesses on the MSMEs scale. Open-ended 
survey data were analysed using qualitative data analysis software. This study shows the influence of the character 
followed by the entrepreneur. This study also shows that there are patterns that form a model, about how business 
owners view idol figures and what they get to carry out the idea’s generation process. Such as whether there is 
influence from figures, then big business figures and celebrities, as well as other supporting factors. This research is 
useful for business assistants, to be able to provide inspiration through the models contained in this study, to facilitate 
giving to business owners effectively and efficiently. This research also contributes to the development of 
entrepreneurial skills, especially in ideas generation in entrepreneurship education.

Abstract 
A transmission belt manufacturer in Indonesia, producing v-belts and conveyor belts. Many faults remain in the conveyor belt 
manufacturing process, causing product quality to deteriorate. Bubbles in the canvas cover are responsible for more than half 
of all faults. As a result, a quality control process is required to ensure that the finished product meets consumer expectations. 
The percentage of defective goods in total production and the percentage of the main contributors to defects are determined 
using P control chart approach and Pareto diagram. Fishbone diagrams are used to investigate the sources of faults and 
prioritize the adjustments that need to be done. The findings revealed that faults in conveyor production are caused by human 
factors, machinery, and techniques. This study proposes that quality control be used to improve the quality of conveyor 
products by identifying the major contributors to defects and their causes.

1. Introduction
The appropriateness of a product or service to the specifications of a customer's needs is defined as quality (Hartini 2012). 
Quality control is a closely associated activity to the manufacturing process, in which the product's quality features are 
examined and tested to ensure that they satisfy the needed specification criteria (Susetyo et al. 2011). According to (Kotler 
2004), customer satisfaction is a person's experience of joy or disappointment because of comparing his perceptions or 
impressions of a product's performance or results to his expectations. 
A largest transmission belt company in Indonesia, one of its products is conveyor belts (Halepoto et al 2016). There are still 
inconsistencies between the items produced and consumer specifications in the manufacturing process (Sanchez et al. 2020). 
As consumer demands grow, the conveyor belt division will be required to manufacture excellent products (Weihe et al. 
2021). A method, which is a process used to monitor standards, measure, and take corrective action while a product or service 
is being produced, is one way that can be used to carry out quality control (Heizer and Render 2006). Statistical Process 
Control (SPC) is an effective technique for improving the quality of products and services over time (Jiju Antony 2000). This 
strategy has a number of advantages, including decreasing wasted energy and expenses, improving procedures for the best 
output, and enhancing product quality to reduce customer complaints (Antony 2000). As a result, a quality control procedure 
will be carried out in this study utilizing SPC approach to control the conveyor production process and provide customer 
satisfaction. 
2. Methods
Research and data collection are in a transmission belt company. The time of the research was carried out from August 1-
August 31, 2019. Primary data collection was carried out by direct observation and interviews, then for secondary data using 
data obtained from the company in the form of the number of production and conveyor defects that occurred for seven months 
last (Rucitra and Amelia 2021). The data obtained is then processed using Minitab Software (Masir et al. 2021). The 
techniques used in analyzing the data are check sheets, Pareto diagrams, and SPC (Statistical Quality Control) analysis with 
P control charts, Fishbone Diagrams, and proposed improvements using the 5W+1H technique (Manojkumar and Kumar 
2021).

3.5 Repair Solution Analysis 
1. Man 
The first factor is that when conducting field observations on the curing machine, the operator does not pierce the 
green belt at the available puncture site. This can happen because the operator stabs the green belt when the position 
is hanging so that the stabbing process cannot be maximized and allows the results of the puncture to only reach the 
surface of the green belt. Therefore, to overcome this, the recommendation that can be made is to make an SOP to 
stab the green belt in place. In addition, the supervisor's role is also needed as a party which reminds if the operator 
does not stab at the provided place. For the second human factor, the operator must pierce the green belt one by one 
continuously. Of course, this will cause the operator to tire easily. To overcome this, the recommendation that can be 
done is to redesign the tool by increasing the number of puncture ends. 
 
2. Machine 
One of the causes of bubbles in the canvas cover is the operator being unable to puncture the thick conveyor belt until 
it penetrates to the bottom. The thing that causes this to happen is that the tool used is unable to penetrate the conveyor 
belt because it is not sharp enough. Therefore, maintenance of the stabbing device is one solution that can reduce the 
bubbles of the canvas cover on the conveyor belt. Tool maintenance that can be done is to sharpen the awl regularly. 
Based on the results of interviews with operators, the maintenance of the awl is carried out only when the tool looks 
bent or blunt, without carrying out routine maintenance of the tool. Therefore, it is necessary to sharpen the tool 
regularly once a week because when the awl is maintained sharp, it will help the operator to be able to penetrate the 
thick conveyor belt. 
 
3. Method 
Based on field observations, the operator performs stabbing with erratic distances between holes. The operator does 
not puncture tightly and evenly so that there is still air space between the cover and the canvas. If the air space between 
the cover and the canvas is not punctured, it will cause bubbles for the canvas cover when the cooking process is 
complete in the curing machine. Therefore, to overcome this, the way is to increase the number of stabs ends with a 
distance between the stab ends of approximately 2 cm to minimize the air trapped in the space between the canvas 
covers and also tighten the green belt stabbing which is not only at the beginning and at the end. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Chart p shows that the conveyor production process in the curing machine is out of control for the proportion between 
the number of defects and the amount of production, based on the results of data processing using a control. There 
were eight types of flaws in the conveyor belt production process in the curing machine from January to July 2019, 
namely: bare (A), bubble Canvas-Canvas (B), Bubble Cover – Cover, and Bubble Cover – Cover (C). Canvas (G), 
Marking Defect (M), Porosity (S), Ply Embossed on Cover Surface (R), and Foreign Body Defect are all examples of 
bubble covers (X). The bubble cover canvas is the most prevalent sort of product defect. The Fishbone Diagram and 
the 5 M methodology are used in product defect analysis to examine the factors that cause the most problems by 
examining five elements: person, machine, method, material, and environment. However, only human, machine, and 
method elements are important to this challenge. Improvement suggestions can be made, for example, in terms of 
human factors, such as giving instructions to maintain stabbing the green belt on the provided base so that the green 
belt can be punctured optimally. It is standard procedure to do maintenance on the machine or tool factor, such as 
sharpening the awl once a week in order to pierce the green belt. The procedure entails increasing the number of 
punctures while maintaining a 2 cm spacing between them and flattening the punctures to reduce the amount of air 
trapped in the conveyor belt.

Abstract 
Personal hygiene is crucial for each human being as they have their way of maintaining them daily. While one person 
can maintain their hygiene, they are still prone to diseases that others can spread. Performing daily hygiene is mostly 
about habit. Habit is a settled or regular tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up. To change from 
one habit to another, we need a constant reminder. The development of information technology provides a more 
convenient way to do reminder activities. Apps such as Habit Tracker, Sure Wash, and Epic To-Do List are available 
freely in Google Play Store and Apple AppStore. Although many gamified reminder applications exist, most of them 
only work on one individual. While for daily hygiene, the problem is not only the individual habits but also the society. 
This study improved the awareness of personal hygiene by building gamification software. We use the Octa lysis 
framework to analyze and design the software, using three levels: data collection, calculation, and analysis from 47 
respondents using the Octa lysis 8 core drive measurement. The evaluation period was carried out for 14 days using 
30 respondents by analyzing Pre-test Vs. Post-test using HMSAM. Finally, this study showed a significant increase 
in changes in daily personal hygiene with an average of 82%, which concluded that a mobile application equipped 
with a reminder feature for particular groups could trigger other people to do the same.

1. Introduction
Personal hygiene is crucial for each human being as they have their way of maintaining them daily (Delea et al. 2020). 
It is an action to maintain the cleanliness and health of a person for his welfare, both physical and psychological. 
Personal hygiene includes hygiene and health of the skin, feet, hands, nails, teeth, mouth, hair, eyes, ears, and nose, 
or we can say that it is an effort to maintain the cleanliness of the body from head to toe (Desai and Goel 2018). 
Several steps can be taken in carrying out personal care, such as proper hand washing, which is an action that is highly 
recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Lack of adherence to the most relevant personal 
recommendations, namely hand hygiene, to avoid several infectious diseases (Tariq et al. 2020). Diseases coming 
from a lack of personal hygiene still hold imminent threats to society. For instance, despite remarkable progress over 
the past few years, the diarrheal disease remains the leading cause of death in children worldwide. Every year, young 
people aged 60 months who get diarrhea have caused 700,000 deaths (Fischer Walker et al. 2013). All this is mainly 
because of one individual's inability to maintain daily hygiene.

The total percentage yield of all calculated scales is 82.07%. The highest group result is perceived usefulness using a 
scale of 81%, with the lowest group measurement result being 77.31%. The score for how deeply someone is carried 
away (immersion) is 81.22%, and what affects the desire to use continuously (behavioral intention to use) is 81.43%. 
If interpreted from the measurement of the scale, the group agrees that they want to use it in the future. These results 
also show that daily personal hygiene gamification can positively impact changes in health behavior. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We researched gamification's effect on users' daily personal hygiene, especially in a community, which ultimately saw 
the impact of using this software. We make daily hygiene gamified software carefully incorporating what game 
elements are included in a game to increase their motivation to do daily personal hygiene and keep practicing 
maintaining better daily personal hygiene. The results show that by adding gamified elements into the non-gamified 
context in the software, we can achieve all the goals set and which ultimately have an impact or impact on the daily 
personal hygiene of a person in a group. Target users aged 15 – 65 who can engage in fun daily personal hygiene 
activities while doing them. The increase in daily personal hygiene, individually and in groups, was quite significant, 
with an average of almost 82%, and concluded that a mobile application with a reminder feature for groups could 
trigger other people to do the same. Group discussions have a positive impact on bringing users to a better 
understanding of daily personal hygiene. Lastly, choosing the correct method for creating gamified software daily 
hygiene is also very important. This study chose the Octalysis framework developed by Yu-kai–Chou, which divides 
several game elements into eight core drives that must be considered when creating gamified software.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an impact on the global retail industry. Some studies have investigated e-
commerce during the pandemic. However, most of them focused on consumer behavior in online shopping. This paper 
focuses on e-commerce firms, as an aggregate, among regions.   This study departs from a question: what we can learn 
from the e-commerce firms in regions during the pandemic. The objectives of this study are: (1) to classify the intensity 
of e-commerce firms in a region and to specify the regional and e-commerce profiles, (2) to classify the intensity of 
pandemic impact on e-commerce firms and to specify the regional and e-commerce profiles, and (3) to specify the 
observed association between the characteristics of e-commerce, pandemic impact, and region profiles of e-commerce 
firms with high intensity and high pandemic impact. This quantitative and secondary research collected data from the 
Indonesian official statistics and Google mobility report. Data mining was implemented with the Knime Analytics 
Platform. The analysis classifies provinces with high and low e-commerce intensity and high and low pandemic impact 
and specifies the regional and e-commerce profiles regarding those classifications. This article contributes to the 
literature by presenting data mining using the official statistics among regions at a country level on e-commerce during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. More facilitation for regions with low e-commerce intensity is suggested. For example, 
local governments and marketplace companies could support firms entering online sales channels.

1. Introduction
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the retail industry was apparent globally. The governments' lockdown, 
social distancing, and movement control policies have been implemented in most countries. As a result, reduced 
people's mobility was detected, for example, in Japan, Hongkong, Singapore, and Australia (Hakim et al., 2021), 
Malaysia (Aziz et al., 2020), and Indonesia (Djalante et al., 2020). Those studies indicated the effectiveness of the 
government's movement control policy (Mendolia et al., 2021). As people's mobility was restricted, conventional or 
brick-and-mortar retailers experienced declined sales transactions. Many retail outlets closed their business because 
of high fixed costs incurred, and sales dropped.  
For online retailers or e-commerce firms, the COVID-19 pandemic impact might come to two conditions. First, fewer 
people's (consumers) mobility could reduce the goods to buy and shrink the online sales transaction. Second, the 
pandemic might shift the way consumers shop from visiting retail outlets to online shopping. Therefore, some e-
commerce firms could suffer a sales decline, and others enjoy increased sales. For example, the Indonesian National 
Statistics (BPS) reported that e-commerce firms, at the country level, experienced three conditions: a transaction 
volume decline (72%), an increased (10%), and the same (18%) (BPS, 2021). The numbers denote that most firms 
experience the negative impact of the pandemic.  
Several studies have investigated e-commerce during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of them focused on 
consumer behavior in online shopping, such as in Indonesia (Iriani & Andjarwati, 2020), Saudi Arabia (Albliwi & 
Alsolami, 2021), Poland (Wiscicka-Fernando, 2021), and Finland (Eriksson & Stenius, 2021). Other studies proposed 
retail-related technologies for facing the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond (Har et al., 2022; Shankar et al., 2021). 
The analysis in this paper focuses on e-commerce firms in Indonesian provinces. Electronic commerce (e-commerce) 
refers to a business model that allows companies and individuals to buy and sell goods and services over the Internet.

The growth of e-commerce in Indonesia was attributed to a few big marketplaces such as Tokopedia, BliBli, 
Bukalapak, Lazada, and Shopee. Those e-commerce firms use social media less as a sales channel than those with less 
e-commerce intensity. Social media as a sales channel is a Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) business model in which 
transaction such as payment is set up between seller and buyer. The use of social media as a sales channel is less 
advanced than in a marketplace. Fashion is the second highest product category sold after food-and-beverages in all 
provinces. Those firms with less e-commerce intensity focus more on fashion products. In contrast, those with high e-
commerce intensity sell more product variety to serve the customer demand.   
  
Higher mobility decline in the retail area relates to the decreasing sales volume of e-commerce firms. The restriction 
on people's activities has reduced the demand for products. When the pandemic ends, and the economy recovers, those 
e-commerce firms will likely increase transactions. Furthermore, the pandemic impact was experienced by e-
commerce firms in any province and was not associated with regional and e-commerce profiles. Furthermore, 
provinces with high e-commerce intensity and experiencing high pandemic impact have similar characteristics as 
provinces with high e-commerce intensity, as discussed earlier.   
 
5. Conclusion   
This study has implemented a data mining approach for official statistics about e-commerce firms among Indonesia 
provinces during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis reveals that a region with high e-commerce intensity has a 
high population density and inhabitants with IT skills. Those e-commerce firms use the marketplace more than low e-
commerce intensity as a sales channel. Furthermore, the finding shows the pandemic impact of e-commerce firms in 
all provinces regardless of regional and e-commerce profiles.   
  
This article adds to the literature by presenting data mining using the official statistics among regions at a country 
level on the topic of e-commerce during the pandemic. Furthermore, the data-driven analysis implemented in this 
study reveals an empirical association between variables based on the available secondary data. However, the 
generalization of the finding is limited to e-commerce firms in Indonesian provinces. Further study in other countries 
could generalize the finding. In addition, as the unit of analysis is e-commerce firms as an aggregate number in a 
region, the behavior of any single firm responding to the pandemic could not be identified.   
 
Motivated by the economic impact of e-commerce activities, this study suggests more facilitation for regions with low 
e-commerce intensity. For example, local governments and marketplace companies could support MSMEs entering 
online sales channels through training about e-commerce, product quality, production process, and management. In 
addition, the improvement in Internet access and ICT skills among residents, as this study found, could become a 
priority program for the local governments.

Abstract 
Masin is a Sumbawa sauce made from fermented rebon shrimp. That has several shortcomings, such as non-uniform 
time for masin fermentation. Therefore, the design of FERMAS-KECE, a masin fermenter equipped with a 
temperature control system, is carried out to optimize the fermentation process. This study aims to determine the 
thermal distribution controlled by the heater position and velocity of the fan using the computational fluid dynamic 
(CFD) method with Ansys software. CFD simulation is done on Ansys 2022 R2 student version. The variables studied 
were fan speed variables 2m/s, 1,5m/s, and 1m/s. Variable heater position one (bottom), position two (middle), and 
position three (upper and lower) are the heater position on the Fermenter. The simulation results of the heat distribution 
with fan speed 2m/s at positions one, two, and three, namely 331,5K, 332,7K, and 332,2K, thermal distribution with 
fan speed 1.5m/s at positions one, two, and three are 329,6K, 330,5K, and 330,2K. Thermal distribution with fan speed 
1m/s at positions one, two, and three are 326,3K, 326,9K, and 326,7K. The simulation results show that the CFD 
simulation's thermal distribution at position two with a fan speed of 2 m/s is 332,7K and has uniform color thermal 
distribution contours. We hope that the placement of the heater and fan speed on the Fermenter can optimize the masin 
fermentation process.

1. Introduction
Masin is a typical food of the Empang sub-district, Sumbawa, as a fermented reborn shrimp product. Until now, the 
masin fermentation process is still traditionally done with a spontaneous fermentation process, namely bacteria whose 
role is stimulated in its development by adding organic acids and salt in conditions without air (Ramzi, 2016). In a 
process like this, it can result in the total and group of bacteria that play an active role in the manufacture of various 
types of salt, so the results obtained are not uniform. They have poor quality (Capozzi et al., 2017). Therefore, to 
reduce the problem of the masin fermentation process, a tool is used to carry out the fermentation process, namely a 
fermenter. Where in this tool, there are components to support the fermentation process. 
A previous study (Rohman et al., 2021) made a masin fermenter using a heater in the form of six 10-watt incandescent 
lamps (actuators) with AC power and a fermenter capacity of 18 liters, which is relatively small in size and due to 
much interest in salt. So to increase salt production, the FERMAS-KECE (intelligent control salted fermenter) was 
developed. FERMAS-KECE (intelligent control salted fermenter) is a masin fermenter that uses a batch system,

Airspeed stream 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9 Position 1 vs. Position 2 vs. Position 3 
 
In position 1, based on the streamlined airflow, it shows that the airflow only focuses on the lower room of the 
Fermenter room, only a small amount of air flows upwards, which causes an uneven distribution of heat between the 
lower and upper Fermenter rooms. This applies to all variable speed fan positions 1 speed, 2 m/s, 1.5 m/s, and 1 m/s. 
 
In position 2, based on the streamlined airflow, it shows that the airflow spreads up and down the Fermenter room so 
that the heat distribution does not focus on one point only. This applies to all variable speed fan positions 2 speeds of 
2 m/s, 1.5 m/s, and 1 m/s. 
 
In position 3, based on the streamlined airflow, it shows the airflow in heaters 1 (heater below) and 2 (heater above) 
focusing on each track so that there are parts that are not evenly distributed in heat in the fermenter room. on heater 1 
(heater below), it only focuses on the bottom of the fermenter room so that the airflow that flows at the top of the 
fermenter room is small, but this can be overcome by placing heater 2 (above). 
 
5. Conclusion  
After the simulation has been carried out in the Fermenter room, the heat distribution values in the fermenter room 
position 1 are at a speed of 2 m/s, 1.5 m/s, and 1 m/s, which are 331.5K, 329.6K, and 326, respectively. 3K and 
fermentation tank temperatures of 315.4K, 313.5K, and 311.4K. At position 2, the speeds of 2 m/s, 1.5 m/s, and 1 m/s 
are 332.7K, 330.5K, and 326.9K, and the fermentation tank's temperature is 317.8K, 315.6K, and 312.8K. And in 
position 3, the speeds are 2 m/s, 1.5 m/s, and 1 m/s, which are 332.2K, 330.2K, and 326.7K, and the temperature of 
the fermentation tank is 315.9K, 313.9K. , and 311.4K. based on the simulation results, it can be concluded that the 
faster the air velocity, the higher the temperature produced and the less low temperatures in the room and fermentation 
tank of the Fermenter. After comparing the three position variable simulations, it is found that position 2 has a speed 
of 2 m/s, whose heat distribution is almost evenly distributed throughout the Fermenter's fermentation tank.

Abstract 
Masin is a typical Sumbawa, Indonesia sauce made from tiny shrimp. A closed fermentation process makes Masin 
for seven to fourteen days. This research aims to increase the productivity of making masin by optimizing the 
fermentation process by maintaining the fermentation temperature at the optimal temperature using a fuzzy logic 
control system. The masin fermenter is in the form of a cube of 640 mm X 640 mm X 550 mm and a fermentation 
container with a diameter of 380 mm and a height of 440 mm equipped with a heater and Arduino, with the setting 
point of the fermenter is 37ºC. Furthermore, product quality tests were carried out on the third, fifth, seventh, ninth, 
twelfth and fourteenth days, with an organoleptic test, bacterial count, protein, fat, fiber, and carbohydrate content. 
Then the fermentation results with the fermenter were compared with normal fermentation. The organoleptic test 
result is that using a fermentor for 12 days is the most preferred by participants in terms of color, aroma and texture, 
while for taste, they prefer samples of a 9-days fermenter. The highest growth of lactic acid bacteria was found in 
the 7-day fermenter, which was 3.3 X 10⁷. The highest protein content was found in the 5-day fermenter sample, 
which was 12.21%, the highest fat content was found in 3 days of normal fermentation, 23.15%,  the highest fiber 
content was found in the 3-day standard fermentation sample, 26.12%, and the highest carbohydrate content was 
found in the 7-day fermenter was 11.32%.

1. Introduction
Masin is a traditional sauce from Sumbawa, a type of chili sauce that is a fermented product of tiny fresh shrimp 
with added salt (NaCl) and tamarind (Asmawati et al., 2020). Making masin is traditionally done by mixing all the 
masin ingredients, storing it in a closed container, and then fermenting it at room temperature for 3 to 7 days 
(Ramzi, 2016). As with other fermented products, this can lead to unstable and non-uniform product quality. 
Traditional masin-making has several problems: production is not optimal due to long fermentation time, less sterile 
masin-making space and unequal masin quality. Previous research has developed a bioreactor or fermenter for the 
masin fermentation based on an ON-OFF control system. Temperature control in fermenters generally uses an ON-
OFF control system. However, several researchers have developed fermenters with a P.I.D. control system (Rohman 
et al., 2021). The ON-OFF control system will provide a temperature profile constantly changing around the set 
point. In contrast, the conventional P.I.D. control system will provide a system response. However, a precise 
mathematical model of the system is required for its design. In addition to conventional control systems, intelligent 
control systems also have the potential to be applied to temperature control in masin fermenters. The advantages of

26.12%. The highest percentage of carbohydrate content was found in the 7th day masin fermenter sample, which 
was 11.32%.(Figures 10 – 13). 
6. Conclusion
Based on the design, testing, analysis and discussion that have been carried out in this study, the following 
conclusions can be drawn: 
The measurement of the fermentation process using the ON-OFF control mode shows a steady state error above the 
set point, while the fuzzy logic control mode shows a lower steady-state error than the ON-OFF control system in 
previous studies. The results of the organoleptic test using a fermenter for 12 days were most favored by participants 
in terms of color, aroma and texture, while for the taste, they preferred a 9-day fermenter sample. The highest 
growth of lactic acid bacteria was found in the 7-day fermenter, which was 3.3 X 10⁷. The highest protein content 
was found in the 5-day fermenter sample, namely 12.21%, the highest fat content was found in the 3-day normal 
fermentation sample, 23.15%, the highest fiber content was found in the 3-day standard fermentation sample, 
26.12%, and carbohydrate content. The highest was found in the 7-day fermenter, namely 11.32%

Abstract 
The NgebUTS electric bike is one of the vehicles developed by the Sumbawa University of Technology that makes 
this bike one of the innovations in providing environmentally friendly transportation facilities. Riding the NgebUTS 
NTB 1 electric bike for an extended period can cause health problems such as Low Back Pain. This study aims to 
obtain a good evaluation and recommendation for riding an electric bike NTB 1 and a design for an NTB 1 racing 
electric bike that is more comfortable and safe. The NgebUTS NTB 1 electric bike development uses a Universal 
Design approach, an analysis of riding posture using the REBA method, and a strength test on the Frame using a 
simulation finite element method. As for the results of cycling posture analysis, lower cycling postures are better in 
the form of an angle body recommendation for the neck, torso, upper arm, forearm, and foot are 0°, 0°, 20°, 94 °, and 
70°. These are obtained from changes in a bike frame by shortening the size of the bike and modifications to the 
handlebars by increasing that size. The test results on a bike frame with finite element analysis obtained a displacement 
value of 0.087 mm and a safety factor value of 4.157 ul, which means the mainframe prototype design is solid and 
safe to use. With the development of the NgebUTS NTB 1 electric bike, it is hoped that bike users can feel comfortable 
and secure, reducing the injury risk.

1. Introduction
Transportation is an effort to transport and carry goods from one place to another (Tseng et al., 2005). Transportation 
progress shows increased speed, loading capacity, and a transportation infrastructure network that can reach all parts 
of the region and between regions (Childress et al., 2015). In addition, the increased mobility of people and goods 
positively contributes to regional development. However, the increasing number of motorized vehicles used by the 
community produces exhaust gases which cause increased air pollution. Therefore, several countries have begun to 
switch to environmentally friendly human-powered transportation modes called bikes (Suhardi et al., 2015; 
Priadythama et al., 2016). 
Sumbawa University of Technology (UTS) is one of the universities in Central Indonesia, especially in West Nusa 
Tenggara Province, which is currently developing environmentally friendly bikes. Through a campus-owned business 
entity and in collaboration with small industries (IKM), UTS has succeeded in developing an electric bike called 
NgebUTS. This NTB 1 electric bike has several types, one of which is the NTB 1 electric bike which can be seen in 
Figure 1. NTB 1 is a male electric bike with a battery capacity of 48V/16Ah and can be used for up to 30 km without 
using the pedals. The maximum distance can reach 50-60 km if pedals are used.

Based on the picture Figure 12 above, it can be seen that the position of the rider using the electric bike design is safer 
than the position of the rider using the NgebUTS NTB electric bike 1. This can be seen in the results of calculations 
using the calculations in the final REBA table, the final score using the proposed bicycle is 2 and the initial REBA 
value is 5. 
 
 
 
Figure 13. REBA Value Comparison 
 
Based on the picture Figure 13 above, it can be seen that there is a decrease in the risk of injury based on overall body 
posture using REBA. The risk reduction is from a work posture that has a moderate risk and needs to be corrected 
immediately (score 5) to a cycling posture that has a low risk (score 2), so it can make the bike safe to ride. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The potential for injury to an electric cyclist in West Nusa Tenggara 1 was obtained from an analysis of the cyclist's 
posture using the REBA table, so the final score for the activity of using a bike was 5 which the REBA score indicates 
that has a medium risk, it needs to be investigated further and changes immediately. bike development is done to get 
a safe and comfortable design. development of the NgebUTS NTB 1 bike design in the form of saddles, handlebars, 
bike frames that are safer and more comfortable when used. Safe can be seen from the value of the safety factor and 
displacement. A comfortable bike judging by the REBA value. From the results of calculating the working posture of 
cyclists using the REBA table, the final score for the proposed bike activity is 2 which has low risk and changes may 
need to be needed. where the value means the posture is acceptable and safe to ride. It is hoped that with the 
development of the NgebUTS NTB 1 electric bike, bike users can feel comfortable and safe while driving and the risk 
of injury can be reduced.

Abstract 
Masin is a kind of sambal typical of Sumbawa Indonesia in the form of fermented rebon shrimp with the addition of 
salt and acid. A traditional Masin making is still done manually with the wrong work posture and is done repeatedly 
and risks causing pain to workers. This study aimed to evaluate the Masin maker's working posture using REBA and 
design a Masin maker consisting of a fermenter and a Masin work table for grinding and mixing using Kansei 
engineering and value engineering. The Masin maker design is based on the wishes and needs of the user while 
considering the added value of the tool and the costs incurred. From the 20 pairs of Kansei words created, 15 pairs 
of Kansei words were obtained representing the users' wishes and needs, which were then used as information phase 
on the value engineering method. The results of Reba show a score of 9 which means that the work is a high risk, so 
improvements need to be made. From Reba and Kansei's engineering results, a Masin maker was designed using 
value engineering to optimize Masin fermentation and a work table that can improve the user's work posture. The 
research showed that the Masin maker is luxurious, colorful, beautiful, elegant, modern, thick, heavy, easy to clean, 
large capacity, safe, comfortable, dynamic, uncomplicated, robust and cheap. This research is expected to provide a 
Masin maker that can minimize the risk of work-related illness and optimize the making of Masin.

1. Introduction
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are productive businesses to be developed in Indonesia to support 
macro and micro-economic development. Then every MSME needs to make improvements. One of the MSMEs that 
need to improve is MSME Masin. Masin is a kind of sambal, a product of fermented rebon shrimp with the addition 
of chili, salt and acid, which the people often make in Sumbawa, West Nusa Tenggara (Jumisayati, 2020). One of 
the Masin SMEs is Masin SMEs, Mr. Sayhminan. Based on the observations that have been made, masin workers 
grind chilies in standing and walking positions. This can raise the risk of work-related illness. According to Joanda 
and Suhardi (2017), poor work posture can cause musculoskeletal disorders in workers. Workers who experience 
serious work-related illnesses can have lost working days, reduced work productivity and reduced work ability 
(Umami et al. 2014; Pramono 2020; and Hanif 2020). 
In addition, the place for grinding chilies and mixing dough is not located in the same place as the storage room for 
raw materials and fermentation, thus requiring workers to move places. Thereby extending the material handling 
distance. According to Andriantantri (2008), the long total material handling distance ultimately causes the total

Final REBA analysis 
Based on the angle has been described using Autodesk Inventor 2017 software and produces a neck angle of 16.86°, 
an upper arm angle of 36.3°, a forearm angle of 19.6°, a palm angle of 61.8°, and a leg angle. 104.2°. The next step 
is to analyze the work posture using the REBA worksheet. 
 
Based on the results of the final REBA analysis, the analysis using the REBA worksheet showed that the table c and 
activity score each got 2 and 1, then added 3 with a score of 3. Score 3 entered into action level 2, namely low risk, 
which shows that the work posture of the Masin maker has changed from high risk to low risk. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The initial work posture of Masin workers at Masin MSME, Mr. Syahminan, using the REBA method, obtained a 
REBA score of 9. A score of 9 belongs to action level 4, namely High risk or High risk, which indicates that this 
work posture requires further investigation and immediate implementation of improved work posture. The final 
working posture of Masin workers at MSME Masin, Mr. Syahminan, using the REBA method, obtained a score of 
3. The REBA 3 score entered into action level 2, namely low risk or low risk, which indicates that the work posture 
of Masin makers has changed from high risk to low risk. 
 
The work table design based on the results of the Kansei Engineering questionnaire is to get three factors or groups. 
Namely, Group one with comfortable, strong and plain design criteria. Group two with a colorful design. And group 
three with a dynamic and inexpensive design. Moreover, the design of the work table uses value engineering. 
Namely, the material chosen is a framework using 30 x 30 mm hollow iron with a thickness of 0.9 mm and 
multiplex with a thickness of 1.2 mm. For a dynamic design, use a rubber table adjuster. Not expensive, realized by 
evaluating the value that considers the cost of each proposal. The color chosen is yellow. The design is comfortable 
because the table design is based on the anthropometry of the average Indonesian.

Abstract 
Lean Manufacturing is an approach for the systematic identification and elimination of waste associated with 
manufacturing systems and services through continuous improvement by the flow of the product or service to the 
customer and in the pursuit of organizational sustainability. This article presents a structural equation model that 
relates the 5s and good manufacturing practices as independent variables with the economic sustainability (dependent 
variable) of maquiladora companies in Ciudad Juarez. The model proposes three hypotheses validated using the partial 
least squares technique integrated into the WarpPLS 7.0 software with the information obtained from 119 responses 
to a questionnaire applied to the local maquiladora industry. Likewise, a sensitivity analysis was performed in which 
the importance of properly implementing the 5s and what happens when they are not implemented correctly is 
observed. The results show that the 5s is a facilitator of good manufacturing practices since, through them, a reduction 
in the different costs incurred by the maquiladora industry is obtained.

1. Introduction
Companies are looking for new manufacturing strategies to improve their performance and become more competitive 
in today's competitive markets. As part of these strategies, they implement Lean Manufacturing (LM) practices, which 
is an approach for the systematic identification and elimination of waste associated with manufacturing systems and 
services through continuous improvement by the flow of the product or service to the customer in the pursuit of 
sustainability of organizations (Radnor, 2011). LM comprises a management philosophy with tools aimed at 
eliminating waste, optimizing workflow, reducing costs and improving quality (Thawesaengskulthai, 2010).  One such 
tool that helps in the sustainability of companies are is 5S, as they are considered the main LM initiative and have a 
solid potential to improve efficiency, quality, production, delivery fulfillment, safety and cost optimization, and act as 
a basic requirement for other quality improvement programs (Randhawa & Ahuja, 2017b). The maquiladora is a sector 
of the industry that has used the tools of LM to achieve competitiveness and stay in the market in recent years.  
The term ""maquiladora"" today refers to ""any particular activity in an industrial process for, example, assembly or 
packaging performed by a party other than the original manufacturer"" (García-Alcaraz et al., 2016). Export 
maquiladoras gained importance in the Mexican economy during the last two decades. These plants import raw 
materials, components, machinery and equipment to assemble or process in Mexico and then re-export, mainly to the 
United States, paying taxes only on the value-added (Carrillo & Zárate, 2009; J. L. García-Alcaraz et al., 2015). Such 
Mexican maquiladoras have established strategies to reduce costs and waste and usually apply advanced production 
processes and implementation of novel methodologies since they import all raw materials and export all final products,

Abstract 
A lithium battery is a very lightweight battery but has better storage capacity and longer endurance than conventional 
batteries. Developing lithium batteries for motorcycles requires a business feasibility analysis to replace a motorcycle 
with lithium batteries. Lithium batteries are lightweight, environmentally friendly and safer than other types of 
batteries. This article is an improvement from Kurniyati et al. (2016), which discusses the feasibility of investing in 
the lithium battery business for motorcycles. Previous articles have not considered taxes and interest rates inflation. 
Therefore, improvements are needed to produce a better outcome. In this article, a feasibility analysis of investing in 
the lithium battery business using the NPV (Net Present Value), PP (Payback Period), IRR (Internal Rate of Return) 
method with a MARR value of 7.5% and a time horizon of 8 years. In addition, this article also considers the tax rate 
and interest rate inflation. Based on the calculations, the NPV value > 0 is IDR 198,366,208.00, the PP value is 14 
years, four months longer than the eight-year time horizon, and the IRR < MARR is 12%. Therefore, investment in 
the lithium battery business for motorcycles is not feasible and contradicts the research of Kurniyati et al. (2016), 
which has not considered income tax and inflation interest rates. Then, all values can meet the feasibility test aspect 
when the initial selling price increases by 5%.

1. Introduction
Most of the issues have been lithium battery technology issues in recent years. Currently, lithium batteries are very 
close to people's lives, such as public street lighting, solar power plants, handy talkies, and accumulators for 
motorcycles (Wijayanti et al. 2018). Lithium Ferro Phosphate (LiFePO4) battery is the most widespread type. The 
advantage of this lithium battery is that it is very light, weighing up to one-fifth of the wet batteries commonly used

b. Sensitivity Analysis 
After conducting a financial feasibility analysis, a business has a high risk that may reduce the success of this project. 
This study conducted a sensitivity analysis to project the changes experienced on the parameters that influence it. The 
parameters discussed in this study are changes in product sales and changes in costs. (Table 10). 
 
 
Table 10. Sensitivity Analysis Based on Changes in Product Selling Prices

9.1 < n year 
IDR 325,500 
IDR 1,999,674,925 > 0 
36% > MARR 
6.1 > n year 
 
Based on this research, the eligibility requirements that are the basis for measuring an investment consist of NPV > 0, 
IRR > MARR (12%), and PP < n (8 years). The results of the calculation of the sensitivity analysis above show that 
the increase in the selling price is directly proportional to the level of feasibility of the investment. So, when the initial 
selling price is to be increased by 2.5%, it causes the MARR, which was initially not feasible by 4% because it is less 
than the MARR value, it increases to 17% and shows a number that is more than the MARR value which means it is 
feasible. Likewise, an increase in the initial selling price of 5% causes the value of the Payback Period to decrease, 
which was initially due to 14.4 years or exceeding the stipulated time limit (8 years), decreasing to 6.1 years, which 
is greater than that time limit. So that all values can meet the feasibility test aspect when the initial selling price is to 
be increased by 5%. The feasibility test results between this study and Kurniyati's (2016) research are due to the 
absence of consideration of income tax and depreciation at the beginning of the calculation. Thus, the feasibility test 
results do not provide an accurate decision.

Based on the Table 11, the improvement of Kurniyati et al. (2016) on this study provides several additional 
considerations such as income tax, depreciation cost, and actual value conversion or inflation interest rates to obtain 
more accurate analysis results. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis in this study, the conclusion obtained is that the economic efficiency applied for shows that the 
investment in the feasibility of the lithium battery is not economically feasible. Even though the NPV value of this 
investment is IDR 198,366,208.00 or NPV >0, the PP value analysis is 14.4 years or PP > n (8 years). In addition, the 
IRR value (4%) is lower than the MARR value (12%). This research contradicts previous research (Kurniyati, 2016), 
which indicates that this investment is feasible. The difference in research results is due to several considerations not 
being reviewed, such as income tax, depreciation, and price changes in previous studies. Then, all values can meet the 
feasibility test aspect when the initial selling price increases by 5%. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that 
currently investments that receive depreciation and income tax schemes are considered less feasible if the price used 
in the case study still refers to the research of Kurniyati et al (2016). As time goes by, every year the country will 
experience increasing inflation. For sure this will affect the investment value of a business. Thus, in compiling an

investment feasibility analysis, it is better to pay attention to depreciation costs, income tax, fuel costs, and the inflation 
rate of a country.

Abstract 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is one of the solutions to solving problems related to supply chain visibility 
because it creates a framework that integrates the company's internal business processes. Companies that implement 
ERP can be integrated directly with suppliers and customers. This article discusses the improvement of the article by 
Mairawati et al. (2018), related to the analysis of the feasibility of investing in financial software, namely Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP). Previous research has evaluated the economic approach using investment feasibility 
criteria, the value of Net Present Value >0, Payback Period <5 years (economic age), and implementation that results 
in savings of IDR 72,000,000. Then, this study add aspects of techno-economic calculations makes suggestions for 
improvement that have not been studied, such as income tax, depreciation, and sensitivity analysis to get more accurate 
results. The results show that the investment has Net Present Value of IDR 190,071,261.75, the Payback Period is 6 
months, which means that the company will obtain the profit is much greater than the expected profit.  So, the 
investment can be said that feasible. In addition, the results of the sensitivity analysis also show that the initial 
investment and annual costs have the same relationship with annual costs, a negative relationship. An increase of 
initial investment or annual fee will decrease the annual worth received and vice versa.

1. Introduction
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are indispensable for most larger and midsize firms and have changed 
how accounting information is collected, stored, processed, and disseminated (Guo et al. 2021). Altamony et al. (2016) 
also explained that ERP is a system of integrated applications used by organizations to manage the efficient and 
effective use of organization's resources such as raw materials, funds, technology tools, human resources, etc. Before

6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis in this study, the conclusions obtained consist of: 
 
a. The applied economic efficiency shows that the investment in implementing the Enterprise Resort Planning is 
economically feasible. Eligibility is considered achievable based on the analysis of the NPV value of IDR 
190,071,261.75 or NPV > 0 with PP for 6 months. In addition, the study also considers income tax, depreciation, 
and price changes. So the value is obtained as a basis for analysis closer to the actual value. Thus, the investment 
can be said to be feasible. 
b. This ERP implementation can provide IDR 72,000,000.00 or the equivalent of saving 3 employees. In addition, 
the success of ERP implementation will take place if it is improved by both the company and the ERP system 
developer, especially the commitment of top management and training in the use of the ERP system so that the 
purpose of implementing the ERP system is to improve and improve the efficiency of the existing ERP system.

Abstract 
P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri is a manufacturing company enganged in the furniture sector. In the spring bed 
production line, the time required to produce one spring bed requires a long machine set-up time and has many non-value-
added operations. The first step is to minimize the spring bed production time and the distance of spring bed production by 
doing a waste analysis on the spring bed production process to identify the non-value activity and then remove that process. 
After that, create a new alternative layout with the S.L.P. method. The new alternative layout was created using process 
activity mapping to compare spring bed production time and distance from the old layout and the new alternative layout. 
Then, the set-up time on spring bed production is reduced by implementing a single SMED method. Then the last step is 
creating current value stream mapping and future value stream mapping. Then comparing the efficiency of current value 
stream mapping and future value stream mapping. From implementing SMED, removing the non-value-added activity, and 
implementing the new layout of spring bed production. With this implementation, the set-up time and the spring bed 
production process were reduced, reducing the set-up time on the spring bed production process and increasing the 
efficiency of value stream mapping.

1. Introduction
P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri is a company engaged in manufacturing established in 1998 located in Tangerang and 
engaged in the furniture industry. The company sells products in the form of spring beds and accessories such as bed 
frames, cots, mattress backs, and various other accessories. P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri has an office on Jl. Arjuna 
Utara 10, West Jakarta and factory at  Jl. Raya Kuta Bumi Km 6, Tanggerang with an area of 5250 m2. P.T. Alpha Jaya 
Manunggal Mandiri is a manufacturing company engaged in the furniture sector to produce cots, bedframes, spring beds, 
pillows, etc. The production process on each production line has a different production time. Making one spring bed 
requires a long machine set-up time and has many non-value-added operations in the spring bed production line. This 
condition causes waste in the spring beds production process, which is carried out in the form of waste of motion, waste of 
waiting, waste of transportation, etc. Based on the results of the research conducted at the spring beds production line, the 
following are the objectives in minimizing the set-up time and waste at the spring beds production line: 
a) Removing non-value-added operation on spring beds production process to minimize lead time and cycle time.
b) Implementing SMED method to minimize the set-up time in the spring beds production process.
c) Creating future value stream mapping on spring beds production line at P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri.

is uniform. The adequacy test used a confident level of 95% and a significance level of 5%. If N is greater than N', the 
collected data is sufficient. From the normality test, all operations have a P-value greater than 0.05, so all the operation 
data collected were normal. All operation data ordered do not exceed U.C.L. and L.C.L. from the uniformity test, so the 
data collected were uniform. All the collected data is greater than N' from the adequacy test, so the data collected were 
sufficient. 
 
6. Conclusion  
From the waste analysis that has been done, there is 5 non-value-added activity in the spring beds production process. The 
non-value-added activity then will be eliminated to reduce spring bed production time. Then the new alternative layout was 
created by using Systematic Layout Planning (S.L.P.) Method. The new alternative layout has been made in 2 forms: 
alternative layout 1 and layout 2. From the alternative layout, the distance and operation time were decreased. The total 
activity of the process activity mapping for the alternative layout 1  and alternative layout 2 decreased from 41 activities to 
36 activities which decreased by 12.2%. The total operation time of the old layout was 9410 seconds by implementing 
waste analysis and creating the new layout. The total operation time was reduced. The total operation time for alternative 
layout 1 is 8704 seconds and the total operation time for alternative layout 2 is 8568 seconds. The total distance of the old 
layout was 85 meters by implementing waste analysis and creating a new layout. The total distance was decreased. The 
total distance for alternative layout 1 is 44.5 meters and the total distance for alternative layout 2 is 36.75 meters. From the 
process activity mapping, the alternative layout 2 has the least total operation time of 8568 seconds, which decreased the 
total operation time by 8.95% and had the least distance of 36.75 meters, which reduced the distance of the spring beds 
production process by 56.77%. So alternative layout 2 was chosen to become the new layout for P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal 
Mandiri. 
 
Before implementing SMED, the set-up activity total time was 710 seconds. Then after the implementation of SMED, there 
is some activity converted into an external activity, such as taking the raw material from the raw material storage, etc. By 
converting some internal activities to external activities, the set-up time for the spring beds production process was reduced 
by 165 seconds, decreasing the set-up time by 23.23%. Then, from the implementation of SMED, some set-up activity has 
been eliminated because the set-up activity can be done before the production process starts, such as taking the gauge from 
the auxiliary materials warehouse, etc. From the implementation of SMED, the total set-up time turned into 434 seconds 
which decreased the set-up time by 38.86%. From the value stream mapping, the efficiency between current value stream 
mapping and future value stream mapping on operation spring beds frame production is 90.58%; on spring beds edge wire 
production is 54.7%; on spring beds frame assembly and foam sticking is 94.6%; on spring beds fabric production is 
89.18%; and on tape edge and packing is 99.8%. Also, the lead time after implementing the new layout decreased from 
720 seconds to 435 seconds, which decreased lead time by 39.58%.

Abstract 
One important component that supports the performance of production SMEs is Supply Chain Management because 
Supply Chain Management or SCM integrates the raw material procurement process to the sales process. One of the 
important parts of SCM for the procurement of raw materials for SME production is determining the best supplier 
who can provide raw materials with several predetermined criteria such as competitive prices, quality products and 
others. However, the selection of suppliers who provide raw materials for SMEs is currently still done manually, 
resulting in inappropriate supplier selection decisions. On the other hand, a Decision Support System or DSS is a 
computer-based system built to assist the decision-making process by considering criteria and alternatives. Thus, the

5. Conclusion  
Supplier selection for SMEs is an important process because the best suppliers will provide the best services for SMEs. 
The best service from suppliers will affect the effectiveness and efficiency of the SME supply chain and will ultimately 
affect the overall performance of SMEs. Thus, the adoption of DSS for supplier selection is very helpful for SMEs to 
choose suppliers based on the criteria determined by SMEs. The request analyzer which is part of the proposed model 
increases the flexibility of the DSS to be able to offer analysis capabilities of the existing problem. Likewise, the 
mechanism selector feature enhances the functionality of the DSS which supports several selection methods that can 
be used by SMEs

1. Introduction
The increasing level of business competition in Indonesia resulted in companies being required to create 
competent employee performance. Human resources become the main actors in carrying out the company's 
activities in producing goods and services. Here are the reasons why researchers chose Jakarta as a research place: 
1.
Many regional residents are migrating to Jakarta with the aim of improving the welfare of a better life in the
capital. Jakarta is ranked 6th as the province with the largest population in Indonesia, which is 10.46 million
people (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2018)

5. Conclusion
The Effect of the Work Environment on Employee Performance 
The work environment has a positive influence on employee performance with a coefficient value of 0.64 and a t 
value of 4.97. The results of this study can be accepted by the company's management because the value of the 
work environment in the form of employee job security becomes a benchmark in improving employee 
performance. Lighting and humidity are supporting factors to stabilize the atmosphere at work. To create a good 
working atmosphere, it is also necessary to pay attention to minimizing interference due to the sound of motor 
vehicles, considering the company's location is near the highway. The arrangement of the workspace is targeted 
to obtain comfort in carrying out the tasks charged. The more comfortable the work environment, the more 
performance increases in employees. 
The Effect of the Work Environment on Work Motivation 
The work environment has a positive influence on work motivation with a coefficient of 1.14 and a t value of 
3.21. The results of this study can be accepted by the management because the right work environment as a whole 
will support employees in putting themselves in their positions. Work environment conditions can be used to 
encourage employees to work harder so that employees easily complete the tasks charged without waiting for 
orders given from the leadership. 
Influence of Organizational Culture on Employee Performance 
Organizational culture has a positive influence on employee performance with a coefficient value of 0.51 and a t 
value of 7.10. The results of this study can be accepted by the management because the culture applied to the 
641","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

company is good enough to remain improved. Organizational culture becomes a force that inhibits conflicts 
between employees and leaders. 
Influence of Organizational Culture on Work Motivation 
Organizational culture has a negative influence on work motivation with a coefficient value of -0.71 and a t value 
of 2.86. The results of the study can be accepted by the management because the work motivation given to 
employees is still minimal in providing a positive effect on the organizational culture of the company. The lack 
of relationships between employees indicates that work motivation is still low. 
The Effect of Work Motivation on Employee Performance 
Work motivation has a negative influence on employee performance with a coefficient of -0.30 and a t value of 
2.05. The results of this study can be accepted by the company's management. The work motivation applied to 
employees in the company so far is still not good. Based on the results of research and assessments conducted by 
the company's management, employee morale and passion have not been maximized because employee job 
satisfaction is still minimal. Motivation is expected to encourage better employee performance. Some things that 
need to be considered are cooperation between employees so as to maintain a good relationship in daily activities. 
The Influence of Work Motivation in Mediating the Work Environment on Employee Performance 
The results of the study were positive and insignificant with a coefficient value of 0.01 and a t value of 0.33 which 
means that work motivation has no influence on mediating the work environment on employee performance. The 
coefficient of determination (R2) of work motivation is 0.67 (67%). The results of this study can be accepted by 
the management so that the company needs to increase employee work motivation in various ways to improve 
employee performance such as giving bonuses to outstanding employees. 
The Influence of Work Motivation in Mediating Organizational Culture on Employee Performance 
The results of the study were positive and significant with a coefficient of 0.05 and a t-count value of 2.18 which 
means that work motivation has an influence in mediating organizational culture on employee performance. The 
coefficient of determination (R2) of employee performance is 0.96 (96%). The results of this study can be accepted 
by the management. Work motivation has a real effect on mediating organizational culture toward employee 
performance. This reflects motivation that if improved then the company’s organizational culture will improve 
so that employee performance will also increase.  
6. Limitation Research
Limitations of this research only include the workforce who are active in the office of PT Manggala Energi*) with 
a saturated sample of 50 employees out of a total population of 50 employees, so it cannot be generalized that the 
findings in this study will be the same results for all other companies.  Further research can be done in other 
companies with a larger number of employees and can be used as a comparison to the results of research. It can 
also add variables other than those already in the study.

Abstract 
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in most countries. According to 2018 statistics, about 17.9 million people 
worldwide died from cardiovascular disease. Early prediction and control can help reduce mortality from heart disease 
using existing health data. The decision tree method accurately builds a computational model that aims to predict. The 
usefulness of decision trees in health has made them used to predict cancer, diagnose lung disease, diagnose heart 
disease, etc. More studies have also shown that geographical variables can affect the prevalence of hypertension, one 
of the causes of heart disease. Although hypertension is closely related to geographic variables and has a relationship 
with heart disease, there are still not many studies related to heart disease prevention and have not used the geographic 
location as a variable. This study predicts the risk of heart disease by combining 15 variables of heart disease patient 
data obtained from Azra Hospital, Indonesia and geographic data in the form of an area's altitude. We have categorized 
the elevation data from 367 villages in West Java into 2 categories based on the indicators of plains in Indonesia, 
highlands (>600m) and lowlands (<600m). Based on the test results, we found that the decision tree method's diagnosis 
had an accuracy of 93,75%, with the highest level of risk being in people living in the lowlands. This shows that the 
altitude of an area can affects the risk of heart disease. We suggest optimizing the method to improve the accuracy of 
the prediction results.

1. Introduction
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in most countries(Mamatha Alex and Shaji 2019). According to 2018 
statistics, about 17.9 million people worldwide died from cardiovascular disease(Iskandar, Hadi, and Alfridsyah 
2017)(Dhar et al. 2018). Early prediction and control can help reduce mortality from heart disease by using existing 
health data and data mining techniques that can help identify whether a person has a disease or not. Healthcare workers 
can take quick action to find more patients(Purushottam, Saxena, and Sharma 2016)(Priyanka and Ravikumar 2017). 
Efforts continue to be made to predict the possibility of this deadly disease. Data mining techniques can be an 
advantage(Khennou et al. 2019). In this case, predictions using data mining techniques can provide accurate initial 
conclusions about this disease(Dhar et al. 2018). Hidden patterns of data and existing relationships can be extracted 
from significant data sources using data mining techniques. It is also used for the initial automatic diagnosis of patients 
and to take action more quickly so that more patients can get the drug in a shorter period and can save many 
lives(Sharma, Yadav, and Gupta 2020).

There are several menus in the software, including entering test data that can be done through the available forms, 
viewing the tree model used in the software, and checking altitude location data from 368 districts in 12 cities in West 
Java which are implemented into the database. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This study can conclude that the prediction of the risk of heart disease based on geographic variables using a decision 
tree gets good results. Based on the test results, it was found that the diagnosis of the decision tree method has an 
accuracy of 93.75%. This shows that the altitude of an area can affects the risk of heart disease. We suggest optimizing 
the method and using more geographic variables associated with heart disease to increase the accuracy of the 
prediction results.

Abstract 
Employee empowerment is the company's effort to help and encourage employees to have a sense of self-
confidence and be able to make employees independent to do their jobs effectively. Employee empowerment in 
the hospitality sector includes clearly defined responsibilities, delegating authority, setting standards of 
excellence, train & development, provide knowledge & information, giving feedback, recognition, and trust. 
The combination of employee empowerment methods will have a positive short-term and long-term impact on 
the company. Thus, based on research that has been carried out using the SLR (Systematic Literature Review) 
which aims to analyze the employee empowerment system in the hospitality industry in Indonesia, it is concluded 
that the use of employee empowerment methods can provide optimal and efficient results.

1. Introduction
In the current era, developments in the tourism industry are very much considered by the people and the Indonesian 
government, especially in the Bali area, because this industry provides business opportunities for people who 
engage in it (Pratama and Sriathi, 2015). When it comes to tourism, one of the factors that becomes an important 
facility in supporting this is lodging or hotel facilities. Business competition, especially in increasingly 
competitive hotels (Pratama and Sriathi, 2015) (Hutomo, 2020) requires them to quickly adapt to all kinds of 
existing developments. 
Figure 1. Number of Accommodation Businesses in Indonesia in 2021

Based on the data above Figure 1, it shows that the number of star hotels in Indonesia in 2020. There are around 
3,644-star hotels or about 11.82% of the total accommodation provider businesses. With the intense competition 
in the hotel industry, some organizations will need competent employees. 
Human Resources (HR) is an important asset for a company to achieve the goals that have been set (Sompie et 
al., 2019); (Hutomo, 2020); (Pratama and Sriathi, 2015), they play an important role in improving performance,

Abstract 
This case study was conducted in the Indonesian government's palm oil agro-industry. This company shows that 
pollution from exhaust emissions is the most pollution data during the palm oil processing process. This study aims 
to determine how much environmental impact is caused and strategies to minimize environmental impacts in the 
supply chain in the oil palm agro-industry. The problem-solving approach is carried out by identifying supply chain 
strategies ranging from oil palm plantations to crude palm oil (CPO) using the SCOR model and life cycle assessment 
methods. Furthermore, the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in the palm oil agro-industry is carried out using 
the environmental impact analysis method. The results of this study indicate that the analysis of greenhouse gas 
emissions in the palm oil agro-industry involves the plantation process unit is 62 Kg CO2-Eq/ton CPO, the distribution 
process unit is 1069 Kg CO2-Eq/ton CPO and the CPO production process unit is 49 Kg CO2-Eq/ton CPO. The most 
significant emission occurs in the distribution process unit in the supply chain strategy in the palm oil agro-industry. 
The implication of this study is to provide a solution to overcome the problem by recommending the efficient use of 
trucks and the transportation distance from the plantation to the factory. In the palm oil agro-industry, it is better to 
use trucks with a larger capacity so that later this can reduce the number of trucks and reduce truck fuel used in 
transportation activities.

1. Introduction
A case study was conducted on the oil palm agroindustry, which is a state-owned enterprise (BUMN). This palm oil 
agro-industry has a capacity of 75 tons/hour, with two plants covering 30 tons of FFB and 45 tons of FFB in one hour. 
Then, this company has 13 plantations. Fresh fruit bunches from the plantation serve as the raw material for the Palm 
Oil Mill. This company also manufactures Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and palm kernel (Kernel). This palm oil agro-
industry has issues with air pollution, which has an environmental impact because of the palm oil processing process. 
Thus, this causes problems in the form of greenhouse gas emissions. These issues affect and sometimes even harm 
the environment in which they occur. As a result, actions are required to reduce the environmental damage caused by 
the palm oil agro-industry. 
The root cause must be found to reduce environmental contamination (Hosseini & Wahid, 2015; Kurniawan et al., 
2019). Then, A study also stated management must consider environmental effects that could impair a company's 
operational procedures in addition to concentrating on the output of agricultural products (Sajid & Rahman, 2021). 
Therefore, suggestions for reducing environmental effects are required to help policymakers come up with plans to 
664","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

environmental impacts is in the distribution process unit. This is due to an imbalance between the capacity of trucks 
and the capacity of fresh fruit bunches (FFB) to be transported from the plantation. The ideas resulted in more effective 
truck use and shorter transportation routes from the plantation to the factory. It is preferable to employ higher capacity 
trucks in the palm oil agro-industry to reduce the number of trucks and truck fuel used in transportation activities. This 
recommendation is consistent with research conducted by Fitri, (2015) which states that choosing the right distribution 
channel is critical in a product manufacturing company to reduce distance, distribution time, distribution costs, the 
number of vehicles, and other resources. 
6. Conclusion
The oil palm agro-industry research was successful in defining the supply chain strategy of the oil palm plantation 
agro-industry from planting to becoming CPO. This study also discusses the impact of environmental emissions on 
the environment of the company. Pollution in the form of the highest greenhouse gas emissions in the distribution, 
with a value of 1069 Kg CO2-Eq/ton CPO (90.56 percent), has an environmental impact. This is due to an imbalance 
between the amount of FFB to be transported from the plantation and the truck capacity. The development of a life 
cycle assessment (LCA) scenario is the solution for reducing potential CO2 greenhouse emissions and enhancing 
energy efficiency. Recommendations to minimize emissions are implemented by enhancing the efficiency of truck 
use and transportation distances from the plantation to the factory. The purpose of this research is to provide 
recommendations for difficulties. To obtain changes that occur, it is preferable to create a recommended modification 
with the application of simulation results for further investigation. It will then be able to identify more effective 
approaches to enhance business productivity.

Abstract 
The global outbreak of Covid-19 has caused countries all over the world, including Indonesia to take preventive 
measures, such as social and physical restrictions. Implementation of these restrictions on public facilities includes 
prohibiting people to sit on public chairs that are marked with a cross symbol. However, in reality, people often ignore 
this. In addition, existing public chairs do not have features that support health protocols. These things cause 
discomfort for most people, hence ""Extendable Chair” is designed based on ergonomic aspects as a chair that can be 
extended and is equipped with several health protocols and user comfort supporting features. Authors also designed 
the company that will produce extendable chairs while considering and analyzing marketing aspects, technic and 
technological aspects, managerial and human resources aspects and financial aspects to determine the business 
feasibility of a company. The main target market for extendable chairs include parks, educational institutions, 
terminals and shopping centres in DKI Jakarta with a market share of 20%. Based on the analysis done, the company 
is estimated to earn total revenue of $419,637.32 in the first year by selling 1,621 units of extendable chairs and some 
of the production waste. With a Minimum Attractive Rate of Return (MARR) of 15%, the company has an Net Present 
Value (NPV) of $24,923.44; Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 21%; Break Even Point (BEP) at 4,653 units; 
Benefit/Cost (B/C) ratio of 1.09; and the payback period is 1.997, so it can be concluded that the business is feasible.

1. Introduction
The emergence of Covid-19 which was determined as a global epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
has caused harmful impacts on every country all over the world. Daily activities of the community, especially 
interactions in public places have the potential to become a means of transmitting Covid-19 (Aprillita et. al. 2021; 
Joes et.al. 2021). As a response to this, various countries including Indonesia, have taken preventive measures, such 
as social and physical distancing, as well as regional quarantines, both on a full and limited scale. One implementation 
of social and physical distancing on public facilities is by prohibiting people to sit on chairs that are marked with a 
cross symbol. However, in reality, some people often ignore this regulation, especially people who have not been or 
are less educated about Covid-19 and the health protocols set by the government. This caused inconvenience to other

Abstract 
The bus is a transportation that can carry many passengers. Fatigue and stress can affect the driver's attitude and 
increase the risk of accidents. This research aims to analyze the effect of work duration and work shifts on fatigue and 
stress on the Taruna Jaya bus driver on the Sumbawa-Taliwang route. The sample used in this study was limited to 
one driver because the survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic when only a few buses were operating. 
Fatigue was measured using a Visual Analogue Scale questionnaire and a Body Battery using Garmin Vivosmart 4. 
Stress was measured using a Simple Mental Health Scale questionnaire and a Stress Level using Garmin Vivosmart 
4. The tests were conducted using Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon Test, and Correlation Test. The Mann-Whitney
U-Test was conducted to determine whether there was an effect of shift on driver fatigue and stress based on whether
there was a difference in the average results of driver fatigue and stress between the morning shift and the afternoon
shift. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was conducted to determine whether driving duration affects driver fatigue and
stress based on whether there is a difference in the average results of driver fatigue and stress between before and after
driving. The results showed that the duration of driving and shifts affected driver fatigue and did not affect the driver's
stress. In addition, there was no relationship between fatigue and stress in the driver.

1. Introduction
Transportation in Indonesia has a vital role in national development as a supporter and a stimulus for economic growth 
and other development sectors. Of the various types of public transportation available, the bus is a mode of public 
transportation with a significant increase in the number of vehicles (Irawan et al., 2020). People prefer buses and 
minibusses because they provide an alternative to different directions, have affordable ticket prices compared to other 
types of public transportation and other means of land transportation and can carry large numbers of passengers 
(Watson et al., 2008). One of the main problems with using land transportation is the occurrence of accidents. 
According to 2017 Indonesian Police data published by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information, 
an average of 3 Indonesians die every hour due to road accidents (Satria et al., 2020). The causes of these accidents 
are human factors at 61%, infrastructure and environmental factors at 30% and factors at 9%. 
The cause of drivers experiencing decreased ability and concentration is fatigue (Zuraida et al., 2018). Symptoms of 
fatigue on the physical aspect include headaches, the body feeling stiff, feels pain in the back, difficulty breathing on 
the way, feeling excessive thirst, shaking hands and feet on the way, drowsiness, difficulty standing on the way, feeling 
like lying down (Mayer et al., 2012). Apart from fatigue, stress can also harm drivers. This is because a stressed driver

variables that have a relationship are awake time with changes in fatigue on the questionnaire and shift with changes 
in fatigue on the questionnaire. 
6. Conclusion
This study aims to determine the relationship between work duration and work shifts on changes in fatigue and stress 
on bus drivers majoring in Sumbawa-Taliwang. Using measuring tools in the form of Visual Analogue Scale, Simple

concluded that the duration of driving and shifts influence changes in driver fatigue, where the level of driver fatigue 
after driving increases compared to before driving and the increase in fatigue in the morning shift increases more than 
in the afternoon shift. As for stress, it was concluded that the duration of driving and work shifts did not affect changes 
in driver stress, where the level of driver fatigue after driving was relatively the same as before driving, and the level 
of added stress in the morning shift was also relatively the same compared to the afternoon shift. There is no significant 
relationship between changes in stress levels and driver fatigue. Where the level of fatigue always rises both in the 
morning shift and afternoon shift.

Abstract 
Covid-19 Pandemic has changed the way of life and many sectors of human activities, including the business way. 
The companies that want to survive and win the business during this pandemic, must have a supply chain resilience 
(SCR); hence, they can adapt and change their business way. This preliminary study tries to tackle this phenomenon 
by identifying the important factors to strengthen the SCR and formulating the SCR framework for companies to 
survive this global disruption, especially for those that operate in Indonesia. Based on the framework that has been 
developed, there are several changes that companies need to make for gaining a SCR. The companies must change 
the way of interaction with suppliers and consumers as well as the way they produce or operate.

Abstract 
Public Service Sectors require professional and innovative public officers to support economic growth. Multiple 
regression is used in this study to examine the research hypotheses of knowledge-intensive public services in the 
Indonesian Development Department in Greater Jakarta. The empirical findings demonstrate that knowledge 
development and pro-social behaviour are significantly associated with knowledge-intensive public services. While 
training and development are essential tools for improving public sector officers' knowledge, when knowledge 
development and pro-social behaviour are combined, they can have a greater significant impact in developing 
knowledge-intensive public services. Furthermore, the research revealed that knowledge development alone is 
insufficient to ensure qualified public service officers in the public sector. In conclusion, a more significant impact on 
knowledge-intensive public services can be achieved when knowledge development is combined with pro-social 
behaviour.

1. Introduction
Today's organizations have become fast-growing in both the private and public sectors. In highly complex situations, 
all employees must exhibit behaviours beyond their established tasks. Therefore, government organizations must 
develop or adopt new strategies to ensure that services are delivered on time and well managed (Tamrin & Sadapotto, 
2021).  
Human capital is a vital function in the public sector to be established and implemented by state departments to ensure 
that organizational goals are met (Singh & Singh, 2019). Moreover, service management has developed an excellent 
strategic concept for private and public sectors (Ambe & Maleka, 2016). It demonstrates that private and public sector 
organizations have a lot in common when promoting service initiatives (Razak et al., 2016). As a result, private or 
public sectors must invest in human capital as the foundation for service delivery.  
In human resources management, the term ""human capital"" refers to the abilities, competence, and motivation of 
individuals (Ali et al., 2021). Individual capabilities, interactions, behavioural patterns, and processes are part of a

The results indicate that the R2 value is 48.6 percent significant at 1%. Thus, at both the 1% and 5% significance 
levels, the study variables, knowledge development, and pro-social behavior significantly affect intensive public sector 
organizations. Thus, these regression results are acceptable. 
 
5.3 Discussion 
As a result of the increasing number of people entering the workforce, Public Service Sectors need professional state 
institutions to support economic growth and success. According to the research findings, knowledge development and 
pro-social behavior are closely associated with the knowledge-intensive public sector organizations, particularly 
knowledge development of public sector employees. Moreover, they corroborate prior research, which discovered that 
public sector workers who are already trained in the field would effectively assist a country's development efforts 
(Elena et al., 2021; Marcos et al., 2020; Scott & Sulsberger, 2019; Urbancová et al., 2021). 
 
The study's findings revealed that knowledge development alone is insufficient to ensure the long-term sustainability 
of knowledge-intensive public sector organizations. Knowledge development has a more significant impact on 
knowledge-intensive public sector organizations when accompanied by pro-social behavior. According to the research 
findings, knowledge development, followed by pro-social behavior, has the most significant impact on knowledge-
intensive public sector organizations. The results of this study support the previous findings that OCB can make 
employees willing to contribute numerous creative solutions to problems. Also, they invest in self-development to 
improve their knowledge, skills, and talents and thus contribute more effectively to the organization (Grego-Planer, 
2019; Qiu et al., 2020). 
 
The study concludes that the public sector organizations should innovate the most efficient means of providing 
superior service to the public. To create a knowledge-intensive public sector organization, all public sector employees 
must first acquire the necessary technical skills to support day-to-day operations. The essential skills can be developed 
through service orientation training and development. Meanwhile, the empirical finding shows that professional 
development should be supported by the pro-social behavior of civil service officers. It implies that public sector 
employees who are willing to go above and beyond the call of duty will win the service quality for the governmental 
entity. It is consistent with the public sector's ethos of not seeking profit but rather offering the best services to society 
as the public sector is a nonprofit organization. 
 
Public sector engagement should be a part of the pursuit of success and contentment. In addition to feelings of love or 
empathy, a desire to help others can be seen in the public service officers who serve the public patiently. Finally, the 
attitude of love for one's country (patriotism), accountability for one's responsibilities, and loyalty to one's country are 
components of the nationalism mindset. Employees in the public sector should be service-oriented, not profit-oriented, 
and sincerely invested in their work. They should be motivated by the perks and rewards associated with their jobs. 
The research findings imply that the government should make the service-oriented individual a symbol of the 
government employees' nationality. In the long run, this will reduce the desire for corruption and will indirectly benefit 
the people and society. Also, the service-oriented individual should be an essential component in selecting civil service 
employees. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Knowledge development in public sector companies will help ensure that civil service personnel can provide these 
services with a holistic perspective. Knowledge development should aim to address the development challenges of 
knowledge-intensive public sector organizations with various knowledge assisting in knowledge-based activities. The 
knowledge acquired in knowledge development must be strategically aligned, crossing the strategic vision with 
competencies and activities with critical knowledge. Therefore, it is imperative to use knowledge based on different 
criteria, transform strategic and essential knowledge, and transfer it to learning. 
 
Pro-social behavior is unstructured employee behavior that is not job-specific, is not contractually regulated, and 
benefits the organization. It requires employees to carry out their responsibilities out of a desire to assist their 
colleagues and the business, not for personal gain. It assists organizations in the public sector that rely heavily on 
knowledge.

The research limitations include the small sample size of the public sector. The research findings are based on 
responses to a questionnaire survey provided by representatives of the organizations. A further in-depth examination 
of the organizational problem should bolster the research's significance. It is critical to place the observation inside 
another public sector context for the research to draw generalized findings from those samples. Additional research 
should be conducted to determine how training efficacy findings are integrated into firms' strategic plans, training 
programs, and employee career plans.

Abstract 
Hospital management must improve their performance and services, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. One 
way that might be done is by implementing Kaizen. This study tries to see the effect of the application of Kaizen on 
improving the quality of work and overall service in Indonesian Hospitals. From this research, it can be identified the 
factors that drive and inhibit the success of Kaizen implementation in hospitals. In this study, the Kaizen aspect is 
viewed from 4 variables, namely company policies and awareness; education and training; work culture; and internal 
training. Data was collected by distributing questionnaires to 150 employees in 2 hospitals in South Jakarta-Indonesia, 
using a random sample, consisting of executives, managers, and hospital employees. Statistical analysis using PLS-
SEM (second generation SEM approach) yielded more significant results. The findings of the study indicate that the 
application of Kaizen affects the overall improvement of work and the quality of hospital services through the 
intermediate variables of employee work. Thus, the increase in employee work is a strong predictor of the overall 
increase in employment and services in hospitals. One of the interesting findings shows that culture is a leverage that 
drives the success of Kaizen implementation, especially employee commitment to continuously improve work systems 
and when employees believe what they are doing will add and build company value. Internal processes are an 
important factor that needs to be improved so that the implementation of Kaizen is successful, especially regarding 
working in teams and being process oriented.

1. Introduction
During the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital management must improve their performance and services. Kaizen has the 
principle of making continuous improvements in stages, which aims to increase organizational productivity (Soltani 
& Amanat, 2019). Adopting Kaizen means making continuous improvements in all parts of the organization to 
maintain its long-term competitiveness (Cwikla, Gwiazda, Banas, Monica, & Foit, 2018). The method of 
implementing Kaizen in the workplace does not require high costs or sophisticated technology, but the cooperation 
among employees is a major part of the progress of the system (Ohno, 1988). Thus, Kaizen can be expressed as an 
approach to improve performance through small changes by involving participation of the employees (Brunet & New, 
2003), facilities, equipment, materials to improve work processes and increase efficiency. This implies that quality, 
productivity, efficiency, and work effectiveness are the responsibility of everyone in every production line (Petru & 
Abbas, 2015). Work effectiveness is important because it states the adequate performance of an employee based on 
quality, quantity, timeliness, and productivity used to achieve the desired goals (Ricardianto, Ikhsan, Setiawati, & 
Gugat, 2020). 
Kaizen can be applied to various areas of the organization, including hospitals (Sankoff and Mintzer, 2013). Hospitals 
are one of the most complex types of service organizations. Hospitals, especially in developing countries (Harrison et 
al., 2015) face daily challenges to ensure safety, effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of service (L.W. Biffl, 2011). 
In hospitals, there are continuous human interactions, which create opportunities for misalignment in services during 
the interaction process (Berry and Seltman, 2008; Institute of Medicine, 2000). Hospitals have successfully utilized

continuous improvement of the work system. This shows that employee participation is very important for improving 
employee work and on the improvement of overall work and service quality. 
 
However, this study also has some limitations. The focus of this research is hypothesis testing, so that in this study no 
cultural control (namely individualism vs collectivism) was carried out. For further research, it is necessary to consider 
cultural and demographic variables (namely age, education, years of service) as control variables in order to better 
represent research findings.

Abstract 
The tight competition in the industrial world has spurred companies to be fast and responsive in producing quality 
products. This article is a development and refinement of Asyifa & Sutopo's (2017) article in analyzing the feasibility 
of investing in a painting machine to solve the bottleneck problem at CV. Creative 71. The previous analysis was 
evaluated and recalculated using more comprehensive and accurate data. The choice of the depreciation method based 
on a combination of the straight-line method and the DL method can result in a significant depreciation amount being 
charged at the beginning of the investment. While the tax used is 1% of gross income by the provisions of Government 
Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia No 23 years 2018. This article considers the rupiah exchange rate changes 
and aspects of the relationship between each key parameter in the proposed investment. The results obtained are NPV 
of Rp.312,897,652, IRR value of 21.951%, PP value for 0.048 years, and PI value of 66.152%. And B/C ratio of 4,004. 
From a financial point of view, it shows the investment in adding a CV. Creative 71 painting machine can be 
considered feasible because the calculated values have met the proposed indicator limits.

1. Introduction
competitive conditions in the world of the manufacturing industry trigger business units to be able to produce quality 
and value-added products in order to gain the trust of their consumers. Various efforts were made by business units to 
improve the quality and quantity of production through investment in purchasing more capable machines, such as 
what was done by CV. Creative 71. Various qualitative and quantitative criteria are considered in selecting the best 
alternative in investment. Consideration of the financial aspect of the investment is the basic point in the analysis of

From the spider plot above, it can be concluded that the value of capital investment tends to experience a steady 
decline if the percentage of interest value is increased. Likewise, the MARR value will decrease if the percentage of 
interest charged to the investment increases. The annual cost is inversely proportional to the MARR value and the 
value of the capital investment. The value of the annual cost will increase if there is an additional percentage of interest 
charged. Overall, the investment is feasible even though the related variables (capital investment, annual cost, MARR) 
have increased or decreased the interest charged by the investment because the results of the comparison are positive. 
(Figure 4) 
6. Conclusion
The conclusions were obtained from the investment feasibility analysis of adding a CV. Creative 71 painting machines 
are: 
1.
From a financial point of view, it shows the investment in adding a CV. Creative 71 painting machine can be said
to be very feasible. The feasibility is based on the calculation results of the NPV of Rp.312,897,652, the IRR
value of 21.951%, the PP value for 0.048 years, the PI value of 66.152%, and the B/C ratio of 4,004.
The calculated values are considered feasible because they have met the proposed indicator limits. This result is
slightly different from the article Asyifa & Sutopo, (2017) because this article considers data and information that
is more holistic and accurate. The choice of the depreciation method based on a combination of the straight-line
method and the DL method can result in a significant depreciation amount being charged at the beginning of the
investment. Meanwhile, the tax used is 1% of gross income following the provisions of Government Regulation
of the Republic of Indonesia Number 23 of 2018. In addition, price change and sensitivity analysis are also
considered in this article.
2.
Calculation of the relationship between capital investment, annual cost, and MARR to the interest percentage
product is considered in this article. The value of the painted product is susceptible to the annual cost and MARR.
Adding the percentage value of interest to the annual cost causes the business unit to suffer losses because the
annual cost is higher. In line with the annual cost, the MARR value also suffers the same fate, experiencing a
decrease in income if the interest rate increases.

Abstract 
This Article is a development and refinement of the Article by Rachadian et al. (2013), which discusses the 
feasibility analysis of adding a new milling machine by paying attention to the attributes and parameters of a more 
comprehensive investment feasibility analysis. The calculation of the previous research was evaluated by 
considering the calculation of income, the taxes, the depreciation expense, and the assumption of the selling price 
itself. In addition, consideration has been carried out on exchange rate fluctuations and relations aspects of each 
key parameter on investment using sensitivity analysis. The best result was obtained in the form of alternative 2 
with Rp. 20,000/plat of selling price assumption. The calculated value of NPV DC2-A is Rp. 123,683,069 with 
an IRR value of 37.5%, a B/C ratio value of 2.14, a PP value of 1 year six months, and a PI value of 2.47. The 
values of the various calculations are considered feasible because they have reached the specified requirements. 
The target for plate production on the DC 2-A alternative in the first year is 3350 units in order not to suffer losses. 
The alternative production value of DC-2A is the most sensitive to changes in annual cost. If the business unit 
increases the annual cost by 20%, the business unit will lose much money.

1. Introduction
As machines and production equipment age, this causes a decrease in their ability to carry out their duties. The 
decrease in their reliability can cause various waste and losses that cause the company to suffer losses 
(Daellenbach & Mcnickle, 2005). The company needs to make continuous improvement efforts in dealing with 
these problems. Improving machine maintenance management and investment in purchasing new machines are 
crucial options that must be considered to answer these problems. The investment feasibility analysis is 
indispensable in projecting both options. 
CV. XYZ is a manufacturing business unit engaged in the production engineering of printing machines. In
implementing its production, a milling machine is a critical object that supports the production economy. For
almost 20 years, the milling machine has experienced many problems that cause waste and losses. There are

In the Spider Plot graphic, the Sensitivity Analysis shows the effect of changing the variable's value on the amount 
of the DC 2-A production target. The Capital Investment variable is directly proportional to the return value of 
MARR. The value of Capital Investment will decrease if the value of MARR returns decreases if it is the opposite. 
Meanwhile, the annual cost value is inversely proportional to the Capital Investment and MARR. If the company 
wants to increase the cash flow value, it must minimize the MARR or Capital Investment results. The DC-2A 
production target value is the most sensitive to changes in annual costs (Figure 5). If the business unit adds 20% 
annual cost, the business unit will lose much money. Sensitivity Analysis will show the effect on the investment's 
characteristics. The company can find out the range of additions and subtractions of the three variables before the 
project declared is not eligible or does not generate profits. 
6. Conclusion
The feasibility of investment can be used as a proposal for a new alternative that can provide benefits for the 
company. Based on the analysis of the investment feasibility by adding a new milling machine of replacing 
damaged engine components on the proposed CV. XYZ, it can be concluded that:

The Analysis carried out has the same results as the previous article by Rachadian et al. (2013), the second
alternative. The second alternative that has been chosen is DC 2-A which has an assumption of  Rp.

is one year six month(s) (PP<10 years), and the PP value if one year six month(s) (PP<10 years). PI is 2.47 
(PI>1). The values of the various calculations are considered feasible because they have reached the 
specified requirements. The calculation of this article is slightly different from the previous article because 
it pays attention to the attributes and parameters of a more comprehensive investment feasibility analysis. 
Using more complete data, calculation of income, taxes, depreciation expense, calculation of the inflation 
rate, and considering aspects of the relations of each key parameter on investment using sensitivity analysis. 
In addition, there is an assumption of selling price to anticipate the fluctuation of the plate selling price in 
the future. 
2.
The business unit does not face any suffering loss if the plate production target for alternative DC 2-A in the
first year is 3350 units. If the company wants to increase profits, it must increase the number of plate
production, for fixed costs and variable costs have a constant value to the amount of plate production.
3.
The relations between Capital Investment, Annual Cost, and MARR value to the number of plate production.
The alternative production value of DC-2A is the most sensitive to changes in annual cost. If the business
unit adds an annual cost of 20%, the business unit will lose out. Meanwhile, the alternative production value
of DC-2A has a more negligible effect on increasing and decreasing Capital Investment and MARR value.

Abstract 
Startup business success stories, especially in the creative industry, currently dominate businesses in the world, 
including in Indonesia. Start-up businesses are expected to develop and master various lines of business, which change 
human civilization and habits, especially in the use of digital technology. This study aims to see how the 
implementation of quality management by startup businesses, the constraints, and solutions are carried out. The 
research was conducted on MSEs based on creative industries, especially food. The startup business studied is in the 
bootstrapping stage, where the business is still run by the nuclear family and there is no capital investment. The 
research method is a survey, on a startup business that is developing in West Java, Indonesia. The data shows that 
SMEs experience problems in the quality management system, especially looking for forms of quality planning and 
control, collaboration is still low both from upstream and downstream which results in low product and service quality. 
Start-up businesses will develop well if they use digital marketing as a marketing base and collaborate with suppliers 
and distributors who have reliability in product quality and distribution.

1. Introduction
The year 2019 was the year when pandemic COVID-19 attacked the world which had an impact on slowing economic 
growth, businesses suffered losses, unemployment increased and even many large companies finally laid off almost 
80% of their employees. Indonesia in the second quarter of 2020 experienced very small economic growth, namely 
2.97%, far from the 5% target, this condition was caused by COVID-19, and this is also experienced by many countries 
in the world. On the other hand, there are many positive impacts of the existence of COVID 19, namely the growth of 
business startups using internet technology as a business base. Internet technology ushers in cultural changes in the 
world community both in economic, development, political, social, etc. One of the significant impacts of the internet 
is the growth of artificial intelligence-based businesses. Banking, transportation, business delivery, food and beverage, 
oil and gas, etc. all involve themselves in the use of the internet. Gojek, Alibaba.com, Traveloka, Kopi Kenangan, 
Ovo, etc. are examples of internet technology-based businesses that have succeeded in achieving significant growth. 
A startup business is a start-up business that is usually digital based in its business processes, starting as a personal 
business with a little help from the family and growing into a big business and even involving investors for the funding 
process. Digital involvement in startup businesses mainly occurs in the sales process by involving the marketplace, 
Fb ads, Tiktok Ads, and Google Ads.  
Indonesia is ranked as the 5th largest in the world after Canada. Based on BPS data (bps.go.id) in 2020, it shows that 
90.18% of digital-based business is carried out in the marketing process by utilizing social media, marketplace, and 
also digital applications. Most of the business sectors involved or 48.42% are in the food, beverage, groceries, fashion 
and cosmetic businesses, using the COD (Cash on Delivery) payment method and directly to non-industrial end 
consumers. 
The business fields that are mostly engaged in by startups are transportation, delivery or courier services, food, fashion, 
e-commerce, health, household equipment, and even to large industrial products such as machinery, vehicles, building
materials, etc.

5. Results and Discussion  
 
5.1 ASS management's Understanding of Quality 
To see how ASS managers understand the concepts and principles of quality management, the researchers conducted 
interviews directly, by asking several questions. The following are the conclusions of the results of the interview: (1) 
ASS management understands and believes that quality must be number one in business management, they are very 
understanding when consumer disappointment occurs both from the service aspect (late delivery of the product) and 
from the product aspect (stale product) causing losses from the financial aspect directly and also Consumers don't 
make purchases anymore. (2) ASS management is very aware that promotions must be accurate and more careful, 
because based on the records of many consumers, they compare the products received with the images provided in 
online media. ASS management's understanding of the principles of quality management, based on the results of 
interviews and observations, is as follows: 
 
(1) The principles of the first quality management system related to focus on consumers have been well 
implemented by ASS, some of the activities that lead to this are, always replacing goods when consumers 
give complaints, goods until more than 24 hours, ASS will replace with new goods the next day. 
(2) Partial continuous improvement was carried out, especially in the use of raw materials, but in the 
distribution process, there were still obstacles due to cooperation with third parties. 
(3) Leaders from ASS have not maximally concentrated on the quality management process, because they are 
still focusing on sales targets, promotions, and branding. ASS management apart from being a leader also 
acts as a sales force that is in continuous contact with consumers every day.

(4) The system approach has not been fulfilled to the fullest where the problem solving about quality is still
partial, when the problem exists at that time it is solved without further analysis to keep the problem from
coming out again.
5.2 Solution for rejection of shipments 
According to ASS management, problems related to quality can be identified in the supply chain, namely upstream as 
raw material suppliers, manufacturing as processors, and downstream as distributors. The following are the causes 
and solutions. 
Upstream 
Upstream is the source of raw materials, seasonings, materials for gaskets and the machines used by ASS in business 
processes. As stated above, the first rank is food that is not fresh or category A and is the dominant problem. Based 
on the results of the analysis, this incident is caused by raw material suppliers, 90% are SMEs whose processes and 
products are less standardized. ASS management tries to find various sources of materials to obtain standardized 
quality. In some raw materials cannot be obtained from large industries because the required quantities have not 
reached the minimum purchase requirements. Partnering with suppliers who have high standardization of materials, 
has an impact on reducing product variability. 
Internal supply 
Conformities that often arise due to activities in internal supply or within the company itself are (a) the inventory 
system, especially food freezing, which is still perfect so that it gives a different taste on several occasions, (b) the 
vacuum machine used often provides a high vacuum density. different (c) the production process is still traditional 
with cooking utensils that have not been standardized for temperature and cooking time (d) HR is still in the process 
of being standardized. For this condition, the management acted by purchasing a high-tech vacuum machine, with a 
fairly large investment, and was proven to be able to make food vacuums more accurate so that food freshness could 
be maintained. The next step is investing in a freezer with adequate capacity to support a good inventory system and 
the last is the standardization of processing in cooking time, use of spices, and cooking stages. This condition makes 
the food sold relatively has the same taste and also lasts longer. 
Downstream 
The most common suitability occurs downstream, namely in the category 
Shipment returns occur for various reasons including: (1) Delivery errors occur due to the similarity of the consumer's 
name so that the goods are exchanged, in the process of exchanging goods it takes a longer time, for example, it should 
be from South Jakarta to East Jakarta or vice versa. (2) Address tag error, when creating a delivery address for 
consumers, the IT team experienced an address tag error. In both conditions, the settlement that is carried out is re-
checking for compatibility between the name, address, and also type of goods sent. 
6. Conclusion
Add conclusion here. Make sure to address that all objectives are met and emphasize of unique research contribution.

Abstract 
In March 2020, WHO declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) a new world pandemic. Different countries have 
implemented different strategies to control the impact of the pandemic. For example, France and Germany 
implemented relatively strict lockdown policies and empowered people to work. In addition, public transport is 
advised to keep passenger levels low and avoid overcrowding, while people over the age of 70 are encouraged to 
abstain from public transport altogether. As a result, the use of bicycles as an active mode of transportation has 
increased and this mode is highlighted to overcome problems related to social distancing in the transportation domain. 
This is what underlies the bicycle industry to increase productivity and improve quality during the pandemic. This 
research is focused on analyzing the quality improvement of the electric bicycle production process using the FMEA 
method. This FMEA method is based on a simple DMAIC problem solving methodology, namely: Define (formulate), 
Measure (measure), Analyze (analyze), Improve (improve) and Control (control), which combines several statistical 
tools and other process improvements. The steps carried out using the FMEA method are identifying several types of 
problems, determining the severity rating value, occurrence rating value, detection value, and calculating the Risk 
Priority Number (RPN). After obtaining the RPN value from the FMEA method, then an analysis is carried out in 
determining the priority of problems in the bicycle production process. The result of the research is that there are three 
processes that must be prioritized.

1. Introduction
Various countries in the world have implemented different strategies to control the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic 
that occurred in early 2020. For example, France and Germany implemented relatively strict lock down policies and 
gave people authority to work (Pierre, 2020). In addition, public transport is advised to keep passenger levels low to 
avoid overcrowding, while people over the age of 70 are encouraged not to use public transport at all 
(Folkhalsomyndigheten, 2020).  
The transport domain is an integral part of everyday life, and an in-depth understanding of the health and comfort of 
its users is very important, especially in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, social distancing 
has been introduced as a remedy to reduce human interaction, as some people may be infected with the virus but not 
aware that they should be quarantined (Wilder-Smith and Freedman, 2020). As a result, the use of bicycles as an active 
mode of transportation has increased and this mode is highlighted to overcome problems related to social distance in 
the transportation domain (De Vos, 2020). Cycling provides broad benefits for users and society, such as improved 
health and reduced CO2 emissions and fuel consumption (Hood et al., 2011).

RPN value is very low even less than 40 after obtaining the top three rankings from the entire process, management 
should prioritize the three processes first and correct errors that result in large number of defects and improvements 
must be made to the three processes thoroughly and appropriately. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of observations and observations that have been made, several conclusions have been obtained, 
namely that in the bicycle industry during the Covid-19 period there was a significant increase in production, namely 
with brands such as Polygon, United, Pacific, and Element, which increased from 60% to 80% by reaching more than 
8-9 million units, both for bicycles for adults and children. From January to May, the company had an average request 
of 22056 and the number of complaints was 23. After the company experienced the impact of the pandemic, from 
June to October the average demand was 44045, a significant increase of 99.7% and the number of complaints was 
73, which increased by 218. %. And from the results of the FMEA analysis that has been done, it can be concluded 
that the RPN value contained in the welding & press process shows varying results. In the wheel station process, it 
ranks first with the highest RPN, which is 128. For the Accessories station process, it is in the second rank, which is 
112. The third rank is occupied by the shifter station process with a value of 80. It can be seen that these 3 processes 
are the main problems that must be prioritized in order to reduce the number of defects and improve the quality of the 
bicycle production process.

Abstract 
Recently, global cotton prices have increased by 107.15% in the last two years, and the demand for fabrics has 
decreased, having a significant impact on the company's profitability by 15%. This research was conducted at a 
manufacturing company specializing in knitting fabrics made from polyester, tetron cotton, and chief value cotton. 
During observation, it was found that the company's expectations regarding the good quality of the fabrics produced 
were different from the reality that almost 75% of the fabrics produced had to go through the repair/rework stage due 
to defects. The purpose of this study is to prepare a strategy for companies to increase profitability during a crisis in 
company profitability. This research focuses on the production area, from the raw material preparation process in the 
warehouse, the knitting process, the quality checking process, and the storage process in the warehouse. One month 
of production data was utilized in the study. This research begins by observing the production process, interviewing 
employees, and collecting daily production data and waste identification using WAQ and a WRM. The problem-
solving process uses the DMAIC method, starting by defining the problem and measuring the capability of the 
production process. WRM and WAQ are used to analyze the type of waste, and the root of the problem is analyzed 
with a fishbone diagram. The results of this study indicate that the most common types of defects are holes in the 
fabric, broken threads, and broken needles that cause other waste in the production process. The root of the problem 
is that there are no QC procedures for raw materials, machine operating procedures, or periodic inspection procedures. 
The proposed improvement to overcome this problem is to conduct QC inspections on incoming raw materials and 
make a periodic machine inspection procedure. From the validation process for the proposed improvements, it shows 
that lead time was reduced by 15.13%, efficiency increased by 11.23%, and profitability by 6.17%.

6. Conclusion 
In the production process, quality inspection is needed for every raw material that comes from suppliers to evaluate 
supplier performance as part of the supply chain of the textile industry. No quality inspection process on raw materials 
results in receiving raw materials with poor quality so that defects in fabrics are a consequence of this. 
 
Defects as one of the main problems in this case are the main triggers in causing other waste such as waste of waiting, 
waste of overprocessing, and waste of overproduction. The result of these defects and waste is reduced work 
efficiency, increased manufacturing lead time, and increased costs. 
 
Based on the validation results on the proposed improvement, an increase in efficiency of 11.23%, a reduction in 
manufacturing lead time by 15.13%, a reduction in production costs by 6.17%, and an increase in company 
profitability by 6.17%. 
 
This research limitation is about the time to research and the observation process is one month, so a study with a 
longer time span is needed so that the production data and defects obtained are more and the short observation time 
has the potential to be influenced by other factors such as the amount of seasonal fabric demand, pandemics, and so 
on. This research also doesn’t emphasize the company’s readiness for implementing lean green six sigma to maintain 
company’s sustainability. 
 
In the next research, an assessment of lean green six sigma readiness is needed, and the observation data must be 
longer to prevent some factors like seasonal demands that lead the research into bias conclusions.

Abstract 
Trust in leadership significantly affects employee trust in leadership and behavior during organizational changes 
that lead to improvement. In Transformational Leadership, there are four essential elements for leadership 
relationships, namely (1) relationships based on influence; (2) the leader and the follower are the people in this 
relationship; (3) leaders and followers want real change; and (4) leaders and followers develop mutual goals. 
Transformational Leadership and Trust in Leadership will increase work engagement within the organization. 
Thus, the research carried out using the SLR method aims to analyze Transformational Leadership and Trust in 
Leadership in work engagement in organizations.

1. Introduction
Organizations that use transformational leadership styles in increasing work engagement are carried out by 
motivating employees through the leadership dimension (Ansa & Nahib, 2021). Today, leaders and followers 
or employees play an essential role in organizational sustainability (Burcu & Serdar, 2017). One of the essential 
parts of an organization is human resources (Sunil & Becky, 2019); (Janes & Novak, 2018). An organization is 
said to be successful or not in achieving its goals, which is determined by how much employees are committed 
to the organization (Adekunle, Abimbola, & Ehimen, 2019). Management research identifies transformational 
leadership as one of the most influential leadership approaches, significantly when changing organizations 
(Hasan, 2016); (Yashuo, Ranran, Tong, Shangjun, & Chunjiang, 2018). Transformational leadership has been 
described as managing organizational change that focuses on nurturing potential followers and changing their 
mindset to facilitate their involvement in the change process (Donny, 2018); (Aida, Fumitaka, & Islam, 2020) 
as a transformational leader can accelerate organizational change by influencing the attitudes of the workforce 
and increasing the level of job involvement (Klug, Maier, & Steinmann, 2018). 
As a leader in implementing planned organizational change, around 70% of organizations are said to have 
experienced some form of failure in their transformational change initiatives Bakari, Hanjra, & Niazi, 2017); 
(Jones, Firth, Hannibal, & Ogunsyin, 2019); (Aida, Fumitaka, & Islam, 2020). The complexity associated with 
organizational change often does not result in the change process (Hasan, Islam, & Chowdhury, 2020). 
Researchers and practitioners argue that due to the level of complexity associated with transformational 
leadership change, they are often unable to complete the change process successfully (Aida, Fumitaka, & Islam, 
2020); (Fong, Hui, Szu, Yu, & Cheng, 2020). In times of uncertainty, however, employees may disagree with 
organizational leaders and cynic about the administrative change process (Mega, Rini, & Chichi, 2020); (Aida, 
Fumitaka, & Islam, 2020) 
Previous research studies have highlighted different leadership approaches as essential for enhancing employee 
trust-supportive behavior (Agote, Aramburu, & Lines, 2016; Bakari, Hanjra, & Niazi, 2017). Uncertainty and 
complexity associated with Transformational Leadership changes; an employee will fear that a question mark 
will arise with another meaning of distrust. It shows an unwillingness to be involved in approaching work with 
leaders. Therefore, a study describes that employee championing behavior is considered effective change

Abstract 
High school students are affected by the pandemic of covid-19 because they have to study online and study 
separately from their teachers and friends. Not infrequently students are confused in the online learning system. This 
creates students feeling of unsecure, with affect their mental health.  In online learning system students’ mental 
health becomes a concern because it affects students' learning motivation. The purpose of study is to examine the 
motivation of students to learn in Indonesian public high school during covid -19 pandemic. Motivation is measured 
through 5 dimensions, namely: general competence belief, interest to learn, learning usefulness value, mastery 
oriented, and performance oriented. The respondents consisted of students from 13 public high schools in 
Tangerang, Indonesia. A total of 528 students filled out a questionnaire using google form media. The questionnaire 
contains 13 questions distributed from February 1, 2021, to February 17, 2021. There are 498 valid questionnaires 
(44.5% male and 55.5% female). The data were processed and then analyzed using multivariate analysis 
(MANOVA). The results showed that gender affects students' learning motivation, this is because men have 
different innate characteristics from female. The mean value of the indicators ‘general competence’ and ‘interest to 
learn’ for men is higher than for female. Meanwhile, the mean value of the indicators ‘learning usefulness value’, 
‘mastery oriented’ and ‘performance oriented’ of female is higher than that of men. The results also show that 
majors do not affect students' learning motivation when studying online.

1. Introduction
The pandemic of covid-19 has become a serious problem around the world. As a result, every country tries to 
prevent the spread of covid-19 in their own way, such as locking down, closing schools, and limiting activities, 
which of course affect daily social interactions. This preventive measure raises concerns for the mental health of 
children and adolescents (Pfeffer Baum, B., 2020). This can be seen from the findings of several recent studies 
showing an increase a symptom of affected mental health of adolescents, such as anxiety sometimes even led to 
depression (Racine, N. et al, 2020). This needs to be anticipated because individuals with mental health symptoms 
tend to show poor motivation in learning (Accordino, D.B. et al, 2020). With increasing anxiety and depression, then 
there will be a decrease in the achievement motivation of the students. General symptoms can be seen among others 
are an increased time spent sleeping, using social media, and playing games while a decrease in academic 
motivation and self-discipline, and more than 75% of the students reported increased stress, mainly related to 
academic motivation and challenges (Ellen L. Usher, 2021).  
The fulfillment of psychological needs, such as a relationship with others, competence, and autonomy (An, M.A.; 
Han, S.L., Van den Broeck et al, 2016) will increase the individual's intrinsic motivation. The interaction of students 
with friends and teachers is very limited since the pandemic outbreak, of course, has an impact on student 
motivation. Social interaction can reduce the negative impact in student motivation during the pandemic (Son, C, et 
al,2020). Social interactions can reduce some of the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including protecting 
against demotivation (Goldstein, S.E. et al, 2015). Around 80% of adolescent students are indicated that their 
motivation and capacity for self-discipline in online learning are decrease. (Usher, E. L, 2021). When learning

class in online system. This shows students are longing for offline learning that allows interacting with peers and 
teachers, where they can express enthusiasm when in class, through dynamic face-to-face interactions (Clayton, K.; 
Blumberg, F, 2010).  
The research show that gender affects students' learning motivation when learning online. The average value for the 
general competence belief indicator (male=10.07, female=9.89) and Interest to learn (male 7.28, female=7.16), 
which shows the mean value for male are taller than female. Meanwhile, the other 3 indicators show that the mean 
value of female is greater than that of men, namely the learning usefulness value (female=7.87, male=7.57); Mastery 
oriented (female=12.28, male=11.97); and for performance oriented (female=11.07, male=11.04). 
The research findings show that the major does not affect students' learning motivation when studying online. This 
shows that the learning motivation of science students and social science students is not influenced by major. The 
description of the forms of student learning motivation in natural science and social sciences as shown through 
indicators of competence belief, Interest to learn, learning usefulness value, mastery oriented, and performance 
oriented are basically not significantly different. Students majoring in natural science and social science have the 
same desire to understand what is learned in school, want to learn as much as possible about their subject, 
perseverance in class, pride in their grades even though they are not as good as other students in the class. They also 
realize that learning in school (although currently online) is useful for the future, and what is learned in school 
(although currently online) will be useful. Online learning conditions continue to trigger them to become the best 
students, and strive to be better than other students, because one of the main goals of students in both science and 
social studies majors is to get the best grades. This is the cause of the emergence of motivation from within students 
to learn, where students have beliefs about what they should do as students.  
However, this study also has some limitations. The main focus of this research is on motivation, without dividing 
motivation into intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. For further research, it is necessary to consider the 
motivation variables into intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation.

Abstract 
Production planning is an important activity in the company, production planning at PT. WDY 
experienced several problems, namely the company tended to use intuition or experience in 
determining lot sizes and sometimes ordered only as needed. This has resulted in several problems 
such as increased costs, shortage of raw materials, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the lot 
determination process. The improvement process starts with forecasting, where the forecasting 
method chosen based on the smallest error rate of 19.46% is the winter method. Then proceed with 
the manufacture of MPS, checking capacity using the gross capacity method, calculating the number 
of lots and calculating the capacity of each machine. The results of the calculation of factory capacity 
show that the factory capacity is larger so that MPS can be implemented. The method of calculating 
the number of lots selected is the Wagner within the method with a cost reduction of 14.24%. In the 
calculation of machine capacity, it is found that each machine has a capacity greater than what is 
needed, which means that each machine can meet consumer demand

1. Introduction
PT. WDY is a manufacturing company engaged in printing, this company produces snack food 
packaging. The main product produced is in the form of box-shaped snack packaging. not only snack 
packaging but also various other product packaging, such as instant noodle packaging, canned 
drinks, and mosquito coil packaging. PT. WDY produces tens of thousands of packages in one day 
from various orders, seeing many orders, the production process carried out by the company 
requires sophisticated and modern machines and tools (Manahan, 2012). The method of planning 
and quality control must also be precise, so that it can fulfill a high customer order 
Based on information from discussions with the production staff of PT. WDY is known that the 
company in determining the lot size of raw materials has not used the right method. Generally, 
companies use intuition or experience and order according to consumer demand. 
The absence of the right and optimal method and ordering only based on consumer demand, causes 
companies to have to order raw materials repeatedly (Kusuma, 2009). Of course, this will cause 
ordering costs to rise. In addition, the company also often experiences delays in receiving raw 
materials and shortages of raw materials so that the production process is disrupted. The company 
also informed that the procurement of raw materials also accounts for 65% of the company's total 
costs. 
Therefore, the company needs a proposed improvement design for the new lot sizing method 
which is expected to help the company overcome the problems that occur. Thus, the purpose of 
this study is to determine the right lot sizing method for each material that will be used to make the 
product,

In the calculation of factory capacity, it is found that consumer demand is still below the factory 
capacity so that consumer demand can be fulfilled, and the master production schedule can be 
implemented. 
 
In the comparison of lot determination methods, it was found that the method with the lowest cost 
was the Wagner within the method with a cost reduction percentage of 14.24%. 
 
In the calculation of the capacity of each machine, it can be seen that the production needs for each 
machine do not exceed the amount of available time owned by the factory, thus each machine is able 
to meet consumer needs. 
 
The application of enterprise resource planning can help improve company performance in planning 
and controlling production. Some of the benefits obtained include information on the availability of 
raw materials which is always updated automatically, a fast calculation process, open information 
sharing between departments, and increased coordination and cooperation between divisions. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the research that has been done, several conclusions can be drawn. The following are some 
conclusions that can be drawn. 
 
a. Forecasting is an important first step in production planning. The right forecast in this study 
based on the smallest error is forecasting with the winter method with alpha 0.9 which has 
an error rate of 19.48% MAPE, 87576.90 MAD, and 11225900000.00 MSE. 
b. The comparison of factory capacity and required capacity using the RCCP method states that 
the total required capacity of 446.58 hours can be fulfilled by the factory of 131152 hours. 
c. The method of determining the right number of lots used by the factory is the Wagner Within 
method with a cost reduction percentage of 47.5%, a percentage decrease in ordering 
frequency by 10%, and a decrease in the amount of inventory by 75.8%. 
d. The calculation of the capacity of each machine using the CRP method shows that the time 
it takes for each machine to produce consumer demand can be met. The need for 4546 hours 
on the cutting machine can be met with a capacity of 16960 hours, the need for 5891 hours 
on the printing machine can be met with a capacity of 57701 hours, the need for 10340 hours 
on the coating machine can be met with a capacity of 19843 hours, the need for 7432 hours 
on the ponding machine can be met with a capacity of 25446 hours and the need for 2136 
hours on the glue machine can be met with a capacity of 11200 hours. 
e. The implementation of an ERP system in planning and controlling production will make the 
company become and. ERP systems can help companies integrate all operational processes 
quickly and automatically

Maintenance of company facilities or machines has an important role in supporting work productivity within the 
company to achieve the production targets that have been set. Results Based on the research conducted, it can be 
seen that PT. XYZ has problems with the current maintenance system. The problem that still occurs is that there 
is still waste in its maintenance activities. PT. XYZ is a company engaged in the garment sector and has been 
established in 2003. The products produced by PT. XYZ, namely, polo shirts, t-shirts, sweaters, shirts, field service 
clothes (PDL) and jerseys. One of the damages is the overlock machine which has a downtime per year from 
January 2020 to December 2020, which is 11944 minutes. The data is carried out using Maintenance Value Stream 
Mapping (MVSM) to trace the causes of waste in maintenance activities which will then be deepened with Root 
Cause Analysis (RCA), which uses five-whys analysis and fishbone diagrams to recommend improvements in 
these wasteful efforts. Based on the recommendations for improvement, the maintenance efficiency of the servo 
motor component has increased from 36.36% to 42.90%, while the looper component has increased maintenance 
efficiency from 24.27% to 32%.

1. Introduction
Recent trends indicate that, in general, many systems in use are not performing as intended, so far as cost- 
effectiveness in terms of their operation and support is concerned. Particularly in manufacturing systems, some 
of them often operate at less than full capacity, with low productivity, and the costs of producing products are 
high. According to the study reported, from 15% to 40% (average 28%) of total production cost is attributed to 
maintenance activities in the factory. In fact, these costs are associated with maintenance labour and materials and 
are likely to go even higher in the future with the addition of factory automation through the development of new 
technologies. In this sense, the lean concept has conquered different economic sectors and most of the company's 
processes, positioning itself as an inevitable concept to improve the performance of the company.(Mobley 1990) 
Lean is a lever that enables the company to continually improve its processes, reduce overheads and meet the 
growing and diverse needs of its customers, but it can never be achieved without maximum reliability and 
availability of equipment because of their direct impact on the quality, cost and delivery of products or services. 
Then companies must define the most appropriate maintenance strategy to achieve the required performance of 
the production system.(Mouzani and Bouami 2018) 
PY XYZ is a company specializing in garment products established in 2003 and located in Tangerang. Based on 
an interview with the head of the company maintenance, the company currently has problems with the 
maintenance system that is applied because production machines often experience sudden shutdown when the 
production process takes place and takes a long time to repair. Based on the results of initial observations, the 
high downtime of machines is due to waste that usually occurs in maintenance activities at PT. XYZ. A lean 
maintenance approach is expected to minimize waste in the maintenance department by identifying and 
eliminating activities that disrupt production and creating a smooth flow throughout maintenance activities.

equipment downtime and lost productivity if parts 
aren't available when needed. 
automatically tracked, including links to the work 
order and purchasing modules in the CMMS system 
5. Conclusion
Based on the waste identification carried out for  the component with the highest downtime, there were 4 types of 
waste found in the maintenance process of PT. XYZ is waste process, motion, waiting and defects. In the 
identification of waste carried out on components with the highest downtime, it was found 5 factors causing waste 
contained in the maintenance process of PT. XYZ. These factors include man, method, machine, material, 
environment. The results of the comparison between the maintenance efficiency of the current state map and the 
future state map that have been carried out by eliminating delays in the maintenance process, show that the value 
of the maintenance efficiency of the servo motor component increased by 7% with an efficiency value of 7%. 
previously by 36% to 43% while for the looper component it increased by 8% with the previous efficiency value 
of 24% to 32%. The suggestions for improvement recommended by the author are the application of 5s, the 
proposed digitization of the maintenance system, the proposed training/training plan for technicians and the 
proposal for making a checklist on maintenance activities. Some of these proposals are expected to help companies 
improve the effectiveness of overlock machine maintenance.

Abstract 
Tix.id is an online digitally based application that allows users to purchase and book the schedule of seats for a movie 
at the cinema. Tix.id is engaged in the service sector, which requires a different way in terms of quality assurance 
compared to the manufacturing sector. So it is needed several analytical tools in assess customer satisfaction, 
performance, quality, and so on. Gap analysis is present as one of the tools that can be used to assess the performance 
of the Tix.id application. Gap Analysis is an analytical method that compares actual performance with expectations 
with the hope that the results of this analysis can be used as reference and information for future planning and 
improving the quality of performance. HOQ (House of Quality) is a quality assurance tool that helps to focus on the 
characteristics of the products produced by observing the market segmentation, consumer needs and desires. In this 
report, the data will be collected from the users of Tix.id application, and then the data will be analyzed using gap 
analysis to find the gap between the user's perception and the user's expectation of Tix.id application. From the gap 
analysis then HOQ will be made to obtain certain information that will be used to provide the solution to improve the 
application to fulfil the user's expectation of Tix.id.

1. Introduction
Tix.id is an online digitally based application that allows users to purchase and book the schedule of seats of a movie 
at the cinema. In other words, Tix.id is driving the digitalization of the purchasing process of cinema tickets in 
Indonesia that offers the convenience of the reservations, purchases, schedule and seat selection, distribution of film 
information and outlets, to payment processing using a variety of payment methods.  Tix.id is engaged in the service 
sector which requires a different way in terms of quality assurance compared to the manufacturing sector. So it needs 
several analytical tools in assessing customer satisfaction, performance, quality, and so on (Yulianti & Gozali, 2021). 
Gap analysis is present as one of the tools that can be used to assess the performance of the Tix.id application. Gap

4.15 Proposed Improvements 
From the Gap Analysis that has been done, it can be seen that the Responsiveness aspect and Empathy aspect is already 
very good. The assurance aspect is good enough. The reliability aspect and tangibles aspect is moderately good but 
needs to be improved further. From the Gap Analysis, the criteria that need to be reviewed further are then analyzed 
using the House of Quality. Based on the HOQ, solutions that can be offered to improve the quality of the application 
so that the application can meet customer needs such as: 
1.
Update the appearance of each user's application with application updates.
2.
Provide tutorial features and reduce advertisements on the application.
3.

is in the aspects of reliability and tangibles (tangibility). There is also a service quality gap from the cheaper Tix.id 
ticket prices. This shows that the ticket prices sold on the Tix.id application are not much different from the official 
ticket prices for cinemas. In the rank importance section in the House of Quality, the largest percentage is 13% on the 
target of ""update the appearance of each user's application"". This shows that updating the appearance of the application 
must be done first to continue to provide the best service. So the best advice that can be given by the author is, that 
the Tix.id application updates the application’s interface every time the user updates the application. From the Gap 
Analysis, in the Assurance aspect, one assessment criteria need to be reviewed further, which is the application 
guarantees cheaper ticket prices. In the aspect of reliability, the thing that needs to be reviewed further is the 
application Tix.id can enable fast ticket booking, and the application rarely experiences problems because they do not 
meet the expectations of the user. On the Tangibles aspect, the criteria that need to be reviewed further namely the 
application is easy to operate and provides a variety of various payment methods. From the Gap Analysis, the criteria 
that need to be reviewed further are then analyzed using the House of Quality. The order of targets for improving the 
performance of Tix.ID services based on the rank importance of the house of quality that has been made is as follows: 
1.
Update the appearance of each user's application with application updates
2.
Provide tutorial features and reduce advertisements on the application.
3.
Cooperating with payment applications such as Gopay, Ovo, etc.
4.
The application can be used for other cinemas such as Blitz Megaplex and Flix Cinema.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 virus has become a global pandemic, including Indonesia. Various efforts have been made by the 
government to reduce the negative impact of this pandemic, one of which is through the launch of the Peduli 
Lindungi application. This research was conducted to classify the public feedback towards the Peduli Lindungi 
application based on the review data on the Google Play site. The data collection period starts from July 1st to 
November 30th, 2021. This period was chosen because the government requires the public to participate in 
preventing the spread of Covid-19 through the Peduli Lindungi application. Initial data labeling uses the Textblob 
library. The sentiment analysis is classified using the Support Vector Machine algorithm based on two classes, 
namely positive and negative. The results showed that the classification accuracy performance reaching 81.35%. 
The Sentiment analysis results are sufficient to display public opinion. The association of words on negative 
sentiment indicates that users are less satisfied with the performance of the Peduli Lindungi application. Especially 
in terms of applications, vaccines, certificates, locations, check-ins, registers, and service complaints. Thus, the 
results of this study are expected to be able to provide information to Peduli Lindungi to focus on improving 
applications based on complaints written by users and it is hoped that decision makers can improve the performance 
of Peduli Lindungi applications based on this opinion.

1. Introduction
The Covid-19 virus has become a worldwide pandemic, including Indonesia. The spread of the Covid-19 virus in 
Indonesia has continued to increase drastically since the announcement of the first case in March 2020 (Almutaqqi 
2020). As a result of the virus, the death rate in Indonesia has increased to 140,138 with a Case Fatality Rate of 
3.4% in September 2021 (Kemenkes 2021). The negative impact of the pandemic continues, thus making the 
Indonesian government have a big responsibility to help the community resolve the pandemic. The government 
needs to take action and/or respond more responsively to the community to resolve the Covid-19 virus problem. The 
World Health Organization (WHO) urges the public to implement health protocols to avoid the spread of Covid-19 
by maintaining a minimum distance of one meter, wearing masks, washing hands, limiting mobility, and staying 
away from crowds. The lack of access to information related to the spread of Covid-19 causes confusion for the 
public and the central government. In addition, the government is experiencing an inability to manage information 
and the lack of publicly accessible data related to the spread of the Covid-19 virus. According to WHO, electronic 
devices and information technology are able to assist contact tracing activities on a large scale (WHO 2020). 
Therefore, the Ministry of Communication and Information and the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises of 
Indonesia designed a Peduli Lindungi mobile app to be used to assist the public and relevant government agencies in 
tracking to stop the spread of Covid-19. In addition, the Peduli Lindungi application is used for 3 things, namely 
screening (checking vaccination status and also swab test status), tracing (scan QR Code to start an activity), and 
ensuring the implementation of health protocols according to the QR Code color results (Peduli Lindungi 2021). 
Based on the urgency of the need for the Peduli Lindungi application to support people's activities in daily life, this 
research focuses on user perceptions of the Peduli Lindungi application to support improvements in improving the

6. Conclusion
The results in this study provide information related to public feedback towards the Peduli Lindungi application. The 
results of the study show that Peduli Lindungi users often discuss applications, vaccines, services, certificates, data, 
locations, and others. The word association in the negative sentiment class shows performance complaints related to 
applications, vaccines, certificates, locations, check-ins, registers, and service complaints. Therefore, the results of 
this study are expected to focus on improving the Peduli Lindungi application to improve application performance. 
The proposal is based on Google Play policies and government policies for public use. Based on the analysis of the 
results, the Support Vector Machine model is able to perform calcification stably and flexibly. In addition, the 
results of the implementation of the combination of parameters by the Grid Search module show an increase in the 
performance of the built model. This study also provides information for further research, namely adding parameters 
to the Support Vector Machine algorithm in order to obtain maximum results.

Abstract 
Position of nurses in hospitals has a vital role in providing medical services to patients. Still, these nurses often cannot 
offer high-quality work due to the enormous workload, and this is in line with previous research that conducted 
questionnaires on 364 nurses who stated that most nurses had 2.875 working hours/week excess. Because of these 
problems, in this study, a geofencing system was created which is used to monitor the presence of nurses in hospitals 
using the pull service technique so that nurses get the feature to be able to turn on geofence when starting work and 
entering the hospital, and also turning off geofence when finished working and leaving the hospital. Geofencing in 
this study is set at a radius of 200m or equivalent to the area of Azra Hospital, which is 20,323m2. Based on the 
geofencing accuracy test, the system can produce native real-time positioning with an error rate of 1.4 to 3.7 m and 
has a time delay of 4.45 to 15.30 seconds for user position switching, depending on the device used.

1. Introduction
Location-based information services are now widely used on many platforms, especially mobile applications. One of 
the technologies behind based services is geofencing. Geofencing is a virtual fence used to delimit a geographic area. 
Geofence can detect when someone enters or leaves a specific area (Maiouak and Taleb). The new position is calculated 
intermittently from various sources as the user moves, depending on internet connectivity, whether via Wi-Fi, RFID 
signals, cellular data, or GPS (Global Positioning System). It can produce real-time native positioning with an accuracy 
of 20-50 meters from the original location. However, if a geofence wants a better accuracy, it can use Bluetooth beacons 
with proximity accuracy of up to three meters from the original location (Mackey et al.). Currently, geofence has been 
widely applied in various sectors, including the health sector, to track the Covid-19 area (Anto Arockia Rosaline R, 
Lalitha R, Hariharan G) and find the nearest hospital for patients (Nguyen et al.). In this study, geofencing will be used 
as a technology to monitor the effective working hours of nurses in the hospital area. 
Monitoring in the world of work is essential because every company or agency management has its own set of hours 
and work schedules, including health service agencies such as hospitals. The hospital has a 24-hour work system 
consisting of three shifts with a high workload, according to Kepmenakertrans No. Kep-233/Men/2003 of 2003 
concerning the type and nature of work, nurses on duty in hospitals have five working days with a limit of eight hours 
per day and 40 hours per week (Latief and Lestari). Because it plays a vital role in health services, nurses should have 
regular working hours accompanied by high work efficiency. However, due to the high workload, nurses often work 
more than the predetermined working hours, causing a decrease in the quality of service quality to patients. The 
questionnaire conducted by previous research on 364 nurses stated that the average nurse was always over 2.875 
working hours/week (Rodriguez Santana et al.). This condition causes many nurses to complain of fatigue, especially 
night shift nurses.

Based on the geofencing performance testing that has been done, the system can produce native real-time positioning 
with an error rate of 1.4 to 3.7 m and has a time delay of 4.45 to 15.30 seconds for user positioning, depending on the 
device used. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study's working hours monitoring system consists of several components, namely Android smartphones, and 
GPS. The function of this system is simple. Namely, the system will access the GPS on the smartphone user to get the 
user's location and automate the user so that they can ""Clock in"" and ""Clock out"" within the limits of the hospital area. 
This monitoring system is expected to be an option that makes it easier to replace the manual attendance method that 
still exists on the running system. The system can calculate the adequate time of nurses in the hospital area from the 
implementation results. Based on geofencing performance testing, the system can produce real-time positioning with 
an error rate of 1.4 to 3.7 m and has a delay of 4.45 to 15.30 seconds of user positioning, depending on the device 
used. Expectations for research are to develop this application for other operating systems besides Android, such as 
Blackberry and Ios. Besides that, it is also hoped that future research can track the presence of nurses in hospitals so 
that they can record nurse activities automatically.

Abstract 
The increasing of digitalization in developing an application of the public transportation service shows that the 
business is transforming rapidly and producing practicalities and innovation. For example, the use of the application 
has been advanced by adding delivery systems for the food and beverage businesses and many others. The massive 
number of users will give a massive amount of reviews about the applications. One of the companies that develop the 
application, such as Gojek, requires feedback from the user to improve its services for the future. The enormous 
reviews written by the users tend to be subjective, and difficult to interpret. By conducting analysis using the big data 
of reviews, Gojek can design the necessary strategies as a differentiator in attracting more customers to use its 
application. This study aims to further analyze the reviews based on a machine learning approach (K-Nearest 
Neighbors) and sentiment analysis to label each review as positive or negative. This study will use the best 
classification model determined by selecting the best accuracy and precision the model gives. The result gives that K-
Nearest Neighbors get 83% accuracy on classified the reviews, and it tends to give a positive result with 35542 data. 
By analyzing the word frequency result, Gojek has succeeded in providing good application services and competent 
drivers.

6. Conclusion  
It can be concluded that the model classification built with K-Nearest Neighbors can classify sentiment class with 
high accuracy and precision. The use of Grid search CV to find the best parameter works very well and should be 
doing for the future project to compare. Seeing the predicted sentiment class give 54% positive sentiment on review 
dataset and the word that most occur show in table 3 mean that most of the customer used Gojek app are satisfying 
with the performance of Gojek app and its feature such as Go Ride, Go food Delivery systems, Gopay and the services 
from the driver. Performance and quality services are an important elements of standards achievement that must be 
met, by achieving the standards that have been set mean that the company has performing well and vice versa (Kasmir, 
2016). Improving the quality services cannot be separated from 5 dimension of service quality to achieve customer 
loyalty.  The driver from gojek doing good communication relationships and sincere attention to customers, gain trust, 
and provide responsive service is a form of 5 dimension of service quality (Lee & Moghavvemi, 2015). Meanwhile 
from Gojek app giving discount and offer on its feature, doing a lot of promotion strategy to attract more consumers, 
and provide a stability performance from its application will create a strong relationship between consumers and the 
company, where consumers or the users will be commit to using the services again for the future (Jayanti, 2016; Nikin 
Hardati, 2021).

Recycling is one of the effective methods for reducing the negative impact of plastic waste to the environment. It is 
expected that the youth could play a role, to be responsible for managing plastic waste. The purpose of this research 
is to analyse the influence of demography factor and recycling education on the vocational high school students’ 
perception toward plastic recycling activities. This research employed a quantitative approach of one group pre-test 
and post-test design using a case study in mechanical engineering class of a Vocational High School in the city of 
Surakarta, Indonesia. The data collection technique was carried out through questionnaire distributed amount 31 
students. Statistical data analysis was used to describe students' perceptions and test the hypothesis of the effect of 
recycling education on students' perceptions of sorting waste for recycling. The recycling education was performed in 
2 (two) sessions in which the first session covered the theory of plastic recycling. In the second session, the students 
were asked to use an injection moulding machine to recycle plastic into a simple product of a, key chains. The study 
indicated the recycling education significantly affects the student’ perception in managing plastic waste for recycling 
purpose. It is found a notable difference between the students’ post-test and pre-test score after attending the recycling 
education program. In this study, the demographics factors indicating from the student family background were not 
significantly have an impact on the student’ perception plastic waste management. This study emphasizes the need for 
an integrated waste management education program on the school curriculum to increase the student’ awareness 
toward environmental issues of plastic waste.

1. Introduction
Considering their superior characteristics, plastic could be found in every aspect of life, from household into aerospace 
applications. Based on global data, in 2015 the demand for plastics increased by more than 320 million tons to 330 
million tons in 2016 (Europe, 2017). Global plastic production reached 368 million tons in 2019 and according to 
Boyle & Örmeci, (2020) it is estimated that the amount of plastic production will increase by about 48 million tons 
higher than the previous year and this number is expected to increase continuously in the next 20 years. Figure 1 shows 
the increase in plastic production by year.

Abstract 
The rapid change in the business environment emphasizes the company to adapt faster to advance toward sustainable 
development. Although SMEs significantly contribute to the Gross Domestic Product in Indonesia, in terms of 
managing the business, a previous study showed that many SMEs continue to use the traditional approach, especially 
in the financial management aspects, so they are prone to failure. This study tries to explore the presence of financial 
management practice at SMEs in Indonesia which data are taken from 216 SMEs owners or managers. The study was 
conducted with the qualitative method with the in-depth interview approach through an online platform from January 
to April 2022. Results showed that present SMEs in Indonesia have better financial management practices that can be 
seen from 1) most SMEs have already recorded their financial report, 3) Most SMEs have moderate to high levels of 
financial literacy, and 3) their overall performance somewhat increases rather than previous years.

1. Introduction
MSMEs are one of the economic supports in Indonesia, this can be seen from the contribution of the MSME sector 
which is quite high to GDP, which is 61.07% or worth 8,573.89 trillion rupiahs in 2020 (Ministry of Cooperatives and 
MSMEs). SMEs also play a strategic role in the Indonesian economy by being a major subject in economic activity 
across various sectors, creating large employment opportunities, developing local economic activities and empowering 
people, creating new markets and sources of innovation, and maintaining the balance of payments through export 
activities (LPPI & BI, 2015). In 2019, according to the Ministry of Cooperative and SMEs showed that the number of 
SMEs in Indonesia has reached above 90% compared to the large industries (Mahdi, 2022) and the distribution of 
these SMEs concentrated in Java Island, such as central java province, east java province, and west java province 
detailed about the distribution of SMEs can be seen in Figure 1.

5. Conclusion  
From our study, it can be concluded that the financial management practice of SMEs in Indonesia has already gone to 
the next level. It can be shown from the implementation of financial management practices that 1) most SMEs have 
already recorded their financial report, even though most of them record the income statement report and cashflow 
report, 2) Most SMEs have moderate to high levels of financial literacy, and 3) their overall performance somewhat 
increases rather than previous years. 
Despite this satisfactory result, future research suggests conducting a study that includes the rural area with the same 
portion of the urban area, which expected can represent a better population.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to investigate and analyze the determinants of using digital payment platforms, as well as 
their implications for behavior and intention to use for some people who used mobile payment in Jakarta, Indonesia. 
This study uses primary data obtained by distributing online questionnaires to applicants who adopted and 
implemented the mobile payment platforms. Performance expectancy (PE), hedonic motivation (HM), facility 
condition (FC), social influence (SI), price value (PV), and perceived technical security (PTS). Platform trust in 
platforms (TP) as an intervening variable, plus behavior intention to use (BI) as a dependent variable. To conduct all 
the data, a multi-regression linear approach is used, along with some hypothesis tests. A total of 210 respondents as a 
target were reached through Google Drive forms questionnaires. The empirical findings revealed that PE and HM 
have significant effects on platform trust. While FC, SI, PV, and PTS do not influence TP. Further, SI, HM, and TP 
have a significant effect on the variable BI. Likewise, PE, FC, PV, and PTS have no effect on the dependent variable 
of BI. Eventually, Trust in Platforms is the intervening construct of SI, HM, and PTS on Behavior Intention to use. 
Meanwhile, the others, like PE, FC, SI, and PV, don’t have any influence on BI through TP. The study contributes to 
the literature by documenting the determinants of Trust in Platforms as well as the implementation of BI. It is expected 
to make a significant contribution since similar research is rarely conducted in Indonesia's context. It mitigates the 
frontier literacy by providing the empirical evidence and recommending that the topic needs more exploration and 
development on the platforms of mobile payments. To provide a recommendation to accelerate the growth of mobile 
devices. The findings could be appreciated from divergent perspectives. From a government perspective, it might be 
insightful to explore the utilization of developing convenient discretion of trust using a platform more professionally 
and responsibly to offer an acceptable device. The results might be used by the companies’ CEOs who want to compile 
future policies that focus on digital payments that have been rapidly spreading in recent years. This study has some 
limitations. First, we considered only the 210 respondents. Second, additional variables such as biographic factors are 
needed to obtain deeper results. Third, expand the research area to get more diverse respondents who carry out many 
digital devices.

1. Introduction
The presence of mobile payment platforms can make it easier for someone to conduct business transactions 
comfortably and safely. Users can transfer money using the platform by using various devices. In Indonesia, the 
potential for growth and development is very open. It can be seen from the increasing number of applicants. According 
to the Digital Indonesia 2021 Report, it reaches 345.3 million. In addition, the number of active internet users in 
Indonesia reaches 202.6 million, indicating that 73.7% of Indonesia's population currently accesses the internet. This 
number is expected to increase every year (Digital in 2021). In a study by Heikki Karjaluoto (2003), it indicates that 
while the diffusion of electronic delivery channels has been rapid, the management of digital customer relationships 
has become an important key. Ziqy Liao et al. (2002) concluded that how banks enhance their services through internet

Abstract 
The textile industry is one of the major industries and has a high level of integration for the country's economy. The 
use of the right method can increase good profits and make it easier for the company. The 4 countries with the largest 
textile industries include Bangladesh, China, India and Indonesia. Decision Tree is included in data mining that is 
used by many industries, one of which is the textile industry. The decision tree is in the form of classifying data in the 
form of classes and nodes, a method that is easy to understand and very capable of providing the effectiveness of a 
company's production process. This paper uses the C4.5, SVM and Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithms. The 
methodology used is Decisions Tree which has the right level of accuracy and classification for the textile industry, 
because it is very efficient, has a variety of models and a structured rule tree structure. This method is used to be 
implemented in the textile industry, including being able to predict fabric defects, and clustering information in the 
textile industry. The company wants quality fabric products. Classification is in the form of class and root so that it 
can determine the right level of accuracy and can determine the level of defects in the fabric whether later the fabric 
can be processed into finished products or not and inform the level of smoothness. A high level of accuracy is obtained 
from Percepetron Multi-Layer with a value of 83.6%.

Abstract 
The objective of this research is to systematically examine the trend of research references related to innovation 
management theory over the last ten years, from 2012 to 2022. This study will specifically look at the evolution 
of innovation management theory research and its application on a data-driven scale. This study used a mix 
method approach, combining bibliometric methods and a literature review. This study collects 51 data points from 
international publications with the keyword innovation management theory from 2012 to 2022, using the web 
scraping method and the Scopus database. According to the findings of this study, studies related to innovation 
management theory are dominated by several fields of study, including management, business, economics, finance, 
the environment, infrastructure, geography, and technology. According to the findings of this study, there are at 
least four major perspectives that are dominantly used in discussing this issue. Furthermore, this analysis discovers 
that the contexts that are frequently discussed are interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary issues. This means that 
when discussing an issue, a study will typically employ more than one viewpoint. The scope of the articles used, 
which were sourced from the SCOPUS database, is the research's limitation. In the future, the recommendations 
in this study can be used as hypotheses in addition to research with broader literature sources, and comprehensive 
and in-depth follow-up research can be conducted. The findings of this study are expected to serve as a resource 
for academics interested in studying innovation management.

1. Introduction
Studies of consumer attitudes, interests, and intentions to adopt products or services dominate consumer behavior 
and marketing. Resistance research, which investigates why consumers do not adopt products or services, is still 
limited and has received little attention (Demirbag-Kaplan 2018; Heidenreich and Handrich 2015; Ma and Lee 
2019a; H. Seth et al. 2020; Talke and Heidenreich 2014; Aaron van Klyton et al. 2021). Companies will always 
try to create attraction through various innovations, but problems will arise if consumers fail to respond to that 
attraction as novelty. 
Nowadays, it is extremely difficult to create a completely new or never-before-created attraction. As a result, the 
company's innovation efforts do not always succeed in attracting customers who perceive the offer as nothing 
new. However, this does not imply that innovation is pointless (Ram 1987). 
Successful innovation research has been widely conducted and has been enriched with various causal factors. 
However, the number of studies on innovation failure due to consumer resistance or rejection remains limited 
(Ram and Sheth 1989). Therefore, practitioners and researchers are still investigating innovation. 
Diffusion of innovation is a fundamental concept in comprehending the adoption of change, particularly 
technology, to better understand consumer needs and interpret it as a system design that provides convenience 
and broad benefits. However, Rogers (1962), a pioneer of the concept of diffusion of innovation, reveals that 
researchers are biased in their view of innovation, with innovation always connoted as positive, useful, and

S., Le Masson, P., and Weil, B., 2016). Comparative analysis and causal relationships are two examples of 
research methods used. In this field, descriptive qualitative methods are still the most used approach (Ma, C. A., 
Xiao, R., Chang, H. Y., and Song, G. R., 2022). Although quantitative methods, particularly the SEM, MRA, and 
QCA methods, are still widely used. 
Third, in terms of context or research scope, studies related to management, business, economics, finance, 
environment, infrastructure, geography, and technology predominate. Fourth, according to the review's findings, 
frequently raised issues include actor network theory, business performance, collaborative innovation, innovation 
management (Ghorbani, M., and Lames, M., 2016; Wu, C. W. 2016; Midler, C., Killen, C. P., and Kock, A. 2016), 
responsible research, technology management, business service, creative management, customer relationship 
management, intelligent, railway, modern organization, offshoring, operation management, property service 
enterprise, solid waste management industry, collaboration, learning management system, natural resources 
management, perception, role, emergency care service, nurses’ perception, pain management protocol, 
agricultural innovation platform, application, entrepreneurship, improved irrigation scheme management, 
management systems usage, transport infrastructure, building energy, conflict, environment management system 
innovation, top level sport, and internet financing. 
This study confirms that the visualizations that appear in network analysis are representations of issues that are 
frequently discussed based on the topics that are frequently researched. However, this review does not argue that 
low frequency is a minor issue. On the other hand, perhaps these issues (the outer core) are under-researched areas 
of study or approaches that are rarely used. This cluster may require additional attention in future research. 
This study formulates comprehensively and systematically the clusters of knowledge that are frequently used to 
support studies related to innovation management theory, based on the contextual framing of network analysis 
and supported by various innovation management theory literature. The findings of the analysis are shown below.

Table 2 shows that the review discovered at least four major perspectives that were commonly used when 
discussing innovation management. However, this does not imply that no other perspectives are used in addition 
to these findings. Of course, many unexplored perspectives remain unexplored because they are not dominant 
perspectives. Furthermore, this analysis discovers that the contexts that are frequently discussed are 
interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary issues. This means that when discussing an issue, a study will typically 
employ more than one viewpoint. One example is how the issue of internet financing in innovation management 
is approached from both a financial and technological standpoint. 
5. Conclusion
Based on the findings and discussion of this study, it is concluded that the highest growth development in the 
topic field of innovation management theory occurred in 2021 and 2016, with a total of 9 articles, from 2012 to 
2022. Furthermore, the review reveals that most of the journals that discuss the issue of innovation management 
theory extensively are business management journals. According to the findings of this study, there is no dominant

journal or publisher that discusses the topic of innovation management theory. This means that research in this 
area is still dispersed across different journals or publishers. Furthermore, development maps are classified into 
12 clusters based on co-occurrence and keywords. This review, on the other hand, abstracts research trends in 
innovation management theory into four major issues. To begin with, the research locations for the last ten years 
have been several developing countries in southern Africa and Indonesia. Meanwhile, based on the research 
approach used, the results of data analysis show that most of the research employs an empirical study approach 
and a case study. Although some studies are more theoretical in nature, such as the development and design of 
theories. Comparative analysis and causal relationships are two examples of research methods used. In this field, 
descriptive qualitative methods are still the most used approach. Although quantitative methods, particularly the 
SEM, MRA, and QCA methods, are still widely used. Third, in terms of context or research scope, studies related 
to management, business, economics, finance, environment, infrastructure, geography, and technology 
predominate. Finally, this study discovers that at least four major perspectives are dominantly used when 
discussing innovation management. However, this does not imply that no other perspectives are used in addition 
to these findings. Of course, many unexplored perspectives remain unexplored because they are not dominant 
perspectives. Furthermore, this analysis discovers that the contexts that are frequently discussed are 
interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary issues. This means that when discussing an issue, a study will typically 
employ more than one viewpoint. The scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the SCOPUS database, 
is the research's limitation. In the future, it is strongly advised to conduct research using a broader literature source. 
Furthermore, the findings of this study can be used as hypotheses, and comprehensive and systematic follow-up

Abstract 
Technology plays an important role in helping problems that exist in a company. One of them is at CV. Sukses Jaya 
Putra which often has difficulty knowing how much raw material to buy for the next period. so that there are often 
errors in purchasing estimates. This study aims to predict the purchase of raw materials in CV.Sukses Jaya Putra by 
using data records from the previous 14 months as much as 2,181 data to calculate predictions for the next period by 
comparing two methods, namely weight moving average and double exponential smooth. Researchers compared 
these two methods in order to find out which method has a smaller error value which means it is better at predicting. 
The results showed that the weight moving average was more accurate than the double exponential smoothing 
method with an average result of MAPE of 28.74% and for double exponential smoothing as much as 33.07%. 
While the results of the next period prediction with the results of 2,251,440.33 for the weight moving average 
method and 1,672,246.18 for the double exponential smoothing method. For further research, we suggest more 
variations of weights to be included in calculations using the double exponential smooth or weight moving average 
approach 
.

4. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the final project research that has been carried out, it can be concluded that the computational 
model mechanism for predicting raw material purchases at CV. Sukses Jaya Putra uses 2,181 data taken from 
CV.Sukses Jaya Putra and 2 methods, namely weight moving average and double exponential smoothing with a 
period of 3 months using a weight value of 1,2,3 for weight moving average and a value of α = 0.05 and β = 0.01 for 
double exponential smoothing. For comparison of the two methods, the results show that the weight moving average 
method is better because it has an accuracy value calculated by MAPE which has an average of 28.74% compared to 
double exponential smoothing which is at 33.07%. The prediction results for the next period with the results of 
2,251,440.33 for the weight moving average method and 1,672,246.18 for the double exponential smoothing 
method.

Abstract 
The ever-increasing development of technology has created many loopholes for software attackers to commit harmful 
crimes. Computer system users are vulnerable to malware attacks, the spread of malware (malicious software) is one 
of the most common computer security problems because it causes various kinds of losses. The technique used to 
detect the type of malware is malware classification. The method used in malware detection is the gradient boosting 
classification algorithm. The increasing development of malware makes technology users have to be careful in doing 
something. In this case, computer system security is very important. With the creation of malware detection, system 
security and information security can be better maintained. The Gradient Boosting Classification algorithm is an 
algorithm for classification that is effective and efficient in performing malware detection. Several other studies have 
proven this. The Gradient Boosting Classification algorithm can classify malicious software quickly and accurately. 
This research also uses the Portable Executable Header which contains metadata from the executable file. This 
research uses data taken from Kaggle with data sources from certain sites such as total virus and taken from the 
extraction of executable folders in windows. The results of the data set are divided into test data and training data with 
20% testing of the total data and then sorting some important features from the portable executable, resulting accuracy 
of the gradient boosting classification algorithm of 99.20%. Further research can be suggested to show more details 
of the detected malware in the malware detection system.

6.  Conclusion  
The system created in this study uses 79 attributes. The Gradient Boosting Classification Algorithm method is used 
because the method is a gradual gradient-based approach method to increase the effectiveness of the classifier. The 
Gradient Boosting Classification algorithm is an algorithm for classification that is effective and efficient in 
performing malware detection. The system made here also does not need to install the software so as not to burden 
the memory on the computer and efficiently can be done anywhere (online). With the creation of malware detection, 
system security and information security can be better maintained. This research uses data taken from Kaggle with

data sources from certain sites such as total virus and taken from the extraction of executable folders in windows. The 
results of the data set are divided into test data and training data with 20% testing of the total data, then sorting some 
important features of the portable executable, resulting in an accuracy of the gradient boosting classification algorithm 
of 99.20%. In previous research, malware detection using the gradient boosting classification algorithm using 57 
attributes resulted in an accuracy of 98%, it can be concluded that more attributes can affect accuracy results so that 
it becomes better.  
 
Future research is suggested to be able to display more details of the types of malware detected in the malware 
detection system and can add more data.

Abstract 
MSMEs have a very important role in the country's economy especially in Indonesia. The Covid-19 pandemic has had 
a negative impact on the economy in Indonesia. This also has an impact on MSMEs in Indonesia. The existence of a 
pandemic has made the development of MSMEs in Indonesia difficult. Apart from the pandemic, what makes it 
difficult for MSMEs in Indonesia to develop is the lack of utilization of current technology. This research aims to 
create graphical user interface of mobile application to help MSMEs in Indonesia, especially in the fashion industry. 
With this application, users can easily get information about fashion MSMEs originating from Indonesia. In addition, 
users and MSMEs can carry out buying and selling activities. This research use design thinking methods to describe 
design process of mobile apps. This research needs to be further development in order to implemented in MSME so 
that it can have a positive impact on MSME actors in the fashion sector.

1. Introduction
The development of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia has received special attention from 
several groups, including the government. In Law Number 20 of 2008, MSMEs are trades managed by business entities 
or individuals referring to productive economic businesses (Rahmini 2017). According to the Ministry of Cooperatives 
and MSMEs of the Republic of Indonesia in 2019, the number of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in

Abstract 
The number of people experiencing depression in Indonesia has increased rapidly. Many Indonesians need more 
attention so that these symptoms do not cause more serious problems. Depression itself has many patients who commit 
suicide. Knowing this gave me the impetus to create an application design that could be useful to overcome the 
problem of it. Now I'm trying to find out what happened to people with depression, then find out how many people in 
Indonesia have this disease. Then I used a questionnaire to find out this and 36 people answered it. With research on 
cases of this disease, eventually I will find some parts that will be discussed and then I can determine what solutions 
are suitable to solve this problem. I got many solutions, but from some of them I chose to take from one of them. The 
first solution will be adjusted to the number of application users by the community in Indonesia or the world, so from 
here I created a solution to help people with depression through apps. Furthermore, various ways will be followed to 
optimize this solution so that it can be accepted by the community. The solution took the doctor's recommendation 
from a paper from an institution. This makes it possible if the solution I take later will be more optimal and easier to 
apply. It's just that this provision will be adjusted to the theme of the application that I made. My hope is that the 
design of this application will be able to overcome depression in Indonesia, so that it does not continue to soar high. 
This is because if it is not handled, suicide cases will also arise.

Abstract 
An environmentally friendly life is a lifestyle where the things that are done or used do not harm the surrounding 
environment. Today, you can still find many kinds of garbage and waste that are not environmentally friendly, for 
example, plastic. The community environment is increasingly experiencing a decline in quality due to a lack of public 
understanding of education about environmental friendliness. This is the background of the author to find a solution 
to this problem. This study aims to determine the effect of eco-friendly packaging design on public education and 
interest in using it. This research design thinking method to describe design process of eco-friendly packaging. The 
solution offered by the researcher has an output in the form of a packaging design. From the results of the 
questionnaires that have been distributed, researchers can design according to the preferences of most people within 
the scope of the research survey. The solution target to be achieved is in the form of environmentally friendly product 
packaging designs that have an educational element. Elements of education can be in the form of instructions on where 
users should dispose of their waste, the type of packaging product that is used, and several other educations on 
environmentally friendly issues.

1. Introduction
Do people care about the environment around them? An environment is a place where many components of living 
things gather. In the process of life, the environment has stability that must be maintained. Recent studies have shown 
934","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
at the beginning of the manufacturing process. The output of this design process produces secondary packaging and 
primary packaging. Primary packaging is packaging that is in direct contact with the product. This packaging will 
later be addressed to food restaurant owners who serve takeaway food, which will later function as a dry and light 
food container, disposable because the material used is not able to hold water in the long term. While the second output 
to be produced is secondary packaging. Secondary packaging is packaging that is not in direct contact with the product 
but is in contact with the primary packaging. The purpose is to protect the primary packaging. This secondary 
packaging does not affect the quality of the product because it does not come into direct contact (Utami 2021). The 
important point of the design made is to be conveyed through the illustration of a leaf and the earth. Leaves are 
described as the environment and the earth as a life where both have a relationship to complement each other. The 
educational element is conveyed using instructions on where to dispose of the garbage because it is equipped with a 
recyclable logo, or it can also be considered biodegradable. (Figure 7) In addition, information about packaging such 
as the basic ingredient of the material is also provided, so that it is expected to provide insight into the views of the 
public. 
Colours selection is carried out in the drafting process. (Figure 8) The colours used in this design are colours taken 
from earth tone colours. Earth tone is a colour that has elements of the beauty of the earth (Nydia 2021). This earth 
tone colours comes from natural elements on earth, from the sun, green plants, soil, sand, sky, water to storms. Most 
of these colour tones have a pigment that tends to brown where these colours can create a feeling of calm, comfort, 
and warmth (Buehler 2021). The choice of this colours was chosen because it was in accordance with the theme that 
had been determined at the beginning, which was environmentally friendly. The choice of this colours is said to be 
appropriate because these colours represent the colours of the earth. The colours that have been chosen are believed 
to represent the elements of this earth itself. The use of typeface uses 3 types, namely sans serif, decorative, and script. 
Overall, the design does not use serif fonts because it wants to convey the information contained in the packaging in 
a light and relaxed way to look at. The choice of decorative font for the words ""Green Packaging"" was chosen because 
of its shape which resembles clipping writing, supporting the theme of the design, namely recycling. Then in the 
“Throw Me Away” section, the Helvetica font is used. Helvetica is a typeface with a neutral design so that it can be 
used in various designs (CNN Indonesia 2017). This typeface also has good legibility so it will be very suitable to be 
used as a marker or instruction.  
5. Conclusion
In this paper, research has been carried out on environmentally friendly packaging. An environmentally friendly life 
is something that we must start living for the health of the environment around us. We have seen from what has been 
discussed that the data shows that the waste produced is increasing every year, and without us realizing it this will 
have a bad impact on all aspects of human life and the earth. The main problem raised in this study is the lack of public 
understanding and education on environmentally friendly living, more specifically in using food product packaging 
and plastic bags. From these problems, a brainstorming process was carried out to find solutions to these problems 
and it was found to design an environmentally friendly food container packaging. The packaging material is planned 
to use cassava starch. The design process is carried out in several stages, namely making a design draft, sketch, final 
prototype, and final mock-up of the prototype. The original icon is made for this project a hand-drawn picture of the 
earth and leaves. After all the elements are ready, then proceed to the stage of merging design elements into the final 
prototype. In this paper, the prototype of the packaging that has been designed aims to become a campaign and provide 
education to the public. Another goal is to spread and invite more people and communities to use environmentally

friendly products. The prototype design consists of 2, primary packaging and secondary packaging of food packaging. 
This primary packaging prototype has a function as a food container with specifications, for snacks and not wet. As 
for the secondary packaging, it is a crackle bag that is used as a container for the primary packaging. From all the 
research that has been done, the product design that has been discussed in the conclusions above has been produced. 
It is hoped that this research can be useful for society and the environment. The product design that has been made is 
also expected to be an alternative solution so that research can be continued in the future.

Abstract 
This research aims to provide an AI diagnostic solution for small and medium-sized health facilities. The problem of 
medical resources shortages worldwide due to the growing population and the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years 
has become more severe than ever. However, some evolutionary techniques such as big data, AI, and cloud computing 
have been leveraged to provide digital transformation solutions with increased productivity in certain specifics. To 
prove that these techniques can bring benefit and health facilities by increasing productivity with faster, easier 
decision-more accessible abilities and end-to-end cloud data lakehouse-based solution will be designed and 
provisioned. Patient’s dataset collected from the real world will be used for test and evaluation purposes. Through the 
research, the architecture of the solution with AI techniques will be designed, tested, and evaluated. The solution will 
need to be provisioned to the production-grade environment to help targeted health facilities make more efficient 
diagnosis decision-making and save more lives as possible.

1. Introduction
Lack of medical resources has become a common sense not only in some third-world countries but also in developed 
countries, especially in recent years (Wu et al. 2016). Huge numbers of health facilities such as clinics or hospitals are 
working under high pressure, e.g., ICU, bed shortages, and overworked, exhausted hospital staff, mainly caused by 
the COVID-19 pandemic (Alharbi et al. 2020). 
With the development of evolutionary big data, AI and cloud computing have been widely leveraged to provide digital 
transformation solutions in many industries, e.g., medical and healthcare. A typical example would be some healthcare 
facilities that have been successfully creating business value and increasing productivity by using big data and AI 
techniques to process massive amounts of data (Vatandoost et al. 2019).  Those processes include making analyses by

It was verified that in the case of the accuracy, the difference between the use of various algorithms was small, which 
was caused by a small-sized dataset. This situation can make people struggle to select the algorithm with significantly 
higher accuracy. Fortunately, leveraging the majority voting-based ensemble bagging method has been proven through 
experiments to eliminate the risks of a single model’s misjudgment in a case like this.(Figure 11) 
 
6. Conclusion  
The experimental goals of this solution have been successfully achieved, and the cloud-based data lakehouse that can 
provide AI diagnosis services for small and medium-sized health facilities has been proved. Moreover, the solution is 
more advanced than other traditional data science solutions because it provides benefits such as better performance, 
more cost-effectiveness, etc. 
  
The entire solution is very beneficial for small and medium-sized health facilities where doctors and medical resources 
are frequently insufficient. All data analysis and prediction processes can be executed in batches, and the result can 
be provided to doctors through various charts to achieve a faster and more efficient diagnosis.

Abstract 
The Indonesian banking industry had the highest voluntary turnover rate in 2019. This might indicate a low level of 
employee loyalty in the Indonesian banking industry. Therefore, it was urgent for this research to investigate and 
explore the impact of leadership styles on employee loyalty and turnover intention in a bank in Indonesia. This research 
was conducted using a qualitative research method and the data were collected by conducting in-depth semi-structured 
interviews. Twelve employees and one senior human resource manager working at PT Bank XYZ were interviewed. 
Then thematic data analysis was used to analyze the data. The interview results indicated that leadership style had a 
strong impact on employee loyalty and turnover intention at PT Bank XYZ. Transformational and democratic 
leadership styles are the most suitable leadership styles to enhance employee loyalty and reduce turnover intentions 
of employees at PT Bank XYZ. Moreover, the interview results showed that there were eight main factors that were 
equally important that affected employee loyalty and turnover intention of PT Bank XYZ’s employees, such as: work-
life balance, passion for job, salaries, bonus and benefits, relationship with leader, relationships with team members, 
leader’s appreciation and respect, career path, and personal developments. It can be concluded that leadership style 
was the most crucial factor that influenced employee loyalty and turnover intention. Meanwhile, transformational, and 
democratic leadership styles were the most suitable leadership styles to enhance employee loyalty and to reduce the 
turnover intention of PT Bank XYZ’s employees.

1. Introduction
The banking industry has a vital contributory role in boosting global economic and financial growth through its 
functions. The efficiency of the banking system is a key determinant of sustainable global economic growth (Ghosh 
2017), while an effective banking industry is essential in assisting and facilitating economic growth (Jayakumar et al. 
2018). Moreover, a study indicated that banking credits had a positive and significant impact toward economic growth 
and the economy of the country (Abusharbeh 2017). Meanwhile, economic growth is important to any country in that 
it leads to a reduction in poverty, a creation of workspaces for employment, improvement in public services and living 
standards for its people. 
With an approximate population of 270 million, Indonesia has the largest economy in Southeast Asia and is ranked 
15th largest in terms of global nominal GDP (World Bank 2019). Despite being one of the fastest growing world 
economies and largest contributor to the ASEAN GDP, Indonesia has a low financial account penetration compared 
with other ASEAN countries (49%); meanwhile Singapore has 98%, showing a huge gap in financial account 
penetration in 2017. The development of the financial services sector including the banking industry will raise the 
financial account penetration in ASEAN countries and will lead to higher economic growth of a country through the 
enhancement of income equality and aid in poverty reduction (Loo 2019). This demonstrates a need for substantial 
growth in the banking industry in Indonesia. 
1.1 Challenges in Indonesian Banking Industry 
Indonesia’s banking industry is required to improve the facilitation and provision of banking and financial services 
through reducing the number of unbanked citizens and to further boost Indonesia’s economic growth. Despite this 
high need, Indonesia’s banking industry faces a detrimental issue in its employee loyalty evidenced by a voluntary 
957","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

sufficient as previous research only investigated which leadership style was going to enhance employee loyalty and 
reduce turnover intention. This research extended and improved the existing theory as this research not only sought 
which leadership style was the most suitable to enhance employee loyalty and reduce turnover intention; this research 
also investigated how leadership style impacted upon loyalty and turnover intention through the leader-member 
exchange relationships at PT Bank XYZ. This research also investigated how each leadership style affected the quality 
of leader-member exchange relationships that led toward the enhancement of employee loyalty and the reduction of 
turnover intention at PT Bank XYZ. 
 
 
Figure 5: Final framework 
 
All twelve employees working at PT Bank XYZ stated that they previously had intention to leave. Nine out of twelve 
employees would leave their job for better opportunities. There are push factors and pull factors that lead toward 
turnover intention of employees at PT Bank XYZ. Push factors are the factors that are related to internal issues such 
as bad leaders, underpayment, and issues with the community. Meanwhile, the pull factors are external factors related 
to better opportunities from other companies. The HRS Senior Manager also stated that all leadership styles were 
needed for different working levels in the company. The transactional leadership style was the most suitable for the 
lower working levels, whereas the transformational leadership style was the most suitable for the higher working 
levels. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendation  
Leadership style has a strong impact on employee loyalty and turnover intention. The transformational leadership and 
democratic leadership style were the most suitable leadership styles to enhance employee loyalty and turnover 
intention of employees working at PT Bank XYZ including the quality of the leader-member exchange relationships. 
The factors that affected employee loyalty and turnover intention in PT Bank XYZ included: work-life balance, 
passion for job, salaries, bonus, and benefits, relationship with leader, relationships with team members, leader’s 
appreciation and respect, career path, and personal development. 
 
Laissez-faire leadership style and autocratic leadership style had their own pros and cons from the employees’ and 
senior human resource manager’s points of view. Autocratic leadership style was most suitable for the sales team. For 
transactional leadership style, it existed at PT Bank XYZ as there was a system called the ‘Key Performance Index’ 
to track employee’s performance and to reward them based on their performance, contingent rewards as mentioned 
by Bass (1998). 
 
For the managerial implications, the findings of this research were not only beneficial for the specific banking industry 
in Indonesia, but it could also be beneficial for the financial services sector such as: investments companies, real estate 
firms, and insurance companies. Meanwhile, since this research was being conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
the interviews were conducted through WhatsApp online calls. Therefore, the facial expressions of the interviewees 
could not be observed during the interview process. Besides that, the researchers could not visit PT Bank XYZ because 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the researchers had limited connections in the company. These are the limitation 
of this research. This research would get higher validity and reliability if the researchers could get access to the 
managers of the interviewees for triangulation purposes. The interview with the HRS Senior Manager and the 
exploration of the company’s documents served as the triangulation for this research.

More units of analysis and connections in the company to get more detailed and comprehensive results to maximize 
the findings are recommended for future research. Moreover, conducting research in other banking companies in 
Indonesia will provide richer findings and comparison. Besides that, future researchers could also use a single 
quantitative method, or even mixed methods of qualitative and quantitative research methods together to gain richer, 
more accurate and valid insights on the data and findings.

Determining Synonymy of Risk and Priority in Maintenance 
Prioritization.

Abstract 
For many decades, the industry has been using risk as to the basis for prioritization of maintenance activities in the 
form of Risk Priority Number (RPN) and risk matrices. The risk here is defined as the product of severity and 
frequency. However, priority is defined as the product of importance and urgency. This study is to determine whether 
risk and priority are synonymous. For the determination, maintenance data for various trades were collected from two 
Malaysian hospitals. These data were then clustered for risk and priority using the K-means clustering algorithm and 
statistical tools. The results were sorted, ranked, and compared. The resulting comparison shows that risk and priority 
are metrics of different properties.  It was found that risk is a scalar magnitude while priority is a vector. Therefore, 
prioritization of maintenance by risk is a historical lagging indicator, while priority is a leading indicator and better 
predictor of future impact. 
Keywords 
Maintenance, Risk, Priority, Prioritization, and Urgency. 
1. Introduction
For many decades, the main priority schema for failures in the industry has been the risk priority number (RPN) (Kim 
and Zuo, 2018). RPN is the product of the severity of impact, the likelihood of occurrence, and the likelihood of 
detection of failures as shown in Equation 1. The likelihood of detection is only used when there is a control system 
in place. However, RPN only defines failure risk. The industry has been taking risk ranking as the basis for failure 
priority ranking, where higher risk means higher priority and a lower risk means lower priority.  
RPN = Severity x Occurrence x Detection. 
Equation 1 
1.1 Objectives 
The significance of priority ranking research lies mainly in budgets and the allocation of resources. When visibility to 
failure priority ranking is missing, then maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) are budgeted but it is then up to 
operation managers to ascertain the allocation priority of these budgets. The study expects to prove that risk ranking 
is not synonymous with priority ranking. It is expected that this study will show that risk is a scalar magnitude and 
priority is a vector. There should be clear vector direction differences when risk and priority rankings are compared. 
2. Literature Review
Industry activities in failure priority ranking have been using the severity and occurrence of RPN dimensions in risk 
matrixes to ascertain risk. For example, the Jack Knife Diagram shown in Figure 1, is a modified risk matrix that plots 
failures on a risk matrix of downtime and frequency. Failure priority ranking is then based on risk magnitude. The 
bottom right plotted failures are considered acute and chronic failures, thus, of high priority as compared to the left 
top bottom failures (Seecharan et al, 2018). For this paper, the risk is defined as a function of severity and occurrence 
where severity is represented by recorded failure downtime and occurrence by recorded failure frequency (Jianxing et 
al, 2021).

5.3 Validation 
The regressed line slopes for the plotted data at hand were taken as risk velocity. Priority was then calculated by 
multiplying risk values to velocity values. The resultant priority and ranking for each hospital and trade are tabled in 
Table 7 and Table 8 respectively. Risk values and their ranking were also tabled in the same tables for comparative 
analysis.

For comparison between risk ranking against priority ranking, the site types and trades were kept similar. From the 
comparison, it was found that risk values remain positive, while priority values had different polarities. In this case, 
civil trade for hospital one has different polarity or vector polarity from the other priority. This indicates a vectorial 
property as compared to scalar risk values. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of the study show that a failure risk is not a failure priority. Priority has an element of rate of risk or risk 
velocity. As proven in the study, this risk velocity is a vector and not a scalar magnitude. This vector gives an indication 
of the speed of risk to the realization of the risk. The study shows that prioritizing by risks is prioritizing by the 
magnitude of risk. It does not prioritize by the speed to impact. This is shown by the difference in priority ranking by 
risk (severity-frequency) and by priority (magnitude-velocity). Prioritizing by risk is a scalar activity, whereas 
prioritizing by speed to impact is a vector with magnitude and direction. Incorporating speed to impact or risk velocity 
in maintenance prioritization schemas is a better leading predictor of future impact on budgets and resource 
allocations.  Prioritizing purely on risk indicators such as risk priority number (RPN) is a lagging indicator that may 
or may not be a good future predictor. Further research in the usage of risk velocity in industrial maintenance 
prioritization is recommended.

Abstract 
 The purpose of this research study aimed to determine different factors and conditions affecting the tire   tread wear 
of a Dornier 328 aircraft. So many studies and experiments were done to reduce aircraft tire wear, but none were 
patented because most literature describing the physical process that causes aircraft tire rubber to vaporize under 
landing loads is sparse, although multiple studies have been reported in the automotive field. The methodology used 
was the Six Sigma and DMAIC methodology. To analyze the gathered data from the maintenance logbook of an 
aircraft charterer, the researcher also used the Design of Experiment. Based on the results of the experiment, three 
factors are statistically significant to the aircraft tire wear: the experience of the pilot, the length of the runway, and 
the age of the aircraft. Also, tests were used to determine the interaction between factors, and as a result, the 2-way 
interaction of pilot and runway gives the most significant interaction. These findings will help the charterer reduce 
their operational costs by minimizing the tire tread wear and also aid them in planning their flight schedules in 
consideration of the manning of the aircraft and its destinations. Also, a decrease in rubber production for new tires 
will have a positive environmental impact. The findings will also serve as a guide for further studies by future 
researchers on other factors that might be contributory to the reduction of tire tread wear which the researcher was 
not able to consider due to some constraints.

1. Introduction
Six Sigma methodology focuses on business improvement. Any company wanting to improve numbers must decrease 
the number of defective products or services as its output. A defective product (tire wear) can harm customer 
satisfaction levels as well as their safety. A company that wants to implement Six Sigma principles has to find a way 
to minimize cost wherever possible without reducing quality and compromising security.

Cube Plot (fitted means) for Tire Thread Measurement 
Figure 9. Cube Plot Analysis for Tire Tread Measurements 
Fitted means are useful for assessing response differences due to changes in factor levels. For the measurements of 
tire tread, the cube displays all combinations of three factors at two levels and the fitted mean for each combination. 
Assessing the results of the means, we can see that from all combinations, the least of all the means is 4.89623, and 
to achieve that, the combination must be for the pilot to be experienced, the aircraft to be new and the runway to be 
short. (Figure 9) 
6. Conclusion
It says that tire life is dependent on the specific pilot. Based on the result from the cube plot (fitted means) for tire 
tread measurements, we can see that to achieve the least mean (tire tread measurement), the pilot should be 
experienced, short runway, and new aircraft. Some pilots seem to impact the runway hard, which gives even less time 
for the up spinning off the tires, and certainly more wear on the tires. This is one of the advantages of having an 
experienced pilot handling the aircraft. 
But we all know that the distance of runway to be used is our uncontrolled variable, we cannot always choose a 
destination with a short distance runway since an aircraft charterer always pleases its customers for business purposes. 
For the age of an aircraft to be used, the charterer makes the most of its life span and what they can do is to strictly 
implement their preventive maintenance so as not to shorten its life span as well as ensure that their aircraft is worthy 
of flying. 
Based on the summary of the findings and conclusions presented, the following recommendations were offered: 
1. Management of PSAI – to be aware of the importance of skills upgrading for their pilots so as not to limit their
manning schedule to experienced pilots only but skilled pilots, (a pilot can be a newbie but skilled). It can be done by
implementing a program for continuous training and attending seminars.
2. Pilots   – One of the uncontrollable variables in the experiment/study is the runway, but a pilot can be a contributor
in lessening the encounter of an aircraft running on a runway with soft spots and damaged areas which causes an
aircraft tire to be damage. A pilot must maintain a reporting system for any encountered damaged part in the runway

(cracked, soft spot, or areas waiting for repair) to the dispatcher to be reported to the traffic controller and for the latter 
to issue a memorandum notice for issuance to all pilots’ concerns.  
Also, the pilot should minimize the use of hard breaking and instead use medium breaking to avoid damaging the 
tread of an aircraft tire. 
For the non-optimal combinations, the following are recommended: 
a.
Newbie Pilot/ Old Aircraft/ Long Runway – avoid tight turns that place high lateral loads on tires. If tires
were subjected to such conditions, these tires can experience external damage to the tread or sidewall,
internal damage to the casing structure, or bead unseating with consequent pressure loss.
b.
Newbie Pilot/Old Aircraft/Short Runway – avoid a hard landing which most newbie pilots experienced
during short runways.
c.
Experienced Pilot/Old Aircraft/ Short Runway – avoid a hard landing because an old aircraft might not fully
support the tires compared to the new ones which might damage the tread or sidewall of the tires.
d.
Experienced Pilot/Old Aircraft/Long Runway – long taxiing for an old aircraft but manned by an
experienced pilot will not cause the same damage as if the pilot is a newbie which means that this
combination still will not achieve the ideal combination to achieve the least damage to the tread of an
aircraft.
3. Aircraft Maintenance Technicians – to be aware that no matter how experienced a pilot is to man the aircraft, still
the safety of flying is also partly dependent on how well they maintained the airworthiness of the aircraft itself.
4. Future researcher – To verify and strengthen the results of this research study and may use other kinds of
experimentation such as environmental factors like hotness or wetness of runway due to changing seasons which
this researcher was not able to conduct due to several constraints.

Abstract 
Loans and their derivatives are one of the most important sources of income for financial services institutions such 
as banks and multi-finance companies. Challenges happen when customers cannot pay their monthly installments 
or are defined as bad credits. The use of data mining has been known to be able to predict the suitability of new 
credit applicants. Variables significantly influence the accuracy of car credit ratings. Although there have been 
many studies related to the determination of credit rating, they still have a low level of accuracy because of these 
variables. In this study, we use the Naïve Bayes method and combine it with credit scoring to weigh each variable. 
We also added more specific variables to increase the accuracy level. 10.000 data from a leasing company in 
Indonesia were used and produced a suitability level of 8,6%. Calculations using credit scoring get a suitability 
value of 79%. Based on the test results, prospective debtors using the Naive Bayes method have an accuracy of 
approximately 89%. Further research is needed with better use of data that is already eligible for the convenience 
of the data training process.

1. INTRODUCTION
Car loans have become a source of income for various leasing or private companies and agencies that lease their 
credit services to consumers; even so, it can be seen that some consumers have bad credit, such as arrears and 
other things that result in not being able to continue credit payments (Heryono and Kardianawati 2018), in 
providing credit, companies get advantages and disadvantages, such as the PT.MAF leasing company provides 
car loan services for credit applicants and benefits from credit interest payments. Two thousand one hundred 
consumers are experiencing bad credit, where the average credit has a payment delay of 1-5 months of unpaid 
arrears.  
The default can stop the flow of money and cause losses to the company, and unexpected factors are one of the 
reasons why consumers experience bad credit (Luhriyani 2016). To address this problem, a system using the Naive 
Bayes  method and credit scores will be developed to filter the consumers who will apply for credit and reduce 
the risk of congestion.(Pattekari, S.A.; Parveen 2012) Classification is the process of finding models or features

4. Conclusions and Suggestions
Based on the final project research results, it can be concluded that the computational model mechanism for the 
classification of auto loan dignity using the Naive Bayes method and the credit scoring model, branch can classify 
and determine the dignity of prospective debtors in making auto loans. 
To determine the level of the worthiness of prospective auto loan debtors using the Naive Bayes method results 
in a level of worthiness of 8,6% for Worth results and 0 for Not Worth results, and calculations using credit scoring 
get a value of 79%, these results can state that prospective auto loan applicants can be declared Worth to make 
auto loans, and to determine Worth or Not to make auto loans and to use a credit scoring model where if the score> 
70% the applicant can be declared Worth making credit so that the debtor gets an auto loan dignity, the two 
methods should produce a Worth value and a score of> 70%. %. The test results were conducted using the k-fold 
cross-validation method with k = 10, and the confusion matrix test results show that the accuracy of the Naive 
Bayes method is 89%. We suggest that for further research, it is better to use data that already has value for the 
convenience of the data training process. Further research is needed regarding the relationship between criteria 
and the accuracy of the creditworthiness prediction. Further research is needed with better use of data that is 
already eligible for the convenience of the data training process.

Abstract 
Sentiment analysis is one of the areas of application of text analysis and NLP (Natural Language Processing). It 
builds a system to identify and analyze personal information from textual sources, which are generally divided 
into positive and negative categories. Many case studies are chosen to measure the accuracy of the computational 
model of sentiment analysis. In this study, we use social media's perception of electronic wallets usage. The Naïve 
Bayes method was chosen. It can help classification because it is assumed to be an independent variable, and 
Lexicon is used to calculate the weight of each word. Although several studies have been conducted on sentiment 
analysis, none have used non-standard word correction. The use of non-standard word correction deals with non-
standard words such as slang and word abbreviations. This research begins by digging up the required data, namely 
the keyword electronic wallet. The standard word dictionary normalizes non-standard words, preprocessing data 
with four stages: case folding, tokenizing, stop word, and stemming. The lexicon dictionary produces positive and 
negative labels, and nave Bayes is used to classifying. The data used in this study were 3878 tweets, with a 
distribution of 70% training data and 30% test data. Sentiment analysis obtained in this study shows that Twitter 
users in Indonesia are more likely to give negative comments to electronic wallets. The results of this study 
indicate that by using both methods and adding standard word corrections and testing using RapidMiner, the 
accuracy rate for classifying positive and negative sentiments reaches 88.56%. Further research can add 
Levenshtein Distance normalization to the classification results to better influence the accuracy value.

1. Introduction
The development of information technology is increasingly advanced in today's digital era. Not only as a medium 
of information and communication, but many people also use social media to express their opinions, feelings, 
experiences, and other things that concern them(Troussas et al. 2013). Not a few netizens also use Twitter as a 
place to express opinions, and these opinions contain positive and negative sentiments. Sentiment analysis is a 
method of collecting comments and comments from other people about something, such as an issue on a web-
based social network(Alsaeedi and Khan 2019). 
Social media data is one way to perform sentiment analysis. Social media can generate thousands of tweets or 
opinions every day(Medhat, Hassan, and Korashy 2014). People in Indonesia use social media to channel their 
opinions and opinions about various things. The case study taken by researchers is the trend of e-wallet 
applications that have been trending on Twitter regarding the problem of conceding balances in several electronic 
wallet applications to be used as sentiment analysis material because this electronic wallet application is being 
widely used by the public, especially in online transactions. Indonesia has provided several electronic wallets,

Figure 2. Software Implementation 
The Figure 2 above is the result of the implementation of the software created. The software performs pre-
processing, which has a case folding, tokenizing, and stemming process based on the category of e-wallet 
applications in Indonesia. 
The image above is the result of tweets that have been processed, carried out a standard word repair process, and 
then classified with classification steps using a lexicon dictionary and classification using naïve bayes. It can be 
seen from the tweets that have been successfully classified into positive sentiment and negative sentiment. 
 
3.3 Test Result 
The data in this research is taken from a collection of Indonesian tweets taken from each customer's Twitter 
account using RStudio, then stored in CSV and excel. The keywords discussed use hashtags. The data used and 
cleaned as many as 3,878 comments. The ratio between training data and test data is 70:30, with 70% training 
data and 30% test data. Table 9 shows the distribution of training and test data.

The accuracy calculation is carried out using the RapidMiner tool, as shown in Table 10. The accuracy calculation 
itself is needed to see whether the performance of the lexicon-based and naïve bayes methods is as expected, and 
it can be seen in the accuracy calculation itself in equation 6 below.

From the data results in the table above, with a total of 970 tweets, 464 true positives and 506 true negatives were 
obtained. These results show that the recall and precision presentations are between 83% and 94%. The use of 
naïve bayes produces an accuracy of 88.56% for the accuracy of classifying positive and negative sentiments. 
 
4 Conclusions 
Based on the results of the research that has been done, it can be concluded that the computational model 
classification mechanism in the sentiment analysis of e-wallet applications in Indonesia on Twitter social media 
shows that Twitter users in Indonesia are more likely to give negative comments on electronic wallet applications. 
By using the naïve bayes and lexicon methods and standard word repair, the accuracy rate is 88.56% for the 
accuracy of classifying positive and negative sentiment tweets on electronic wallets. This level of accuracy shows 
that sentiment analysis using the naïve bayes and lexicon methods and standard word repair is quite good because 
the resulting accuracy rate is 88.56%.

Abstract 
In maintaining auditor independence, the regulation on auditor switching is set if after five consecutive years of 
auditing a company it must perform auditor switching. Auditor switching can be an indication of problems in a 
company or signify the presence of auditors that have low performance. This study aims to determine the effect of 
company growth, management change, audit report lag, and financial distress simultaneously and partially on auditor 
switching in the infrastructure, utilities, and transportation sectors listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016-
2020. The population in this study is the infrastructure, utilities, and transportation sectors listed on the Indonesian 
Stock Exchange 2016-2020 period. The sample in this study was 155 sample data consisting of 31 companies for 5 
years. The method used is logistic regression and descriptive statistics with SPSS 26 software. The results of this study 
indicate that company growth, management change, audit report lag, and financial distress simultaneously affect 
auditor switching. Partially, management change has a positive effect on auditor switching, while company growth, 
audit report lag, and financial distress have no effect on auditor switching. This research is expected to be an insight 
for investors who do not want to invest in companies do auditor switching voluntarily then look for companies that 
do not often do management change.

1. Introduction
Financial statements are important reports for companies in order to get investors interested in the company and decide 
to invest. In maintaining the financial statements, they will be audited before being used. In maintaining the 
independence of an auditor, auditor switching is applied. The government makes regulations for auditor switching, 
namely the Regulation of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia Number 17 of 2008 concerning Public 
Accountant Services Article 3 which states that auditing services are limited to 6 consecutive financial years for public 
accounting firms and 3 consecutive financial years for public accountants (Lianto, 2017). Auditor switching is divided 
into two, namely voluntary and mandatory. Voluntary auditor switching is a voluntary change of auditors or 
management who dismisses auditors, while mandatory is mandatory auditor switching (Lianto, 2017). 
 Voluntary auditor switching was carried out by the company PT Garuda Indonesia in 2018. Public accountants Kasner 
Sirumapea and Public Accounting Firms Tanubrata, Sutanto, Fahmi, Bambang and Partners gave unqualified opinions 
on financial statements that experienced irregularities. PT Garuda Indonesia recognized trade receivables with PT 
Mahata Aero Teknologi amounting to USD 239 million to revenue, causing a one-year license suspension and fines 
to public accountants, and PT Garuda Indonesia conducting voluntary auditor switching (Hartomo, 2019). From this 
case, it can be concluded that the presence of auditor switching in a company can be an indication of a problem with 
the company or auditors who have poor performance.

5. Results and Discussion 
Hypothesis 1 states that company growth, management change, audit report lag, and financial distress simultaneously 
affect auditor switching. As shown in Table 5, the significance level value is 0.049 which is smaller than 0.05 (5%) 
so it can be interpreted that company growth, management change, audit report lag, and financial distress 
simultaneously affect auditor switching in the infrastructure, utilities, and transportation sectors listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange in 2016-2020. 
 
Hypothesis 2 states that company growth has a positive effect on auditor switching, because the more companies 
increase, the greater the need for auditors who have higher professionalism. Table 6 shows that the significance level 
value is 0.449 which is greater than 0.05 (5%). These results indicate that hypothesis 2 is rejected, namely company 
growth has no effect on auditor switching. This is because if the previous auditor was able to meet the company's 
needs, management will not perform auditor switching and it will not become a basis for the company to conduct 
auditor switching if the company has decreased or increased total assets. These results support the research of Tjahjono 
and Khairunissa (2021) as well as Mardasari and Triyanto (2020). 
 
Hypothesis 3 states that management change has a positive effect on auditor switching. Table 6 shows that the 
significance level value is 0.009 which is smaller than 0.05 (5%). These results indicate that hypothesis 3 is accepted, 
namely management change has a positive effect on auditor switching. This is because with the new management 
there will be a downturn in developing a better company by doing auditor switching, so that by replacing auditors with 
those of better integrity, they can maintain the trust of users of financial statements and there is no suspicion of 
cooperation between companies and auditors. These results support the research of Anggraeni and Hestyaningsih 
(2020) as well as Wulandari and Suputra (2018). 
 
Hypothesis 4 states that audit report lag has a positive effect on auditor switching, because the presence of audit report 
lag will state that the auditor has poor quality. Table 6 shows that the significance level value is 0.366 which is greater 
than 0.05 (5%). The results of this study indicate that hypothesis 4 is rejected, namely audit report lag has no effect 
on auditor switching. This is because the speed or duration of the auditor in completing the independent audit report 
does not become the basis for the company to perform auditor switching and if the auditor switching is carried out, it 
does not guarantee that the new auditor can complete the audit faster than the old auditor. These results support the 
research of Naili and Primasari (2020) as well as Susanto (2018). 
 
Hypothesis 5 states that financial distress has a negative effect on auditor switching, because the presence of auditor 
switching can make the company's finances worse. Table 6 shows that the significance level value is 0.228 which is 
greater than 0.05 (5%). The results of this study indicate that hypothesis 5 is rejected, namely financial distress has no 
effect on auditor switching. This is because financial distress cannot be considered by companies to conduct auditor 
switching and companies experiencing financial distress do not have a strong desire to increase shareholder 
confidence. These results support the research of Anggraeni and Hestyaningsih (2020) as well as Naili and Primasari, 
(2020). 
 
6. Conclusion 
In maintaining the independence of an auditor, auditor switching is applied. Auditor switching voluntarily can be an 
indication of problems in a company or signify the presence of auditors that have low performance. But there are still 
many companies in Indonesia do auditor switching voluntary, so this study conducted a test to determine the factors 
that cause auditor switching. This study aims to determine the effect of company growth, management change, audit 
report lag, and financial distress on auditor switching in the infrastructure, utilities, and transportation sectors listed 
on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016-2020. The method used is logistic regression and descriptive statistics. The 
results of this study indicate that company growth, management change, audit report lag, and financial distress 
simultaneously affect auditor switching. Partially, management change has a positive effect on auditor switching, 
while company growth, audit report lag, and financial distress have no effect on auditor switching. For the further 
research, it is expected to be able to add independent variables such as capital structure or others and to use a wider 
research object so that the research result more relevant. This research is expected to be an insight for investor if don’t 
want to invest in companies do auditor switching voluntarily then look for companies don’t often do management 
change. For the company, it is expected to be able to add insight if the company does management change too often, 
the higher the company will do auditor switching voluntarily.

Abstract 
Many phenomena do not follow a symmetrical distribution. In order to obtain accurate conclusions, the analysis 
used for this phenomenon can be adjusted to the nature of the data distribution that is not symmetrical, for example 
the gamma distribution. The gamma distribution can be extended into a regression model. The gamma regression 
relates a positive response variable following a gamma distribution to one or more predictor variables. In this study, 
we explore a gamma regression with the gamma distribution has three parameters. This paper also presents the 
parameter estimation, test statistics, and hypothesis testing for the significance of the parameter. The method used 
for parameter estimation is Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which is optimized using numerical iteration, 
namely Berndt-Hall-Hall-Hausman (BHHH) algorithm. Maximum Likelihood Ratio Test (MLRT) is used for 
simultaneous test, whereas the Wald test is used for partial test. The developed gamma regression model is applied 
to the education index with three predictor variables, among others, the percentage of households to private toilet 
ownership, population density, and the percentage of poor people. The unit of observation is regency/city in Java, 
Indonesia, of the year 2018. The results show that modeling using multiple predictors is better in terms of accuracy 
of prediction as well as the interpretation. The future work of this research is how to involve geographical factors as 
a spatial effect in the model.

1. Introduction
The gamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution that has a positively skewed (Sallay et al., 2021). Its 
three parameter consists of shape, scale, and location parameters. Gamma regression is a type of non-linear 
regression that contains at least one non-linear parameter (Bravo et al., 2021; Pan et al., 2019). Chakraborty and 
Chakravarty (2012) developed properties and parameter estimations method for discrete gamma distributions. Song 
et al. (2021), who conducted a study of parameter estimation for four-parameter exponential gamma distribution and 
asymptotic variance of its quantiles. Nagar et al. (2021) studied some properties of a bimatrix variate Kummer-
gamma distribution, like the moment generating function, marginal and conditional distributions, and the moments. 
The gamma regression model relates the response variable that follows gamma distribution to the predictor variables. 
The gamma regression model proposed in this study is the based on the Trivariate Gamma Regression (TGR) 
presented by Rahayu et al. (2019) and Multivariate Gamma Regression (MGR) presented by Rahayu et al. (2020), 
which describes the parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. In this study, the parameter estimation method

4. Conclusions and Future Research 
The proposed gamma regression model in this paper includes hypothesis testing and parameter estimation methods. 
The method used for parameter estimation is MLE with numerical optimization to get the solution. In this study, 
numerical optimization employs the BHHH algorithm. The hypothesis testing simultaneously using MLRT and 
partially using the Wald test. The proposed gamma regression model is applied to model the education index of 
regency/city in Java with three predictor variables. Besides that, empirical results show that modeling using multiple 
predictors is better in terms of accuracy of prediction as well as the interpretation, than modeling using single 
predictor. The future work of this research is how to involve geographical factors as a spatial effect in the model.

Abstract 
Floods and landslides often hit disaster-prone areas in districts of Indonesia, causing casualties, damage to housing 
units, and damage to fields and plantations. National Disaster Management Agency calls for increased preparedness. 
One of them by doing technology-based disaster mitigation. Geofencing plays a vital role in implementing several 
disaster management mitigation strategies. Previous studies have used geofencing in administration, finance, and 
security. We conducted this research to apply the haversine formula in disaster management mitigation using 
geofencing in a district in Indonesia. By utilizing GPS technology, the signal of a cellular device can be tracked or 
monitored. If an object with a cellular device approaches or enters the geofence area, it will automatically receive a 
notification that it is approaching or in a disaster-prone area. We carried out this research in several stages. These 
stages collect data from a list of disaster-prone regions in the West Bandung Regency, analyze software 
requirements, and conduct software development, including testing. We recorded the latitude and longitude of each 
area to provide a virtual fence to establish that the area is a disaster-prone area. All of this will result in a system that 
can monitor people who approach or enter the geofence area, calculate the distance between the object and the 
center point of the geofence area and send notifications about it with high accuracy. However, this system only can 
use with the Android operating system. We suggest developing this system, so Android and iOS operating systems 
can use it.

1. Introduction
Natural disasters, physical losses, and social losses are inseparable. When a disaster occurs, physical and social 
failures are inevitable, especially for areas that fall into the category of disaster-prone regions with a very high level 
of risk, such as several areas in West Bandung Regency (Passarella et al. 2018). Currently, some stages aim to 
reduce the impact of disasters by implementing disaster management, namely disaster mitigation (Agustina et al. 
2020). Disaster mitigation has several strategies in its implementation, ranging from mapping, monitoring, 
information dissemination, and education to early warning. Understanding disaster mitigation can reduce casualties 
(Ramadhan, Sukma, and Indriyani 2019). Based on this, we propose to use geofencing technology for disaster 
management mitigation in West Bandung Regency.  
Geofencing research appeared in Munson and Gupta's research literature in 2002 (Munson and Gupta 2002). Several 
studies on geofencing have also been carried out in the security field (Insani 2020)(Priono and Setiawan 2017) and 
in the field of disaster prevention or management (Suyama and Inoue 2016)(Suwal et al. 2015).

In the experiments we did, there was a system result that showed the results of the calculation of the closest distance 
calculated by the system. The pass or file status is given based on the system result. If the system result shows the 
closest distance correctly, then the status is ""pass"". If the system result does not show the closest distance correctly, 
then the status is ""fail"". Based on the experimental results in Table 7, the system can calculate the closest distance 
between the object location and the location of the flood/landslide-prone area correctly because from experiment 1 
to experiment 5, the system result has a “pass” status. 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, we create disaster management mitigation software using the concept of geofencing in the West 
Bandung Regency to convey information on flood/landslide-prone areas to visitors or the local community. The 
software we build can send notifications to users when users enter or out of flood/landslide-prone areas in West 
Bandung Regency. In addition, the software we have built can calculate the shortest distance between users and 
locations prone to flooding/landslides so that users can be prepared when approaching the area.  
There are weaknesses in this study, where mobile devices can only use this software with the Android operating 
system. We suggest developing this software, so Android and iOS operating systems can use it. Also, in the closest

display the distance calculation results without going to other features of the software or pressing the button first.

Abstract 
This paper aims to find the influence of the regional wealth, local government size, leverage, and opinion audit from 
the Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia on the government's internet financial reporting in district and city 
governments of Central Java Province, Indonesia in the period 2017-2020. Based on the results of research on regional 
wealth, the size of the regional government, leverage, and BPK audit opinion simultaneously affect Internet Financial 
Reporting (IFR). partially, the size of the local government and the BPK audit opinion has a significant effect, but 
regional wealth and leverage have no effect on internet financial reporting (IFR) on internet financial reporting (IFR). 
The sample selection technique in this study was using purposive sampling and the data is presented by panel data 
analysis and processed using the EViews 12 application. 
Keywords 
IFR, Government, Reporting, Accountability, Transparency. 
1. Introduction
The issuance Republic of Indonesia Law No. 14 of 2008 concerning the disclosure of public information, transparency 
and availability of public sector information is growing. The law explain that the government is obliged to provide 
public information more transparently, responsibly, and service-oriented to community in a way that is easily 
accessible, fast, efficient, and easy to understand. The government must create accountability for the public disclosing 
financial information to increase public trust (Mariani and Utami, 2019).  
To make financial statements transparent, it can be done by build and develop the official website of local government. 
Internet financial reporting is part of e-government that can be improved by providing information to the public about 
financial accountability to improve relation with the society. Juniantika and Hapsari (2020) local governments can use 
the government’s official website to publish their financial statements through the internet. The government must 
provide easy to access financial report using local government official website (e-government). In accordance with 
agency theory, internet financial reporting is important because as a government media provide by the government, 
which is an agent provides information related to the public. With access to financial information, the public can 
monitor and assess the government’s performance in managing its finances (Annisa and Murtini, 2018) 
Instruction of the Minister of Home Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia Number 188.52/179/SJ that local 
government’s official website has a menu Transparency of Regional Budget Management (TPAD) or other names that 
refer to financial transparency. Currently all district and cities in Central Java have official website to provide

financial performance. Public wants fair financial report on financial management so the government that receives an 
unqualified opinion is compliant with regulations in preparing financial reporting. Local government tends to do 
internet financial reporting. This study in line with Nor et al. (2019) and Sofyani and Dwirama (2019) study that BPK 
audit opinion has a significant positive effect on internet financial reporting. However, the result of this study is 
different from study of Idris et al. 2018 and Mariani and Utami (2019) which stated that BPK audit opinion has no 
effect on internet financial reporting.  
6. Conclusion
Partially, local government size has a significant positive effect on internet financial reporting, the greater assets 
owned by the government, the greater size of local government size, resulting greater public control of internet 
financial reporting to determine government financial management. BPK audit opinion partially has a significant 
positive effect on internet financial reporting, the better local government audit opinion increasingly encouraging local 
governments to conduct internet financial reporting. This study partially finds no evidence that regional wealth and 
leverage have no effect on internet financial reporting. 
The researchers only conduct research in district and cities in Central Java, it is hoped that the future researchers can 
conduct in other districts and cites to find out internet financial reporting in other districts and cities. The next 
researcher is expected to able to add other variables that may influence the internet financial reporting.

Abstract 
The type of currency market or capital market investment that we know is commonly called forex or foreign exchange. 
Forex is one of the investments that gets a lot of attention today. The methods used in this research are Neural Network 
Backpropagation and Exponential Moving Average. Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) is an Artificial Neural 
Network that moves forward and has no repetition where the signal is from the input neuron to the output neuron with 
a 3-9-1 architecture where 3 inputs, 9 hidden layers and 1 output, while Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type 
of Moving Average that adds weighting in close price movements with the EMA range used is 50. Dataset collection 
through the website www.tradermade.com to retrieve API and then to retrieve offline data from the site 
www.eatradingacademy.com with the period January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2022 for the 1-day timeframe and January 
3, 2021 to June 30, 2022 for the 1-hour timeframe. Then the data processing is carried out. The data will be divided 
into 80% training data and 20% testing data which will be used in the data processing process. The purpose of this 
research is to predict foreign exchange rates in the foreign exchange business using the BPNN and EMA methods to 
predict future prices. The predicted currencies use 5 currencies with the highest volume transactions such as 
EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CAD and AUD/USD. Accuracy used for testing using MAPE with an 
accuracy value of 1.3338 for EUR/USD, 1.6160 for USD/JPY, 1.3118 for GBP/USD, 1.2997 for USD/CAD and 
3.2058 for AUD/USD. The average of the MAPE values is 1.75342.

3.3 Training Backpropagation Neural Network 
The method used is Backpropagation Neural Network for forex price prediction. This prediction process creates a 
model. Prediction results from training data in the form of MAPE and labels. The label here is a new array of prediction 
results that will be output after the training and testing prediction process is carried out with a distribution of 80% of 
the training data.  
 
3.4 Testing Backpropagation Neural Network 
After the model has been trained, the model will continue with testing using 20% of the data. Testing Backpropagation 
Neural Network (BPNN) will produce an output in the form of predictions. 
 
3.5 Results and Validation 
After the prediction results are obtained, the accuracy of the prediction results is carried out using Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error (MAPE). Then choosing which of the two data with a higher level of precision is evaluated with the 
MAPE parameter, conclusions will be drawn on the basis of the analysis results obtained. 
 
4. Data Collection 
This data daily from eatradingacademy.com and real time data from tradermade.com. Because it uses API, the data is 
always updated over time and uses endpoints. Then the training data was obtained from the eatradingacademy.com 
site with a daily time frame, 4 hours and 1 hour. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
The results of the backpropagation training model in Jupyter Notebook are used to predict test and training data. As a 
result of calculating and evaluating the error difference of the test data, the MAE value of the EUR / USD currency is 
0.0325, and the error difference of the training data is 0.0315. Figure 2 shows the expected performance of the test 
data. The blue dots represent the actual data, and the red dots are the prediction results of the test data.

4 Conclusion 
 
 
 
Figure 3 Architecture of Backpropagation Neural Network 
The backpropagation method is used to train 3879 lines of data in a 3-9-1 network architecture (3 input layer nodes, 
9 hidden layer nodes and 1 output layer node). (Figure 3) The backpropagation model generated from the training was 
used to test 969 lines of test data. It has a margin of error of 0.0325 from the actual data. While the backpropagation 
model used to test the training data as many as 3879 paths has an error margin of 0.0315. You can use the 
backpropagation algorithm to predict forex prices. The backpropagation algorithm for this training model can be 
implemented on your website or application. The predicted currencies use 5 currencies with the highest volume 
transactions such as EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CAD and AUD/USD. Accuracy used for testing using 
MAPE with an accuracy value of 1.3338 for EUR/USD, 1.6160 for USD/JPY, 1.3118 for GBP/USD, 1.2997 for 
USD/CAD and 3.2058 for AUD/USD. The average of the MAPE values is 1.75342.

Abstract 
NFT, or non-fungible tokens, are online certificates of ownership that can be traded based on data units stored in 
digital ledgers belonging to blockchain technology. This is non-fungible, meaning that it cannot be exchanged and is 
unique. NFT has been around since 2014. But now, it is increasingly being considered as a practical method for trading 
digital artwork or art. To buy NFT assets, you require special coins in the form of NFT coins, which consist of various 
types, such as mana coins, sand, axes, and other NFT coins. The NFT coins are used to process NFT purchase 
transactions. The movement of NFT coins over time is relatively erratic and uncertain. This NFT coin price prediction 
will be very useful for investors to know how the investment flow of each price works because the price of each NFT 
coin will change from time to time. through the literature study stage, interviews, and viewing daily NFT coin price 
data where the attributes used are date, open, high, low, close, and volume. The method used in this research is k-
Nearest Neighbours. Dataset collection through the website www.coinmarketcap.com for the period January 1, 2019 
to December 31, 2021. Then the data processing is carried out. An accurate NFT coin price prediction model can help 
investors in considering transaction decisions because NFT coin prices, which tend to be non-linear, will allow 
investors to make predictions. This study aims to obtain the predicted value of NFT coins using the k-Nearest 
Neighbours algorithm.

1. Introduction
The trend of non-fungible tokens (NFT) has been increasing in recent times. This is because the public's interest in 
buying and selling digital assets and works of art through NFT is getting higher. One of the reasons for the growing 
popularity of NFT is the rapid development of digital technology. The increasing public interest in crypto assets

6. Conclusion
The conclusions from the research carried out are: From the experimental results of the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) 
method on the dataset using the parameter values of K 3, 5, and 7, it can be concluded that the KNN model that has 
the best accuracy is KNN with a value of K = 3. The greater the value of K, the greater the value of Mean Square 
Error and Mean Absolute Error. The research conducted predicts the Close value of the NFT coin price in a period of 
1 day. 
Subsequent research will add more datasets used, so that the resulting error is smaller, and the results are more 
accurate.

Abstract 
Implementing an innovative business model and determining the right strategy can be the key to the success of a 
business. Using this research, the researcher tries to find an innovative business model suitable for eco-friendly 
products and then formulate the most appropriate business strategy. Eco-print craft technique is one of the textile craft 
arts. Eco-print craft is a system of tracing leaves on a piece of fabric and steaming it. This eco-print technique is 
natural and does not use artificial chemical elements. This research elaborates on the nine building blocks of the 
business model canvas in the eco-print business. Each block will act as a blueprint strategy for every aspect of the 
company, such as marketing, financial, operation, and value creation. As a result, the researchers suggested 
implementing personal selling, opening an offline workshop, and developing skills and knowledge of the eco-printers. 
Personal selling and workshop would build a bond between the customer and company to increase the repurchase 
intention. Developing skills and knowledge is important to enhance quality and minimize product defects.

1. Introduction
The fashion industry is one of the fastest-growing industries (Thee, 2009). In Indonesia, the fashion industry is one of 
the most significant contributors to the creative sector, which can improve Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product 
(Bisnis.com, 2019). The players in the fashion industry are competing to create products that are not only functional 
but also have characteristics and uniqueness that become an added value in fashion products (Bhardwaj & Fairhurst, 
2010). Various types of uniqueness and characteristics in the fashion industry become a unique attraction for 
entrepreneurs involved in this industry. Individuality in the fashion industry is created by utilizing knowledge in craft 
art to be an added value in producing fashion products. The product will have uniqueness and more value compared 
to other fashion products. 
Crafts, a sub-sector of the creative economy, play an essential role in creating values and competitive advantages in 
the fashion industry (Darmawan & Setiawan, 2019). With the existence of craft arts, especially textile crafts, many 
unique things with different values will enrich the fashion industry. Eco-print craft technique is one of the textile craft 
arts. Eco-print craft involves tracing leaves on a piece of fabric and steaming it (Wirawan & Alvin, 2019). This eco-
print technique is natural and does not use artificial chemical elements. This technique supports the concept of 
sustainable fashion, where the eco-print is considered safe for the environment (Nissa et al., 2014). The entire process 
carried out in eco-print is unique. The results generated from each process will never be the same. Therefore, the eco-
print process results are exceptional and can add value to their products. Customers who buy eco-print products get 
not only a functional fashion but also a unique, different, rare, and environmentally friendly fashion. All materials and 
manufacturing processes are natural and do not pollute the environment. As we all know, eco-friendly fashion product 
becomes the best alternative to decrease pollution and reduce waste (D. P. Alamsyah, Aryanto, et al., 2021; Pandey et 
al., 2020). 
The main challenge faced by eco-print products in Indonesia is brand awareness. Prospective consumers do not 
understand what offer this product has. Several eco-print craftsmen (eco-printers) find difficulties in marketing these

printers is essential so that companies can continue to produce quality eco-print products and minimize the occurrence 
of failed products. (Figure 2) 
 
6. Conclusion  
Implementing an innovative business model and determining the right strategy can be the key to the success of a 
business. Having a product with more value and competitive advantage compared to other products is sometimes not 
enough. Innovative strategies are needed so that the value message can be appropriately conveyed to potential 
customers. The strategies resulting from this research are functional strategies that can be used and applied in the eco-
print business. The researcher hopes that by applying the strategies that have been analyzed previously, the company 
can create innovations in the eco-print business model so that eco-print can be more widely known by fashion product 
lovers and convey its values well to their users. The implementation of the research strategy is also expected to help 
eco-print business actors to be able to continue to work and introduce the uniqueness and beauty of eco-print products. 
So that in the future, eco-print products can be enjoyed by a wider audience. This research certainly has limitations; 
It did not study the business prototyping level. Research on prototyping deals with feedback from customers about 
eco-print products. This feedback can provide a broad and in-depth picture of products used for business continuity. 
Research at the prototyping level is recommended for further research. This research can provide better results and 
recommendations for businesses, help the progress of local Indonesian products, and introduce products to the broader 
community.

Abstract 
PT LCI produces two types of precast: centrifugal concrete and non-centrifugal concrete. The company's main 
problem is a defective product in December 2021 with a defect percentage of 4.12%. In addition to defective products, 
in the production process of Jacking Pipe 450 mm, there is waste, namely activities that do not add value to the product, 
reducing product activity. This study aims to reduce waste and improve quality by applying Lean Six Sigma can be 
used with the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control stages. Define stage in the form of diagrams Supplier-
Input-Process-Output-Customer and Critical to Quality product. The Measure stage calculates Defects per Million 
Opportunities (DPMO), sigma level, Process Cycle Efficiency, and Value Stream Mapping. The Measure results are 
calculated (DPMO) of 19867.54 units with a sigma level of 3.55 sigma, Process Cycle Efficiency (PCE) of 51.46%, 
Manufacturing Lead Time of 12.978 Hours, Exit Rate of 11.64 Units/Hour, and Process Velocity of 2.31 
Activities/Hour. The waste is found in the form of defective products and waiting time. The tools used in the Analyze 
stage are Ishikawa diagrams and FMEA. This is used as the basis for proposed improvements at the improvement 
stage. The Control phase is the implementation of the proposed improvement activities in the form of cleaning the 
mold using mold oil, adding mold inspection activities with checklist tools, making machine work instructions and 
daily check sheet overhead cranes, and minimizing setup time. After the implementation, the DPMO value is 16666.67 
units, equivalent to 3.62 sigma level, PCE value is 58.08%, Manufacturing Lead Time is 11.499 hours, Exit Rate is 
3.48 Units/hour, and Process Velocity is 2.61 Activities/Hour.

Conclusion 
From data processing and analysis of the results that have been obtained, the conclusions obtained in this study are: 
 
1. Types of defects that occur in the production process of Jacking Pipe 450mm are porous, impermeable cracks, 
and segregation. Based on Pareto, the dominant defects to be repaired are porous defects and impenetrable 
cracks. 
2. Waste that occurs in the production process is in the form of waiting time and product defects. 
3. The obtained DPMO value is 19867.54, and the sigma level is 3.55 sigma. Based on the calculation, the PCE 
results are 51.46%, Exit Rate is 11.64 Units/hour, and Process Velocity is 2.31 activity/hour. 
4. The causes of the problems that occur are that there are still traces of concrete in the mold, the Jacking Pipe 
is shaken when moving with an overhead crane, and workers are not careful enough to check the mold before 
opening the mold. Proposed improvements to the problems that occur are using mold oil which helps clean 
used concrete, adding mold inspection activities with special Checklist tools for opening molds, and making 
work instructions and daily check sheets for overhead crane machines. 
       5. The results after the implementation of several proposed improvements in the minimization of defects, the 
initial DPMO value was 19867.54, the sigma level was 3.55, and after the implementation, the DPMO value was 
16666.66, and the sigma level was 3.62. Then the results of the implementation estimate in reducing lead time in the 
initial production process have a PCE of 51.46% to 58.08 %.

Abstract 
Medication non-adherence is a health problem often found in the global community. According to Lars Osterberg, 
M.D, about 30% of adult patients in America fail to take their medication at the appointed time, causing an estimated
$100 billion in possible costs each year. Along with the development of information technology, interventions have
been carried out on non-adherence to medication in patients. Previous research developed an automatic treatment
application by sending notifications in email and SMS messages on time according to doctor's recommendations;
Unfortunately, now SMS messages have almost been replaced with chat application services. This study aims to
overcome the focus by performing automatic reminders using cloud computing technology with job scheduling sent
via cellular notifications, email, and WhatsApp so that treatment reminders will be delivered faster using cloud
computing. This research begins by designing an auto-reminder function. After the design is complete, it is continued
with the implementation phase of the drug reminder application. In the testing phase, ten notifications were sent via
WhatsApp, cellular, and email, received by 30 respondents, and sent simultaneously on each media with an average
time interval of approximately 2 seconds, 7 seconds, and 18 seconds, respectively. The test concluded that all
notifications sent with the last ten users experience a delay of approximately 18 seconds for each notification media.
In future research, it is recommended to implement this notification technology on Wearable Devices so that it is
expected to make it easier for patients to receive notifications during their treatment period.

1. Introduction
Medication adherence is the process by which patients follow their medication as prescribed, consisting of 3 main 
components: initiation, implementation, and discontinuation (Walsh et al, 2019). Many factors contribute to 
medication non-adherence, one of which is the individual level of the patient (e.g., low health literacy) (Zullig et al, 
2017). The human factor is one of the causes of medical errors, an exciting topic in patient safety. It is understood that 
the human condition has poor memory, false senses, and poor response to physiological stress (Robson, 2013). In 
general, there are four categories of medical errors. One of these categories is Preventive Error; Preventive Error can 
come from insufficient supervision or lack of follow-up care (Al-Assaf et al, 2003). As a medical human being, 
mistakes are a huge problem; therefore, even though the costs incurred are significant, it is necessary to avoid the 
injury and death of many people (Al-Assaf et al, 2003). The forms of prevention that have been used include 
medication reminder applications. Today's life is full of responsibility and stress. So, people are prone to various 
diseases, and we must keep ourselves fit and healthy. If the patient stays at home, he may ask someone to take care of 
him, but when someone is not at home, is out of town, or is away from home, it is difficult for family members to 
remind them. They are timing their doses each time (Ameta et al, 2015).

CPU resources when running the scheduling process using job scheduling are at ±5% CPU usage, and the percentage 
of CPU usage can drop to ±4%.

When testing the delivery of 30 notifications, CPU resources increased by approximately ±4% from 43%. Metrics can 
be seen in Figure 8. 
4. Conclusion
This study focuses on implementing and testing the automatic medication reminder notification function, which is 
implemented on a mobile app and backend using job scheduling techniques on a cloud virtual machine. Notifications 
are sent via mobile notifications, email, and WhatsApp. In this study, the test results conclude that the experiment of 
sending ten notifications sent to 30 respondents received all notifications and experienced a delay of 18 seconds for 
the last ten users for each notification media. The Job Scheduling process on the backend does not take up a significant 
CPU load because it only consumes ±5% of the CPU processing on the virtual machine used in this study.

Abstract 
 COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of corona virus, namely SARS-CoV-2. The most common 
symptoms of COVID-19 victims are fever, dry cough, and fatigue. This virus has spread to almost all 
countries, including West Bandung Regency. Transmission of this virus can be directly transmitted from 
one person to another, of course this is what causes the number of COVID-19 cases to continuously 
increase. So far, the use of COVID-19 vaccines is being developed, some of which are still in the 
experimental stage. However, a vaccine that is truly effective against the COVID-19 virus has not yet 
been found. Therefore, this study aims to classify the level of COVID-19 cases in Bandung Regency to 
predict the spread of the corona virus and suppress the number of COVID-19 cases so that it does not 
continue to increase. The method used in this research is to use one of the data mining algorithms, 
namely the Naive Bayes algorithm as a classification.

1. Introduction
Since 2019, the world has been shocked by the innovation of a new disease in the City of Wuhan, China 
which is claimed to use COVID-19. Coronavirus is an RNA virus that has a particle size between 120-
160 nm. This virus usually attacks certain animals, including bats and camels. There are several types of 
coronavirus, including alphacoronavirus 229E, betacoronavirus HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Illness 
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 
Coronavirus belongs to the betacoronavirus genus (Susilo et al., 2020). 
 Previous studies have grouped the level of COVID-19 cases at various levels. West Bandung is one of 
the regencies in Indonesia, which consists of 16 sub-districts and 165 villages. Based on information 
from the West Bandung Regency COVID-19 Monitoring Data, as of February 2, 2022, the total number 
of cases was 24453 while 19327 positive cases were confirmed. Therefore, patients with a high or 
positive level of urgency are prioritized for treatment compared to patients with moderate or 
asymptomatic symptoms. (Liliana et al., 2021) Of course, medical personnel need to help classify patient 
status automatically to reduce fatigue of the medical staff on duty and minimize the risk of patient delays 
in treatment. Therefore, there is a need for a data-based automated technology solution that can help 
classify emergencies according to patient data. (Rahmayadi et al., 2021)  Classifying using the nave 
Bayes algorithm is the main choice because its accuracy and simplicity are one of its advantages. 
Although simple, the results obtained are always comparable to other algorithms (Nurdiana & Algifari, 
2015) . Research that has been carried out by Nunu Nurdiana, Abijar Algifari proves that the results 
obtained using the nave Bayes algorithm obtain an accuracy value of 2%. Naïve Bayes obtained 76% 
accuracy and 74% ID3. (Saputra et al., 2018) 
 This study aims to provide a solution to the classification of COVID-19 cases, especially in the Bandung 
Regency area. Using the Naïve-Bayes algorithm method for classification. (Ikbal et al., 2021) By

4. Conclusion
The Naive Bayes Algorithm method used to classify Covid-19 cases in West Bandung Regency resulted 
in a fairly good accuracy of 94% where out of 16 training data, 1 of them was classified as incorrect. It 
can be seen that the Covid-19 cases in West Bandung Regency tend to be high in only a few sub-districts. 
And it can also be concluded that the level of COVID-19 cases in West Bandung district is in a fairly 
high category for several sub-districts.

Abstract 
Service climate constitutes a critical factor for logistics service provider (LSP) as a service company especially during 
COVID-19 pandemic in order developing its supply chain resilience and performance. Service climate refers to 
logistics service providers (LSP) employees' perceptions about how their companies appreciate them if they provided 
the excellent service for their customers. Supply chain resilience refers to capability of logistics service providers 
(LSP) in preventing disruptions and reducing the impact of disruptions in accordance with the extent of their readiness, 
quick response, and recovery. Whereas the performance relates to the logistics service providers’ achievement in 
certain period in terms of operation cost, service level, service speed, and customer value. The study intends to 
investigate the mediation effect of supply chain resilience on the effect of service climate on firm (LSP) performance. 
The service climate is an exogenous variable, supply chain resilience is a mediating variable, and LSP-performance 
is an endogenous variable. This study used cross-sectional, survey, and quantitative methods. Purposive sampling 
used in this study with sample size consist of 48 respondents and questionnaires or g-form as tool for collecting data. 
SEM-PLS (Smart-PLS) was used in this study to process the data and examine the mediation effect and further analysis 
its implication and discussion. The results indicated that supply chain resilience partially mediate the effect of service 
climate on LSP-performance. 
Keywords: Service Climate, Supply Chain Resilience, Firm Performance, Logistics Service Provider 
1. Introduction
84% of companies report discussed the resilience (PwC, 2021). Resilience constitutes one of very important firms’ 
capabilities to sustain their business performance in the disruption era. It was required to meet customer demand that 
have changed due to disruption in order that achieving superior customer value and service quality. Therefore, business 
resilience requires support specific business culture that reflects flexibility, adaptability, proactive, innovative, 
anticipative, etc. Some studies showed that corporate culture had positive and significant impact on business resilience 
(Sawalha, 2015; Fietz, Hillmann, and Guenther, 2021) and business performance (Chen and Kao, 2014; Cheng, Hong, 
and Yang, 2018; Tian, Tang, and Tse, 2022). Whereas business resilience had positive and significant effect on 
business performance (Beuren, dos Santos, and Theiss,2022; Baral et al., 2022). Whether or not service climate as 
part or specific condition of corporate culture and supply chain resilience as part of business resilience have positive 
and significant impact on firm performance? Does the supply chain resilience mediate the effect of service climate on 
firm performance? These are the questions that will be answered in this study. 
Based on the research questions, this study aims to investigate the effect of service climate has positive and significant 
effect on firm performance through supply chain resilience. This study tries to examine four hypotheses, namely

6. Conclusion
Supply chain resilience mediated the effect of service climate on performance of logistics service company (LSP-
performance) significantly.  The mediation effect constitutes partial mediation, this meant that in improving 
performance of logistics service provider can be conducted through improvement of their service climate directly or 
indirectly through their supply chain resilience.

Abstract 
The C4.5 algorithm is one of many data mining classification techniques. The final result in the classification of this 
algorithm is the creation of a decision tree. This tree helps in making predictions and selection. The c4.5 algorithm is 
widely used in many cases, such as outpatient services, disease prediction, etc. It's just that for the c4.5 algorithm 
method in the construction of chatbots, only a few apply it. More cases of implementing chatbots using Semantic Web, 
NLP, etc. This study focuses on the c4.5 algorithm method and its application in chatbots because, in previous studies, 
it was still rare to implement chatbot services in hospitals using this algorithm. The c4.5 algorithm method in this 
study will be carried out on a chatbot because in predicting poly hospital services for selection, it is more suitable to 
use this algorithm. The data used were obtained from the Azra Hospital Bogor, totaling 3,292 data after the data 
cleaning process with the classification results using the c4.5 algorithm, namely getting the RMSE (Root Mean 
Square) / Mean value of 12.66%. This number means that the lower the average prediction error, the less. That means 
that from the total data used, 315 data experienced wrong predictions, and 2,977 other data were predicted correctly. 
Gradient Boosting was also carried out to reduce the prediction error rate by 0.66% after being tested seven times. In 
the future, this research is expected to improve the classification test time.

1. Introduction
Chatbots have been widely used in the development of chat service technology. The advantages are that they can run 
without human supervision, minimize chat errors by admins, and provide quick responses at any time (Amato et al. 
2017)(Oh et al. 2017). Chatbots assist users in doing many things, such as getting information, entertainment services, 
health services, customer services, and others (Mostaço et al. 2018). The chat response displayed to the user can vary 
depending on the concept and complexity of the technique itself. The more complex the program code, the more 
complex and diverse the responses that can be generated (Adamopoulou and Moussiades 2020).  
The C4.5 algorithm method is used in this study to create a decision tree to implement the outpatient poly service 
chatbot (Mardi 2017). The c4.5 algorithm has been widely used in various fields, one of which is in health services 
such as: predicting emotions, healthcare system monitoring, and others (Nuzulia 2020)(Tamin and Iswari 2017). There 
are several advantages to using this algorithm. Namely, it can handle numeric attributes and missing values and can 
trim branches (Sharma and Kumar 2016). This algorithm was chosen because one study comparing the use of ID3, 
C4.5, and C5.0 found that the most powerful and preferred method in machine learning is C4.5 (Bimo et al. 2020).

4 
Can chatbots respond to anything 
other than /start and /poli ? 
No 
The chatbot now only supports the /start and 
/poli commands. Otherwise, the chatbot will 
not respond to anything. 
5 
The /poli chat command works 
fine 
No 
If, while filling out the input form and the 
user misses or does not fill in one of the input 
criteria, the chatbot will stop functioning. 
6 
Can chatbots handle complex 
questions? 
No 
Because the chatbot that was built is only 
intended for the development of the selection 
of poli services. 
5. Conclusion
The research focused on implementing the c4.5 algorithm on the outpatient poly service chatbot. The applied algorithm 
focuses on processing outpatient medical record data in hospitals to provide options for poly service recommendations 
to chatbot users. Users can enter input criteria as a reference to the algorithm to choose the appropriate service for the 
user. The results of this study chatbot can provide a response in the form of an outpatient poly name to the user. It can 
be concluded that the application of the c4.5 algorithm in the selection of outpatient poly services in hospitals can be 
applied to the chatbot. With this application, it is hoped that users can be helped to choose the appropriate service 
through a chatbot.

Abstract 
In general, learning media is widely used to share needed information, especially for the health of people with 
diabetes. Still, few people can understand health education for people with diabetes, and special attention is needed 
for sufferers, especially the elderly, to maintain a lifestyle of food, drink, and exercise. Lack of understanding in 
health discussions and insight often causes many people with diabetes to experience complications of other diseases, 
so in this study, we used interactive media to support health understanding by using design thinking approach 
technology that can make it easier for sufferers to understand diabetes, because of a direct approach with sufferers. 
The design thinking method has five stages, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test, which are carried out to 
help solve problems by adjusting to the needs of sufferers and used as a reference in application development. The 
final stage of this research is to test the respondents to determine whether the solutions applied can solve the 
patient's problems. The test was carried out using a questionnaire given to 50 respondents from the general public 
with complaints of diabetes symptoms, giving a calculation result of 80.2% agreeing that the respondents felt helped 
by the Ayasha application. Suggestions for further research are necessary additions that include the presentation of 
more comprehensive information about diabetes and a feedback feature for users to make it easier to understand, and 
further updates are needed.

1. Introduction
Design Thinking is an innovation-centered approach that takes design tools to integrate as needed. Design Thinking 
can be applied to increase ideas in meeting solution needs that can integrate technology into innovation thinking, 
and the design process also encourages creative ideas to build products (Chou 2018). The Design Thinking approach 
is used in designing educational applications to maintain normal sugar levels for people with diabetes to determine 
how to maintain normal sugar levels for sufferers (Lazuardi and Sukoco 2019). 
The Design Thinking method used in the empathy, define, ideate, prototyping, and testing stages can help the user 
experience solving problems as needed by using the google form media for distributing the questionnaire, having 
diabetes for more than three years, taking 50 respondents to understand the needs and problems that users get after 
distributing the questionnaire, After getting a solution to the problem then making this design based on the 
validation results that have been made previously. After the application creation is complete, it is necessary to test 
the respondents to determine whether the solution can solve the problem. The questionnaire given to 50 respondents 
presents the ease of using the AYOSEHAT educational application (Syabana and Saputra 2020). A comprehensive 
thinking process that concentrates on creating solutions begins with an empathetic process. This stage makes

5. Conclusion
This research has produced an educational application about introducing healthy food to maintain normal sugar 
levels in diabetics, which is implemented using the design thinking method. This educational application was built 
to provide learning through interactive media in the form of various kinds of food, drinks allowed to be consumed 
by diabetics, and types of exercise that diabetics can do. The Ayo Sehat application has been tested on 50 
respondents by trying to run the Ayo Sehat application. From the results of the test questionnaire shown in table 4, it 
can be concluded based on the responses given by the respondents that the Ayo Sehat application meets the 
percentage of 80.2%, so the application of the interface and learning information has been applied to the Ayo Sehat 
application.

Abstract 
Audit quality is an auditor's tendency to detect and disclose an error or fraud that occurs in a client's accounting system. 
This study aims to determine the effect of audit tenure, audit fees, and client importance on audit quality both 
simultaneously and partially. The population in this study were all companies in the infrastructure, utility, and 
transportation sectors listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2015-2020 totaling 81 companies. The 
sampling technique used purposive sampling with predetermined criteria obtained from 20 companies with a total 
sample of 120 data. This study uses logistic regression analysis using SPSS version 25. The results of this study 
indicate that simultaneously audit tenure, audit fees, and client importance affect audit quality. Meanwhile, partially 
the audit tenure has no effect on audit quality. This is because the length or short tenure of a public accounting firm 
with a client does not always affect the attitude of the auditor's independence so that it cannot reduce audit quality. 
Audit fees have a significant positive effect on audit quality. This is because the greater the fee given to the auditor, 
the more motivated the auditor will be to improve his performance on duty, so that the resulting audit quality is high. 
while client importance has a significant negative effect on audit quality. This is because of the possibility of economic 
dependence that makes the auditor not objective and independent in doing his job. Further researchers can use other 
independent variables that have not been included in this study. In addition, further researchers are expected to conduct 
research with different objects. This is intended so that research can provide new insights and a broad picture of what 
factors affect audit quality. And it is expected that companies that have gone public will prefer to engage with large 
public accounting firms, namely the big four public accounting firms because they can produce better audit quality 
than non-big four public accounting firms. Good audit quality can develop the company's ability in its business, so 
that the financial statements presented can be trusted by investors. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Financial reports can be used as one of the decision-making bases as well as to guarantee the third parties and 
community that financial reports can be trusted. In order to gain clients’ trust, an audit process is required on the 
financial statements done by the external auditor. A financial reports audit is essential to the needs of companies and 
management parties of the company to gain the public’s trust. Thus, financial statements do not mislead investors in 
deciding on investing. 
According to De Angelo (1981) in Purnomo and Aulia (2019), audit quality is the probability of an auditor finding 
and reporting an error or deviation occurring in a client accounting system. Moreover, according to Yolanda Siregar 
(2018) in Renaningtyas (2020), a competent auditor is related to an auditor’s skill in detecting misstatements in the 
client’s financial reports. However, auditors are not always able to produce high-quality audits because they cannot 
detect an error or fraud in the financial reports. It is proven by some cases that occurred, such as cases of PT. Garuda 
Indonesia Tbk and PT. Inovisi Infracom Tbk, which in the end was sanctioned by the Financial Services Authority 
(OJK) due to cases of bribery and fraud in the company’s financial reports.

Based on the results of the regression coefficient test in Table 8 shows that: 
 
1. The regression coefficient value from audit tenure is 0.380, and the significance level is 0.206. The value is 
greater than the significance level (α), which is 0.05. Thus, H2 is rejected, meaning that audit tenure does not 
affect audit quality. These results do not align with the hypothesis that the researcher has put forward that 
audit tenure has a negative effect on audit quality because the longer the bond between the client and the 
auditor can lead to a loss of auditor independence. However, the results of this study indicate that audit tenure 
does not affect audit quality. The results of this study align with research conducted by Fauziyyah and 
Praptiningsih (2020) and Novrilia et al. (2019), which states that audit tenure has no effect on audit quality. 
It is because the tenure of the public accounting firms with the client cannot be used as a comparison or 
measure of audit quality. It is because the long tenure of public accounting firms does not always affect the 
attitude of auditor independence, so it cannot reduce audit quality. In addition, the short tenure of public 
accounting firms also cannot always determine the reliability of audit quality because the auditor may not 
have sufficient knowledge and experience in conducting audits on the clients’ companies. 
 
2. The regression coefficient value of the audit fee is 2.701, and the significance level is 0.000. The value is 
smaller than the significance level (α), which is 0.05. Thus, H3 is accepted, meaning that the audit fee affects 
audit quality. These results are in line with the hypothesis that the researcher has put forward that audit fees 
have a positive effect on audit quality. The results of this study are in line with research conducted by 
Renaningtyas (2020) and Pramaswaradana and Astika (2017), which state that audit fees have a positive 
effect on audit quality. It is because the greater the fee given to the auditor, the more diligent the auditor will 
be and improve his performance in the duties so that the resulting audits quality is high. Most companies in 
the infrastructure, utilities, and transportation sectors choose to pay higher fees due to producing quality audit 
reports and increasing the credibility of the company’s financial reports. These results indicate that the 
company prefers to pay a larger audit fee to use the big four public accounting firms to audit its financial 
reports so that the produced quality is better. 
 
3. The value of the regression coefficient of client importance is -62.560, and the significance level is 0.001. 
The value is smaller than the significance level (α) of 0.05. Thus, H4 is accepted, meaning that client 
importance has a negative effect on audit quality. These results are in line with the hypothesis that the 
researcher has put forward that client importance affects audit quality. Because the direction of the coefficient 
of client importance on the client importance variable has a negative effect, indicating the more important 
the client is to the auditor, the resulting audit quality is low because it makes the auditor not objective and 
independent. The results of this study are in line with the research conducted by Devi et al. (2019) and Wahyu 
(2020), which state that client importance has a negative effect on audit quality. It is because most companies 
with important non-big-four public accounting firms clients make it possible to produce low audit quality. It 
is economic dependence which makes the auditor not objective and independent. When the auditors find 
something deviant in the client’s financial reports due to fraud, auditors tend not to report it because they feel 
that if it is reported, it will make the client no longer want to use the services of the auditor again, which will 
have an impact on the auditors’ income.

6.2 Recommendations 
This research is expected to be additional information to add insight and knowledge in the field auditing regarding 
audit quality. Further researchers can use other independent variables that are not included in this study such as auditor 
specialization, audit switching, publication age, company size, and audit committee. Moreover, the next researchers 
are expected to do research with different objects. It is intended so that research can provide new insights and a broad 
picture of what factors affect audit quality. Also, it is expected that the go public companies prefer to perform 
engagements with large public accounting firms, namely big four public accounting firms, because they can produce 
better audit quality than non-big four public accounting firms. Good audit quality can develop the company’s ability 
in its business so that investors can trust the financial reports presented.

Abstract 
The tourism industry is growing dramatically today. Many tourism industries provide information on the internet to 
the prospective tourists. Quality of information, quality of service and quality of design are components that build 
quality confirmation on the travel website. Quality confirmation, travel website satisfaction and decision-making are 
three main aspects for the industry and researchers to investigate how prospective tourists decide to visit tourism 
location through the travel website. Nevertheless, the prospective tourists address some problems in the travel website, 
such as the lack of information on the website, the design of the website and so on. As a result, prospective tourists 
are puzzled as they try to make a decision as to where they are going to visit. The aim of this research is to analyze 
the correlation between the quality of the travel website and the satisfaction of the travel website and the subsequent 
impact on the decision-making. The method is to analyze 300 respondents who have already used the Trip Advisor 
website. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings indicate that quality of 
information, quality of service and quality of design have the positive effect on the quality confirmation of travel 
websites. Then the quality confirmation of the travel website affects the satisfaction. Finally, to this satisfaction, the 
prospective tourist decides to visit the tourism location. This study allows the industry and the researcher to realize 
more thoroughly what prospective tourists need when they plan to travel. 
Keywords 
Quality of Information, Quality of Service, Quality of Design, Tourism Website Satisfaction, Decision-Making. 
1. Introduction
The digital information age has changed global tourism in profound ways. Information and Communication 
Technologies (ICT) are pervasive, and they have become inextricably linked with contemporary consumer cultures 
(Gössling, 2021). In the 21st century, 95 % of prospective tourists have used website to collect travel-related 
information and 93 % visited the travel website, approximately half of the tourists used e-mail to collect information 
about the places (Kauppinen-Räisänen et al., 2013). The Travel website sets the images and information of a specific 
destination for prospective tourists. The Internet is today a key source of information for the tourism industry. The 
distinctive characteristic of the travel website is that it has intangible elements, such as expertise or facilities (Koo et 
1138","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
Figure 2 shows that the highest cross load is 0,877. It is in the item No. 1 (Information Quality). This means that most 
prospective tourists think that the Trip Advisor website is fun to read. In contrast, the smallest cross loading is 0,520. 
It is in the item no. 8 (Service Quality). It indicates that most of the prospective tourist think that Trip Advisor less 
offer adequate e-mail answers containing all information about future tourist needs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research explores how the Trip Advisor website affects prospective tourists to visit tourism location. The research 
concerns with information quality of Trip Advisor website, service quality of Trip Advisor website, design quality of 
Trip Advisor website, quality confirmation of Trip Advisor website, satisfaction of Trip Advisor website, and 
decision-making of Trip Advisor website. The measurement is based on some of the theories previously stated. The 
results indicate that most tourists think that Trip Advisor website is fun to read. They enjoy when read the information 
from the website. However, the tourist suggests that the Trip Advisor website should offer adequate e-mail answers 
containing all information about future tourist needs. In addition, Hypothesis 1 to Hypothesis 5 are accepted.  
 
The research contributes theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this research supports the theory about 
information system in tourism. Then practically, the findings of this study include advice about how to best handle 
websites on the travel website. It is expected that the travel website should increase information quality, service 
quality, and design quality. As the impact, the prospective tourist will decide to visit the tourism location.

1. Introduction
Fraud has become a problem for organizations around the world. Based on the results of the 2018 Global 
Study on Occupational Fraud and Abuse conducted by ACFE, Indonesia ranks third in the country with the 
most fraud cases after China and Australia (ACFE, 2018). Of the several types of fraud cases, fraudulent 
financial reporting is one of the most common types of fraud committed by management in the form of 
material misstatements of financial statements that can harm investors and creditors. 
ACFE Indonesia Chapter (2017) further discovered that the most prevalent type of fraud was corruption, 
followed by misuse of state assets and financial reporting. The loss borne from a total of 36 cases of corruption 
ranged between Rp100 million and Rp500 million (Chapter, 2017). This gave Indonesia a very high 
Corruption Perception Index (CPI) score. One of the most cases in Indonesia is PT. Garuda Indonesia Tbk., 
in which the company recognized an income of Rp3.5 trillion, which was a receivable item. This 
misrepresentation of the interim financial statement in the first quarter of 2019 earned PT. Garuda Indonesia

Abstract 
In this pandemic age, online learning is crucial to the learning process. It is drastically integrated into the learning 
process by Malaysian students. It is also interesting to study the impact of this online learning, especially at the tertiary 
level. Some factors have been identified as success factors for the adoption of online learning. These factors include 
student perceptions and student engagement in learning. This study was conducted among 475 students from different 
degree programmes. A questionnaire was distributed to the respondents to obtain data on their perceptions and 
engagement in English learning in online courses. The results showed that they perceived English online courses very 
positively and were also very engaged in the classes. Some challenges were identified in implementing online 
instruction, such as the technology gap, documentation, and the nature of instruction. It is recommended that blended 
learning should be implemented to achieve the best results and satisfaction in the learning process.

1) Technology gap 
 
Technology plays a very important role in the process of online learning. Teachers are struggling with the new 
applications such as Google Meet, Zoom, Loom, and Webex that they have no experience with. They need to learn 
how to do the process with the help of colleagues and students. They need to prepare and upload materials into the 
system, such as AUTHOR, OLES, GOALs and BLACKBOARD. 
 
 
2) Documentation 
 
There is no longer a manual filing system, as everything should be fully documented online when fully online learning 
is introduced. Faculty must therefore be experts in using Google Drive, sharing files, recording lectures, and 
monitoring tests, quizzes, exams, and student management. 
 
3)  Teaching approach 
 
Teachers must ensure that students are always engaged in the learning process. Some problems were highlighted, such 
as turning on the camera during lectures, as many of the students were not on the camera for various reasons, such as 
poor data and internet connection. Therefore, the satisfaction level of the class was not very high. The instructors also 
need to be more concerned about whether the students understand the lectures or not, as many students are silent 
during online learning. In addition, teachers constantly face complaints about internet connection, especially from 
students living in rural areas such as Sabah and Sarawak. All of this affects the teachers' approach to teaching. 
 
6. Conclusion  
It can be concluded that students view online English learning positively and show a high level of engagement in the 
learning process. Of course, with the sudden changes in the education system, there are many challenges that 
students, teachers, and administrators must face. In general, fully online learning has advantages in the context of 
English language learning in these four higher education institutions, as it promotes self-learning, reduces costs, 
offers convenience, and promotes flexibility to some extent. Online learning is an excellent option during the 
COVID -19 pandemic, although it obviously cannot completely replace face-to-face learning. Therefore, the study 
recommends that blended learning should be considered to create a more balanced learning environment in English 
learning environments. It is also recommended that further research be conducted to clarify the effects of fully 
online English learning on students of different genders and study backgrounds.

Abstract 
The project work is structured in and around teams. Changes in the business environment is known as part of the 
domain of Project Portfolio Management. Resilient teams are more likely to be productive, agile, and innovative 
during turbulent times.  This study aims to investigate whether team resilience is influenced by individual 
resilience and transformational leadership style. This research is a descriptive quantitative study as the authors 
want to see how the influence of individual resilience and transformational leadership is to team resilience.  A 
survey using a structured questionnaire is necessary to measure the perception of targeted respondents. Total 349 
data from returned questionnaire was analyzed using PLS. The study showed that Individual Resilience and 
Transformational Leadership, are significantly influencing Team Resilience in both construction and ICT 
industries. However, Individual resilience has a more significant influence on Team Resilience in construction 
than ICT industry. However, Transformational Leadership has less influence on Team Resilience in construction 
than in ICT.

1. Introduction
The project work is structured in and around teams. Teams are defined as an interdependent group of individuals who 
share responsibility and are focused on a common goal (Moga, 2017). Changes in the business environment is known 
as part of the domain of Project Portfolio Management (Killen et al., 2008, 2012; Killen & Hunt, 2010, 2013). 
Furthermore, the aspects of risk and uncertainties in Project Portfolio may lead to changes not only in Project Portfolio 
(Teller, 2013; Teller & Kock, 2013) but also in individual projects (Assad et al., 2020; Besner & Hobbs, 2012; Ortiz 
et al., 2019; Project Management Institute, 2017). Such conditions will lead to challenges in the project organization, 
especially for the project teams. Furthermore, project complexity, such as institutional and stakeholders (Dille et al., 
2018; ElWakeel & Andersen, 2019), socio-economic (Elia et al., 2020), and technology (Shenhar et al., 2005) will 
also add problems to the projects thus leading to further pressure to the project teams. Resilient teams are more likely 
to be productive, agile, and innovative during turbulent times (Sharma, 2016). The difference between a resilience 
team and not could be the difference between survival and breaking down when facing adversity (Vera, Rodríguez-
Sánchez and Salanova, 2017).  
Resilience is the capacity to bounce back (and beyond) from setbacks and positively cope and adapt to significant 
changes (Sharma & Sharma, 2016a). Team resilience is defined as “a team’s belief that it can absorb and cope with 
strain, as well as a team’s capacity to cope, recover, and adjust positively to difficulties” (Carmeli, Friedman and 
Tishler, 2013).

Based on the result in Table 5, it can be concluded that both relationships from IRS to TRES and TRFL to TRES are 
significant, as as both have T-value >1.96. The hypotheses are hence both accepted for construction and ICT groups. 
The standardized coefficient β of IRS to TRES in construction is relatively higher in comparison with ICT. However, 
it is the other way around in TRFL to TRES. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that both variables, Individual Resilience and Transformational Leadership, 
are significantly influencing Team Resilience in both construction and ICT industries. However, Individual resilience 
has a more significant influence on Team Resilience in construction than ICT industry. However, Transformational 
Leadership has less influence on Team Resilience in construction than in ICT.  
 
Project management teams have to deal with risk and uncertainty from the project portfolio level to the individual 
level. Furthermore, project complexity will add to the challenges faced by the project management team. Moreover, 
projects are performed by project management teams that consist of various individuals from different background. 
Therefore, team resilience is critical to the success of project management. It seems that resilient teams are more likely 
to be productive, agile and innovative during turbulent times.  
 
This study has a limitation where the data comes from a number of respondents during the peak time of the second 
wave of COVID-19. It did not reflect the team resilience during the first wave, where most industries were highly 
affected by the pandemic. Furthermore, this study only explores two independent variables, individual resilience and 
transformational leadership. Further research should aim toother industries. In addition, further research can be 
performed in the form of case studies to validate this study result.

Abstract 
Turnover has been known to negatively impact the company effectiveness and success.  Yet, research on Generation 
Y and Z has shown that their loyalty to stay in one company is low.  This study aims to see the influence of work life 
balance and work engagement to turnover intention on Millennial and Generation Z in Indonesia.  Survey to 178 
respondent was conducted to Millennial and Generation Z workers.  The relationships between variables were 
analyzed using PLS.  The result showed that work life balance negatively and significantly influences turnover 
intention.  However, this study failed to see the significant relationship between work engagement and turnover 
intention. This study contributes to the literature of Millennial and Generation Z, specifically on factors influencing 
the turnover intention.

1. Introduction
Turnover Intention (TOI) is a desire by employees to leave the organization to get a better job (Lestari and Margaretha, 
2021). Disadvantages of high TOI are such as recruitment and training costs, separation costs, and reduced 
productivity(Jiang and Shen, 2018).   It  also results in a negative impact on the stability of labor conditions(Lestari 
and Margaretha, 2021) which leads to poor performance (Jung, Jung and Yoon, 2021). Previous studies have shown 
that high  turnover  rates can negatively impact the company effectiveness and success (Memon, Salleh and Baharom, 
2016). The loss of good performance employees can also negatively affect a  company's competitive advantage, lower 
other employees’ morale, and reduce productivity and quality of work(Memon, Salleh and Baharom, 2016). 
Indonesia Statistic Bureau (BPS) in 2020 (Widyastuti, 2021) states that millennials and Generation Z (Gen Z) 
contributes to more than 50% of population, means they will dominate the labor force in the future. But the current 
phenomenon shows that Millennials and Gen Z have low loyalty at work (Jobplanet, 2017). Around 76.7% of 
Millennials and 91% of Gen Z only last 1-2 years in one company before deciding to find another job. Only 9.5% of 
Millennials and 5.8% of Gen Z survive working in one place for five years or more. Deloitte(Healy, 2018) reveals that 
only 28% of Millennial plan to stay in the same company for more than 5 years. The survey also reveals that 43% of 
Millennials will find a new job within 2 years and 61% for Gen Z.  
The frequent reason of Millennial and Gen Z to change jobs is Work-Life Balance (WLB)(Al Kabir, Tirno and Al 
Kabir, 2018).  (Jaharuddin and Zainol, 2018) defines that work life-balance is a need for employees to achieve a 
balance between work with personal.  WLB is a critical issue for both employees and companies. The lack of WLB is 
associated with psychological and physical decline in health that can result in stress and emotional fatigue (Al Kabir, 
Tirno and Al Kabir, 2018).  WLB also results in increased stress in employees which lead to increased TOI (Jaharuddin 
and Zainol, 2018). Work Institute survey (Healy, 2018) of 10,000 employees who left their company states that 12% 
of respondents said that the main reason they left was related to WLB.  
Hypothesis 1: Work Life-Balance has a negative and significant influence on Turnover Intention.

The result is consistent with research conducted by (Lestari & Margaretha, 2021) (Al Kabir et al., 2018)(Lestari and 
Margaretha, 2021)(Al Kabir, Tirno and Al Kabir, 2018)(Jaharuddin & Zainol, 2018)(Jaharuddin and Zainol, 2018) 
that WLB has a negative and significant influence on TOI.   WLB is an employee's need to achieve a balance between 
work with personal (Jaharuddin and Zainol, 2018). One of the factors that affect the low level of WLB is long working 
hours, where the longer the time employees spend working, the higher the obstacles in balancing between work and 
personal life. (Al Kabir, Tirno and Al Kabir, 2018). 
The study result are inconsistent with the results of previous studies (Santhanam and Srinivas, 2020)(Milliman, 
Gatling and Kim, 2018) and (Memon, Salleh and Baharom, 2016) which state that WE has a negative and significant 
influence on TOI. This can be explained as follows.  Research conducted by (Rafiq et al., 2019) show that the direct 
influence  of work engagement on turnover intention is very weak and insignificant at  low job embeddedness levels 
.But the influence of work engagement becomes much more significant to turnover intentions at high levels of job 
embeddedness.   
In this study, the level of Job Embeddedness was not evaluated, however when mean value of respondents with service 
year <3 years compared to 4-6 years, the mean value of WE are 4,041 and 4,471 respectively. This indicates that an 
employee who has worked longer in the company will have higher WE. Since most employees with a working length 
of <3 years (74.7%), so most likely the level of embeddedness is low.  The explanation can be from the characteristics 
of Gene Z.  They are known to want freedom and unattachment, or their embeddedness that may be low. In accordance 
with research (Rafiq et al., 2019) if embeddedness is low then the effect  of WE on TOI is not significant. Another 
way to explain the result is the relationship between WE and TOI according to (Slåtten, Lien and Mutonyi, 2022) is 
mediated by Job Satisfaction (JS). For Millennials and Gen Z, job satisfaction is very important. So even if the WE 
level is high if JS is low then TOI will not be affected. (Table 4) 
5. Conclusion
Based on the results of the hypothesis that has been made, the conclusion of this study is: There is a negative and 
significant influence between Work-Life Balance and Turnover Intention. There is a negative and insignificant 
influence between Work Engagement and Turnover Intention.  
The first limitation of study is the number sample only 178 respondents, the majority is Gen Z with working experience 
<3 years. Therefore, the further study with more sample and diverse work experience is recommended. The second 
limitation is the study is only quantitative study.  Mixed method study can be considered for future study. The 
recommendation of further research is to see the relationship of Job Embeddedness to TOI and the mediation of Job 
Satisfaction to relationship between WE and TOI.

1. Introduction
The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic is not only a threat to human health but also has an impact on economic 
growth in a country, especially Indonesia, the decline in the economic system is felt in the tourism, transportation, 
investment and other sectors. We cannot avoid this because positive cases of Covid-19 are also increasing and 
have an impact on the stock exchange. However, based on the 2020 Indonesia Stock Exchange report, there has 
been an increase in transactions by millennial stock investors in a number of transactions in the online capital 
market even though the Covid-19 case is rife (Ekonomi Bisnis Report, 2020). The rise of investor behavior during 
COVID-19, many millennial investors have an Overconfidence bias, so this can be a problem if it is not balanced 
with prudent behavior to bypass risks in making investment decisions in their shares. 
According to Gill et al (2018) Overconfidence Bias refers to a biased way of looking at a situation that can be 
applied to stock investment decisions. In the midst of this up-and-coming stock investment activity, there are some 
people who have a negative perception of stock investment so that they need to have a fairly broad knowledge of 
stock investment, therefore investors should continue to increase their Investment Knowledge. Because as a good 
stock investor, it is certainly very good if you have good knowledge about stock investment knowledge. While 
investment is investing a certain amount of capital now for future profits (Syahyunan, 2015).

6. Conclusion 
This study aims to analyze the factors that influence millennial stock investment in Jakarta during the Covid-19 
pandemic. The variables contained in this study are exogenous variables, namely Overconfidence Bias and 
Investment Knowledge, mediating variables are Risk Taking Behavior, and endogenous variables are Investment 
Decision Making Behavior. After the test was carried out, the results obtained, there were seven hypotheses that 
were accepted, this happened because at the time of the study there was a trend of stock investment among 
millennials, especially in Jakarta. What we know is that there are some millennial stock investors during the 
Covid-19 pandemic who have not worked or are still students, some are working part time, working from home 
only during social distancing, so there is free time to invest in stocks that are worth investing in. provide more 
benefits than just sitting at home alone. All hypotheses in this study are accepted, namely Overconfidence Bias 
has a positive effect on Risk Taking Behavior, Investment Knowledge has a positive effect on Risk Taking 
Behavior, Risk Taking Behavior has a positive effect on Investment Decision Making Behavior, Overconfidence 
Bias has a positive effect on Investment Decision Making Behavior, Overconfidence Bias has a positive effect on 
Investment Decision Making Behavior mediated through Risk Taking Behavior, Investment Knowledge has a 
positive effect on Investment Decision Making Behavior, Investment Knowledge has a positive effect on 
Investment Decision Making Behavior mediated through Risk Taking Behavior. 
 
Based on the results of the research above, the authors intend to provide suggestions for further researchers, with 
all the limitations in the scope of this research, namely the limited number and characteristics of the samples that 
have been studied. It is advisable for the next research to expand the coverage area not only in Jakarta, and wider 
age category as well. Further research can also examine other variables outside of Overconfidence Bias, 
Investment Knowledge, Risk Taking Behavior and Investment Decision Making Behavior such as the Herding 
Behavior, Investment Performance variables which are very interesting to explore so that further research can 
analyze more deeply about what factors only that can affect the Investment Decision Making Behavior of stock 
investors. Support from the Regulator/Government is needed to protect investors, especially related stock 
investors. Namely by applying Law Reinforcement, because the information needed by investors is accurate and 
adequate information, but usually the information conveyed by issuers is only information that still needs to be 
reanalyzed. Therefore, stock investors should seek advice from securities companies or investment advisors.

Abstract 
This study aims to explain how the behavior of the millennial generation can have an impact on the financial literacy 
of that generation and how this literacy or knowledge then greatly affects the ability of the Indonesian millennial 
generation to manage and invest their funds. Data was collected using a questionnaire with a survey method. The 
population in this study are all millennials in Jakarta who have made investments. Using a random sampling method, 
questionnaires were distributed to 206 millennial respondents in several private banks in Jakarta. Partial Least Square-
Structural Equation Modeling approach with Smart PLS program was used to perform data analysis. The results show 
that Financial Literacy has a positive and significant effect on Investment Decision, Financial Literacy has a positive 
and significant effect on Financial Behavior, and Financial Behavior has a positive and significant effect on Investment 
Decision.

1. Introduction
Increasing financial literacy has become a global concern in recent decades, with an important role to play in 
encouraging economic progress. According to Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) (2007), empowering consumers through 
financial literacy will help to stabilize the financial system, increase people's welfare, reduce poverty and income 
disparity, and promote more inclusive development. On November 19, 2013, Joko Widodo, the 7th President of the 
Republic of Indonesia, introduced the National Strategy for Indonesian Financial Literacy (SNLKI). The SNKLI is 
one of three policy instruments designed to boost market confidence, consumer equality, and the financial services 
industry. 
Financial literacy is defined by Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (2017) as knowledge, beliefs, and skills possessed by the 
community that can affect attitudes and behavior in enhancing the quality of decision-making and financial 
management to promote public welfare. According to the definition, financial service business actors, financial 
product consumers, and society are expected to know and understand financial services as well as increase their ability 
to make financial decisions. Furthermore, it alters their financial management views in order to improve public 
welfare. 
Financial literacy has become a necessity for the Indonesian people. As a result, financial literacy knowledge becomes 
a life skill that each individual owns in order to live a long life. People with a high level of financial literacy (well 
literate) will have an easier time understanding the financial services industry's products, services, and procedures. 
They will also have full knowledge, allowing them to access financial services industry products and services as 
needed in their daily lives. 
People with high financial literacy (well literate) find it easier to choose and determine financial products or services 
that are appropriate for their requirements and talents, allowing them to improve their overall well-being. Furthermore, 
those with high financial literacy (highly literate) have stronger financial management abilities, which helps them 
maintain their financial well-being. As a result, creating a well-literate and financially inclusive society will ultimately 
encourage economic growth.

Abstract 
This research discusses the relationship between promotion, ease of perception, and pocket money on interest in using 
digital wallets because we want to know the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable and also the 
effect of the moderating variable on the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. 
This study took 193 samples that were randomly distributed using an online questionnaire focused on 4 variables. The 
analysis method uses simple regression and Moderated regression analysis with SPSS V.25 software. the results of 
the study found that promotion, ease of perception had a positive and significant effect on interest, pocket money had 
no significant effect on the relationship between promotion and interest, and the relationship between ease of 
perception  and interest

1. Introduction
The payment system with money has been recognized for a long time by humans. The payment system with money 
was originally carried out because the barter system was considered inefficient, its weaknesses such as difficulty 
determining the value of an item in exchange, because the value of the item is subjective, depending on how valuable 
the usefulness of the goods between the two parties.  
Until now, with the rapid development of technology, the payment system has also not escaped digital innovation. 
Various payment systems from credit, debit, blockchain, digital wallet systems are increasingly emerging in Indonesia. 
For example, many Digital Wallet companies such as E-Money, Ovo, Dana, Go-pay, Link aja are becoming 
increasingly popular in Indonesia, especially among millennials. Based on data from Bank Indonesia, the nominal 
number of transactions in Indonesia has increased from year to year, in 2020 it is known that the nominal amount of 
electronic money transactions in Indonesia in 2020 amounted to 204,909,170, up 41% from 2019, which amounted to 
145,165,467.6. while if you look at the growth from 2016 to 2020 the increase has reached 2800%. 
Digital wallet transactions have also experienced a high increase in transactions after the covid 19 pandemic, where 
the government's PPKM limits the physical movement of the community so that the use of digital wallets is safer to 
use than cash which can be a medium for transmitting the spread of the virus. Based on data quoted from Kontan 
(2021), one of the digital wallet players such as Go-pay experienced an increase in transaction value for Go-Pay 
Paylater reaching 3.3 times. Meanwhile, the value of investment Gopay transactions increased by almost 7 times. In 
addition, based on data reported by Beritasatu (2021), Dana's digital wallet users experienced a surge in their digital 
wallet users of 20 million from December 2020 to the first semester of 2021. With the average transaction increasing 
from 3 million transactions per day to 5 million transactions per day.

understand, easy to learn. In addition, it can provide easy access in determining payment methods, payment 
networks, etc. 
3. For other researchers who discuss similar themes to be able to further develop the research that the authors 
have done by using a wider sample and distributing questionnaires more evenly and a longer sampling time. 
 
5.4 Validation 
1. Promotion has a significant positive effect on interest in using Digital Wallets  
Based on table 4.18 T-test of Promotion on Interest, T-count 10.161 > 1.98 from t table means that 
individually the independent variable has a significant effect on the dependent variable. Meaning Promotion 
has a significant positive effect on interest in using Digital Wallets.  
2. Promotion has an effect on interest in using digital wallets with pocket money as a moderating variable 
Based on Table 4.16 F-test Moderate 1, The anova test above shows that the F test produces a calculated F 
value of 39,328 with a significant level of 0.000. because the probability is below 0.05, the regression model 
can be used to predict Y (interest) or it can be said that X1 (Promotion), Z (pocket money) and moderat_1 
(Promotion X Pocket money) together has a significant effect on Y (interest). 
3. Ease of Perception has a significant positive effect on interest in using Digital Wallets  
Based on Table 4.19 T-test of Ease on Interest, T-count 7.050 > 1.98 from t table means that individually the 
independent variable has a significant effect on the dependent variable. Meaning Ease of Perception has a 
significant positive effect on interest in using Digital Wallets  
4. Ease of Perception has an effect on interest in using Digital Wallets with pocket money as a moderating 
variable. 
Based on Based on Table 4.17 F-test of Moderate 2, the anova test above shows that the F test produces a 
calculated F value of 21,340 with a significance level of 0.000. because the probability is below 0.05, the 
regression model can be used to predict Y (interest) or it can be said that X2 (ease), Z (pocket money) and 
moderat_2 together have a significant effect on Y (interest). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the discussion and interpretation of the research, the author will conclude that. 
1. Promotion has a significant positive effect on interest in using digital wallets. This finding means that 
promotion affects customer interest in using digital wallet applications. The greater the promotion, or price 
discount, the greater the user's interest in using a digital wallet. 
2. Promotion variables have no effect on interest in using digital wallets with pocket money as a moderating 
variable. This finding means that the amount of pocket money does not affect the relationship between 
promotion and interest in using digital wallets. 
3. Ease of Perception has a significant positive effect on interest in using digital wallets. This finding means 
that the perceived ease or appearance of the user interface of a digital wallet application affects user interest 
in using digital wallets. The easier and more attractive the ease of perception, the greater the interest in using 
a digital wallet. 
4. Ease of Perception variable has no effect on interest in using digital wallets with pocket money as a 
moderating variable. This finding means that the amount of pocket money does not affect the relationship 
between Ease of Perception and interest in using digital wallets.

  Abstract 
Through this research, the objective is to analyze the main problems presented in the area of financial planning of a 
company in the food industry, among which can be found the excessive wear of certain collaborators, the non-
compliance with the delivery deadlines of files and financial reports and lack of communication between team 
members; in order to improve the workflow of the financial planning area through the application of agile 
methodologies such as Scrumban, which flexibly combines the characteristics of Kanban and Scrum. The 
methodology used in this project has 3 steps, in which surveys, fault records and the Trello application will be used 
to collect a series of data that will allow us to evaluate the current situation of the work method used. By implementing 
this methodology, improvements can be found that were measured in qualitative and quantitative indicators that 
allowed increasing the degree of satisfaction of the collaborators and the functional area, saving time and achieving 
better efficiency in the work of the financial planning area. After performing the analysis and identifying the respective 
improvements in the area, this research may serve as a basis to optimize other similar processes in other companies 
and in large areas such as strategic planning, demand planning, financial planning, etc. They have mechanical 
components, but they also have projections taking into account internal and external factors of the company, such as 
the situation of a country at a given time.

5. Discussion
From the results, it is evident that the period in which there was a greater number of publications of agile 
methodologies magazines, specifically Scrum and Kanban, was between 2020 and 2021 with respect to a total analysis 
of the years 2015 and 2021; This may be due to the implementation of agile methodologies during the pandemic and 
which, precisely, coincides with the period in which there is a tendency to increase these methodologies using 
computer tools to have better visibility of the processes and also on issues such as speed and efficiency that the 
programs provide. From the results obtained, it was also possible to analyze that the institutions with the highest 
number of publications on agile methodologies are in the United States and Germany; however, according to the 
annual study by the Project Management Institute (PMI), 71% of organizations worldwide already use agile 
methodologies. In addition, this study extracts what could be the main reason for the use of these methodologies, 
which is that the application of these methodologies has a direct impact on the return on investment (ROI). According 
to the report, companies grew revenue 37% faster and made 30% more profit than companies that have not yet 
implemented these methodologies. (CIO, 2017). Examples of successful companies that used agile methodologies are 
Amazon, Apple, Spotify and Google AdWords. 
On the other hand, with respect to the keywords included in the publications, words such as ""software design"", ""scrum"", 
""scrumban"", ""Kanban"" and ""agile software development"" had a higher rate of matches in journals published in recent 
years. These keywords are grouped into clusters and in turn serve as a model for other magazines, as they link with 
branches that include words like software industry, agility, lean, etc. 
Likewise, after implementing the Scrumban method, a significant improvement was evidenced in the performance 
indicators of the financial planning area. In that sense, although an improvement was expected, it was not expected to 
reduce the bottlenecks by 100%; In addition, there was only one task not completed, representing a reduction of 86% 
with respect to what was presented in the pilot test. Additionally, there was a 55% reduction in the number of failures 
per month and a 79% reduction in hours spent troubleshooting. These changes demonstrate the direct relationship that 
exists between using agile methodologies such as Scrumban and the development of areas such as financial planning 
where there is a mechanical and an experimental part. 
Finally, possible limitations were found when applying these methodologies and it is when the collaborative spaces 
are very small, basically between 2 people; in this case, it would be better to use simpler tools to better optimize the 
processes. For the rest, the implementation of this agile methodology in financial planning can serve to help integrate 
complex teams with a large number of people and in areas where not everything is mechanical, but rather it is necessary 
to rely on the situation of the country. and even predict certain situations to be effective when planning. 
6. Conclusions
The present study demonstrated the advantages of using agile methodologies in combination with the purpose of 
achieving an improvement in a company's planning area, an area that, in general, is difficult to predict and organize, 
due to the fact that it is composed of on the one hand analytical and the other experimental, since planning depends, 
to a large extent, on the current situation that the country is going through already in a social, economic or health 
context such as the pandemic; According to this, we were also able to identify that to improve the indicators in a work 
area and be more efficient during the pandemic, it required a greater organization even than in the period before the 
pandemic, so implementing agile methodology tools during this stage of a health crisis where most people worked 
virtually and there was no pre-established order regarding schedules, tasks, work divisions, etc. it was a challenge. 
However, with the help of tools such as surveys and in combination with agile methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban 
and Trello, we were able to improve the indicators in this area by reducing bottlenecks by 100% and uncompleted 
tasks by 86%. For these reasons, it is recommended to continue using this mix of agile methodologies and tools in 
future research with the purpose of optimizing even larger areas of a company to save efforts and obtain better labor 
indicators that will translate into higher economic income for the company. and higher percentage of employee 
satisfaction.

Abstract 
Generation Y is the digital generation, having grown up with cell phones, computer games, instant communication, 
and social networking. They are naturally optimistic, realistic, global-aware, and welcoming. They are goal-oriented, 
entrepreneurial, and seek solutions at work. They have personal social media accounts, which can also provide 
opportunities to learn new things and make discoveries. It is ambidexterity which means an individual learning 
activity. The study investigates the role of ambidexterity and social media experience in developing innovative 
behaviors among millennial workers in Greater Jakarta using convenience sampling. The Rasch Model and Structural 
Equation Modeling (SEM) were employed. According to the Rash Model Analysis, Millennial workers with higher 
ambidexterity display much more innovative behavior. At the same time, the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) 
reveals that ambidexterity has a higher significant impact on innovative behavior than social media learning.

1. Introduction
Millennials are another name for Generation Y. By 2025; they will account for three-quarters of the worldwide 
workforce. They come from a time of demographic upheaval, so they are entering the workforce alongside older 
generations and are more at ease with technology and computers. They adapt to communication technology more 
easily (Islam et al., 2011; Reza & Sarraf, 2019; Simic, 2019). 
On the other hand, Generation Y is the digital generation, having grown up with cell phones and computer games and 
familiar with immediate communication and social networking. They are naturally optimistic, realistic, globally 
aware, and inclusive. They are goal-oriented, entrepreneurial, and seek answers in the workplace. They have personal 
accountability and a need for feedback. Millennials are collaborative and work well in today's empowered workplace 
as long as there are enough challenges and opportunities to keep them interested (Islam et al., 2011; Saileela &

Abstract 
Japanese companies tend to implement 5S as an autonomic nervous system in order to keep manufacturing activities 
running smoothly, as well as to avoid Muda. However, 5S implementation could potentially cause several impacts if 
it does not run consistently. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the impact of inconsistencies in 5S implementation. 
This research will be conducted with a qualitative method, using observation as primary data, and interviews as 
supporting data. Additionally, the descriptive analytics method would be implemented to adjust collected data with 
theories from a literature review. The result from the study is the inconsistency of 5S at PT Indonesia Toray Synthetics 
causing Muda. The Conclusion is that there are several forms of Muda due to the inconsistencies of 5S implementation. 
The main factors causing the inconsistencies in the implementation of 5S at PT ITS are the existence of cultural 
differences between management systems and the majority of local workers. The solution that can be done in this case 
is to hold training and simulations that are scheduled by the management and carried out routinely by all workers.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry usually establishes a production system that functions to keep manufacturing activities 
running smoothly. Fujimoto (2012:33) explains that when some individual strategic routines such as kaizen, kanban, 
heijunka, jidoka, 5S (seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu, shitsuke), and a number of other lean management are integrated 
into a coordinating system to achieve stable competitive performance, it is called “organizational capability in 
manufacturing.” The focus of the characteristics of most Japanese companies still running consistently now is to avoid 
waste (Ponanake, 2012:79). Based on the features and characteristics of the Japanese company's manufacturing work 
system, the author determines the research theme regarding the 5S management system implemented by a Japanese 
company operating in Indonesia, namely PT Indonesia Toray Synthetics (ITS). However, there is a particular condition 
in this study, namely the existence of an inconsistent attitude towards the application of 5S, so it is possible to assume 
the impact that will arise. Thus, the focus of the research theme is the impact caused by the inconsistency of 
implementing the 5S system in Japanese companies in Indonesia. Currently, PT ITS is in the middle of revitalizing

5.5.1. Analysis of Shitsuke Practices Applied by the PSF Department of PT ITS 
Question I: “Has the practice of shitsuke been practiced before?” 
The informant responded that the practice of shitsuke was actually also implemented, but its minimal implementation 
resulted in the results of the implementation not being in line with management expectations (Oky Syafwiratama – 
Assistant Manager of Section PT ITS, 7 June 2018). 
Question II: “Are there records of 5S evaluation results in shitsuke practice?” 
The resource person explained that the recording was only limited to the findings as a corrective step through follow-
up (Oky Syafwiratama – Assistant Manager of Section PT ITS, 1 July 2018). 
Question III: “What are the management steps to build a 5S system at ITS, both in the past and now?” 
The resource person explained that the steps to build 5S which initially only started with socialization, now the method 
has developed with room modeling as a visual management to facilitate the work activities of all employees (Oky 
Syafwiratama – Assistant Manager of Section PT ITS, 1 July 2018). 
Analysis: 
Based on the results of the information from questions I, II, and III, the authors analyze that PT Indonesia Toray 
Synthetics, especially the Polyester Staple Fiber (PSF) department, applies the practice of seiketsu with the statement 
that seiketsu is applied but with weak intensity. In addition, although a proper evaluation has not been carried out, the 
follow-up results from the patrols carried out are always an effort to improve the system which is considered to be 
lacking. Then, steps to build 5S through socialization and then developing with a modeling system were also carried 
out to facilitate work activities. In accordance with Imai (2012) which states that there is a review from superiors and 
evaluations must be carried out regularly by factory managers and genba managers to assess the 5S standards that 
have been running. 
5.5.2. Analysis of Shitsuke's Practice Inconsistency in the PSF Department of PT ITS 
Question IV: ""Can it be concluded that the implementation of shitsuke that has not been implemented in its entirety 
will lead to waste in terms of process waste and time wasting?"" 
The resource persons also agreed to this (Oky Syafwiratama – Assistant Manager of Section PT ITS, 1 July 2018). 
Analysis: 
Based on the results of the information from question I, the author analyzes that the practice of shitsuke has not been 
fully implemented by PT ITS, especially the PSF department, due to several constraining factors such as the lack of 
resources in the midst of high intensity of routine work if the performance of production activities is not going 
according to plan, so lead to weak continuity in its application. In addition, based on the results of the information 
from question IV, the author also analyzes that there is a form of waste that occurs due to the inconsistent application 
of shitsuke. Such wastage is a waste of process because all implementations will be restarted from scratch, and a waste 
of time because the whole process is in the scope of an ongoing timeframe. 
Based on the above analysis, the author would like to emphasize this analysis that the 5S practice has indeed been 
implemented by PT ITS based on the results of its implementation experience. However, the author also analyzes that 
the implementation of 5S has not been carried out in full by PT ITS, so that it has an impact in the form of waste or 
youth, both in terms of possibilities and what has already occurred on the availability of existing data objects. 
6. Conclusion
From the results of the overall analysis, the authors draw an outline of the main factors causing the inconsistencies 
that occur in the implementation of 5S at PT ITS, namely the existence of cultural differences, both between systems 
from management and the majority of local workers. The solution that can be done in this case is to hold training 
and simulations that are scheduled by the management and carried out routinely by all workers.

to 2021 experienced a decline, in 2019 by 10.68%, then in 2020 by 10.63%, and in 2021 it decreased to 6.08%. The 
decline in ROI is inseparable from the impact of the declining value of the company's NPM in 2021. A declining ROI 
indicates the company's ability to decline in managing its assets to generate an operating profit. ROE PT. Mayora 
Indah, Tbk during the period 2019 to 2021 experienced a decline, in 2019 by 20.5%, then in 2020 by 18.7%, and in 
2021 it decreased to 10.7%. A declining ROE indicates that the level of net income earned by the company on the 
capital invested in the company decreases.

Abstract 
This study aims to measure the performance of Sritex through financial performance measurement methods using 
profitability analysis (Net Profit Margin, Return on Equity, and Return on Assets) to see a representation of the 
company's performance in recent years, but also accompanied by the actual condition of the company. Seen from 
several sources of articles on the internet to harmonize and conclude the company's performance so far. The output of 
this research is a formulation of a new business strategy that can be used to improve the company's performance to 
achieve above-average returns as well as strong competitiveness at the global level. Based on the calculation, it is 
known that the Net Profit Margin, Return on Asset and Return on Equity tend to decrease every year. Therefore, 
several new proposed strategies have been formulated. These include implementing a cost leadership strategy in the 
company's exports, diversifying its business and product differentiation. Cut production costs by building or acquiring 
subsidiaries to produce their own raw materials. And do mass production so that the logistics costs will be cut by itself.

1. Introduction
PT Sri Rejeki Isman Tbk. or commonly known as SiteX, is a textile company headquartered in Sukoharjo, Central 
Java. This company was founded by HM. Lukminto in 1966 as a textile trading business in Klewer Market, Solo under 
the name ""UD Sri Redjeki"". In 1968, UD Sri Redjeki opened its first printing factory to produce white and colored 
fabrics in Joyosuran, Solo. In 1978, UD Sri Redjeki was registered with the Ministry of Trade as a limited liability 
company named ""PT Sri Rejeki Isman"". Sritex was able to survive the Monetary Crisis in 1998 and managed to 
multiply its growth by 8 times. So that in 2013, PT Sri Rejeki Isman Tbk was officially registered its shares (with 
ticker code and SRIL) on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Until now, for 54 years, Sritex is still one of the largest textile 
companies in Southeast Asia, which is still actively producing and exporting its products to various continents, 
especially Europe, Asia and America.

overhead control, avoidance of marginal customer accounts, and cost minimization in areas like R&D, service, sales 
force, advertising, and so on,”.  
 
The following are some of the ways that can be used to achieve an optimal cost leadership strategy, utilize company 
resources effectively to avoid waste, carry out mass production to achieve economies of scale that result in lower unit 
costs, and invest in renewable technologies to achieve smart work. Sritex in 2021 won the industry 4.0 Readiness 
Index (INDI 4.0) award from the Ministry of Industry for the Product and Service category. Sritex makes updates in 
various aspects of production, starting from the coloring design that already uses digital print, the weaving system 
used in the factory is a robotic system, namely a programmable logic controller that uses algorithms. This can be a 
good first step for Sritex to implement a smart work system to increase productivity. Besides that, it must also be 
accompanied by a strong R&D team to continue to create new product innovations using available resources. 
 
Strategies that can be done include diversifying the business so that sales do not depend on one particular area, and 
also focusing on more profitable markets. Apart from that, it can also differentiate products, so far Sritex is known to 
produce innovative products with low and affordable prices. To cut costs so that product prices can be competitive, 
among others, is to cut costs on procurement of goods, because 60% of Sritex's raw materials are imported goods such 
as cotton, rayon fiber materials, and polyester. However, in the past few years Sritex has started to build its own rayon 
factory to produce yarn raw materials. With the existence of its own rayon factory, it can cut production costs and also 
reduce differences in the quality of rayon fiber for production needs, so that product quality is maintained. In addition, 
by producing various types of fabrics that are needed by consumers, Sritex can also automatically reduce logistics 
costs, because whatever the consumers want is already available by Sritex. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Profitability ratio analysis is one of the ratios that can be used to assess financial performance which can describe the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the company in carrying out operational activities. Some ratios that can be used are 
Net Profit Margin, Return on Equity and Return on Assets. In addition, the company's performance can also be 
analyzed using a SWOT analysis by looking at the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats faced by the 
company. After analyzing the company's performance, a new strategy is formulated that the company can do. These 
include implementing a cost leadership strategy in the company's exports, diversifying its business and also product 
differentiation. Cut production costs by building or acquiring subsidiaries to produce their own raw materials. And 
also do mass production so that the logistics costs will be cut by itself.

Abstract 
The company was founded with the commercial purpose of obtaining profit, maximizing share value, and increasing 
sales & service. Companies must have good performance both financially and non-financially. A competent company 
can be identified through a description of the financial condition that reflects a well-structured and organized 
management process. Companies with superior and stable financial performance can attract and retain investors to 
continue to entrust their capital to the company. Financial performance assessment with profit and value orientation 
can use Economic Value Added (EVA). In a case study on a cable company in Indonesia, PT KMI Wire and Cable 
Tbk (KMI) suffered losses due to declining sales and the effects of the pandemic (2020). With the EVA method, 
financial performance is analyzed, and then we formulate a business strategy with the SWOT analysis method to 
obtain a tactical strategy and become a suggestion for managers to make decisions in strategy selection. Several 
strategies that can be considered are strengthening the private market by increasing tenders, expanding national and 
international business by using effective technology through online markets, reducing production costs by mass 
production of low-voltage cable types with industrial market coverage and housing, maintaining quality and 
competitive prices, strengthening distribution and marketing networks by conducting joint ventures for selling 
products in both national and international markets, strengthening the R&D team by involving universities in product 
innovation and managing CSR effectively so that the company automatically builds value through research activities 
and social actions involving educational institutions.

5.4 Recommendation 
The company's steps in determining KPIs from a financial perspective can use the EVA method because this method 
has a complete performance measure, is easy to do, overcomes short-term problems, and provides investment decision 
considerations for companies and investors. Strategy formulation with SWOT analysis provides alternative solutions 
for tactical decisions related to strategy. 
 
Several strategies that can be considered in this research are strengthening the private market by increasing tenders, 
expanding national and international business by using effective technology through online markets, reducing 
production costs by mass production of low-voltage cable types with industrial market coverage and housing, 
maintaining quality and competitive prices, so that good profit margins are obtained, strengthening distribution and 
marketing networks by conducting joint ventures for selling products in both national and international markets, 
strengthening the R&D team by involving universities in product innovation and managing CSR effectively so that 
the company automatically builds value through research activities and social actions involving educational 
institutions. 
  
6. Conclusion 
Measurement of financial performance using EVA can be one solution in determining policies on capital management 
so that a positive margin is obtained from the capital used. The KPIs and strategic steps described above can be applied 
as tactical steps for the company. Performing internal and external analysis using the SWOT analysis method can be 
a solution to translate the best tactical strategies for the company to increase profits. 
 
The limitation of this research is that the literature and data are obtained only from internet sources. Further research, 
if possible, can be done using data on the actual condition of the company. So that more accurate data and analysis 
are obtained.

Abstract 
Financial statement analysis is the analytical tool to explore and compare the financial statement for the purpose of 
making business decisions. Cooperatives are one of the business entities that require financial reports to assess how 
well their financial management is. The Ministry of Religion Employee Cooperative (KOPKA) is an organization 
engaged in non-bank financial services and goods sales services owned by the Ministry of Religion, with the aim of 
helping members meet their financial needs, both for business capital needs, business development, education costs, 
and other emergency fund needs. KOPKA always carries out routine evaluation activities, namely RAT (the annual 
member meeting), to make accountability reports and cooperative business strategies to prepare work plans for the 
next period. Therefore, the measurement of financial performance is one of the important benchmarks for business 
development at KOPKA. A business strategy that can create innovation from novelty is needed to compete globally 
with competitors. This research is expected to be able to identify evaluations and financial performance as well as 
design business strategies through analysis of internal and external factors with a SWOT matrix based on data reports 
from the Ministry of Religion Employee Cooperative for the period 2019-2020.

1. Introduction
Financial statement analysis is an analytical tool to explore and compare financial statements for business decision-
making purposes (Al-Ansari, 2020). In addition, financial statements contain important data that must be used to assist 
in decision-making for decision-makers (Auken and Carraher, 2013). Cooperatives are one of the business entities 
that require financial reports in order to assess the effectiveness of their financial management.

4.5 Recommendation 
Based on this research, several recommendations are offered in the hope that they would be evaluated and 
implemented by the company and future researchers. KOPKA's financial condition is quite good when measured by 
financial performance. However, to increase the company's profit, it must improve its financial performance by paying 
more attention to total income and reducing expenses, especially in the future. This can be accomplished by 
incorporating additional types of business that are possible in the sales and service segments. Furthermore, KOPKA 
must immediately collect bad debts in order for its finances to work correctly. 
Internal and external analysis using the SWOT matrix reveals that KOPKA's strength is adequate finance as well as 
rapidly growing technological advances. This can lead to new business opportunities by expanding elsewhere, 
collaborating with other companies, or opening e-commerce stores. Consumers' various needs are also important 
because they can be used as opportunities, such as pre-ordering specific goods or making consignments with traders 
to sell their merchandise. Keep in mind that to develop a business, good human resources are also required so that the 
business strategy plan can run smoothly. 
Despite numerous opportunities, KOPKA should benchmark with business competitors in order to participate in the 
global market. Because of the increase in customer demands, KOPKA must make internal changes, particularly to its 
outdated administrative and bureaucratic systems. Because internal improvements will make it easier for customers 
to learn about specials or delayed transactions. This is critical because it can improve customer relations and the ability 
of KOPKA employees to communicate effectively with the public. 
5. Conclusion
Based on the results of the analysis of the financial performance of the Ministry of Religion Employee Cooperative 
(KOPKA) for the 2019-2020 period, it can be concluded that: 
Based on a vertical analysis of the 2019-2020 balance sheet, KOPKA's financial performance has been optimal. This 
can be seen from the total asset item, which is much larger than the total liability item. This indicates that KOPKA is 
able to fulfill its obligations with its assets. From the vertical analysis of the 2019-2020 income statement, KOPKA's 
financial performance is still not optimal. This is due to the large expenses and operations, thereby reducing the net 
profit earned in each period. 
From the results of the horizontal balance sheet analysis for the 2019-2020 period, KOPKA's financial performance 
experienced a negative trend. Although there was a significant decrease in total liabilities, total assets also experienced 
a slight decrease in the 2020 period, which was -2.5%. Meanwhile, from the analysis of the income statement for the 
2019-2020 period, although the total expenses and operations as well as taxes decreased, the net profit obtained by 
KOPKA in the 2020 period also decreased, due to reduced sales and services reaching -24%. 
On the other hand, through internal and external analysis of the SWOT matrix, the strategy for business opportunities 
at KOPKA is quite a lot, balanced with the available capital and several strengths it has. However, there are several 
things that need to be considered in business processes, especially internal factors that can hinder business growth at 
KOPKA.

Abstract 
This case study discusses a work facility design project in a leather bag craft business in Magetan. Magetan leather 
craft has great potential to become the largest leather producer in Indonesia. The leather craft production process in 
Magetan still uses the traditional method or what is known as handmade. The problems raised were obtained based 
on direct observations and interviews conducted at SME bags Magetan, namely Dwarr Leather. The existing condition 
regarding the management and storage of raw materials in SME Bags Leather Magetan has a lot of risk and waste. 
The purpose of this project is to design work facilities in the form of swivel racks and tables that can increase company 
productivity and reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in operators. The design stage uses the NIDA (Need, 
Idea, Decision, Action) method. In the NIDA design stage, two alternative rack design solutions were obtained. To 
determine the chosen alternative decision, the selection is carried out using the Pugh selection method. The results 
obtained show the selected alternative design 2. The design analysis stated that the specifications made were declared 
safe and the raw materials for the tools were available in the market.

1. Introduction
Magetan Regency is the center of the leather industry with many leather handicrafts such as shoes, sandals, and bags. 
Magetan leather craft has great potential to become the largest leather producer in Indonesia. Shopping tourism as an 
alternative tourism is expected to be a center for the development of creativity and innovation. The leather industry in 
Magetan Regency is a micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME). Data from the Department of Industry and Trade 
of Magetan recorded that there were 115 business units in the leather sector in 2017. Each manufacturer competes to 
be able to produce quality products and have low prices. This is because the resulting product has the same 
product/service characteristics (Suhartini, 2015). This intense competition will certainly have an impact on 
competitive prices as well. Therefore, the development of leather craft production is needed in order to obtain better 
quality and affordable prices. 
The leather craft production process in Magetan still uses the traditional method or what is known as handmade. This 
makes it superior because in terms of product quality it can compete with other similar products (Hadinata, 2014). 
However, the traditional method also has various shortcomings such as the lack of conformity with the existing 
standard of production methods and others. The problems raised were obtained based on direct observations and 
interviews conducted at SME bags Magetan, namely Dwarr Leather. The existing condition regarding the management 
and storage of raw materials in SME Bags Leather Magetan has a lot of risk and waste. Dwarr Leather's raw material 
storage system does not have adequate facilities. The leather raw material is placed on the floor and mixed others. The 
operator has slouch postur and lifts heavy loads. The human posture and work facilities are not ergonomic cause 
muscoloskeletal disorder (Silviana et al., 2022) The bad raw material storage system causes many losses such as 
searching time, quality of raw materials and musculoskeletal injuries. This has an effect on poor business productivity.

6. Conclusion 
Dwarr Leather does not have adequate facilities for storing leather raw materials. This causes operators to experience 
difficulties and fatigue in storing and processing leather raw materials for production. In addition, there are other 
effects such as musculoskeltal injury, inhibition of production and decreased leather quality. The design of the raw 
material storage facility is carried out to improve the facility in its existing condition. By using the NIDA design 
method, the results obtained are designs that meet the needs and overcome the problems faced by SME Dwar leather. 
The design has a swivel rack system and a table so that the operator has a good working posture. The quality of the 
leather is maintained because it uses a hygienic aluminum material suitable for leather processing. The design analysis 
stated that the specifications made were declared safe and the raw materials for the tools were available in the market.

Abstract 
Social media such as Twitter is a online platforms to exchange stock information. Many researchers believe that more 
information about the stock market should reduce volatility. This study aims to see the impact of agreement among 
investors in the capital market moderated by investor alpha. Is it only considered noise or valuable information? We 
used data on Twitter to capture agreement among investors and the impact of investor alpha from 2016 to 2021 and 
analyze 10242 stock-related daily messages using computational linguistics and examine the mechanism leading to 
an efficient aggregation of information from investor alpha or quality of investment advice based on 60 largest trading 
volume stock registered in Indonesia Stock Exchange. We used the moderation model PROCESS analysis regression 
to seek to determine whether the size or sign of the effect agreement among investors in the capital market depends in 
one way or another on the quality of investor alpha. Our results show that disagreement among online investors 
positively correlated with volatility and the impact of agreement among investors on volatility in the capital market 
depends on the quality of investor alpha. In other words, the level of agreement between investors can affect the 
volatility of the stock market depending on the accuracy of the recommendations given by alpha investors on the stock 
returns for a period.

1. Introduction
The development of the internet has had an impact on every piece of information received by investors, especially 
investors who seek the information through social media platforms. Previous empirical studies reveal that investors 
are often influenced by word of mouth (Ng and Wu, 2006; Mizrach and Weerts, 2009). Cao et al. (2002) state that if

From Figure 3. it can be seen that there is a difference in the impact given of volatility on changes in the level of 
agreement between online investors and the quality of the information provided by alpha investors. When a 
disagreement occurs between investors, it will cause an increase in volatility where the size of the impact will depend 
on the quality of the information provided by the alpha investor. When the information provided by alpha investors is 
not of good quality, it will cause a higher level of volatility, but if the information provided is of good quality, it will 
cause a decrease in the level of volatility when there is a disagreement between investors. 
 
When there is an agreement between investors that will cause a decrease in the level of volatility. This condition will 
be different depending on the quality of the information provided by alpha investors. When the quality of the 
information provided causes a higher level of volatility than when there is a decrease in the quality of information. 
The quality of this information is seen from how valid the level of information provided by alpha investors is as 
compared to the realization of returns in period t. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study has a purpose to see the effect of agreement among online investors which we called microblogging 
investors on volatility in the stock market in Indonesia where the size of the effect depends on the quality of the 
information provided by alpha investors. Alpha investors are investors who provide information about the level of 
“buy”, “sell”, and “hold” which is compared to the condition of the rate of return in period t. It is said to be qualified 
when the information is by the conditions that occur in the stock market. The results showed that the increase in 
disagreement among online investors led to an increase in the level of stock market volatility even though there was 
no information provided by alpha investors. However, alpha investors themselves do not have a conditional effect on 
the level of volatility when there is no agreement or disagreement between online investors. However, the size of the 
effect of the level of agreement between online investors on the level of volatility will depend on the quality of alpha 
investors. The impact given will be different depending on the quality of the information provided by the alpha 
investor, When a disagreement occurs between investors, it will cause an increase in volatility where the size of the 
impact will depend on the quality of the information provided by the alpha investor. When the information provided 
by alpha investors is not of good quality, it will cause a higher level of volatility, but if the information provided is of 
good quality, it will cause a decrease in the level of volatility when there is a disagreement between investors. But 
when there is an agreement between investors that will cause a decrease in the level of volatility. This condition will 
be different depending on the quality of the information provided by alpha investors. When the quality of the 
information provided causes a higher level of volatility than when there is a decrease in the quality of information.

Abstract 
Indonesia is a country in which most of its citizens are Muslim. This condition brings both opportunities for halal 
products and the rise of challenges to ensuring halal status. In line with that, the increasing interest in Korean products 
also brings a new challenge. Some of their products contain haram ingredients or do not have a halal label. Therefore, 
consumer awareness of Korean-food halal status is essential to protect themselves from Korean non-halal products. 
On the other hand, as Korean foods become daily consumption in Muslim society, the concern about their nutritional 
value and their potential effects on health is also growing. 
This study aimed to explore the Muslim society's perception of the importance of Korean-food halal status and 
nutritional value. 
This study is a descriptive mix-methods study that consists of cross-sectional and qualitative studies. The qualitative 
data were collected using focus group discussion and were validated using source triangulation. The total number of 
participants in this study was 81. The inclusion criteria were Moslem, aged a minimal 14 years old, live in Daerah 
Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY), and a Korean food consumer.  
The results show that most participants are concerned about Korean food’s halal status. It also became their priority 
when purchasing Korean food. More than half of the participants have good halal food knowledge (60,5%) and 
practices (51,9%). In addition, the majority of subjects were concerned about foods’ nutritional value, although only 
17,2% of participants were always considerate about the nutrition aspects. They also have perceptions that Korean 
foods can be considered healthy or not, depending on the food type.

Abstract 
Since Starbucks Coffee first opened its stores in Indonesia, Indonesia’s coffee culture was significantly developed and 
the growth of local coffee shops greatly improved. It also transformed coffee into the symbol of social status and 
lifestyle for society. People then came to coffee shop to meet friends and family while enjoying coffee and other 
beverages. Furthermore, the value of Indonesia’s coffee shop business rose into Rp4.8 billion which indicates a huge 
business potential. Unfortunately, Covid-19 struck Indonesia and the coffee shop business was hampered. The purpose 
of this research is to determine the effect of service quality, food quality, price fairness, and store atmosphere on coffee 
shop customer loyalty in Jabodetabek during the Covid-19 pandemic with the mediation of customer satisfaction. A 
questionnaire and 6-point Likert scale was designed for this research and has collected 179 respondents who live in 
Jakarta Metropolitan Area (Jabodetabek) and have regular coffee shops to be visited during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
This research used the PLS-SEM approach to analyse the collected data. This research found that service quality, food 
quality, price fairness, and store atmosphere positively and significantly affect customer satisfaction. Customer 
satisfaction also has a positive and significant influence on customer loyalty.

1. Introduction 
As the fourth biggest producer of coffee in the world (Deshmukh, 2021), coffee culture has existed for a long time in 
Indonesia and is seen as a representation of hangout culture of Indonesian people (Cahya, 2018). The culture was 
greatly developed when Starbucks first came to Indonesia to open its stores. The moment was stated by Purnomo et 
al. (2021) as the “Starbuckization” process. Through this process, coffee was elevated as a symbol of social status 
(Purnomo et al. 2021). Indonesia’s coffee culture developed from just a mere culture into a part of people’s lifestyle

Abstract 
This article reveals how the possibility of implementing continuous auditing in a local public accounting firm in East 
Java Indonesia. The COVID-19 pandemic had a consistent impact on the implementation of audits carried out by local 
public accounting firms due to regulations related to restrictions on mobilization including field audit work that must 
be carried out. It is explained how the conditions of audit work during the pandemic and whether it is possible to 
implement continuous auditing as a support for technology development in the local public accounting firm 
environment from the readiness of the auditors. The method used in this research is case studies that focus on 
observation and in-depth interviews conducted to reveal possible changes that occur in audit work after the pandemic 
ends. In the research conducted, it was found that several local public accounting firms that have partners from big-
four public accounting firms are ready with the possibility of implementing continuous auditing, while some public 
accounting firms that have non-big-four partners still need a lot of preparation for change. Some of the obstacles 
include the lack of training on technology, human resources who are accustomed to manual work systems, human 
resources who find it difficult to re-learn about technology and human resources who resist change. The originality of 
this study lies in the object of research where the possibility of continuous auditing can be applied not only to big-four 
label firms but also to non-big-four public accounting firms on a local scale.

Abstract 
In 2018, Natuna was designated as a National Geopark. However, the promotion of Maritime Tourism on the Natuna 
beaches is still inferior when compared to Bali, Bangka and Belitung. Currently, Natuna is being prepared by the 
regional and central governments to become a UNESCO Global Geopark. Some of the requirements that must be met 
are geological heritage, international recognition, management systems, geopark sites, domestic and international 
facilities and networks. Based on the results of the Focus Discussion Group with the Head of the Tourism and Creative 
Industry Office and their staff, the obstacles faced by Natuna are human resources as well as technology and data in 
tourism promotion. This article discusses the Blockchain application model in the Natuna tourism industry. The 
developed model provides convenience in storing and using data and other sources of information. This technology 
promises to increase transparency and security in transactions, so tourists who want to travel to Natuna don't have to 
worry about Blockchain bringing security and transparency to several important touchpoints. Blockchain can make 
booking flights and hotels more secure and transparent as responsibility spreads across the network. With blockchain, 
all information appearing on the network is public, reliable, and secure, achieving greater transparency and increasing 
consumer trust. By presenting a case study of the application of blockchain technology in Natuna tourism, the authors 
analyze the potential use of blockchain technology in the tourism industry and discuss topics for further research.

information about booking airline tickets, boat tickets to local airports and seaports, as well as access to local hotels 
that cannot be booked online. (2) Information on boat rental fees for island hopping, as well as hobby tourism costs 
which include kayaking/canoeing, snorkeling, diving, fishing and so on, (3) Adding video material because in general, 
visitors prefer to watch videos rather than reading because they are more attractive for promotions from the visual side 
compared to the written side. (4) There is a comment section for tourists who have been to Natuna regarding Natuna 
tourism, to increase promotion. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The number of visits to the Natuna tourism website is still low because of the limited material from the website. In 
addition, there are no videos uploaded to the website. We recommend that in making website materials and managing 
websites, it is also advisable to involve local tourism actors so that they can enrich website content. In addition, there 
is also a need for a Focus Discussion Group with stakeholders involved in the promotion of Natuna tourism to provide 
input on the website that is being developed.

Abstract 
Indonesia is rich in cultural diversity and traditions. Indonesia's unexpected cultural wealth ranges from tradition, art, 
tourism, and culinary. Indonesia is a country rich in culture. The relationship between Indonesian culture and 
Indonesian Peranakan culture is also very close. The arrival of the Chinese from mainland China to Indonesia around 
the 14th or 15th century AD settled and married the locals, combining the socio-cultural and culinary diversity of the 
two nations. The culture born due to intercultural marriage is Indo-Chinese or Peranakan culture. This intangible 
heritage needs to be protected and preserved. Digital transformation in the manufacturing sector plays an essential 
role in the era of the industrial revolution 4.0. In 2018 the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, 
launched a road map of Making Indonesia 4.0 with the aspiration to make Indonesia into the top 10 of the world 
economy by 2030. At the same time, Indonesia's cultural and creative industries have developed, which play a 
significant role in promoting development. Indonesian economy. Indonesia supports creative innovation by deepening 
the concept that the cultural and creative industries encourage economic development. This paper raises the design of 
the Peranakan culture model to increase awareness of the Peranakan culture that can be sold in Indonesian tour 
packages. This model is expected to be developed to promote crossbreed tourism in other regions.

In addition, we must convey this historical fact to as many people as possible through design and creative thinking so 
that everyone can feel its charm and cultural value. Future research needs to collect large amounts of data on consumer 
responses to these Peranakan cultural products. Do products with cultural connotations affect them? Misinterpretation 
can be avoided when converting standard features into modern product designs. Furthermore, since interpreting and 
using culture is not an easy task, a comprehensive design process needs to be developed in the future. This will give 
designers clear instructions on how to design cultural products.

Abstract 
Along with the rapid advances in technology and innovation today because of globalization of the 21st century 
and the industrial revolution 4.0, educational learning outcomes need to be maintained so as not to deviate to 
the point of failure. Mandarin is a compulsory subject in Three Language schools (Indonesian, English, 
Mandarin). Thus, learning Mandarin at the Three-Language School also involves all forms of innovation and 
transformation that are currently taking place in the delivery of learning materials and learning assessments. 
Learning outcomes from learning are students' ability to communicate. This paper intends to analyze the latest 
technological advances and innovations in the Chinese language teaching process along with student test scores, 
data collection methods based on student activity in collecting assignments in Google Classroom (GCR) and 
students' final grades. The respondents of this study were 26 junior high school students at the Pahoa Three 
Language School, Tangerang. The exam questions include completing the dialogue (60%), answering questions 
after hearing the contents of the text (30%) and answering questions from reading (10%). The learning process 
that lasted for 4 months was evaluated 5 times with assignment at GCR. The conclusion of this study is that 
the intensity of task collection has a close relationship with test results. This research is expected to be a 
reference for further research by utilizing technology and innovation in learning and assignments, especially 
in foreign language learning.

1. Introduction.
Today, the development of Chinese language teaching has reached various aspects, the methods used are also 
diverse. One of them can also be through applications, for example the Mobile Assisted Language Learning 
(MALL) application, this application can be used to support classroom learning and independent learning at 
home (Jureynolds et.al 2021). In addition, the development of Chinese learning platforms, especially e-learning 
course-based platforms can maximize the advantages of functional, structural, variety, and content management 
aspects (Jureynolds et.al 2020). 
During the pandemic, the use of online media as a medium to collect student assignments also emerged, for 
example with the online media Google Classroom (GCR). GCR allows teachers to directly provide assignments 
to students, then ask them to submit assignments in their virtual classrooms and provide feedback on their work. 
With online media such as GCR, students become more flexible in collecting assignments that have been given 
by the teacher. 
Apart from technology as a supporting material in learning, the role of the teacher also has a significant 
influence on students' learning abilities. In addition, the teacher's response in improving student learning is also 
a consideration in various aspects, including proficiency in using technological devices, etc. Lisnawati (2021) 
states that the teacher's response to the use of multimedia is very important, because it is the teacher who will 
operate the tool and on the other hand the media can really improve the learning process and results. In addition, 
lecturers must also be able to provide motivation and arouse students' desire to improve their speaking skills

5. Conclusion 
Based on the research above, we can conclude that the use of GCR-based learning applications also has a 
significant influence on student activity in participating in learning. In learning using the GCR media, a more 
practical collection does not guarantee that all students will collect it on time, but it has a close relationship 
with student test results, where students who do not submit assignments in the GCR tend to have lower scores. 
Therefore, the application of using GCR learning media needs to be carried out as much as possible

Abstract 
An understanding of cross-culture provides an overview of communication between different cultures. There 
are often inhibiting factors in the process of learning and understanding intercultural communication. Barriers 
to intercultural communication may occur because of cultural differences between communicators and 
communicants. Provision of cross-cultural knowledge to students needs to be done before students enter the 
workforce. So that they can adapt according to the field of work they are engaged in. This study discusses the 
role of cross-cultural knowledge in the field of work. The respondents are 99 alumni from three universities in 
Indonesia who work in various fields. The fields of work studied are admin, manager, trainer, translator. This 
research was conducted using a quantitative method, the results of the analysis of ANOVA testing (post-hoc 
analysis) using the Bonferroni method. The results of the test of the significance of the difference in the mean 
of the four groups of verbal ability rating scores obtained from the four sample clusters, namely the rating 
scores of admin, manager, trainer, and translator, showed significant test results. This is indicated by the value 
of F = 3.149 at = 0.05 and = 0.01 which is indicated by the value of -p = 0.29. The results of the research show 
that the order of work that requires cross-cultural knowledge is translator, manager, admin and trainer. This 
research is expected to be a reference for higher education providers to prepare human resources who have 
cross-cultural knowledge. In addition, it is hoped that further research can provide a model of cross-cultural 
knowledge to management in higher education.

1. Introduction
Kanungo, R. (2006) stated that culture is the key to people's way of life. So that by studying culture, we can 
also understand how to act and behave in society. Understanding cultural differences is one of the most 
important skills for companies to thrive, to have a competitive advantage in international business, that's why 
the study is focusing on how to remove barriers in cross-cultural communication. Cross-cultural 
communication often refers to the notion of intercultural communication. It has an important function, 
especially when one begins to establish bilateral, trilateral, or multilateral correlations. Cross-cultural 
communication serves to reduce the uncertainty of communication between people, between tribes, and 
between nations who do not share the same culture. Cross-cultural communication is very crucial, especially 
to those who want to achieve mutually beneficial cooperative relationships. 
The importance of cross-cultural communication for harmonious international relations. Cross-cultural 
communication is a communication process carried out by two or more cultures. The goal is to reduce the level 
of misunderstanding and minimize conflicts. Basically, every communication process almost always involves 
culture. Because communication is a means of transmitting culture, and culture is a form, process, technique, 
and social method in human life that continues to be entrenched. By updating and adjusting the relationship 
between communicators and communicants, the process of cross-cultural communication can be successful 
and effective. The effectiveness of cross-cultural communication will create peace and be able to reduce 
conflicts that may occur between communities. Barriers to intercultural communication can occur because of

translator rating scores is not significant at = -0.78 with a value of -p = 0.069. The results of the test are 
significant, the difference between the average rating scores of translators and admins is significant at = 0.19 
with a value of -p = 0.65. The results of the significant test the difference between the mean score of rating 
translators and managers was not significant at = 0.59 with a value of -p = 0.87. The results of the test are 
significant the difference between the mean score of rating translator and trainer is significant at = 0.78 with a 
value of -p = 0.69. The results of the significant test of the difference between the average rating scores of the 
four types of work can be seen from Figure 1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Culture Capability Curves for 4 Types of Jobs 
 
From the above, the average manager rating score is the highest and is followed by translators. Admin is in 
third place while the lowest order is trainer. Thus, to work as a manager and translator cultural skills are needed. 
Cultural ability in this case is to understand how to work, work habits, work rules and work ethics in foreign 
companies. It also understands how to get along with strangers. Managers and translators are people who often 
deal with foreigners and communicate intensely with their colleagues or partners or customers. Thus, cultural 
skills are needed so that communication and work run smoothly. While administrators usually work behind a 
desk. However, it also requires cultural knowledge to adapt to the work environment and co-workers who are 
foreign nationals. Trainers rarely interact with foreigners because their main task is to deliver teaching materials 
or materials. So, it doesn't really need cultural skills to communicate with foreigners. Thus, the need for cultural 
skills is also the lowest among other fields of work. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that the sequence of jobs that required cross-cultural knowledge were translator, manager, 
admin and trainer. Managers and translators are required to have cultural knowledge. Cultural ability in this 
case is to understand how to work, work habits, work rules and work ethics in foreign companies. It also 
understands how to get along with strangers. The work of managers and translators requires them to 
communicate more actively and intensely with their colleagues or partners or customers. Thus, cross-cultural 
skills are needed so that communication and work run smoothly and so that unwanted conflicts do not occur 
due to miss communication. Meanwhile, administrators usually work behind a desk, so they rarely work in the 
field or interact with outsiders from different cultures. However, administrators also need cultural knowledge 
in order to be able to adapt to the work environment and co-workers of different cultures, especially those who 
are foreign nationals. Trainers rarely interact with foreigners because their main task is to deliver teaching 
materials or materials. So it doesn't really need cultural skills to communicate with foreigners. However, the 
trainer also needs to equip himself with cross-cultural knowledge so that he can convey it to his students so 
that they also understand how to communicate with people who are different from their culture.

The translator's job requires him to master other cultures so that the accuracy of the translation results and the 
use of language in conveying the translation results can be understood by second parties or third parties. Thus, 
the translator profession is required to always add insight and ability to translate quickly and be able to 
summarize all the information heard and transfer it to the target language with the right language choice. This 
research is expected to be a reference for higher education providers, especially the compilers of the Chinese 
Literature curriculum to prepare human resources who have cross-cultural knowledge. In addition, further 
research is expected to provide a model of cross-cultural knowledge to management in higher education. The 
limitation of this study is the limited number of respondents because it only involves alumni from three private 
universities in Indonesia. Future research is expected to increase the number of questionnaires so that the results 
obtained are more varied.

Abstract 
Research on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has developed tremendously over the past four decades, especially 
regarding affective organizational commitment, organizational behavior, and many other variables. However, research 
on how employee perception on organizational CSR activities and how it relates to job performance are still scant in 
nature. This study aims to answer these gaps. This study uses quantitative approach using Social Exchange Theory as 
the underlying argument. Purposive sampling is used in this study with aim on Greater Jakarta area (Jabodetabek), 
and the questionnaire was distributed using WhatsApp application. As many as 105 respondents returned the 
distributed questionnaire, in which only 93 is deemed to be worthy of further analyses. Four variables are used to be 
the focus of this study, namely Employee perception on CSR, Job Performance, Employee Engagement and Job 
Satisfaction. The study found that Employee perceived CSR directly affect Job Performance. The variable of 
Employee Engagement partially mediated the relationship between Employee perceived CSR and Job Performance. 
While Job Satisfaction did not mediate the relationship between Employee perceived CSR towards Job Performance. 
This study manages to provide contribution in the literature of CSR especially in the perspective of Employee 
perception on CSR and in the context of developing countries.

1. Introduction
Business activities can have a positive and negative influence on society and the environment, (Sarfraz Qun, Abdullah 
and Alvi, 2018) which makes Corporate social responsibility an important topic in public policy (Wang, Xu, Wang, 
2020). This is mostly due to its role in minimizing negative external implications (Sarfraz et al., 2018), which makes 
research on Corporate Social Responsibility becoming more and more important topic in literature. Kotler & Lee 
(2005) defines Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a commitment to improving the welfare of society through 
free business practices and the contribution of corporate resources. A similar definition was also put forward by 
Coombs & Holladay (2012) regarding CSR which is a voluntary action implemented by a company when carrying 
out its mission and fulfilling its obligations to stakeholders, including employees, society, and the environment. Then, 
Santoso (2014) emphasizes that CSR that carried out with the aim of meeting legal requirements is not a voluntary 
actions, thus it cannot be considered as CSR. Previous research has found a positive relationship between CSR 
perceptions and various employee outcomes, such as affective organizational commitment (AOC), job satisfaction, 
organizational identification, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), creativity and employee engagement (Hur, 
Moon and Choi, 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Aguinis & Glavas, 2012). However, the exact mechanism by which the 
perception of CSR can improve employee work outcomes is still somewhat elusive (Hur et al., 2019) and the lack of 
rigor in exploring the mediator of the relationship of CSR perceptions with employee job performance (Glavas, 2016). 
Meanwhile, based on the Social Exchange Theory (SET) some previous researchers found that when employees feel 
respected and valued by organizations that implement CSR, they are willing to trust the organization and take more 
responsibility and effort for improving their performance to reach the organizational target (Wang et al., 2020; Tafolli

Abstract 
The topic of electronic service quality (e-service quality) has been developed especially during pandemic 2020. This study 
examines the performance of e-service quality in relating to customer satisfaction in the context of online investment portal. 
The online Mutual Fund portal has increased new investors via its ease of access, affordability, and product availability. The 
results of the study show that aspects of Portal design, customer service quality, and security have a significant positive 
influence on the quality of electronic services but not on fulfillment aspects. Furthermore, the aspect of electronic service 
quality is proven to have a significant effect on customer satisfaction and brand image but does not influence customer trust. 
In addition, Brand Image does not affect the satisfaction, trust, and loyalty of online Mutual Fund customers. While customer 
satisfaction and trust have a significant positive effect on customer loyalty, this customer satisfaction does not encourage 
customers to be more trusting of online Mutual Fund portal service providers. This study provides empirical result from e-
service quality framework from Blut in Journal of Retailing (2015 & 2016).

1. Introduction
Mutual Fund products are currently increasingly popular and have become an investment instrument that can be said to be 
suitable for investors with various characters, ranging from aggressive, moderate, or conservative. Mutual Funds are very 
suitable for beginners to advanced investors because they have the advantage of having high liquidity, easier to be transparent 
and managed by professionals. According to George (2016) there are four main factors that drive the rapid growth of the Mutual 
Fund industry. Namely, ease of access (Accessibility) supported by infrastructure and wider distribution channels, affordability 
(affordability), public awareness of the importance of investment (Awareness) and availability (Availability) of various types 
of products in accordance with the risk profile and investment objectives of customers. Innovation and technological progress 
are important factors that support public interest in investing in Mutual Funds (Panda and Ali, 2018). 
The online Mutual Fund investment services offered by investment manager companies and Mutual Fund selling agents since 
OJK allowed account opening and Mutual Fund purchase transactions to be conducted electronically in 2014 was an important 
breakthrough in the Mutual Fund industry in Indonesia. This service greatly facilitates the public and makes mutual fund 
investment more comfortable and friendly for ordinary investors. The process of opening accounts and conventional Mutual 
Fund transactions that were previously carried out was deemed time consuming and inefficient because they had to rely on 
physical documents manually and required wet signatures. The digital Mutual Fund platform will become a trend in the future 
because it can adapt to the times, by providing convenience, customer convenience and more efficient transactions and will

As for the results of hypothesis testing in this research, there are 8 accepted hypotheses and 5 rejected hypotheses. Aspects of 
Portal design, customer service quality, and security have a significant positive influence on the quality of electronic services 
in the context of the online Mutual Fund portal. While the fulfillment aspect does not affect the quality of electronic services. 
Furthermore, the aspect of electronic service quality has been shown to have a significant effect on customer satisfaction and 
brand image but not on customer confidence in the online Mutual Fund portal provider company. In addition, Brand Image 
does not affect the satisfaction, trust, and loyalty of online Mutual Fund customers. Meanwhile, customer satisfaction has a 
significant positive effect on customer loyalty and encourages customers to have more confidence in the credibility, competence 
and expertise of online Mutual Fund portal service providers. In this study, it was also found that customer trust had a significant 
positive effect on customer loyalty for companies providing online Mutual Fund portals. 
 
Meanwhile, based on the results of further testing using PLS Multi Group Analysis (MGA) it was found that there was a 
moderating effect that caused 2 significant differences that affected customer satisfaction between the investment manager 
customer respondent group and the selling agent. In this case, E-Service Quality has a more significant effect on customer 
satisfaction of the online Mutual Fund portal of the Mutual Fund Selling Agent compared to the customer of the online Mutual 
Fund portal of the investment manager. On the other hand, the brand image (reputation and track record) of investment manager 
companies has a more significant impact on customer satisfaction. 
6. Conclusions  
This research is one of the initial efforts to contribute to the literature reference on the digitalization of the Mutual Fund industry 
in Indonesia by conducting an extensive investigation related to the quality aspects of electronic services in the context of the 
development of an online Mutual Fund transaction portal. In this study, the researcher adapted a comprehensive e-service 
quality model that is able to predict customer behavior better than other widely used scales without overestimating the 
importance of electronic service quality attributes. 
 
Based on the results of the study conducted, the model proposed by the researcher has acceptable results of convergent validity 
and discriminant validity. This shows that all constructs, both formative and reflective, first order and second order in the 
structure of this model are supported by conceptual theory. Furthermore, all constructs in this model are also reliable and have 
moderate predictive ability. In terms of portal design aspects, product variety, information quality and convenience are the most 
dominant factors that can affect customer functionality assessments of the online Mutual Fund portal. 
 
In the context of product variety and quality, it is very important for investment manager companies to always maintain and 
improve the performance of the Mutual Fund products they manage and provide a wide selection of products according to 
investment objectives and customer risk profiles. In this case, investment manager companies can optimize their product

marketing efficiently by establishing partnerships with Mutual Fund selling agent companies. So that they can focus more on 
the performance of the Mutual Fund products they manage. On the other hand, Mutual Fund selling agent companies need to 
be more selective in offering Mutual Fund products by only offering products that perform well from investment manager 
companies that have a track record and reputation to their customers. 
 
Due to time and resource constraints, this study only used a small sample size (115 respondents), which may not significantly 
represent the proportion of online mutual fund investors and it is necessary to pay attention to the comparison of the number 
of respondents per group in order to be more balanced. Further research can focus on the context of the development of online 
Mutual Fund portals in Indonesia. That is by examining the relationship of E-Service Quality to the behavior of online Mutual 
Fund portal customers by combining trends in the market such as the collaboration of online Mutual Fund portals with 
marketplaces, digital wallets, payment gateway companies and digital banking, such as the collaboration of fintech companies 
to invest in mutual funds, Seeds with Digital Bank Company (Bank Jago) and the interesting acquisition of a mutual fund 
fintech company (Ajaib) over a securities company recently that has just happened in the Indonesian Capital Market today.

Abstract 
Currently, the number of SMEs reaches 64.2 million, while those with a digital ecosystem account for 23.9% of the 
total number of SMEs in Indonesia. In 2022, Indonesia will begin to enter the stage of faster and more transformative 
SMEs economic recovery. Based on Presidential Decree No. 18 of 2020, the Presidential Regulation aims to improve 
the economy and welfare by accelerating the national digital transformation. SMEs problems are found in several 
fields: management, organization, technology, capital, operational and technical, limited market access, business 
licensing constraints, and non-technical costs. With these conditions, an acceleration of digital transformation is 
needed to facilitate activities in running a business for SMEs. This study aims to create collaborations for SMEs 
business innovations due to the lack of capabilities in determining the suitable collaboration model for conducting 
SMEs business. The methods used in this research are Service Quality and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) 
methods. In this study, there are 15 attributes of a business collaboration system desired by SMEs, namely product 
trends, product ideas, selling price information, return processes, product quality strengths and weaknesses, product 
testing, customer needs, idea development opportunities, raw material prices, delivery processes, availability of 
materials, complaint process, product specification requirements, production process. The technical characteristics 
used are 9 attributes. The attributes are information on customer characteristics, delivery schedule information, raw 
material requirements, product quality information, customer needs information, product development frequency 
information, product testing schedule information, production flow information, and process time information.

A fast business collaboration system can make it easier for SMEs to carry out activities in business processes. The 
design of the collaboration system follows the wishes of SMEs, making it easier for SMEs to carry out business 
collaboration systems. Thus, the productivity of SMEs can increase and can be competitive. (Table 6) 
 
 
6. Conclusion  
The technical characteristics used are nine attributes. The attributes are Information on customer characteristics, 
delivery schedule information, raw material requirements, product quality information, customer needs Information, 
product development frequency information, product testing schedule information, production flow information, and 
process time information. In this study, there are 15 attributes of a business collaboration system desired by SMEs, 
namely product trends, product ideas, selling price information, return processes, product quality strengths and 
weaknesses, product testing, customer needs, idea development opportunities, raw material prices, delivery processes, 
availability of materials, complaint process, product specification requirements, production process. 
 
The priority attribute level of consumer needs (the voice of customer) to the business collaboration system with a 
value of Normalized Raw Weight of 8.02% is n raw material prices, and attributes with a value of Normalized Raw 
Weight of 7.51% are product testing. The priority description of the technical characteristics of the target on the 
business collaboration system from the analysis of Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is Information on raw

Abstract 
Hourensou is one of the Japanese corporate cultures which regulates the communication system in daily operation 
management. Ozora publishing is one of the Japanese companies that also implements hourensou in the execution 
of daily work. The research verified how Ozora publishing implements hourensou within the company activity. 
The research method is qualitative and quantitative by spreading the questionnaire about hourensou to be 
answered by Ozora employees in Japan. Hourensou implementation is analyzed in the descriptive analysis 
method. It can be concluded that the research has acknowledged the performance of hourensou in Ozora 
publishing. Implementing hourensou within work activity could make teamwork and the work’s flow more 
efficient..

1.Introduction
Hourensou is a Japanese work culture that regulates the communication system in the organization. Hourensou is 
an abbreviation of houkoku-renraku-soudan, houkoku which means to report, renraku which means to inform, 
and soudan which means to discuss or consult. From previous research, the author can understand that the 
definition of hourensou is as follows, houkoku activity is to implement a reporting system for every progress of 
work that has been done. Renraku means confirming or informing related parties. Members of the team must 
always confirm the circumstances regarding the work being carried out, by always having confirmation of 
progress in the workplace can prevent misunderstandings in communication. Soudan is to consult all problems 
faced by employees to superiors and team members, and the goal of Soudan is to find solutions to existing 
problems. A Japanese company applies hourensou in the implementation of work. Ozora publishing is also one 
of the Japanese companies that also applies hourensou in the company. Implementing hourensou in a team and 
maintaining fluency in communication can also make team relationships more potent and integrated due to 
continuous communication. 
Studies found that online / web-based language learning or mobile based language learning has been an efficient 
method in reducing anxiety and increasing motivation (Cong-Lem, 2018), interactive and helpful (Saud, et.al., 
2020), or even improving inclusiveness (Simanjuntak, et.al., 2018).  With an attempt to develop an online 
language learning platform, a team of language experts and IT professionals at a private university in Jakarta 
worked together to assemble an online language learning platform.  The platform, available in mobile and web, 
was built on the team’s  interpretation of Krashen’s Second Language Acquisition theory that revolves around the 
five hypotheses, i.e., the acquisition-learning hypothesis, monitoring hypothesis, input hypothesis, the affective 
filter hypothesis, and the natural order hypothesis. (Krashen, 1982) and aspects of sociocultural theory in learning 
( Vygotsky, 1987 ). Thus, it was designed with the ultimate understanding that students need to have personalized,

As many as 83% of respondents (19 people) will discuss problems that need to be consulted and also prepare 
solutions that have been thought of by themselves regarding the problems to be consulted, while 17% of 
respondents (4 people) will only prepare discussions of problems that need to be consulted. 
 
Like explained by Nobe (2013), there are several things that must be prepared before doing soudan: 
1) Arrange the discussion content 
2) Arrange the flow of the conversation 
3) Made answers to the questions, gather documents 
4) Think of solutions from self 
By preparing these 4 things, soudan activities will be maximized as mention by Nobe (2013). 
Most of the Ozora publishing employees have been able to carry out soudan activities properly, according to Nobe 
(2013) that the things to be prepared before carrying out soudan activities are one of them making discussions 
and preparing solutions from yourself regarding the problems you want to discuss. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Ozora publishing employees apply hourensou by involving the entire internal company, not only doing hourensou 
activities for superiors, but fellow work team members and subordinates. In the case of implementing renraku 
regarding reporting information from clients that must be conveyed to team members, it is submitted with 
additional information. The application of hourensou emphasizes information about the development or progress 
of a job being done, this is in accordance with the hourensou culture. The effectiveness of implementing 
Hourensou in companies is problems can be detected quickly, accurately, and in a shorter time because issues are 
easily detected and resolved soon. Hourensou is also more cost-effective because problems are detected quickly 
to reduce losses. Besides that, the relationship between teams is getting stronger and more integrated. In this study 
the author realizes that further researchers possible to do research hourensou associated with different things, for 
example, the application of hourensou following the development of an increasingly sophisticated technological 
era.

Abstract 
This study aims to analyze the effect of Ownership Structure, Profitability, and Liquidity on Risk Disclosure in 
Banking Companies for the Period 2017 to 2020, both partially and simultaneously. Good corporate governance is 
measured by Managerial Ownership and Public Share Ownership. Meanwhile, profitability is measured by Return 
on Asset (ROA) and Liquidity is measured using the Loan Dept Ratio (LDR). The data used was obtained from the 
annual financial statements of banks published on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2017 to 2020. This 
study used the research method of Multiple Linear Regression with Panel Data. The results showed that Managerial 
Ownership and Public Share Ownership had partial positive and significant. In addition, profitability has also proven 
to have positive and significant. Meanwhile, the Liquidity variable was not found to have a significant on Risk 
Disclosure in Banks from 2017 to 2020.

1. Introduction
The economic development of a country is influenced by supporting industrial conditions. The banking industry is 
one of the industries that play a very important role in supporting economic development, namely collecting and 
distributing funds. The distribution of funds in the form of credit will increase industrial development in the real 
sector which supports the country's economic growth and reduces the unemployment rate. The banking industry is 
also an industry that is very vulnerable to risk because banking involves managing public money which is played in 
various forms of investment. Financial institutions, namely banks, have more complex risks, including operational 
risk, legal risk, credit risk, compliance risk, market risk, liquidity risk, reputation risk, and strategic risk (PBI 
Number 11/25/PBI/2009). So too avoids these risks, banks are expected to be able to manage properly and be able to 
carry out their duties and functions as organizers of the state economy.

Effect of Liquidity on Risk Management Disclosure 
Liquidity (LDR) has a probability of 0.9597 or greater than a significance level of 0.05 (5%). So hypothesis H4 is 
rejected and H0 is rejected, which means that liquidity has a significant influence on risk disclosure in banking 
companies from 2017 to 2020. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research that has been carried out and supported by theory and previous research, the 
conclusion is that during the period of observation of risk management disclosure, proxied by RMD. Management 
ownership, public ownership, and profitability have a significant positive effect on risk management disclosure. In 
contrast, liquidity has no significant positive effect on risk management disclosure.

Abstract 
The model of entrepreneurial universities is believed to be the main driving force for independence and innovation 
and appropriate response to environmental turbulence and rapid market changes. In addition to teaching and research, 
the accomplishment of becoming entrepreneurial is seldom immediate and requires a transformation process. This 
study aimed to assess the transformation process of a private university in Indonesia in becoming entrepreneurial. Its 
analytical framework was based on an entrepreneurial university model with six variables: actors, university 
governance, entrepreneurial activity, entrepreneurial output, support measures needed, and challenges. Using a 
descriptive-analytic method, the results obtained from the questionnaire administered to 541 respondents, belonging 
to various groups from within and outside the university indicated that University “A” is currently treading an 
entrepreneurial path. The assessment results for the perceived value from entrepreneurial indicators, at an average 
score above 4, implied a positive perception of entrepreneurial implementation. Subsequently, mapping the results 
into a transformation model positioned the university close to the entrepreneurial paradigm.

1. Introduction
The adaptability of education systems is required to meet new challenges arising from the impact of rapid 
developments in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Several institutions of higher learning have been 
significantly pressured by massive technological advances creating both challenges and opportunities. Advances in 
technology have propelled the teaching practice to become personalized and more accommodative to the needs of 
students. The emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), because of exploiting opportunities offered by 
technological developments, is a phenomenon that enables universities to operate entrepreneurially, and secure a high 
public value orientation (Wood et al., 2008). 
There are 3,269 public and private colleges (Menristekdikti, 2019) in Indonesia, the 4th most populous country in the 
world (Indonesia Population, 2020). Having been ranked 40th in the global competitiveness index in 2020, HEIs in 
Indonesia face challenges in competing with the quality of graduates at the international level. Therefore, it is essential 
to encourage HEIs in Indonesia to produce graduates who meet the demands of the current world and utilize their 
entrepreneurial spirit to generate employment. 
The entrepreneurship level in Indonesia is low, ranking 50th out of 80 surveyed countries (Entrepreneurship Rankings, 
2020), with only 3.1% of the total population becoming entrepreneurs in 2018, estimated at 8 million according to the 
Indonesian Ministry of Industry. Compared to other ASEAN countries such as Malaysia and Singapore, this figure is 
relatively low. To execute the third mission of HEIs (Readings, 1996), universities in Indonesia should be encouraged 
to contribute significantly to the development of societal and economic growth through entrepreneurship development 
activities.

As described earlier, the spectrum of entrepreneurial activity shifts from traditional to entrepreneurial. The assessment 
result of University “A” was mapped into a transformation model, illustrating that the more it aligned with the 
entrepreneurial paradigm, the closer it was to its goal of transforming into an entrepreneurial university (Philpott et 
al., 2011). 
Using the results of the survey, where the perceived value of several entrepreneurial indicators was above 4 (very 
good perception), the transformation position of University “A” was close to the entrepreneurial paradigm, as 
illustrated in Figure 1. 
6. Conclusion
Higher education institutions are not enough to focus only on teaching and research, without realizing what society 
needs from the world of education. Therefore, they play a significant role in supporting economic development, both 
at regional and national levels. In addition, universities are expected to produce graduates who will adapt to future 
needs. 
Becoming an entrepreneurial university is a direction that universities may choose as an adaptive response to demands 
in today's rapidly paced changing environment. Several universities have adopted entrepreneurial behavioral 
developments in mainstream education. The ability to respond to the demands of change through innovation and 
survive traditional patterns, whether through entrepreneurialism or other means, is necessary. 
The assessment carried out involving all groups starting from the university leaders, faculties, staff, students, alumni, 
and external resources showed that University “A” is on the path of transformation to become entrepreneurial. The 
positioning of the university in the transformation model was closer to the entrepreneurial paradigm, which means 
that it is closer to becoming an ideal entrepreneurial university. 
The achievements until 2021 as mentioned by respondents indicated that although teaching and research remained the 
main focus for the University “A”, prioritizing quality and adapting to changing times with the awareness that 
technology plays an important role in today's digital era also received equal importance. 
The results of this empirical research indicate that universities do not have to openly declare themselves as 
entrepreneurial universities, or as transitioning into an entrepreneurial university. Instead, the behavior they implement 
demonstrates that adaptability and innovation are pivotal in meeting the increasing demands of dynamic changes and 
encouraging the community to contribute to realizing economic development. 
From the results of this case study, it can be inferred that entrepreneurial universities tend to excel in internal and 
external achievements. This raises the hypothesis that the resulting performance is a product of the ongoing 
entrepreneurial transformation, which can be explored through further research.

Abstract 
Rapid technological development drives the development of technology for reducing distracted driving. Acceptance 
to such technologies is complex and relatively unknown, as it relies on various constructs and different characteristics 
of the users. Studies on technology acceptance can contribute to product development and policymaking to minimize 
driver distraction. This work presents a review of empirical research on technology acceptance for distracted-driving 
reduction technology, referred from 10 published studies within the past 10 years. Models that are evaluated include 
behavioral science theory such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and other proposed variables which 
influence the acceptance and usage of the technologies. Similarities and differences between studies with potential 
limitations and gaps are analyzed in this work. The results indicate that TAM is the most common model, proven to 
be a robust and useful tool. Additional factors added are proven to be insightful to complement the existing constructs 
in TAM. This work concluded less distraction is proven to improve driving performance, but at the cost of user 
acceptance. Discrepancy in term of studied location is highlighted in this work. Majority of the empirical studies are 
conducted in U.S. and European populations. Asian regions, despite largely populated with vehicle users, are severely 
underrepresented.

1. Introduction
Distracted driving is described as any activity that diverts the driver’s attention from driving. Distracted driving has 
serious consequences towards road safety. NHTSA reported 3.142 fatalities in the Unites States in 2019 were related 
to distracted driving, contributing to 15% of all police reported crashes. Razi-Ardakani et al. (2019) studied that 
distraction-related factors are the most important contributor to severity of car crashes. While Shaaban et al. (2020) 
stated in-vehicle distractions strongly affect crash likelihood amongst young drivers. It encapsulates any action that 
diverts one’s attention from safe driving, including talking or texting on the phone, eating and drinking, talking to 
other people inside the vehicle, or interacting with stereo, entertainment, or navigation systems (National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA], 2020). Jazayeri et al. (2021) defined these tasks as secondary tasks which 
encompassed any distraction that does not include tasks that are critical to the driving such as: checking the 
speedometer, checking for blind spots, activating headlight, etc. Driving distractions could be attributed to internal 
and external distractions. Internal distractions occur inside the vehicle, for example distraction from mobile phones 
(Guo et al. 2021), route-guidance systems and navigation technology (Yang et al. 2021; Oviedo-Tres Palacios & 
Watson 2021), entertainment systems, and nontechnological distractions such as eating and drinking. Radio 
adjustments, seatbelt adjustments, and other non-critical tasks done in-vehicle are considered part of internal 
distraction. External distractions occur outside the vehicle, such as road lighting (Robbins & Fotios, 2021) and digital 
billboards (Sheykhfard & Haghighi, 2020). As distraction needed mental resources to process new information while 
driving, it claimed further cognitive resources (mental workload). Drivers’ attentional capacity decrease as there are 
more information being processed (Ortega, et al., 2021). 
Considering the dangers of distracted driving, efforts have been made to develop prevention and/or reduction 
technology. Certain car features to prevent and/or reduce distraction have been introduced in cars manufactured within 
1440","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

it is concluded that TAM is the most popular model, with most studies modifying the constructs to the context of the 
objects and population observed.  Trust is a significant construct in all studies that incorporated it to the original model. 
Also as suggested by Stiegemeier et al. (2022), safety should be considered in further research as driving is a safety-
critical task. Findings in these studies are beneficial in determining ways of interaction that could reduce driver 
distraction. Users generally prefer non-tactile systems in their driving experience (Graichen et al., 2019, Lee et al., 
2015). Rather than reducing workload, users also prefer blocking type of technology (Oviedo-Trespalacios et al. 2020) 
and clear, less intrusive warnings (Kujala et al. 2015). 
 
Driving performance improved with less distraction, but at the cost of user acceptance. As demonstrated by Jung et 
al. (2019), full lockout system is less preferred than the partial lock-out. Acceptance decreases when the technology 
forcibly demanded too much to the users. Users need some freedom for customization to increase their acceptance 
(Normark & Mankila, 2013). Regarding past experiences, perception-only study and simulator study play a significant 
role. Past experiences when not specific to the technology tested will not get accurate results on the acceptance 
measured, as found in Roberts et .al (2012). Minor differences between in-vehicle and smartphone-based technology 
in the study conducted by Lee et al. (2015) showed both means are equally accepted by users. Conclusion could be 
drawn that the development of technology for reducing distracted driving could go in any direction; stationary in-
vehicle technology and nomadic technology. These findings showed that while initial constructs of TAM are proven 
to be useful, more detailed research on other contributing factors such as additional constructs and interface design 
attributes is needed. Closer look upon the specific society the technology is being deployed, as results may vary 
depending on the socio-demographic condition. 
 
There is also room for further improvements identified through this review. The studies presented are mostly done in 
developed western countries. While there are different levels of knowledge and familiarity, these countries generally 
have high awareness for road safety and in-vehicle technology. This indicates discrepancy, with lack of studies in 
Asia-Africa regions and other developing countries. Social-demographic variables would also impact results in 
different countries, as demonstrated by Roberts et al. (2012). Aside from the choice of country, it will be interesting 
to see the study in populations that are generally more unfamiliar with in-vehicle technology and more resistant to be 
introduced to in-vehicle technology. Location (intersection, tight turns etc.) are found to have significant difference 
on objective data (Kujala et al. 2015), acceptance of such technologies might differ when tested on countries with 
different driving terrain and situational conditions.  
 
Most of the studies conducted were cross-sectional. Safety features in IVIS and smartphone might increase the 
interaction between users and the technology due to false sense of security. There would be a need for longitudinal 
study in different populations across the world to see whether the benefits of technology for reducing distraction 
outweigh its negative effects in prolonged usage. The glance studies deployed while useful is still limited by the 
reliability of the equipment used outside of laboratory setting. Subsequently, Widyanti et al. (2017) concluded that 
eye blink rate is appropriate for assessing visually demanding task rather than mentally demanding task, which both 
are the nature of driving. When more advanced technological breakthrough regarding glance tracking got introduced, 
this technology and appropriate real-world scenarios could be leveraged to conduct more accurate analyses and for 
other studies in different countries.  
 
Indonesia is one of the developing countries with surprisingly high acceptance of distracted driving reducing 
technology, despite the general population having lower knowledge and interest in such technologies. Simultaneously, 
Indonesia also has high prevalence of mobile phone and generally exhibit unsafe driving behavior (Widyanti et al., 
2020). As distraction is related to mental workload, objective studies measuring mental workload has been performed 
in Indonesia (Widyanti et al., 2017; Widyanti, et al., 2017) and another assessed acceptance for a variety of technology 
such as Bluetooth audio systems, cellphone blocking application, and phone mirroring. In the future, multiple 
assessment methods should be combined (objective and subjective studies). In addition, further study should consider 
broader range of technology and verify whether the acceptance level was connected to built-in features available in 
recent car models circulating in Indonesia. Consideration is to be made on performing longitudinal studies to observe 
drivers’ behavior in longer periods of time and measure objective data regarding driving performance.

Abstract 
This research develops a joint optimization model for a two-tier supply chain by involving a manufacturer and a 
retailer. We investigate the impact of investment in setup cost reduction and electric-powered equipment such as 
electric forklifts and trucks on the joint total cost. CO2 emissions are produced by both parties and transportation 
activities involving a logistics provider. The products at the manufacturer’s warehouse are collected by a logistic 
provider and delivered to the retailer’s warehouse by using the electric truck. We consider the lead-time that depends 
on the production time, transportation time, material handling time, and in-transit time. The goal is to minimize the 
joint total cost, which is to obtain the decision variables, such as the lot size, factor of safety, and the number of 
batches. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. The result shows that 
the proposed model compared with Wangsa et al. (2020) can significantly affect cost-saving, increase service level, 
short lead-time, and reduce carbon emissions levels by 24.42%; 0.36%; 41.03%; and 29.41%, respectively. 
Keywords 
Two-tier supply chain, electric vehicles, setup cost reduction, stochastic lead-time, and carbon emissions. 
1. Introduction
In the last decade, research on sustainability issues has grown rapidly in various countries. One of them is the problem 
of greenhouse gas emissions. The greenhouse gas that has the greatest impact on air quality is carbon emissions, one 
of which is carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This pollutant is a greenhouse gas that is a major cause of global warming 
and climate change. Recently, climate change that has occurred is the effect of global warming caused by the increase 
in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Global warming now has clear evidence of natural damage and disasters that 
have hit various parts of the world, including degradation, hail, floods, earthquakes, and tsunamis. These impacts will 
affect the sustainability of ecosystems in the future. In the era of Industry 4.0, a variety of emerging technologies, such 
as electric vehicles, drones, and robotics have emerged to help many people work. Unlike traditional vehicles that still 
use fossil fuels, the types of electric vehicles (trucks, vans, and motorcycles) that run on electricity are environmentally 
friendly (low emissions). The disadvantage of using an electric vehicle is the very high initial investment cost of the 
equipment (Bahnke, 2019). In addition, the electric vehicle needs to be recharged and the charging station needs to be 
visited, resulting in lower actual shipping weight (Breunig et al., 2019). Lead-time is one concern for coordinating in 
the supply chain system between a supplier and a retailer. Lead time and setup cost reductions are key business 
parameters, as order size, service levels, and CO2 emissions are directly or indirectly affected by this concern. In 
practice, setup costs investment can be reduced by training workers, changing procedures, and purchasing special 
equipment (Tiwari et al., 2018b). 
Currently, almost all activities that occur in the supply chain area (such as storage, production, and transportation) 
have an impact on carbon emissions (Benjafaar et al., 2012). However, transportation activities produce the most 
carbon emissions among other activities (The US EPA, 2021). Several researchers have studied inventory control with 
the costs of carbon emission. Wangsa (2017) studied the effect of penalties incentives of carbon for a single vendor-
buyer system. Tiwari et al. (2018a) modeled an integrated inventory model that considers carbon emissions, 
deterioration of items, and product defects. An integrated production-inventory model to reduce controllable lead 
times, order costs, and setup costs was developed by Tiwari et al (2018b). The effect of probabilistic demand, reject 
products, and costs of carbon emission on an integrated inventory model was investigated by Jauhari et al. (2018). 
Daryanto et al. (2019) investigated a three-tier supply chain model that considers the emissions from multi-activities

5. Conclusion 
This study develops a sustainable integrated inventory model for a two-tier supply chain by involving electric trucks. 
We consider a probabilistic demand, stochastic lead-time, carbon emission, service level, and setup cost reduction. 
Stochastic lead-time includes the production time, transportation time, loading-unloading time, and in-transit time. 
The carbon emission can be reduced especially transportation emissions by considering electric trucks. The emissions 
will affect the lot size and lot production. From computation analysis, we obtain a total cost savings of 25%, a 
significant total emission reduction of about 30%, a lead-time reduction of 41%, and an increase in service level of 
0.36%. The proposed model can guide managers to determine the optimum lot size, safety factor, number of batches, 
customer service level, carbon emissions, and lead-time. Further study could be by investigating the green technology 
investment and considering the drone for the last mile system. The production and truck capacities constraint would 
be considered in further research. Furthermore, the other possibility is considering rework in the manufacturing 
production process.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 virus pandemic that attacked Indonesia had a very bad impact on the economy in Indonesia, especially 
in the fields of trade, tourism and investment. However, the economic situation in Indonesia has had a good impact 
on raising the intention to invest in Indonesia's Generation Z, which is defined as those born between 1995 and 2010. 
The internal elements that influence Generation Z's investing intention will be explained using the Theory of Planned 
Behavior (TPB) approach in this study. Three crucial components that are accurate in predicting intention to behave 
are attitudes toward conduct, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. To improve the prediction potential 
of TPB theory, constructs to gauge investment intentions, such as the influence of celebrity endorsers, must be added. 
As a result, the research employs quantitative approaches. Sampling was done using a purposive sample technique. In 
totals, there were 150 respondents who participated. Data was collected using an online questionnaire, Google Form. 
The analysis used is SPSS 26 software as a tool to analyze the data. Also, the result of data processing showed that, 
celebrity endorser variable affects investment intentions. Celebrity endorsers have an influence on attitude toward 
behavior. Subjective norms affect investment intentions. Thus, it can be concluded that celebrity endorsers and 
subjective norms affect Generation Z's intention to invest during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Keywords: Investment Intention, Celebrity Endorser, TPB 
1. Introduction
The Covid-19 virus pandemic that attacked Indonesia had a very bad impact on the economy in Indonesia, especially 
in the fields of trade, tourism and investment. According to Purwanto, Mochammad, Akhyar, Rahardhian, Heri and 
Edna (2020), the covid pandemic has resulted in many people losing their jobs, declining sales, and even some 
companies reducing production and even stopping their production. The pandemic situation in Indonesia, on the other 
hand, has had a favorable impact on the intention to invest in Group Z in Indonesia, which is the generation born 
between 1995 and 2010 (Wijoyo, Irjus, Yoyok, Agus and Ruby, 2020). According to the Director of Bursa Efek 
Indonesia (BEI), Hasan Fawzi in June 2021, Generation Z currently dominates the growth rate of investors in 
Indonesia, and has risen to 50, 7% from January 2021 (Okezone, 2021). Quoted from the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
(2022), there was an increase in the growth of the IHSG (Indeks Harga Saham Gabungan), at the end of December 
2020 the IHSG corrected to 5,970.07, but now in Q2 2021 the IHSG has risen to 7,215.97. 
Previous research related to investment intentions has focused on external factors such as returns and risks (Patrianissa, 
2018) family encouragement, facilities and infrastructure, environment and status (Susanti, et. al., 2018) and equity 
investment (Sashikala and Chitramani, 2019). In contrast to earlier research, this study focuses on the internal elements 
that can influence a person's desire to participate in the capital market. Often investors are faced with decisions based 
on psychological conditions, so that the decisions taken are biased or irrational (Combrink and Lew, 2019). In

5.5.5 The Effect of Perceived Behavioral Control to Investment Intention 
Based on the results of the research that has been done, all questions on the perceived behavioral control variable 
questionnaire are declared valid. However, from the results of the final data processing, based on a significance value 
of 0.134 this variable does not affect the intention of Generation Z to invest in shares in the capital market. So based 
on these results, H5 can be declared rejected. 
 
The results of this study are different from the results of previous studies conducted by Satsios & Hadjidakis (2018) 
which showed that perceived behavioral control had a positive effect on saving intentions. The results of this study 
also have different results conducted by Ali et al., (2014) showing that perceived behavioral control has a significant 
and positive influence on investors' intentions to invest in sharia unit trusts. 
 
6. Conclusion 
6.1 Conclusion  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The celebrity endorsement variable has an impact on investment intentions, according to the findings of the debate. 
Celebrity endorsers have an impact on behavior attitudes. Investment intentions are unaffected by one's attitude toward 
behavior. Investment intentions are influenced by subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control has little effect 
on investment intentions. As a result, celebrity endorsers and subjective norms have an impact on Generation Z's 
willingness to invest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internal and external factors can influence Generation Z's 
investment aspirations, according to this study. Celebrity endorsers can be an attractive promotional tool for today's 
generation Z, because celebrity can influence the attitude of generation Z so that the intention arises to invest in the 
capital market. The figure of a celebrity endorser also has an important role, the more known the figure, the more it 
can influence the investment intention of Generation Z. Subjective norms also show that the investment intention of 
Generation Z grows based on a sense of trust or confidence from their environment. This shows that an environment 
that supports investment in the capital market will have a greater intention to invest in the capital market compared to 
people who are in an environment that is less amenable to investing in the capital market. Subjective norms also show 
that Generation Z's investment intentions grow based on a sense of trust or confidence from their environment. This 
shows that an environment that supports investment in the capital market will have a greater intention to invest in the 
capital market compared to people who are in an environment that is less amenable to investing in the capital market.

Abstract 
Indonesia has seen an increase in social media usage over the past years. It increases even more during the COVID-
19 pandemic, which includes white-collared workers seeking to learn practical skills to be implemented in the 
workplace. This study aims to examine the relationship between social motives and digital ambidexterity, in which 
social motives become the precedent of digital ambidexterity. This research uses the quantitative method of study in 
which we gather questionnaire answers from 238 white-collared workers in Indonesia. This questionnaire is employed 
with a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very unimportant) to 5 (very important) for questions regarding social 
motives and social media learning. Our research predicted a significant relationship between social motives and digital 
ambidexterity. It is not the only variable that influences digital ambidexterity the most. The research provides a 
framework for the use of managers to promote social media learning by identifying employees' social motives. We 
argue that this would promote efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace. There have been studies that link social 
motives to social media learning. However, most studies focused on individual motivations outside of the workplace, 
which intrigued the authors to examine the relationship between social motives and social media learning as a path 
towards digital ambidexterity.

1. Introduction
Indonesia has seen increased social media usage for the past years, which increased even more during the COVID-19 
pandemic. As a result, there have been 191.4 million active social media users in Indonesia, with a penetration of 
68.9% (Nurhayati-Wolff 2021). It indicates that more than half of the nation uses social media (Nurhayati-Wolff 
2021). Despite being primarily linked to communicating and connecting with family and friends (Nurhayati-Wolff 
2021), the continuous jump in active users and penetration have become the gateway to a myriad of possibilities in 
social media usage in Indonesia. It also relates to learning the content other people post on social media. 
Not only are social media used by students from elementary schools to college-level undergraduates, but social media 
is also used by employees. More than 50 million content creators have been aggregating in social media from all over 
the world, amassing over $20 billion of value projected to grow to a $104.2 billion market by 2022 (Jansen 2021). 
Among them, myriad internet micro-entrepreneurs focus on value-driven content, or content specifically made for 
educational purposes, no matter how entertaining they are packaged. The topics vary, from theories on specific issues

Our findings also echoed the results of the study conducted by Odei (2017), which showed that academic learning is 
driven by social motives. Odei (2017) also stated that when academical pursuits supported by social motives, firms 
would demand innovation. They remain competitive from the knowledge aggregated by the people they work with. It 
implies that managers who can determine the social motives of their employees will be able to decide what their 
employees deem. It is necessary enough to get themselves motivated to learn through social media. Another thing to 
be considered is how social media learning experience has been focused primarily on informal learning without a 
structured format (Bedford 2019). It indicates a need for a structured format of social media learning experiences for 
the sake of digital ambidexterity driven by employees' social motives. 
 
Social motives become the driver of digital ambidexterity among white-collared workers. Therefore, it is essential to 
revisit the three main motives or needs explained by McClelland & Pilon (1983). Those are the need for achievement, 
affiliation, and power. Awareness of workers' social motives will allow managers to motivate digital ambidexterity 
by creating a structured social media learning curriculum that rewards employees based on their social motives. 
Reward-based systems can be used for those primarily driven by the need for achievement. It is a sign that they have 
accomplished the courses with high scores that can be showcased to others. For those primarily driven by the need for 
affiliation, managers may emphasize finding a community that learns of the same thing. It may encourage employees 
to share knowledge to further promote exploration and exploitation measures. Lastly, for those primarily driven by 
the need for power, managers may emphasize how the social media learning experience brings the opportunity to lead 
a discussion or a team. It will make them the one in charge of the information exchanged by other workers. 
Additionally, they can be motivated through the possibility of job promotions based on their performance during the 
social media learning process. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study examines the role of social motives in influencing digital ambidexterity in white-collared workers in 
Indonesia. The respondents were dominated by workers aged 21 to 30, making them a part of two generational cohorts 
with the most social media users in Indonesia. The continuous jump in social media usage in Indonesia opens the 
possibility of learning through social media, resulting in digital ambidexterity. Studies show the link between 
ambidexterity to innovation and performance. However, it seldom found what actually pushes digital ambidexterity. 
Thus, we gathered data from 238 samples of white-collared workers in Indonesia across all productive ages. The 
research findings prove a significantly positive relationship between social motives and digital ambidexterity. It means 
indicating that when workers are motivated through their primary social motives, they would be able to participate in 
a program that fosters their digital ambidexterity. However, akin to many other studies before this, this study contains 
its own limitations. First, there was only a total of 238 samples taken from all over Indonesia due to the time constraints 
that limited the act of finding participants. This may incite concerns about whether these findings can represent the 
entire population. Second, this study's results indicated that more than only social motives influence digital 
ambidexterity in white-collared workers. Therefore, it is highly suggested that future studies observe the factors 
determining digital ambidexterity in white-collared workers. Third, we also employed simple regression analysis to 
achieve results. We encourage future studies to examine the relationship between each social motive and digital 
ambidexterity.

Abstract 
Product quality is critical to manufacturing sectors because defective parts and production scraps affect business 
profitability and sustainability. In alignment with the Lean Six Sigma manufacturing approach, reducing process 
variability using statistical process control (SPC) is the primary strategy for controlling product quality. Motivated 
by the increased prevalence of mobile devices and their influences on the smart manufacturing environment in 
the industry 4.0 era, this study presents the development of the ProcMon app, a mobile-cloud application designed 
for factory SPC monitoring. The system consists of mobile devices, internet connectivity, and cloud services. The 
ProcMon app adopts a three-layer client-server architecture comprising the presentation, business, and data layers. 
The factory SPC monitoring is realized via automated control chart plotting, process capability Indices, and 
Nelson rules. A short message service alert is sent if out-of-control processes are detected. The ProcMon app is 
developed using two open-source software platforms: MIT App Inventor 2 and Google Workspace. This research 
demonstrated that MIT App Inventor 2 and Google Workspace offer a low-cost and less complex development 
approach for mobile cloud applications in manufacturing, benefiting nonprofessional programmers and 
stakeholders with a minimal budget. After completing app development, a system test was conducted using 
simulated data from a machining part fabrication case study for the app functional validation, and the acceptance 
test conducted by a focus group concluded that the ProcMon app meets the requirements for a low-cost, flexible, 
available 24/7, efficient, and easy-to-use application for SPC.

1. Introduction
Product quality is critical in the manufacturing sector, and thus, to increase business profitability and 
sustainability, quality tools and methodologies are necessary to reduce defective parts and production scraps 
(Sousa et al. 2017). Among the quality tools, statistical process control (SPC) is a popular industry standard 
methodology that aims to reduce process variability, which is the cause of most quality issues (Hrvačić 2018). In 
turn, such reduction improves process stability and capability (Montgomery 2013). One of the most widely used 
SPC tools for process quality control is the Shewhart control chart, which was introduced by Walter A. Shewhart 
in 1924 (Allkhafaji and Obeidy 2018). The Shewhart control chart monitors and controls a process to ensure that 
it will behave predictably to produce conforming products constantly, while tracking variations in the process that 
may affect the quality of products (Madanhire and Mbohwa 2016). By itself, however, the Shewhart control chart 
does not provide information regarding the associated judgment on process stability. Instead, various 
supplementary run rules have been proposed for analyzing data patterns within the control limits of control charts 
(Zaman and Hassan 2021). The Nelson’s run rules proposed by Lloyd S. Nelson are the most popular in this area 
(Montgomery 2013). According to Aslam et al. (2019), as the SPC approach is commonly applied to monitor and 
improve manufacturing process capabilities by reducing process variations, process capability indices (PCIs) are 
established to monitor the variability of a process. In general, the PCIs Cp and Cpk are commonly used to provide 
a quantitative ratio for comparing the specifications of a product to the process’s performance capability (Pyzdek 
and Keller 2010; Montgomery 2013). 
The convergence of mobile and cloud computing has led to a new era of mobile-cloud services in education, 
healthcare, business, and social networks (Kim 2018). As reported by Marko (2022): 1. more than 5 billion people 
worldwide own mobile devices as of 2019, 2. 71 billion people in the world own a smartphone in 2019, 3. 194 
billion mobile phone apps were downloaded in 2019, 4. two-thirds of the world is now connected via mobile 
devices, and 5. mobile device owners worldwide will increase to 7.33 billion by 2023. These observations show 
that the mobile device has become a necessity in our daily lives instead of a luxury item. Hence, this research is

From the focus group feedback, all the participants agreed that the app meets the requirements for a low-cost, 
flexible, available 24/7, efficient, and easy-to-use SPC monitoring app.  
6. Conclusions
This research demonstrated the successful development of the ProcMon app, a mobile-cloud app for online SPC 
monitoring, by combining the use of MIT App Inventor 2 and Google Workspace platforms. The ProcMon app 
features easy-to-use process monitoring capabilities, such as a control chart, PCI, and Nelson rules. Real-time 
SMS alerts is sent if a process is out of control. The developed system is a mobile-cloud multilayer architecture 
app that can operate across heterogeneous computing platforms. It uses Android mobile devices, Google cloud 
service, and Internet connectivity to provide factory personnel with an on-the-go process monitoring service. The 
acceptance test concluded that the app meets the requirements of low cost, flexible, available 24/7, efficient, and 
easy-to-use SPC app. In addition, this research also demonstrated two advantages of combining MIT App Inventor 
2 and the Google Workspace platform in developing mobile–cloud applications. First, this approach incurs 
minimum financial costs due to the free or minimal cost of the open-source and web-based development platforms, 
eliminating the need for hefty setup investments and maintenance costs of hardware setup and software licensing. 
Second, this approach lowers the technical barrier for developing a mobile–cloud app for nonprofessional 
programmers. App Inventor’s “what you see is what you get” editor and block-based programming language 
approach significantly reduce the complexity of coding work for app development. Google Workspace provides 
readily available cloud-based storage access and open-source productivity and collaboration tools that are user-
friendly and do not require complicated configuration and setup efforts during the application development. As a 
research contribution, this study effectively illustrates the construction of a mobile-cloud app for SPC monitoring 
by using these two open-source software platforms which will considerably help prototyping or proof-of-concept 
for mobile-cloud app or smart manufacturing projects in future works.

Abstract 
Customer satisfaction is an important aspect of service quality in any company, including distribution companies or 
suppliers, because it is a good assessment of many service attributes. The company conducts customer assessments 
related to service quality to determine customer satisfaction. A distribution/supplier company is a company that has 
business activities to store and distribute products to both B2B and B2C consumers. Servqual is an instrument to 
measure the dimensions of service quality proposed by Parasuraman. Servqual can show how far the difference 
between reality and customer expectations for the services received from the company by comparing customer 
perceptions of the service with the service received by the customer. Servqual has five dimensions, which are 
Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, and Empathy. Researchers conducted a literature study to analyze 
service attributes using Servqual that affect customer satisfaction on the service quality of distribution companies. The 
approach taken is a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of journal articles taken from each case of journal and paper 
using the keywords Service Quality, Distribution Company, and Customer Satisfaction with the year of publication, 
not more than 5 years.

1. Introduction
When acquiring items or using services, customers have certain expectations. A business must perform better in each 
of its work units if it wants to offer the greatest service. Because it takes the participation of all parties involved in the 
company to develop an excellent service. Quality and customer satisfaction are closely tied. Customers are given a 
distinct incentive by quality to establish long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with the business. In today's 
fiercely competitive climate, the importance of service quality as a determining factor for an organization's success is 
well known. It will be a concern if customer satisfaction drops as a result of subpar service (Kartika et al., 2020). The 
Servqual approach by Parasuraman, which comprises five dimensions and has been extensively researched by 
researchers in a various sectors, both industry and services, can be used to gauge quality of service. Service quality is 
the difference between what is delivered and what is anticipated, and loyal customers are expected to continue to be 
satisfied (Parasuraman et al., 1985)

Figure 1. Percentage of attributes often used 
 
Many reviews of service quality attributes that affect customer satisfaction in service companies have been carried 
out, but especially for distribution services, very few are found including case study research for distribution 
companies, and this is makes it difficult to do extensive shooting of the attributes on the servqual dimension used in a 
distribution company. 
 
The discussion of this study found the attachment of one attribute to another, where the attributes of employees having 
knowledge and skills (9.43%) related to services or products from the company will provide added value where these 
employees can satisfy customers with their knowledge and skills by providing efficient and effective services that can 
build customer trust in the company (Jawneh & Manneh, 2020) and these employees can provide accurate and clear 
information to customers (11.32%), with clear and accurate information related to services and products will help 
reduce customer disappointment (Pramudiyanti & Rahardjo, 2022) 
 
Attributes related to employees who have consideration, sensitivity, and care for customers (9.43%) can increase 
customer satisfaction, because employees can find out what the customer needs and wants including customer 
complaints therefore employees can handle customers complain immediately (18.87%). Fast handling of customer 
complaints provides customer satisfaction (Damayanti & Tuti, 2021; Kartika et al., 2020). Good communication and 
empathy with customers are very important in the relationship between a company and its customers (Jawneh & 
Manneh, 2020) therefore companies needs to improve the human resources, especially who serve directly to the 
customer. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Service quality is one of the important issues for any service company whether it is hotels, banking, shopping malls, 
hospitals, education and including distribution companies. There are several models of service quality, including 
Servqual which has five dimensions, are Tangible, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, Empathy. Where each of 
these five dimensions has service quality attributes to measure customer satisfaction. Each attribute will be adjusted 
to the company's business processes. Through this literature review, seventeen attributes are found that are often used 
by distribution companies to measure customer satisfaction. Attributes that affect customer satisfaction of distribution 
companies lead to fast and responsive customer complaints where customers are satisfied because their complaints 
are accommodated and processed, customers are also more satisfied if employees have sufficient knowledge and skills 
that they can help and inform related services provided, and because employees are representatives of the company, 
employees must be friendly, attentive and responsive to customer needs.

Abstract 
This paper investigates the reliability management of overhead track equipment in a South African railway company. 
The organization has been experiencing unsatisfactory operational efficiency due to infrastructure failures such as 
pantograph hook-ups, derailments, and washaways, which affect performance. The unsatisfactory operational 
efficiency affects the organization's revenue generation, economy, and customer confidence. Studies suggest that the 
overhead track equipment is the least reliable subsystem of the electric traction system, and its failures contribute 
significantly to train operations' poor performance. In the South African railway environment, studies have been 
conducted to evaluate the reliability of the overall railway infrastructure, traction substation and perway; however, 
there has been little research on the reliability of the overhead track equipment. This study addresses the shortcoming 
by assessing the reliability management of the overhead track equipment in South Africa. The convergent mixed-
methods design was selected for the study, and a sample of the maintenance depots was selected to collect failure data, 
inspection and audit reports, and primary data were collected using a questionnaire. The analysis of the data sources 
showed that the maintenance strategies employed by some maintenance depots are ineffective, maintenance 
management tools such as RCM and FMECA can be adopted to improve the reliability of the equipment, and factors 
that affect the reliability of the overhead track equipment are operational, maintenance budget, and human factors. 
Keywords 
Maintenance strategies, failures, reliability, overhead track equipment, theft and vandalism. 
1. Introduction
The Company has been experiencing poor operational efficiency and failing to achieve the set performance targets. 
The annual reports indicate that poor operational efficiency is caused by factors that include chronic infrastructure 
failures. These are derailments, pantograph hook-ups (retirement) and wash-aways. In 2012 the Company 
implemented a strategy to improve its performance; it included infrastructure upgrades, skills development, and 
procuring of rolling stock. Figure 1 shows the Company's performance between 2013/14 and 2018/19, and it shows 
that the performance has been unsatisfactory due to poor operational efficiency, and it has not been able to reach the 
set targets. The Company operates railway lines in electrified and non-electrified sections, and the operations in 
electrified sections affect the operational efficiency through overhead track equipment (OHTE)/overhead contact line 
failures, pantograph hook-ups and traction substation failures. The OHTE is regarded as the least reliable subsystem 
of the electric traction system (Zhang & Zhang, 2010; Cardasim, et al., 2018). OHTE failures affect the railway service 
significantly due to the lack of redundancy (Beagles, et al., 2016; Zhuwaki, 2017); this results in train delays and 
cancellations and reduced operational efficiency. Train cancellations refer to planned train slots cancelled due to the 
train's failure to depart or reach its destination, and train delays refer to delayed trains that reached their destination. 
The OHTE's operational performance is affected by its dynamic behaviour. Poor dynamic behaviour and equipment 
fatigue will result in failures (Beagles, et al., 2016). Failures on the OHTE can have different impacts to train 
operations, minor failures may be inconspicuous to train drivers, and significant failures can result in the closure of 
railway lines (Beagles, et al., 2016; Zhuwaki, 2017). South African studies have been conducted on improving the 
reliability of traction substations and the general railway infrastructure (Sprong, 2008; Zhuwaki, 2017; Shihlomule, 
2019), but similar efforts have not been conducted to investigate the reliability of OHTE. The Company spends a

maintenance budget and slots should be allocated by conducting a cost-benefit analysis over a short- and long-term 
period.  
5.4 Validation 
The research was validated using triangulation of data findings. 
Objective A: to determine the effectiveness of employed maintenance management strategies. The CMMS data 
showed that the failure rate increased for seven of the nine depots and that five of the seven depots were DC depots. 
There are depots which recorded a decrease in failure rate inter-period (E-depot (2019-2020), F- and G-depots (2018-
2020)). The inspection reports showed that poor and ineffective maintenance practices caused the unreliability of 
OHTE. According to the analysis of the audit reports, six depots did not conduct complete condition assessments, and 
seven of the ten questionnaire respondents stated that the failure rate in their depots was increasing. The Pareto chart 
shows that 33% of all failures resulted from maintenance-related causes such as sub-standard maintenance, equipment 
worn beyond the standard and small component failure. Maintenance-related failures are second to the highest cause 
of unreliability, theft, and vandalism of infrastructure, contributing to 35% of failures. Other factors can affect the 
maintenance effectiveness, such as traffic volumes, opportunity to conduct maintenance, and quantity of assets to be 
maintained.   
Objective B: to identify reliability management tools that can be adopted to improve reliability. The CMMS data 
showed significant failures due to poor and substandard maintenance practices; the audit reports showed that the 
depots mainly conducted reactive maintenance and poorly implemented condition assessments. All depots used the 
five whys analysis technique, and it was predominantly used. The findings suggest that the Company should adopt the 
RCM because of the increase in failure rates across most of the sample depots, the inability of some depots to comply 
with the prescribed maintenance, and the reduction in maintenance budget and slots. The railway operator should also 
adopt comprehensive failure analysis techniques such as the FMECA.  
Objective C; to investigate factors affecting the reliability of overhead track equipment. The CMMS showed that the 
causes of the failures were theft, vandalism, and poor maintenance practices. The inspection showed that the faults 
were caused by theft and poor maintenance practices; the audit reports showed that the unreliability of OHTE was due 
to incomplete condition assessments, inadequate team strength, and poor adherence to maintenance practices. The 
respondents to the questionnaire indicated that the unreliability was due to time pressures, stress, fatigue, inadequate 
team strength, theft and vandalism, reduction of maintenance budget, and reduced time for maintenance. The findings 
suggest that the factors affecting the reliability of OHTE are theft and vandalism, human factors, poor maintenance 
strategies, reduced maintenance budget and maintenance opportunities. 
6. Conclusion
The evaluated failure data from the sample depots suggests that overall, the OHTE maintenance strategies employed 
were poor due to the trend of failures increasing during the period under study. However, there are depots that 
decreased the failure rate over the study period, and these were less than half of the sample. There are also depots that 
decreased the failure rate inter-period, suggesting improving maintenance strategies at those depots. All DC depots 
contributed significantly to the unreliability of the Company. AC depots appear to have better maintenance strategies 
than DC depots. The maintenance depots conduct failure analysis on incidents that impacted the train service, and 
they can improve by conducting failure analysis for all failures to identify failure modes and maintenance interventions 
that can minimize the risk of failures. The failures that are not analyzed are likely to lead to failures that impact the 
train operations. The organization should employ comprehensive failure analysis techniques such as FMECA to 
identify the correct root causes, failure modes and impact of failures. It is proposed that the organization implement 
the RCM due to the declining maintenance budget and the risk failures pose to the train operations. Maintenance 
depots with similar failure distributions should be evaluated to implement common maintenance interventions. 
Various factors affect the reliability of OHTE, including theft and vandalism, reduced maintenance budget, human 
factors, and operational factors. Theft and vandalism are the key drivers of failures and operational and human factors. 
The excessive theft and vandalism incident results in the maintenance teams being unable to conduct the planned 
maintenance, and the teams are fatigued and work under pressure to repair the affected equipment; this results in 
unintentional faults being generated during the repairs. The Company should strive to curb the prevalence of theft and 
vandalism incidents; this is the first step to improving its operational efficiency. The analysis showed that depots with 
1509","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

AC electrification had fewer failures than those with DC electrification; the DC depots should be the first to be targeted 
for the proposed reliability improvement interventions.

Abstract 
Data is one of the supporting elements for decision-making in all scientific fields, including in legal dogmatics. As a 
practical science, legal dogmatics is responsible for responding to legal problems in societies, particularly through 
court decisions. In the Indonesian legal tradition, which is heavily influenced by the civil law system, judges in charge 
of deciding cases do not always use references in the form of precedents drawn from similar case decisions. Situations 
like this often attract criticism as they are likely to cause inconsistencies in court decision-making and will ultimately 
reduce public confidence in the courts. This paper offers a way to overcome this tendency and aims to model judgment 
decisions from cases that are related to cases through data mining with the decision tree method. The methods used 
are Decision Tree ID3, with data derived from decisions on corruption cases decided by the Corruption Court in 
Indonesia over the past ten years. This data-training model has shown variables that can be used as data-training that 
really needs consistency in decision making in corruption cases in Indonesia. Considering that the judges' decisions 
are the result of factual as well as normative reasoning, there are many elements that must be anticipated. The judge's 
inconsistency in interpreting the facts results in the judge's interpretation of the elements of the crime. This disparity 
is the source of the weakness of the model that is currently presented in this study. One way to overcome this is to 
increase the data variance. If the researcher only uses duplicate data from the previous training data, the end result 
will not be very different.

The weakness that is very likely to occur is when the researcher conducts an analysis of Table 2 that is too specific to 
the perpetrator of the crime. For example, the gender of the defendant. Some of the propositions below demonstrate 
these weaknesses. Among other things, the propositions read as follows: (1) if an action is an abuse of authority, and 
the perpetrator is a woman, then she is guilty of committing a crime of corruption together; or (2) if an action is an 
abuse of authority, and a perpetrator is a man, then he is guilty of committing a crime of corruption together. 
Propositions like this clearly have no meaning because regardless of the gender of the perpetrator, the verdict is the 
same. 
 
From the design of the data-training model and the results of the rapid miner, it should be seen that the decision tree 
reflects the design thinking of the judges in their decisions. When the researchers investigated the fines in these 
decisions, it turned out that the fines were not related to the amount of state losses. The same is true for employment 
status. In fact, even though there are state losses that are quite large, not all decisions provide penalties for the convict 
to compensate for the loss by requiring him to pay compensation. 
 
This data-training model, therefore, provides a lesson about the difficulties that must be faced by legal text-mining 
researchers who study judges' decisions. Because each case presents different facts, it is necessary to map the variables 
and attributes of the facts that must appear in the table first. All variables and attributes must have the potential to 
correspond to elements of the normative provisions that form the basis of the indictment law. If this is not done, then 
the weaknesses due to illogicality in the meaning of the proposition will appear. This is reasonable because the 
propositions as data training will follow the reading rules of the resulting model. If the researcher wants something 
different, one way is to add variations to the training data. The more data and variations of the data will produce a 
variety of decision variations. On the other hand, if the researcher only uses duplicated data from the previous training 
data, the result will not very much. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This research shows that the judge's decision is a very complex document, but it is still open for analysis using the 
data-training model. The difficulties in transforming all the data to be analysed by rapid miners are due to the variations 
in each of these facts, both concerning the subject of the perpetrator and the actions that correspond to the object of 
the norm. Such diverse norm conditions also give rise to multiple interpretations, thus affecting the punishment. The 
aggravating and mitigating factors are also not all explicitly stated in the decisions. All these variations raise 
weaknesses that every compiler of the data-training model must anticipate. The authors note that this study requires 
more training data with many variations. With the limited variations, there seems to be leaps in the judge's way of 
thinking compared to the propositions displayed by the machine.

Abstract 
The goal of this research was to identify the characteristics that have a substantial impact on employee performance. 
The literature on which the study hypothesis is based is literature on managerial support, work motivation, job 
satisfaction, and employee performance. This study's research approach is quantitative, and the sample is drawn using 
the convenience sampling methodology. In this research, survey approaches were used to obtain data. A partial least 
squares technique was used to examine the data. According to the data analysis findings, employee job satisfaction 
positively and substantially influences work motivation. When job happiness is mediated by work motivation, it has 
a favorable and considerable influence on employee performance. Job satisfaction has a strong and favorable influence 
on job motivation. If management support is mediated by work motivation and job satisfaction, it will have a favorable 
and considerable influence on employee performance. Management assistance has a strong beneficial influence on 
work satisfaction. If job happiness is mediated, management assistance will have a favorable and considerable 
influence on work motivation. Work motivation has a big and favorable influence on employee performance. The firm 
may make many recommendations considering the study's findings. Companies must concentrate on enhancing job 
satisfaction, which will improve employee work motivation, with management support.

1. Introduction
Countries throughout the globe have faced challenging challenges since the COVID-19 epidemic began in early 2020. 
The COVID-19 pandemic, according to Choudhury et al. (2020) and Margherita et al. (2021), is one of the most 
destructive catastrophes in contemporary times, as seen by the massive ramifications for economies, organizations, 
and employees worldwide. To combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus, several governments have implemented 
closure rules and contact limitations. According to Lane et al. (2020), this circumstance modifies the system in the 
company, which results in changes in the organizational cultural dynamics. One of the initiatives implemented by the 
company in response to interaction constraints is to alter the work system to Work from Home (WFH). Organizations 
adopt the WFH idea as a tactic to keep staff working and productive throughout the epidemic. The WFH work idea is 
completely implemented in the organization's many forms of work. According to Oswar (2020), the WFH policy is 
not a new idea; it is one of the telecommuting notions established in the 1970s. Initially, the WFH idea was a flexible 
work arrangement as part of the organization's attempts to assist the attainment of Work-Life Balance (WLB) for 
workers (Dockery and Bawa, 2014). However, many firms have now widely accepted the notion of WFH and 
telecommuting (Alon et al., 2020, p.17). According to Dayaram and Burgess (2021), the WFH policy has been 
implemented comprehensively in all sorts of labor, including professions previously inconceivable for the policy. This 
tendency will result in changes leading to workplace flexibility long after the COVID-19 epidemic is over. According 
to Lyons and Kuron (2014), the WFH notion has become a source of optimism for the younger generation since it 
allows them to work from home. However, WFH is a complex procedure that burdens management or businesses 
(Hartel & Fujimoto, 2014). 
With this shift in work philosophy, businesses must recognize the essential success elements and problems they 
encounter to adopt WFH successfully. Employee performance, often known as employee performance, is critical for

Abstract 
Local Revenue is income obtained through sources of funds from local tax, regional retribution, the results of the 
management of the separated regional wealth, and other legitimate local revenues. Restaurant tax, advertising tax, 
hotel tax, and parking tax are included in local taxes, which are one of the sources of local revenue in Metro City. This 
study aims to determine the contribution of restaurant tax, advertising tax, hotel tax, and parking tax to local revenue 
in Metro City for 2016-2020. This study uses quantitative methods with descriptive research types. The population 
used is a local revenue budget realization report of Metro City, with a sample of 60 samples consisting of January 
2016 to December 2020. The sampling technique used is non-probability sampling with saturated sampling. In this 
study, multiple linear regression analysis was used. This study uses Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS 26 Version 9 to 
process the data. The average contribution of restaurant tax revenue to local revenue during 2016-2020 is 95.39%, the 
contribution of advertising tax is 28.39%, the contribution of hotel tax is 18.00%, and the contribution of parking tax 
is 18.18%. The study's results simultaneously show an influence between restaurant tax, advertising tax, hotel tax, and 
parking tax on local revenue of 17.7%. The remaining 82.3% is influenced by other variables not explained in this 
study. Partially, the parking tax has a significant effect on local tax. However, the restaurant tax, advertising tax, and 
hotel tax have no significant effect on local revenue.

1. Introduction
One of the cities in Lampung is Metro City. Metro City has an area of 68,74 km2 or 6.874 ha, with a population of 
150,950 inhabitants. The administrative area of Metro City Regional Regulation Number 25 of 2000 concerning the 
Expansion of Urban Villages and Subdistricts in Metro City, covers 5 sub-districts and 22 urban villages. Metro City 
itself is planning an improvement and development into a more advanced city, towards its vision and mission as a city 
of education and family tourism in the province of Lampung. The government is making various efforts to improve 
the security, cleanliness, education sector, as well as increasing the optimization of green open spaces, public facilities, 
and beautifying every corner of the city by creating small parks. 
Based on Law Number 33 of 2004 concerning Financial Balance between the Central Government and Regional 
Governments, Article 1 point 18 that Local Revenue is the income obtained by the region based on Regional 
Regulations by statutory regulations. Based on Law Number 28 of 2009 concerning Local Revenue, regional financial 
sources extracted from the relevant regional area consist of regional tax proceeds, regional retribution proceeds,

2) The Effect of Restaurant Tax on Local Revenue 
Based on table 6, the partial test (t-test) shows that the significance value of the restaurant tax is 0.359 and the value 
is > 0.05, meaning Ho2 is accepted and Ha2 is rejected. This shows that restaurant tax partially does not have a 
significant effect on local revenue. Because the restaurant tax received by the government does not affect the local 
revenue of Metro City because only a few restaurants have the potential to increase local revenue. Meanwhile, other 
restaurants in Metro City can potentially increase local revenue, but the potential is not too high. Income from 
restaurants can become local revenue, but in its realization, it is still unable to optimize the achievement revenue of 
local revenue. Therefore, the restaurant tax does not significantly affect local revenue. This study's results align with 
research conducted by Lasmini & Astuti (2019) and Samosir (2020), who said that the restaurant tax contributes less 
to local revenue. 
 
3) The Effect of Advertising Tax on Local Revenue 
Based on table 6, the partial test (t-test) shows that the significance value of the advertising tax is 0.114 and the value 
is > 0.05, meaning Ho3 is accepted and Ha3 is rejected. This shows that the advertising tax partially does not have a 
significant effect on local revenue. Because the advertising tax received by the government does not affect the local 
revenue of Metro City because only a few billboards/advertisements can potentially increase local revenue. 
Meanwhile, other billboards/advertisements in Metro City can potentially increase local revenue, but the potential is 
not too high. Income from billboards/advertisements can become local revenue, but in its realization, it is still unable 
to optimize local revenue achievement revenue. Therefore, the advertising tax does not significantly affect local 
revenue. This study's results align with research conducted by Jariyah & Mildawati (2020) and Primandari & Dahlia 
(2020), who said that the advertising tax contributed less to local revenue. 
 
4) The Effect of Hotel Tax on Local Revenue 
Based on table 6, the partial test (t-test) shows that the significance value of the hotel tax is 0.663 and the value is > 
0.05, meaning Ho4 is accepted and Ha4 is rejected. This shows that hotel tax partially does not have a significant 
effect on local revenue. Because the hotel tax received by the government does not affect the local revenue of Metro 
City because only a few hotels have the potential to increase local revenue. Meanwhile, other hotels in Metro City can 
potentially increase local revenue, but the potential is not too high. Income from hotels can become local revenue, but 
in its realization, it is still unable to optimize the achievement revenue of local revenue. Therefore, hotel tax does not 
have a significant effect on local revenue. This study's results align with research conducted by Jariyah & Mildawati 
(2020) and Lasmini & Astuti (2019), who said that hotel tax contributions do not affect Local revenue. Revenue from 
parking lots can be local revenue.  
 
5) The Effect of Parking Tax on Local Revenue 
Based on table 6, the partial test (t-test) shows that the significance value of the parking tax is 0.003 and the value is 
< 0.05, meaning Ho5 is rejected and Ha5 is accepted. This shows that the parking tax partially significantly affects 
local revenue. Revenue from parking lots can be local revenue receipts, proven after being tested. The results showed 
that the parking tax significantly affects local revenue. This study's results align with Yusuf & Maidar (2018) research 
and are in line with Pratama et al. (2019), which state that the parking tax contribution significantly affects local 
revenue. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study aims to determine the effect of the contribution of restaurant tax, advertising tax, hotel tax, and parking tax 
on the local revenue of Metro City in 2016-2020. The object of this research is Metro City, using a research sample 
of 60 data. This study uses Microsoft Excel 2016 and SPSS 26 Version 9 to process the data. Based on the results of 
research conducted by the authors, the following conclusions are obtained: 
 
1) Based on the results of simultaneous testing, the independent variables, namely restaurant tax, advertising tax, 
hotel tax, and parking tax, significantly influence the local revenue of Metro City in 2016-2020. Based on the 
coefficient of determination obtained by 0.177 or 17.7%, it means that the independent variables, namely restaurant 
tax, advertising tax, hotel tax, and parking tax, can explain local revenue by 17.7% and the remaining 82.3% is 
explained by other variables not explained in this study. 
2) Based on the partial test results, restaurant tax, advertising tax, hotel tax, and parking tax have the following effects: 
a. 
Restaurant tax did not significantly affect the local revenue of Metro City in 2016-2020. 
b. Advertising tax did not significantly affect the local revenue of Metro City in 2016-2020. 
c. 
Hotel tax did not significantly affect the local revenue of Metro City in 2016-2020.

Abstract 
Hedging is a procedure that can be carried out to protect the company from losses on fluctuations in the rupiah 
exchange rate against foreign currencies. State-owned companies that conduct transactions with foreign currencies 
are urged by the Government to hedge to avoid additional debt due to fluctuating exchange rates. This study aims to 
ascertain the effect of growth opportunity, firm size, and dividend policy simultaneously and partially on the 
hedging decisions of BUMN companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2011-2020 period. The 
secondary data used in this study came from the financial statements and annual reports of BUMN companies 
registered on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for 2011-2020. The population in this study is BUMN companies listed 
on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2011-2020. Purposive sampling was used in this study's sample 
selection, resulting in the collection of 113 samples from 12 companies between 2011 and 2020. The data analysis 
techniques used in this study are descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression analysis. Based on the study's 
results, it was concluded that growth opportunities, firm size, and dividend policies simultaneously affect hedging. 
Accordingly, growth opportunity and firm size significantly positively affect hedging decisions in BUMN 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2011-2020. Meanwhile, the dividend policy negatively 
affects hedging decisions in BUMN companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2011-2020.

1. Introduction
Changes in the rupiah exchange rate can affect the company's financial condition and operating processes. The use 
of derivative instruments can protect multinational companies from the risk of increasing exchange rate fluctuations. 
Companies affected by foreign exchange rate uncertainty can cope with hedging (Wang & Makar, 2019). Most 
companies obtain capital from rupiah and US dollars or other foreign currencies. To minimize the risk of asset losses 
and liabilities arising from fluctuations in the rupiah exchange rate, companies can implement a hedging policy. 
Using hedging can improve the capital market, trade between countries, and control of company assets (Giraldo-
Prieto et al., 2019). Based on the regulation of the Minister of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia Number 12 / 
PMK.08 / 2013, hedging is a way to mitigate business risks that arise against interest rates or uncertain currencies in 
the financial markets. Based on data from the bi.go.id the movement of the rupiah exchange rate against the US 
dollar from 2016 to 2018, the rupiah exchange rate began to decline to Rp 14,481. In 2019 it began to strengthen to

BVE ratio indicator had a partially significant positive influence on hedging decisions. The higher the company's 
growth opportunities, the higher the company's level of hedging decisions. 
 
A company that is experiencing good growth is a positive signal for internal and external parties of the company. 
This is in line with the signaling theory, which states that if the company has good quality, it will provide a positive 
signal so that related parties can distinguish the level of quality between good companies and bad companies. The 
results of this study support previous research conducted by Kodriyah et al., (2019), Astyrianti (2017), and 
Marhaenis & Artini (2020). 
 
5.2.3 Effect of Firm size on Hedging 
Based on the study's results, the value of the regression coefficient on the firm size variable was 0.00 with a 
probability (sig.) of 0.05 and a value of regression coefficient of 0.943. The results of this study concluded that the 
firm size variable with natural logarithm indicators has a significant positive influence on hedging policies.  
 
The size of the company gives a positive signal to external parties of the company so that the company will easily 
get funding. With funding, it makes it easier for companies to carry out hedging activities. The results of this study 
are supported by research conducted by Bonita (2017), Setiawan & Mahardika (2019), Mahasari & Rahyudi (2020), 
Rachmat & Kustina (2019), and  Ameer (2020). 
 
5.2.4 Effect of Dividend Policy on Hedging 
Based on the test results, the dividend policy variable regression coefficient has a value of -0.76 with a probability 
value (sig.) of 0.000. The results of this study state that dividend policy with dividend payout ratio indicator has a 
negative influence on hedging policy because it has a significance value greater than 0.05. The higher the dividend 
ratio, the better the company's financial level. The distribution of dividends in cash will result in the company 
obtaining a small amount of retained earnings. (Table 6) This causes the funds that can be used to carry out hedging 
activities will be reduced so that companies tend not to carry out hedging activities. The results of this study support 
previous research conducted by  Astyrianti (2017).

This research proves that the decision to hedge an enterprise is influenced by the growth rate and size of an 
enterprise. The higher the growth rate and size of the company will increase the company's awareness to make 
hedging decisions so that it can avoid the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Suggestions for subsequent researchers:  
1. The object of research in this study is a BUMN listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, researchers can 
then use other research objects such as manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.  
2. The variables used in this study are growth opportunity, firm size and dividend policy, the value of 
Nagelkerke's R square of 0.477. The results showed that the variable ability of growth opportunity, firm 
size, and dividend policy was able to explain by 47.7 and the rest was explained by other factors that were 
not tested in this study. Researchers can then use other variables such as profitability, leverage, managerial 
ownership, and others.

Abstract 
The existence of technology and information that is increasingly sophisticated results in the advancement of economic 
growth, in this case the banking subsector is a subsector that has an important role in maintaining the stability of a 
country's economy, for that reason the importance of improving financial work in banking. This study has two 
variables that affect financial performance, namely intellectual capital and company size, this study aims to determine 
the influence of intellectual capital and company size the financial performance of banking subsector companies listed 
on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The object of this study is a banking subsector company listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange. In period this study is 2017-2020.  This study, financial performance was proxied with Return On 
Assets (ROA), while intellectual capital was proxied with the formula Variable Added Intellectual Coefficient and the 
size of the company was proxied with formula Ln Total Assets. The total population in this study was 33 companies. 
Have 132 samples, The analysis method used in this study is the panel data regression analysis method. The results of 
this study show that simultaneously, intellectual capital and company size affect financial performance, partially 
intellectual capital affects on financial performance and company size have no effect on financial performance. As a 
result of this study, researchers hope that this researcher will become a reference in the company. In addition, 
researchers hope that this study can be described again in a broader direction.

1. Introduction
Financial statements are a structured presentation of the financial position and performance of an entity. In a company, 
determining the good and bad of a company can be measured through financial performance. Financial performance 
is a representation of the company how to carry out its duties according to the application of good finances, it can be 
interpreted as an image as the achievement of the company. Assessing the performance of the company can be seen 
from how much the company has produced effective and efficient financial performance in financial statements that 
can be published in each company, this is because financial performance can see the effectiveness of the company in 
operations in obtaining profits based on managing company resources (Akmil et al., 2019). In terms of the company's 
financial performance, it must be able to create profit, the indicator used by the company to assess the company's 
financial performance, namely by using the calculation of the profitability ratio, the profitability ratio used by this 
study is return on assets (ROA). The greater the Return On Assets, the greater the profit obtained by the company. In 
2020 government banking companies published financial performance, not only government banks, national private

Results of the random effect model (REM) test, it can be known that the panel data regression equation in this study 
is as follows: 
Y = -1.283625 + 0.051351X1 + 0.039916X2 + e 
 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
 
5.1 The Effect of Intellectual Capital and Company Size on Financial Performance 
Based on the probability value (f-statistic) of 0.000035 < 0.05 then H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted, it can be 
interpreted that the independent variables of this study intellectual capital and company size affect the dependent 
variables of financial performance in banking subsector companies listed on the IDX in 2017-2020. 
 
5.2 The Effect of Intellectual Capital on Financial Performance 
Intellectual capital (X1) has a probability value of 0.0004 < 0.05 with a positive regression coefficient value of 
0.051351. This means that H0 is rejected, and Ha is accepted so that intellectual capital partially has a positive 
influence on financial performance. 
 
5.3 The Effect of Company Size on Financial Performance 
The size of the company (X2) has a probability value of 0.1506 > 0.05 with a positive regression coefficient value of 
0.039916. This means that H0 is rejected, and Ha is accepted so that the size of the company partially has no influence 
on financial performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research proves that intellectual capital and company size have a simultaneous effect on financial performance. 
However, partially intellectual capital has a positive effect on financial performance, in this case it shows that 
intellectual capital can play a role in improving financial performance, meaning that the higher the intellectual capital, 
the better the company's financial performance. This, the company is able to use and maximize existing resources 
such as the use of creativity and innovation of employees in the company so as to create added value for the company. 
Firm size has no negative effect on financial performance, in this case because the increase in a company is not always 
with total assets for which there are many other indicators that improve the financial performance of a company.

Abstract 
In all parts of the community, basic autonomous navigation is essential. The capability to navigate complicated 
environments allows people to achieve a wide range of physical and mental objectives. With minimal non-visual 
infrastructure, indoor navigation is a complicated cognitive and perceptual activity, unlike Global Positioning 
System (GPS) infrastructure for outdoor navigation. Blind or visually impaired people (BVIP) require 
sophisticated technologies with inbuilt functionalities for obstacle detection and recognition and the identification 
of desired destinations like rooms, stairs, and elevators to better orient themselves and navigate in unfamiliar 
indoor environments. Electronic travel aids (ETAs) have developed and offered exceptional navigation support 
for the BVIP. ETAs increase opportunities for autonomous navigation by providing information regarding the 
surroundings in the indoor or outdoor environment, the user’s present position, and navigational instructions about 
the route to a targeted destination. However, less focus has been found in the literature on integrating several 
functions in ETAs to have a more comprehensive system that supports indoor navigation activity of BVIP to 
facilitate the mobility of BVIP. This study provides a thorough review of previously developed ETAs using two 
main criteria: the used technologies and the fulfilled functions. Based on the review findings, this study suggests 
future research path of technological instrumentation for the BVIP’ ETA solutions in indoor navigation.

1 Introduction 
According to World Health Organization (WHO) factsheets issued in 2021, at least 2.2 billion individuals 
worldwide are visually impaired (Blindness and Vision Impairment, n.d.). One of the most important senses for 
engaging with the natural world is vision (Sreenivasulu et al., 2021). It is important in guiding people to their 
intended destination, finding the proper way in familiar/unfamiliar indoor environments, or navigating in both 
indoor and outdoor settings. However, blind or visually impaired people (BVIP) confront several difficulties 
concerning safe and effective navigation (Kuriakose et al., 2020). 
Over decades, these people  have utilized conventional navigational aids like a white cane and guide dogs, which 
are currently the most common navigational help (Fei et al., 2017). However, they are limited in delivering truly 
little navigation information. To overcome this constraint, there is a greater necessity for a supplement technique, 
system, or compact and portable technology. There has been a significant amount of work in creating visual 
assistive technologies (VATs) using electronic devices and the utilization of sensor functions during the past 
decade. VATs are classified as either visual enhancement, visual substitution, or visual replacement (Darabont et 
al., 2020).  
A digital picture is captured, processed, and shown on the screen by visual enhancement equipment. On the other 
hand, vision replacement devices provide a processed signal to the brain's visual cortex. Visual substitution 
devices receive data from a range of sensors and provide information to the individual through non-visual 
modalities such as auditory and haptic (K. Patel & Parmar, 2020). Visual substitution is further classified into 
three major categories:

Abstract 
The manufacturing sector has become one of the competitive industries. The demands of a competitive business 
environment require business firms to be able to respond well to uncertainties. The study aimed to identify the risks 
and the risk management strategies in the South African manufacturing environment. The study used survey 
questionnaire to collect quantitative and qualitative data required to answer the research questions. The collected data 
was analysed through grouping of themes, proportional analysis and descriptive statistics. The research results 
indicated that risks experienced in manufacturing firms are strategic risks, operational risks, financial risks and 
hazardous risks. The study found that the risk management strategies employed by the majority of the firms are 
precautionary risk management strategies and risk informed strategies, where with precautionary risk strategy, 
mitigation measures are taken even though the causes and the effects of the suspected risks are not fully proven and 
with risk informed strategies the organization’s risk appetite, risk culture and risk governance are taken into 
consideration when addressing risks. The research further found that manufacturing firms are more familiar with risk 
management tools like FMEA, risk matrix approach and brainstorming.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry contributes to the global economy, it serves as an engine for economic growth, social 
development and political advancement for many developing countries (Adeniran, Agbaje & Adeosun, 2019; Gabriel, 
2019; Zhao & Tang, 2018). The industry also brings forth prospects of capital accumulation (Gabriel, 2019). Other 
sectors such as service; construction; mining and agriculture also play a big role in the Gross Domestic Products 
(GDP) growth and customarily require infrastructure provided by the manufacturing industry. Within the 
manufacturing sector, industries that highly contribute to the growth of Gross Domestic Products include electrical 
machinery and equipment; metal products, food, beverages, tobacco and chemicals (Zhao and Tang, 2018). 
The manufacturing sector is a competitive industry, businesses across the globe chase profit and customers demand 
value at a lower cost. South African manufacturing industry is facing a challenge to compete with other manufacturing 
firms globally due to operational risks associated with a high cost of raw materials, labour, and electricity (Bhorat and 
Rooney, 2017). Some enterprises do not have resources to endure systems like globalisation, legislation, new 
technology, market expansion and open trade barriers which contribute to high competition in doing business(Ferreira 
de Araújo Lima, Crema and Verbano, 2020a). Local products cost fortunes as compared to imported goods, this results 
in a high influx of cheap goods from other countries, thus affecting sales and production volumes in manufacturing.  
The demands of the highly competitive business environment require efficient risk management.  It is important for 
manufacturing firms to know the industry risks and have the ability to respond to uncertainties and unforeseen 
circumstances. Good risk management is a good competitive advantage as it sets the company ahead of the rest of the 
market and it create opportunities for potential grow the business.

Delphi Techniques and Monte Carlo analysis. The organizations are more likely to experience the same problems over 
time because they don’t use any tool that is based on past experiences.  
 
6.1 Future Work 
• 
Future studies should incorporate other tools like interviews to address the gap of not being able to ask follow 
up questions on unclear responses, this will also minimize other questions being skipped.  
• 
Further investigation is required to find out why are people reluctant to answer open ended questions as 
opposed to close ended questions. 
• 
Further research is required to gain more insight on the effects of risks encountered by the manufacturing 
firms and evaluate the effectiveness of the risk management strategies. 
• 
The same research should be conducted with the executives and managing directors’ only being the unit of 
observations in the manufacturing firms. It was observed that the majority of the respondents which were 
engineers are not highly involved in strategic planning, financial management and risk management, their 
knowledge was not as broad as expected.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the quality management practices of the food industry in the past 30 years from 
1993 to 2022 based on literature review. 102 articles from 53 journals were chosen for the detailed literature review. 
The focus of attention was solely on the articles related to quality management in the food industry. This study 
investigated the research time and journals distribution of quality management in the food industry and summarized 
the research streams. This review describes the application and progress of quality management practice in the food 
industry, including the global research in this field in recent years, which is mainly concentrated in Europe and Asia. 
The article is divided into three research streams, and a detailed overview is given. The research results include the 
determinants of implementing quality management practices, the reasons why researchers have proposed multiple 
models and frameworks in the food industry through the years, and the importance of tools and techniques used in the 
implementation of quality management.

1. Introduction
Quality runs through almost all human activities and the history of human development is also a history of quality 
development. For example, high-quality products such as delicate silk and ceramics created by the Chinese people 
travelled across Europe and Asia from the Silk Road to all parts of the globe. Until the middle of the 18th century, the 
industrial revolution broke out in Europe. The emergence of factories brought mass production of products, which 
brought a series of new technical problems, such as precision of components and measurement, etc. The emergence 
of these problems urged the emergence of quality management discipline. However, it was not until the 1920s that the 
quality management systems we know today began to surface. The statistical theory was first applied to product quality 
control, although the focus of quality management remained on the final product. This algorithm had been used for a 
long time. As time went on, however, the business began to develop and grow. More and more products were produced 
in a day. Companies began to go through difficulties in implementing quality control standards. Changes and 
developments were needed. In the 1960s, with the publication of Total Quality Management (TQM) by Feigenbaum, 
countries were gradually accepted this new concept and entered the stage of total quality management since then. Food 
industry is not only the cornerstone of social harmony and public safety, but also the economic lifeline of the country. 
As Jasti et al. (2021) mentioned, it was about the 1990s that TQM began to popularize and deepen, and gradually 
applied to the food industry. However, in general, there is a lack of summary on the application of quality management 
in the food industry. Thus, the aim of this paper is to explore the evolution of quality management models and

articles were reviewed by Taylor & Francis, Emerald, Igi-Global, and Springer. This study used extracts from 21 
journals, and the results were reviewed and examined to answer this research question. The identified articles were 
screened using the selected eligibility criteria. The results of all studies state that they are consistent in contributing to 
the organization's sustainable competitive advantage. When digital change is so fast, the only way to balance and 
maintain the organization's lifelong sustainability is to engage in lifelong learning that synergizes with technological 
elements in its interactions.

1. Introduction
Demographically, in the last ten years, namely 2010-2020, there was an increase in the population of 32.56 million 
people, or if ordinary 3.26 million people yearly. In the population in Indonesia, the age composition that dominates 
the population in Indonesia is the age of generation z, and the millennial generation where this generation is the 
generation born from 1997-2012. Generation Z has the highest percentage of 27.94%, or equal to 74.93 million people. 
Meanwhile, the millennial generation is 69.38% or equivalent to 25.85 million people. This shows a demographic 
bonus: the more productive age population than the unproductive age population (www.kompas.com) are connected 
to technology. They are true digital natives, creative, critical, passionate about changing the world, and in constant 
search of authenticity. 
In 2017 millennials makeup half of the world's workforce, and by 2030 they will occupy three out of four positions 
(Kilber et al., 2014). They carry different values, behaviors, and beliefs as they enter and occupy strategic ranks within 
the organization. This indicates that these millennials drive their capacity to manage and improve organizational 
performance.

Why is Organizational Ambidexterity needed in companies?  
Organizational Ambidexterity is needed in companies because Ambidexteirity can show dynamic capabilities that 
focus on the role of organizational management in adapting, integrating, and reconfiguring skills and resources 
effectively and efficiently to adapt to an ever-changing environment (Úbeda-García et al., 2020). Organizations 
continuously build and improve expertise throughout the life history of the organization to sharpen and balance 
innovation, disruptive mindset, and disruptive innovation (Danneels, 2006). This results in the uniqueness of the 
organization being increasingly competitive in the eyes of the market, which ultimately leads the organization to be 
able to enjoy long-term success for a long time (Silva et al., 2021). Furthermore, skills built as a continuous basis of 
business processes and organizational structures are needed to promote and maintain accountability, identification, 
organizational culture, and development of competitive advantage core competencies (Turner et al., 2013). Thus, 
maintaining the synergy and integration between units and resources is the grass root approach to Ambidexterity. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Organizational practices toward digital systems have played an essential role in the needs of the business world. They 
have influenced the rules of business competition and business models in global industries, which are the core 
competitive factors in sustainable development. The organization sees Ambidexterity as an asset that is prepared to 
compete in the future, which is to have a unique signature process that is not easily imitated and produces 
organizational expertise and a current organizational resilience. It is necessary to have elements of integration that can 
ensure the level of adjustment and alignment in the context of digital transformation in collaboration with a unique set 
of millennial characteristics. Therefore, companies need to provide flexible space that can balance organizational 
dynamics through the involvement of millennials in their business units because they consider digital elements part of 
their personality. A personality can direct a business by thinking, acting, learning, understanding, and operating as the 
foundation for creating and developing long-term business profits. This means the demographic bonus owned by 
Indonesia will provide opportunities through the role of the millennial generation. On the other hand, the demographic 
bonus will threaten the organization if it does not have digital adaptive abilities. Thus, this is what strengthens 
organizational resilience and forms the influencing power in the eyes of global competition.

Abstract 
The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) can prevent the transmission of COVID-19.  However, it also has the 
potential to cause excessive physiological responses. This study aims to investigate the effect of the physical work 
environment (temperature) on physiological responses related to activities using level III PPE for handling COVID-
19 with laboratory experiments. Twelve participants (age 23.7 ± 2.4 years, BMI 24.3 ± 3.3 kg/m2) wore level III PPE 
and carried out simulated activities in three different working temperatures (20 ᵒC, 25 ᵒC and 30 ᵒC with relative 
humidity 50 ± 10 %). The experimental activities consisted of walking on a treadmill (speed of 2.9 km/hour), filling 
out logic-base puzzles, walking on a treadmill, filling out logic-base puzzles, walking on a treadmill, and bedding. 
Each activity was carried out for 9 minutes and the transfer time was 1 minute. At the end of each activity, 
physiological responses were measured including heart rate, oxygen consumption, and blood pressure. The results of 
this study show that working temperature had a significant effect on heart rate (p=0.002) and systolic blood pressure 
(p=0.043) but had no significant effect on oxygen consumption (p=0.411). A post-hoc analysis demonstrates that the 
working temperature of 30 ᵒC had effects that were different from the other two conditions.  It is concluded that 
wearing a PPE at a relatively high working temperature can result in undue physiological strains.  Findings of this 
study can be used as a basis for work and PPE redesigns.

1. Introduction
The Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak is one of the largest global health emergencies after the Second 
World War that impacted not only health but on devastating economies and social outcomes as well. This virus is 
contagious and often mutating and causing the pandemic difficult to handle properly. Pandemics was caused by viruses 
have occurred repeatedly such as the H1N1 virus (known as the Spanish flu) in 1918, the H2N2 influenza virus in 
1957, the H3N2 influenza virus in 1968, and the swine flu virus (H1N1) in 2009 therefore there is a possibility of 
recurrence. 
Health workers are people who directly handle COVID-19 patients therefore they have very high risks of being 
infected because this disease is contagious. The risks are higher as the intense contact between health workers and 
patients due to the increase the number of patients, but it has not been accompanied by an adequate number of health 
workers and care facilities. COVID-19 has been shown to spread through droplet infections, aerosols, human-to-
human contact, contact with infected surfaces, and fecal transmission pathways (Donà et al. 2020). 
Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be used by health workers to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 
but its use is causing side effects of thermal discomfort and the appearance of excessive physiological responses. 
Medical service activities using PPE are causing overheating which results in heat stress which has an impact on 
cognitive impairment, fatigue, productivity, and work accidents (Daanen et al. 2021; Messeri et al. 2021). The 
inconvenience of PPE for handling COVID-19 can be caused by several factors. Six fundamental factors that 
determine the human thermal environment are air temperature, radiant temperature, humidity, and air movement, as

Figure 9 shows the relationship of activity at the temperature of the working environment with diastolic blood pressure. 
The result of statistical analysis shows that there is no influence of the work environment (20 ᵒC, 25 ᵒC and 30 ᵒC) on 
diatolic blood pressure. This happens because the change in diastolic blood pressure is relatively smaller than that of 
systolic blood pressure. (Toomingas 2012). 
6. Conclusion
This study was conducted to evaluate the physiological response experienced by health workers when doing work 
dealing with COVID-19 patients using level III PPE in places with different working environment conditions, namely 
at temperatures of 20 ᵒC, 25 ᵒC and 30 ᵒC with RH (50 ± 10) %. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory to 
obtain controlled research variables. Respondents were taken from S1 and S2 ITB students with age range of (23.7 ± 
2.4) years and BMI of (24.3 ± 3.3) kg/m2. The experimental protocol is designed to describe the activities that health 
workers usually do at work, namely physical activity, activities that require concentration and dexterity of the hands. 
Analysis of variance on experimental results showed that there was an influence of simulated working environment 
temperature (20 ᵒC, 25 ᵒC and 30 ᵒC) on heart rate and systolic blood pressure and there was no effect on oxygen 
consumption and diastolic blood pressure. Post hoc analysis of the physiological response at a working environment 
temperature of 30 ᵒC is different from other working environments (temperatures of 20 ᵒC and 25 ᵒC). Based on the 
analysis of the experimental results, it can be concluded that wearing PPE at a relatively high working temperature 
can result in undue physiological tension.  The findings of this study can be used as the basis for the work and redesign 
of PPE.

Abstract 
The abrupt transition to remote work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it increased reliance on artificial 
intelligence as virtually all facets of the employment lifecycle shifted from in-person to remote. The pandemic also 
opened the door for new AI to gain traction as employers sought ways to enhance the productivity and experience of 
the virtual workforce. Therefore, a new phenomenon emerged called metaverse. Metaverse is a post-reality universe, 
an immutable and persistent multiuser environment that combines physical reality with digital virtuality. It is based 
on the convergence of technologies enabling multisensory interactions with virtual environments, digital objects and 
people such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Therefore, Metaverse is an interconnected network 
of social. Business and employee interactions are also new things that can be developed in the metaverse therefore 
this research is entitled “International Labour Law Perspectives on the Metaverse”, by using a descriptive juridical 
research method through a statutory approach and a conceptual framework. The research question is whether private 
international law already protects the workforce or does working in the metaverse require a whole new rulebook? This 
research will look at how to regulate the metaverse in international labour law.

1. Introduction
The abrupt transition to remote work caused by the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it increased reliance on artificial 
intelligence (AI) as virtually all facets of the employment lifecycle shifted from in-person to remote. The pandemic 
also opened the door for new AI to gain traction as employers sought ways to enhance the productivity and experience 
of the virtual workforce because of that COVID-19 pandemic has created a ripe opportunity for the implementation 
of these tools as employees are increasingly working remotely (Kim Parker et al. 2020).

The further difficulties relate to many aspect especially in labour laws: (i) data protection issues as the metaverse 
stores and manages huge amounts of data including personal data of users, also the cross border data flow issues as 
the users in the metaverse typically come from hundreds of  countries; (ii) applying  “traditional”  contract  law  to 
the  metaverse  as  it  mainly  uses  smart  contracts for the sake of practicality, efficiency, and agility; (iii) cyber 
security issues as more and more cyberattacks occur in the virtual world; (iv) collective efforts of  governments around 
to tax virtual goods, services, and commercial conducts;  (v)  restrictions  by  the  government  on  gambling  activities 
in  the  metaverse  has  adverse  impacts  on  the  development  of   the  metaverse;  (vi)  applying  criminal  law  to 
the  virtual  criminality;  and  (vii)  the  metaverse  has  been accused to be lack of  governance and democracy and 
some of  its users lack of  ethical conducts. 
Stakeholders and governance entities need to discuss how the laws of the future can capture the interrelationships 
between spaces where people in a real digital society hybrid and the interdependence between real-world personalities 
and the economic interests of entrepreneurs. Generally, the issue of distribution of responsibilities and obligations 
between platform creators and users is becoming increasingly challenging for social and trading platforms. This should 
be examined in the context of comparative law whether and to what extent applicable international labour law can 
integrate virtual objects or whether sui generis law virtual object will become necessary. Aspects related to 
tokenization should be included, and the development of private law regarding tokens discussed further.

Abstract 
A corporate culture without core values to support it will only be a mere formality and suffer from lack of intrinsic 
vitality. This condition will make companies more vulnerable to market volatility and drowned in conflicts of interest, 
which will put the company at disadvantage. Chinese companies that are still growing need to explore and set their 
own core values that are crucial to the company’s survival. Adhering to the moral and ethical principles established 
by the traditional Chinese culture, and at the same time, adapting with contemporary Chinese culture become the main 
challenge for the companies in developing their corporate culture. Confucianism, created by Confucius, is the core of 
traditional Chinese culture and plays an important role in the formation and development of Chinese society. It is 
important to refer to Confucianism as the foundation when building a Chinese corporate culture. This paper tries to 
answer two research questions: 1) Which elements of Confucianism play a role in Chinese companies; 2) What impact 
does Confucianism have on Chinese companies? This study concludes that a corporate culture that is well integrated 
with the traditional Chinese culture, like Confucianism, is likely to make the company stronger. 
Keywords: 
Confucianism, Chinese traditional culture, corporate culture, core values, and market volatility. 
1. Introduction
Corporate culture is a cultural phenomenon and activity which reflects the economic behavior and condition of a 
company, a mix of significance of economy and culture, and a movement process where economy and culture pierce 
through and integrate into one. The future will become the era of global competition, and companies which would 
succeed are those which adopt new corporate culture and new cultural marketing strategy.  
Corporate values are the cores of corporate culture which determine and influence the meaning and purpose of a 
company’s existence, values and roles of various corporate regulations, relationship between various people’s 
behaviors in the company and the company’s interests and provide sustainability and development for the company. 
Basic instruction and guiding principles for action have placed foundations for the company’s employees to shape the 
general code of conduct (Thomas, 2018; Eric, 2001). 
Basically, shaping corporate culture is to refine corporate values. Corporate values refer to values in the community. 
Belief regarding certain corporate values, tendency, faith, proposition, and behavior is a summary, generalization, and 
refinement of the company’s manager and employees to the activation of corporate values and value selection activity. 
Employee value activity and employees in a company have the regulation and controlling functions (Jin Wu, 2018).  
The success of an organization lies on effective cultural management. Culture is viewed as a critical organizational 
development area or a strategic key (Thomas, 2018). Culture is related to the organization’s core values. Values are 
critical aspects for the organization which support decision and behavior. All organizations have a set of cultures or 
values which affect behaviors in various fields, such as treatment towards customers, performance standard, 
innovation, etc. Corporate values without core values supporting them will only be a mere formality. This condition

The development of a company which has good cultural relationship between the company and its employees 
(Selvarajah, Chelliah J, and Lee H, 2001; Allen, 2017) will bring upon material and spiritual boosts for the employees. 
Large-scale companies with good division of works, like the head office which can be divided into several levels, like 
a parent company and its subsidiaries, they present vertical parents-children’s relations. This parents-children relation 
acts like an adhesive that binds all of the company’s aspects and departments into one and has strong cohesion. This 
family concept reflects the principal and spirit of collectivism in all aspects of the society, and represents the interests 
and value orientations of the society.  
Driven by the “home 家” concept, which is a collective expression, when faced between individual or common 
interest, common interest will always be prioritized over individual interest, and individual value can only be realized 
through the common value. Building the concept of “home” is an important part of inculcating the moral qualities to 
employees for self-discipline and serves for public interest and cultivates professionalism at work.   
Wisdom (智 zhì) and faithfulness (信 xìn) are implemented in daily life in the company. Confucianism believes that 
human resources are better than material resources. Western traditional management theories perceive human as 
“economic people”, a passive and negative factor. Humans are not mere “economic people” who creates material 
wealth, but also “social people” who wish to satisfy their self-awareness, develop their potentials, showcase their 
talents, and try hard to surpass their own limit. Therefore, in the operational and management process, corporate 
leaders should not only focus on capital, technology, and short-term income value, but should also focus on the 
“people” itself, learn to understand the employees’ feelings, and create fun work atmosphere for them. It necessary to 
change the management function in accordance with the role of each person, event, and condition; from the system of 
instruction, supervision, and control to moving and stimulating the spirit and dedication of the employees in the 
company’s decision-making and management. Confucianism has expanded our mindset in modern corporate 
management, emphasized human factor, and focused on building the sense of participation of the employees through 
ups and down, which can be considered a magical recipe in maintaining the company’s youth vitality (Woods and 
Diamond, 2011; Young, 2004). 
Propriety (礼 lǐ) emphasizes that the society is a group of organizations, and company is an organization. Ensuring 
the order of an organization is essential premise for normal operation of a company. Confucianism believes that the 
purpose of organizational management is to grow the spirit of unity and teamwork between organization members, 
and hierarchy provides the communication bridge (Shen and Yuan Y, 2013). 
6. Conclusion
Basically, companies need to give full trust to the internal employees. The appointed leaders should provide good 
example, create fun work environment for the employees, and avoid command management to make all the employees 
excited to develop their potential, showcase their talent, work hard to surpass their own limit, and do their best for the 
company. Furthermore, the leaders should also be able to promote others, let the employees manage themselves, and 
train the employees to consciously develop their behavior and habit to stay in healthy market competition corridor and 
protect the social and public interest.

Abstract 
The Board of Directors is an essential part in running a company, especially because of its authority over the control 
and management of company activities, which involves a lot of information. Directors drive the company towards its 
goals and visions, by moving it to accomplish its missions. One of the manifestation of its importance can be seen in 
the aspect of disclosure. As the one who manages important information, disclosure is undeniably critical, either for 
the shareholders, government, or the people. The directors’ ability to disclose important information is one of the 
benchmarks for the independence of the directors. This independence is influenced by shareholders, whose 
composition is defined through a share ownership structure. The share ownership structure itself can be classified 
according to the legal system in that country, which makes the different share ownership structure could be identified 
through a country’s legal system. Whereas directors’ independency can be identified through a conflict of interest 
transaction, where the directors play a significant role in preventing potential losses, namely through disclosure. This 
paper aims to show the relationship between share ownership structure and the independence of directors from the 
perspective of conflict of interest transactions in Indonesia and Australia to show which share ownership structure is 
better to be implemented. The results found are that a dispersed share ownership structure that exists in common law 
countries implies better directors’ independency, and that directors in Australia show better disclosure accompanied 
by greater responsibility based on conflict of interest regulations.

Abstract 
Going concern audit opinion is an opinion expressed by the auditor regarding the uncertainty of the company's 
viability caused by several factors. The purpose of the going concern audit opinion is to provide a good early 
warning for business entities to immediately improve their business continuity. The auditor is responsible for 
evaluating, analyzing whether the company or business entity has substantial doubts about the company's 
condition regarding the company's ability to continue as a going concern. The purpose of this study is to determine 
the effect of audit quality, opinion shopping, financial condition, and debt default, either simultaneously or 
partially affecting going concern audit opinion. The population used in this study are manufacturing companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the food and beverage sub-sector in 2016-2020. The number of samples 
of the food and beverage sub-sector in 2016-2020 are 14 companies with a total sample data of 70 companies 
analyzed in this study. In this study, hypothesis testing was carried out using descriptive analysis and logistic 
regression. The study results show that audit quality, opinion shopping, financial condition, and debt default have 
a simultaneous influence on going-concern audit opinion. In the partial test, the financial condition partially has 
a positive influence on going concern audit opinion. Meanwhile, audit quality, opinion shopping, and debt default 
have no influence on going concern audit opinion. It is hoped that this study can be used by investors as a reference 
for considerations regarding investment decisions to pay more attention to the company's financial condition. This 
study is expected to be a guide, information, and insight for companies and individuals in developing financial 
statements so that they do not provide financial reports that are lacking and are in accordance with applicable 
accounting standards.

1. Introduction
A company is founded with the aim of surviving to maintain the viability of it. The viability of the company is 
always associated with the company's management in managing and surviving in business activities for a long 
period of time. Investor is one party who has an important role in maintaining the viability of a company by 
providing every operational activity in the company through investment. Investors will want and agree to invest 
in the business, then the investment can be considered for investors who will hold a meeting, the consideration is 
in the form of profits that will be obtained by the investors and safety guarantees regarding the capital to be 
invested in the business. The role of audit opinion is needed by users of financial information such as shareholders,

Abstract 
In this era of globalization, technology is very much needed, especially in the world of education. To improve the 
quality of learning, many tools can be used to support the quality of learning, one of which is using media as a teaching 
aid. This study aims to analyse the effect of comic media mobile application on Chinese grammatical competence 
among Chinese learners. This study uses a quantitative descriptive approach, and purposive sampling determined the 
sample. The research instrument used was the test (pre-test and post-test) and the questionnaire. The data analysis 
method used to test the hypothesis is the pre-test-post-test using the t-test (paired sample test) and the normality test. 
After the pre-test, the research subjects were asked to try the comic media application “LeDu” for two weeks. Through 
the post-test results, the average value of the research subjects increased from 74 to 87.23. The t-test on the correlation 
between the pre-test and post-test scores shows a correlation between the two variables, and the t-test data shows the 
value of Sig. (2-tailed) is 0.000<0.005, indicating that the “LeDu” comic media application prototype significantly 
affects learning Chinese grammatical competence. The questionnaire data also shows that the respondents responded 
positively to 3 aspects, user interest, content quality, and application usability.

1. Introduction
Mandarin is the national language of the People’s Republic of China and the language with the most prominent native 
speakers in the world. This phenomenon is increasingly attracting the attention of Indonesians to learn and master the 
language. Learning Mandarin in every educational institution in Indonesia is carried out as foreign language learning, 
making Mandarin the second largest foreign language after English (Jureynolds and Ying 2020). Many schools and 
universities have started using media as a teaching aid to improve language learning. The learning process aims to 
provide concrete experiences and motivation to learn and enhance the absorption and retention of learning. 
Comics are one of the most interesting visual learning media. Readers not only get information or learning materials 
but can also be entertained through the stories’ content. Comics are a form of cartoon with supporting characters to 
act out a story (Sudjana and Rivai 2013). Comics that have funny and interesting pictures, as well as fun storylines, 
are not only popular among children but also have their charm for children, teenagers, and adults. In addition, Wilujeng 
and Lan (2015) also said that comic words are easy to remember, increase creativity and motivate students to learn.

According to the results of the paired samples test in the picture above, the value of Sig. (2-tailed) is 0.000<0.005, 
indicating the hypothesis is proven. So it can be concluded that there is a significant influence in using comics learning 
media applications to increase understanding of Mandarin grammar. (Table 5) 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the previous research and discussion, the researchers concluded that there was a significant 
influence in the use of comic learning media applications on the study of Chinese language learning. This is also 
evidenced s of the calculation of the paired samples test, that the value of Sig. (2-tailed) is 0.000 < 0.005, which proves 
a significant influence on using the LeDu comic learning media application. In addition, it can also be seen that the 
average value of the pre-test is smaller than the average value of the post-test, namely 74 < 87.23, which means that 
there is a significant increase in the value of the research subject. 
 
Based on the results of research data processing, the LeDu comic media application can be used as an alternative to 
improve Mandarin grammar skills for learning Chinese. The LeDu funny media application can also be an alternative 
for Chinese language learners in previewing material. This mobile app will help make it easier for the teacher to 
explain the material’s content. Still, it can also help students better understand the material’s content before getting an 
explanation from the teacher so that if there are difficulties in the material, they can be asked to the class lecturer when 
teaching and learning activities are carried out. The LeDu comic media application can also be an alternative for 
students to review lessons. 
 
Suggestions for developing the LeDu application and future research are to be able to conduct research on comic 
learning media with different designs. Presumably, it can improve learning outcomes for elementary-level Chinese 
learners or those who do not have Chinese language skills.

Abstract 
Researchers sparked the idea of designing a song-based learning application concept to get responses in the form of 
input from research samples to develop better learning applications in the future. Learning media in the form of songs 
have been used in classroom learning. Digital transformation in education into music technology as an innovative 
learning media. The research was conducted using a qualitative-descriptive method that begins with depth interviews, 
distributing questionnaires, and then using the data obtained from the user experience. Based on the results of the 
initial user survey, it is known that there are four classifications of learning difficulties in Mandarin, including 
problems in remembering Han characters, grammatical errors, difficulties in pronouncing Han characters, and 
challenges in hearing recorded Mandarin conversations. Based on the needs survey, the initial design of the song-
based application prototype, XingSong, features a song list and music player, vocabulary list, practice, and quiz 
(including Pinyin Writing, fill in the blanks, and reading), speech recognition, and downloadable PDF writing practice. 
The XingSong application received a positive response from respondents as an innovation in Chinese learning 
applications. Based on testing the XingSong application prototype, researchers received input on application 
development regarding design aesthetics and content that can adapt to each user’s Chinese language skills.

1. Introduction
Many schools and universities in Indonesia provide learning Mandarin for students. Studying languages is a good 
investment for yourself because the more proficient in a foreign language we master, the more positive opportunities 
and opportunities we will get in daily life, business, and education (Hermawan, B. and Leonardo, O.P. 2017). This 
phenomenon shows that Mandarin has economic value, and if mastered, it will increase Indonesia’s competitiveness 
in the global market. This makes Mandarin one of the most popular foreign languages. 
However, we all realize that Indonesian students who want to learn Mandarin certainly feel it is not easy to learn. This 
is because Mandarin uses pictograph letters, which are called Han characters. During the cultural revolution, the PRC 
government Romanized the Han characters to eradicate illiteracy. Romanization is used to make it easier to read Han 
characters as pictograph characters, but in language practice, Pinyin cannot replace the position of Han characters. So, 
in the aspect of reading and writing, it will not be separated from Han’s character. 
Over time, the development of Mandarin in Indonesia has begun to enter literary and artistic works due to a large 
number of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia, and not a few Indonesians, from children to adults, like Mandarin films,

and quiz features. In addition, the design must be made more straightforward and elegant, this application must provide 
a ranking feature on the score, and the selection of colors on the application display must be softer and not too flashy. 
 
Respondents felt that the advantages of this application, apart from making the independent learning atmosphere more 
fun and focused, was because the song selection was a popular song. Vocabulary lists make it easy for them to learn 
essential vocabulary in the selected song. Practice and quiz features become an assessment of their understanding. 
They argue that speech recognition and downloadable PDF files, as well as other features in the form of listening, 
practice, quizzes, and new vocabulary that can be learned, are quite complete and exciting and are innovations from a 
learning application prototype. 
 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
This XingSong application prototype still has some shortcomings. Respondents thought that the display design could 
be improved. Their suggestion regarding the design of this application is the monotonous background of the song lyric 
video. It would be nice to replace it with a video or graphical background and color choices that attract the users’ 
attention. Looking at the content aspect, respondents think it would be better to develop features with recommended 
song choices to be able to train users by adjusting the level first so that users can experience significant improvements 
in learning Chinese through the XingSong application. 
 
Based on the test results and user input for the XingSong application prototype, future application development will 
focus on the screen display’s color selection and aesthetic aspects. In addition, the Chinese language proficiency test 
will provide recommendations for personalized song choices for each user by adjusting it to the individual’s Chinese 
language ability. Testing the effectiveness of the XingSong application can be done quantitatively to get a 
measurement of the performance of this application to support learning Chinese. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The initial survey showed that the general difficulties in learning basic Chinese could be classified into four: difficulty 
remembering Han characters, grammatical errors, problems pronouncing Han characters, and difficulty hearing 
recorded Mandarin conversations. Based on these problems, the researchers made a prototype design for the XingSong 
application, hoping to overcome these problems with a song-based language learning approach. The features presented 
in this application prototype include a song list and music player, vocabulary list, practice, and quiz (including Pinyin 
Writing, fill in the blanks, and reading), speech recognition, and downloadable PDF writing practice. Based on the 
survey results of testing the XingSong application prototype, it can be concluded that this application prototype is an 
innovation for Chinese learning applications, especially in song-based Chinese learning. The XingSong application 
prototype received a positive response from respondents. Despite receiving a positive response, this application 
prototype still has many shortcomings in design aesthetics and content leveling. In the XingSong application 
prototype, there is no fix for every user’s answer error, and there is still no feature for the user’s Mandarin level 
division to select songs. While in the design section, this XingSong application still needs many improvements in 
choosing the background color, the layout of the features in the application, and the design of each song lyrics video 
displayed. Some of these inputs will be carried out in the application development stage. They will be supported by 
experimental-based trials to test the effectiveness of the XingSong application in learning Chinese.

Abstract 
Discussions about the relationship between the fourth industrial revolution, also called Industry 4.0, and last mile 
logistics are an issue that has grown over time due to the development of new technologies that take on new industries 
and the lack of processes and innovation to accompany the evolution of Industry 4.0 and cover optimization needs in 
the last mile of the logistics chain. This article's main objective is to research the new challenges and approaches that 
arise in this fourth industrial revolution to face and optimize the last mile of the logistics chain. To fulfill this purpose, 
a systematic literature review was carried out, as well as a bibliometric analysis. 100 articles were reviewed in detail, 
the origin of these articles is 100% Scopus to ensure quality content in the research. The results show a constant 
development of the technologies that make up Industry 4.0 in organizations worldwide, which leads to large-scale 
growth, thus resulting in the need for process optimization for last-mile logistics.

1. Introduction
Last mile logistics is understood as the last link of the supply chain service that includes all movements related to 
commercial activities, supply, and distribution of products for industry, marketing and consumption in cities (Alfieri 
et al., 2019). The supply chain is composed of different processes and the distribution of goods is of the last steps that 
encompasses the delivery of products or services to the final consumer, this step faces permanent challenges that seek 
the optimization of economic resources for the benefit of organizations and final consumers (Zhang et al., 2019). An 
important role involved in this stage is that of the most common end consumers which are business establishments, 
commercial, industrial, private homes and B2C (Ali et al., 2019). To achieve optimization solutions in this stage of 
the logistics chain, new technologies are presented as possible solutions, these are developed and are part of the new 
industry (Guo et al., 2019). There are new approaches that are embodied to meet the challenges of the exposed juncture, 
approaches that are developed from the need to cope with the technological growth that comes with contemporaneity 
in Industry 4.0 (Janjevic & Winkenbach, 2020). Implementing the use of emerging technologies such as Big Data 
analysis, Cyber Physical Systems, Autonomous Systems or Blockchain technology, are postulated as the main 
solutions for the optimization of processes deployed in the last mile (Li et al., 2020). in last mile logistics? 
1.1 Objectives 
Having stated the above, the main objective of this article is to analyze the evolution and new approaches proposed 
by Industry 4.0 for the processes involved in last mile logistics through a respective bibliometric study. That is why it 
is motivated to answer the following questions: 
Q1: What is the current state of the literature regarding the implications of Industry 4.0 on last mile logistics process 
management? 
Q2: What would be a correct definition of Industry 4.0 in the field of last mile logistics? 
Q3: What other technology or technologies are involved in the pursuit of last mile logistics 4.0? 
Q4: What is the impact of new technologies on last mile logistics? 
Q5: What are the barriers that limit the implementation of these technologies?

technology is available (Moshref-Javadi, Hemmati, & Winkenbach, 2021). Numerical results show that all three 
models can significantly reduce customer waiting times. The FTRPD, for example, can reduce customer waiting time 
by more than 60 % in some of the problematic instances compared to the truck-only scenario (Moshref-Javadi, 
Hemmati, & Winkenbach, 2021). 
 
5.4 Barriers 
Barriers in the implementation of these new technologies can be defined as the difficulties encountered when making 
use of it in a real scenario with different variables that could affect its operation, among them the application in real life 
cases, understanding and design of the variables necessary for its effectiveness, cost of implementation and evaluation 
of profitability for certain specific processes. In the case of blockchain technology, this pilot project has revealed a 
number of challenges that need to be addressed before solutions, such as the PROoFD-IT system, can be implemented 
in real delivery processes. The most prominent challenge is the difficulty of translating existing human- centric 
guidelines, such as HACCP, into instructions that can be used by intelligent software systems. While these food safety 
management systems initially appear to have clear guidelines, for example, on critical temperature limits, they are 
designed first and foremost to be used by humans. Our experience with real-world delivery workflows highlights the 
need for such guidelines to be much more detailed and deterministic, clearly stating the expected outcomes in a variety 
of situations. (Markovic, Jacobs, Dryja, Edwards, & Strachan, 2020). As for the implementation of drones for use in 
home deliveries, this reduction in customer wait times is highly dependent on the parameters of the models, including 
the number of UAVs, the UAV-to-truck speed ratio, the UAV flight time limit, and the UAV service time. Among all 
parameters, the models are very sensitive to the number of UAV parameters. The savings in customer waiting time are 
higher for problems with highly congested and clustered networks compared to uniformly distributed networks. The 
results show that there is a considerable trade-off between minimizing customer waiting times and minimizing the 
costs of distributions, and therefore the correct objective function must be chosen carefully. (Moshref-Javadi, Hemmati, 
& Winkenbach, 2021). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The present research study has focused on a topic that has not been fully explored and related because it is in a constant 
transition of research and technological innovation that allows it to be adapted to the needs of the subject under study. 
The context of the Last Mile has demanded the need to implement new technological tools of Industry 4.0, tools such 
as Machine Learning, IoT and Big Data have facilitated and provided the optimization of various processes involved 
in the last mile, in addition they have served as a starting point for the exploration and implementation of new solutions. 
However, there are limitations and disadvantages that directly and indirectly affect the traditional development of last 
mile logistics, so it is important to focus future research on the adaptation and role that Industry 4.0 tools take. It is 
important to make impetus on the comprehensive analysis conducted of the role of Industry 4.0 in the large number 
of studies of last mile logistics through a systematic literature review approach. Currently, large companies are looking 
for Industry 4.0 coupling as part of the digital transformation process to obtain current optimization methods that easily 
adapt to future changes. The reading indicates that the development of new platforms, methods and means to be used 
in the development of last mile logistics are directly related to the digitization and virtualization used by its tools, since 
these provide flexibility and a quick adaptation level that serve as an answer to the needs of the companies. Finally, after 
performing the bibliometric and statistical analysis, it is evident that the research of Industry 4.0 tools for the benefit 
of last mile logistics is constantly growing and is still a niche with great potential for exploitation. It is now where 
companies are responsible for implementing the tools provided by Industry 4.0, adapting them to their digital 
transformation process and developing research for the benefit of optimizing their processes in the last mile of their 
logistics. The suggested review is designed to explain the link between Industry 4.0 and Last Mile Logistics and the 
implication of its tools for the development of new methods that can be implemented in the future.

Abstract 
Financial disclosure is a report that presents structured data on the financial information of a company that contains 
the company's performance and financial position and changes in a certain period.  Financial statements with integrity 
are financial statements that display the actual condition of a company without anything to hide. Transportation 
subsector companies have relatively good and promising business prospects because transportation is an important 
need in carrying out daily activities both on land, sea, and air.  This study aims to determine the effect of managerial 
ownership, leverage, and intellectual capital on the integrity of financial statements in transportation subsector 
companies listed on the Stock Exchange Indonesia for the period 2017-2020.  The population in this study used 
transportation subsector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the   2017-2020 period.  Purposive 
sampling was used in this study, and 36 sample data were obtained.  Descriptive statistical analysis   and panel data 
analysis were used as analysis techniques in this study.  Based on the results of the study, it was concluded that 
managerial ownership, leverage, and intellectual capital   have a simultaneous effect on the integrity of financial 
statement.   Managerial ownership and leverage positively affect   the integrity of financial statements in transportation 
subsector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange   for the period 2017-2020. Meanwhile, intellectual 
capital does not affect the integrity of the financial statements of transportation subsector companies listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 period.

1. Introduction
Based on the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SAK), financial statements are reports that shows 
structured data regarding financial information of a company that contains the company's performance and financial 
position and its changes in a certain period.  The Accountant Institute of Indonesia in the  Statement of Accounting 
Standards (2015) explained that the financial statements show the information about financial position, cash flow, and 
financial performance that will be used to make economic decisions for its users.  The users of financial statements 
include investors, government, creditors, employees and other users(Inganta Sinulingga & Wibawa Ningsih, 2020). 
Financial statements must be integrity   made according to facts and must not be engineered and honest so that users 
do not make mistakes in deciding.  
Financial statement with integrity is a financial report that reveals the actual condition of a company without hiding 
anything (Indrasti, 2020). Financial statements must be prepared with high integrity and impartial to anyone because

5.3 The Effect of Leverage on the Integrity of Financial Statements 
The results of the panel data regression test using the fixed effect model on Table 7. the result of the leverage regression 
coefficient value of 6.080530 with a probability of 0.0024 where the probability value was less than 0.05. Based on 
these results, it can be interpreted that leverage affects the integrity of financial statements.  These results are in line 
with the researcher's hypothesis that leverage has a positive effect on the integrity of financial statements.  Leverage 
is a percentage ratio that shows the amount of debt used to finance the company's assets. The leverage ratio indicates 
high financial risks. Companies that have high leverage are also required to present information more broadly 
compared to companies with low leverage levels (Indrawati & Afriana Hanif, 2017). Companies that have a high 
leverage ratio are required to present financial statements properly so as not to have information asymmetry between 
the company's management and investors. The results of this study also support previous research conducted by Ario 
et al.  (2020) and Danuta & Wijaya (2020).  
 
5.4 The Effect of Intellectual Capital on the Integrity of Financial Statements 
The results of the panel data regression test using the fixed effect model on Table 7.  showed the result of the 
intellectual capital regression coefficient value of -0.025218 with a probability of 0.0762 where the probability value 
was more than 0.05. Based on these results, it can be interpreted that intellectual capital does not affect the integrity 
of financial statements. These results are not in line with the researcher's hypothesis which states that intellectual 
capital has a positive effect on the integrity of financial statements because 24 of the 36 observational data do not 
carry out intellectual capital, the results of this study are also not in the same direction as previous research conducted 
by Febrilyantri (2020) which stated that companies can improve their performance and produce output  financial 
statements with integrity when having quality  intellectual capital. However, in line with Wardani's research (2016) 
which states that intellectual capital does not affect the integrity of financial statements. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The result of this study, lead to the following conclusions: 
 
1. The managerial ownership, leverage, and intellectual capital have a simultaneous effect on the integrity of 
financial statements in Transportation companies that listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2017-2020 period. 
2. Managerial ownership has a positive partially effect on the integrity of financial statements in Transportation 
companies that listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2017-2020 period. 
3. Leverage has a positive partially effect on the integrity of financial statements in Transportation companies that 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2017-2020 period. 
4. Intellectual capital does not affect the integrity of financial statements in Transportation companies that listed on 
the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2017-2020 period.

Abstract 
The occurrence of the Covid-19 pandemic has caused changes in public payment methods, with the aim of reducing 
the transmission of the Covid-19 virus through physical money. With so many mobile services available, payments 
made using e-wallets are more convenient and faster than conventional banking systems because they save time and 
money. Over time, people are getting used to using digital transactions as their payment method. This study focuses 
on the Continuance Intention to use E-Wallet during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Indonesia, with the influence of 
Perceived Value, and E-Service Quality on Customer Satisfaction, as well as Government Support, Customer 
Satisfaction, and Perceived Health Risk on Continuance Intention to Use. Total of 351 data were collected from the 
users of e-wallet in the Greater Jakarta Area of Indonesia and analyzed by deploying partial least squares structural 
equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our results show that only the perceived health risk variable does not affect 
continuance intention to use. In the context of this study, the Covid-19 virus disease is no longer a motivating factor 
for e-wallet users to use e-wallet continuously. However, other variables show a positive influence on continuance 
intention to use.

1. Introduction
Technological developments have changed people's habits in conducting transactions, over the past few years, the 
growth and popularity of commercial mobile-based applications such as mobile services applications have been very 
rapid (Yang et al. 2015). Mobile-based payment systems are widely used for transactions, and making payments 
through actions because consumers find this method profitable (Gokilavani et al. 2018). The innovation of mobile 
payment methods and mobile applications come under different names but has the same function as mobile wallets, 
mobile payments, mobile commerce, and mobile banking (Sharma 2019).
Covid-19 pandemic encourages digital transaction activity, there has been an increase in online shopping activity by 
up to 400% in Indonesia (Kencana 2020). Indonesian people have adapted to the situation so that payments based on 
digital wallets have also become a new habit for the community. This is due to government regulations to carry out 
daily activities from home. This is because the spread of Covid-19 can be transmitted through paper money. Likewise,

Perceived Value -> Customer Satisfaction 
13.7369 
0.0000 
Accepted 
 
The path coefficient result shown in table 4 shows that out of 5 hypotheses, 4 of them are accepted where customer 
satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on continuance intention to use, e-service quality and perceived value 
has a positive and significant effect on customer satisfaction, and government support has a positive and significant 
effect on continuance intention to use. However, 1 one hypothesis are rejected where perceived health risk did not 
have a significant effect on continuance intention to use. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
This study aims to determine the factors that affects continuance intention to use e-wallet during the covid-19 
pandemic. Specifically, this study examines the relationship between perceived value, and e-service quality, on 
customer satisfaction, as well as customer satisfaction, perceived health risk, and government support on continuance 
intention to use. Based on the test results, it was discovered that perceived health risk did not have any significant 
effect to continuance intention to use. Perceived value and e-service quality have a direct impact on customer 
satisfaction, customer satisfaction and government support also have a direct impact on continuance intention to use. 
Based on the tests, it is seen that perceived value is the most influential factor on continuance intention to use in this 
research 
 
This study may benefit several parties, firstly for digital wallet (e-wallet) companies, The results of this study can be 
used as material for consideration and evaluation of the obstacles faced by digital wallet companies during the Covid-
19 pandemic. In addition, this research can also be used as a reference for improving the performance of digital wallet 
companies in the future, such as the development of the e-service quality sector which can be improved even more to 
increase customer satisfaction and also the collaboration between digital wallet companies and the government for the 
development of the company to be even better. For Indonesian government, the results of this study can be used as 
material to increase government efforts in developing ways of doing activities for the community, especially in 
conducting transactions by utilizing existing technological developments. At the same time, during a pandemic, the 
government can also reduce the number of Covid-19 spreads with these technological developments. In addition, this 
research can also be a reference in developing government projects in collaboration with digital wallet companies, so 
that the government has consideration in making a decision. 
 
For this study, there are 2 main limitations that can be considered for future researches on similar topic. The first 
limitation is the limited time available to study this research problem and to measure changes over time is limited by 
several practical problems, so it is recommended in further research to be able to carry out with an optimal timeframe. 
In addition, there are also limited access to access several journals on several publication sites due to limited costs. It 
is hoped that further research will be able to enrich information and data by citing more related research journals, 
especially international journals.

Abstract 
Numerous research has pointed to the significant roles of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in driving economic growth 
in Asia, particularly in the 1980s. Such enterprises have immensely benefited from both state support and legal and 
natural monopolies, often at the expense of crowding out private sector growth and investment. The 1997-1998 Asian 
Financial Crisis, however, have exposed many countries to the fact that it can no longer rely solely on SOEs.  There 
has been pressure to reform its SOEs, to improve its competitiveness or even privatize. SOE Reform in China and 
Indonesia provide interesting case studies, considering their dominance in key sectors, and extent and scope of state 
influence. SOEs in both countries remain obliged, to this day, to deliver political and social objectives while expected 
to generate profits. This paper, therefore, aims at performing a comparative analysis of SOE reform in both countries 
during the period of 2010-2020, with a view of examining governance and financial management changes as 
consequences and products of reform. Questions to be answered in this paper include: 1) what considerations for 
reform are; 2) how SOE governance change as consequence of reform; and 3) extent of financial management and 
operational changes that SOEs experience.  
Keywords 
Indonesia, China, State Owned Enterprises, Reform, State Corporatism. 
1. Introduction
State Owned Enterprises (SOE) significant roles in East Asian countries’ development may characterize the ‘Asian 
way’ of development (Park 2020, also in Singh and Chen, 2018). SOEs contribute more to Gross Domestic Products 
(GDP) in Asian countries compared to elsewhere around the world, and in developing Asia, the contribution is 10-
40% of GDP, higher than average of Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) where SOE 
is contributing 5% of GDP (World Bank, 2014). Among the countries, in Indonesia and China, SOEs contribute 23-
28% percent in China (Zhang, 2019), and have pertinent economic, social, and political roles (Singh and Chen, 2018). 
SOEs so called dominance does not come without issues. In times of economic difficulties, they may pose additional 
burden to the State Budget, and their poor performance may be a source of public discontent. There are also concerns 
that they may crowd out private investment and distort competition (Cevik, 2019; Menong and Ng, 2017). To address 
such issues, reforms have been rolled out in the two countries, and comparative analysis of reform in the two countries 
will be able to share a light on the motivation, and whether governance and performance are affected. To perform a 
comparative analysis, it is important to consider the following questions for Indonesia and China: 
1)
What are the considerations or reasons for SOE reform?
2)
Have there been changes in governance as consequence of reform?
3)
What are the major financial management and operational changes within the SOEs?

are greater (Lin and Zheng, 2020). While in China performance contracts have been introduced to measure SOE 
performance, such mechanism is not yet present in Indonesia. It is therefore not possible to perform comparative 
analysis of SOE performance, particularly efficiency in both countries.

As the research is quantitative research, there are no applicable numerical analysis.  
 
5.2 Graphical Results  
There are no graphical results from numerical analysis. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
There are no proposed improvements to the analysis. 
 
5.4 Validation  
There is no statistical validation which is applicable to this research.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The research began with attempting to draw a correlation between changes in leadership, changes in economic setting 
to the need and immediacy of reform. While in 2010-2020 both Indonesia and China underwent political leadership 
changes, reform history has begun prior to their election and there had been little correlation with the motivation for 
reform. The changes in political economic settings, however, had altered the direction and the manner of the reforms. 
President Xi Jinping had instructed SOEs to be the center of innovation while Indonesian SOEs are expected by 
President Joko Widodo to propel growth in the infrastructure sector. In China state influence has been diluted, as a 
supervisory commission is created to monitor performance, and alignment to party policies are ensured through 
selection of top individuals. In Indonesia this is not the case. The Chinese SOE reform strategy has conceivably 
contributed to better SOE performance – domestically and internationally, while Indonesia needs to introduce some 
measurement of performance.

Abstract 
This paper elaborates on recent studies on renewable energy (solar, bamboo, general RE) in both Indonesia and 
Malaysia. A series of pertinent studies are identified, and findings and approaches of past publications are reported in 
this study. The studies are then classified according to the context/theme and focus/approach to form a literature 
matrix. For the focus/approach, three groups of studies are observed, namely: empirical/experimental study (focusing 
on technology development), exploratory study (focusing on drivers and impediments), and explanatory study 
(focusing on demand/supply/impact). The matrix indicates that: research on renewable energy in Indonesia and 
Malaysia is still limited. The implementation of renewable energy technology needs to be studied in order to be carried 
out effectively. The direction of further research proposed by the researcher is expected to broaden the understanding 
of renewable energy in Indonesia and Malaysia.

1. Introduction
Energy generated from renewable sources supply 14% of the total world energy demand (UNDP, 2000). ASEAN is a 
regional organization composed of ten countries in Southeast Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, 
Vietnam, Singapore, Laos, Cambodia and Brunei. ASEAN aims to accelerate economic growth, social progress and 
cultural development and to promote regional peace and stability (H. C. Lau et al., 2022). The member countries of 
the Southeast Asia region have rich renewable energy sources such as wind energy, biomass and sun (Erdiwansyah et 
al., 2019). Energy from solar power and biomass (especially bamboo) can be developed in the future as a potential in 
ASEAN countries, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia (Shah et al., 2021). 
Indonesia is a large archipelago with 17,504 islands (Winarno dkk., 2017). A total population of 270.20 million people 
with a productive age (15-64 years) features a portion of 70.72%; Indonesia is undoubtedly a large country (Badan 
Pusat Statistik, 2021). Indonesia possesses renewable energy such as wind energy, solar energy, water energy, and 
waste energy. However, Indonesia's number of renewable energy users is minimal (Udin, 2020). With so much 
renewable energy potential in Indonesia, it may be necessary for the public to be aware of the importance of sustainable 
energy. Awareness is essential for the sustainability of the next generation of the nation. Indonesia, especially in the 
energy sector, faces several challenges in terms of sustainable development. The industry still relies on conventional 
energy, although the potential for renewable or alternative energy is enormous. In 2014, Indonesia's total fossil fuel 
consumption reached 1.358 billion SBM, equivalent to 96% of full primary energy use (National Energy Council, 
2015). Energy use subsidies also cause problems in the country's finances; in 2014, the Indonesian government

Abstract 
Nowadays, there are so many interactive web-based applications or mobile app tools as a promising option for 
Mandarin instruction in higher education. One of the examples is the Classkick application learning media. The use 
of Classkick is usually for design exercises and assignments to practice and improve students in learning Mandarin 
language. This study aims to identify the students’ responses after a semester experience using Classkick as a learning 
media in Mandarin language class and the findings hopefully can help teachers design more effective learning using 
Classkick application. The method of this study is quantitative research and adapted Yanqun (2009) five characteristics 
of learning media to design a questionnaire as the instrument to collect the data. The results of this study showed that 
Classkick application conforms to Yanqun (2009) five characteristics of learning media. Overall students agreed to 
use Classkick as a learning media in their Mandarin lesson to practice and improve their Mandarin language skills.

1. Introduction
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in all education in schools must be carried out online at home. The 
teacher must begin to learn and master technologies that can support effective learning carried out online. The 
technology that can bring teachers and students together in the learning activity is through a video-conferencing 
application. In the process of online class, the problem that teachers faced is mostly students because of privacy matters 
or Wi-Fi signals not stable, they ask permission from the teacher to off Cam during the online class. The teacher also 
finds that students hardly focus on the learning activity, teacher needs to ask many times for students to respond or 
not respond at all. Difficulties in monitoring and keeping students focused and active in learning are the main problem 
during online learning. This situation makes it difficult for teachers to provide students with effective learning 
activities to achieve learning objectives. Meanwhile, achieving learning objective it’s takes more effort and 
cooperation from both teachers and students. So, teachers need to design a learning framework according to the 
learning objective, and the teaching methods, and techniques that are used aim to make the students more active and 
more initiative in following the directions from the teacher in the learning process (Xun 2009: 346). Therefore, 
teachers need technologies that can support the online learning process to achieve learning objectives and practice 
students’ language skills. These technologies can play an important and facilitating role in monitor each student’s 
work and engagement in and out of the classroom, for example, Apple Classroom, Google Classroom, Google docs, 
Classflow, Classkick etc (Moloney and Xu 2018:86).  
Nowadays the number of learning application technology developments has started to emerge since online learning 
which aims to support online learning becomes more interesting so that it can attract students' interest to stay focused 
on following lessons. From the results of several studies, it is stated that the use of learning applications as learning

finish the exercises very well. For the lowest mean value goes to ""I can ask the teacher directly or non-directly through 
Classkick"" with the mean value of 3.81. Some of the respondent disagreed that they can ask the lecturer directly or 
non-directly through Classkick. Therefore, lecturer should give more instruction about how to use the feedback 
features so students understand how to used it and aware about it. Overall component mean value in interaction 
characteristic still indicates on average the respondents strongly agreed that all component is useful.

improve my writing skill” with the mean value of 3.79. This mean value result same with the Integrity “I can practice 
my Mandarin writing skills through Classkick” component. This shows the respondent disagreed that they can practice 
Chinese writing through Classkick. Therefore, lecturer can design more exercises for practice writing skill, so students 
can improve their Chinese writing skill. Overall component mean value in effectiveness characteristic still indicates 
on average the respondents strongly agreed that all component is useful 
6. Conclusion
This study result show that overall students agreed using Classkick as a learning media in their Mandarin lesson. 
Classkick conform to Yanqun (2009) five characteristics of learning media. This effective learning media are ease to 
access, can help teacher provide more varied exercise according to the learning material.  Teacher also can give tutor 
and feedback that can help students understand and finish the exercises very well. By doing exercises though Classkick 
Application can improve students Mandarin language skill. From this study found out Classkick application can be a 
promising option for Mandarin instruction in higher education.

Abstract 
Today, the widening and complexity of supply chains and the fact that risks cause serious disruptions have caused 
academicians and practitioners to show interest in studies within the scope of supply chain risk management. In this 
framework, supply chain risk management is becoming increasingly important and processes are being managed with 
many new techniques. Recent research shows that artificial intelligence techniques are increasingly used in supply 
chain risk management. As a result of the use of artificial intelligence in supply chain risk management, it has been 
observed that changes occur especially in functioning and dynamics. Options such as driverless vehicles that emerged 
with artificial intelligence, robots used in storage and shelves, and the easy use of large data in the system ensure that 
errors in supply chains are minimized. Within the scope of supply chain risk management, it is possible for businesses 
to identify and evaluate risks and determine appropriate risk reduction strategies with the help of artificial intelligence 
techniques. In this study, it is aimed to examine in detail the artificial intelligence techniques used in supply chain risk 
management. In this context, expert systems, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm and machine 
learning techniques are examined in detail. Then, these techniques were compared with each other and evaluations 
were made about which artificial intelligence technique would be more effective in which problems. In the conclusion 
part, artificial intelligence techniques that should be applied according to the problem types and some suggestions for 
future studies are presented.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management; in order to gain competitive advantage by adding additional value to the product or service 
and to ensure customer satisfaction, all activities (transportation, production, raw material and material storage, 
stocking of finished products) in the process from the first supplier to the last customer are effectively planned, 
implemented, motivated and controlled consists of by intermediaries. Risk is the uncertainty surrounding future events 
and consequences. Businesses are becoming more sensitive to risks due to reasons such as the globalization of supply 
chains, the increase in product diversity, the decrease in the number of suppliers, the increase in the dependence of 
companies on each other, the increase in customer expectations and the shortening of delivery times. Businesses facing 
high environmental uncertainty are faced with risks such as delays in production and delivery as well as disruptions 
in supply. 
Today, it is seen that globalization, digitalization, competitive conditions, ever-increasing relations between supply 
chain partners and developing technology make supply chains more and more complex day by day. While this situation

Considering today's competitive conditions, supply chain risk management is one of the important issues that business 
managers and academicians should focus on. Using artificial intelligence techniques in supply chain risk management, 
it is extremely important for the continuity of the enterprises to anticipate the risks that the enterprises may face and 
take precautions.

Abstract 
Financial statements contain company information from a financial perspective that can be used as a basis for decision-
making. One of the characteristics is that quality financial reports must have been timely so that the information 
contained can be useful. Timely submission of financial reports is one of the company's responsibilities to the public, 
investors, and other related parties. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the audit committee, public 
ownership, independent commissioners, the operational complexity, and the age of the company on the timeliness of 
submitting financial statements, both simultaneously and partially. The population of this study is the consumer 
cyclical sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. Purposive sampling was 
utilized as the sampling method in this study. 55 companies composed the study's sample. Using SPSS version 25, 
descriptive analysis, and logistic regression analysis are the data analysis techniques used. According to the study's 
findings, the audit committee, public ownership, independent commissioners, the operational complexity, and the 
company age all have an impact on the timeliness of submitting financial statements.  Partially, he the audit committee, 
public ownership, and independent commissioners all have a significant negative effect on the timeliness of submitting 
financial statements. Then, the operational complexity and the company age have no significant effect on the 
timeliness of financial statement submission.

1. Introduction
Accurate and unbiased information is a major component of the decision-making process in business activities. One 
of this information can be seen in financial statement, which are used by a variety of parties including investors, 
creditors, the government, and the citizens (Martha & Gina, 2021). Financial statements are the result of the accounting 
cycle that sums up the state of the business. Based on Financial Accounting Standards (SAK), financial statements 
presented to the public must have a quality that consists of understandability, relevance, materiality, reliability, sound 
judgment, completeness, a comparable, timely, balance between costs, and benefits, and neutral. 
Timeliness is one of the qualitative characteristics of financial statements that have an impact on the level of benefits 
and value of the financial statements (Fitriyani & Lestari, 2021). Every firm listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
shall timely submit an annual financial statement which has been externally audited by an auditor. The annual financial 
report must be submitted no later than the third month's end or 90 days following the end of the financial statement 
date. If that day is a holiday, the business must submit it the next business day. Regarding the Submission of Periodic 
Financial Reports of Issuers, Bapepam, and LK Regulation No. X.K.2 Number: KEP-346/BL/2011, contains 
regulations on this. However, several businesses continue to file financial reports after the deadline. This is a result of 
the business’s internal circumstances and/or the state of the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread the globe 
over the past two years. The productivity level of various business lines has decreased, one of them is tourism.

of this study are consistent with those of Siswantoro (2021) and Avkarina et al. (2021), who found no significant 
relationship between a company's age and the timeliness of submitting financial statements. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the audit committee, public ownership, independent 
commissioners, the operational complexity, and company age on the timeliness of submitting financial statements, 
both simultaneously and partially in consumer cyclical sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for 
the 2016-2020 period. The sample in this study was 55 companies with 5 years research period and total of 255 
observation units processed. Due to the presence of 20 units which were outlier data so that they were removed during 
the test. Based on the findings of the research, five independent variables in this study have an impact on the timely 
submission of financial reports simultaneously. Partially, Audit committee, Public Ownership, and Independent 
Commissioners have a significant negative effect on the timeliness of submitting financial statements. While the 
Operational Complexity and Company Age have no significant impact on the timeliness of submitting financial 
statements. 
 
The novelty of this study is believed by the author to contribute to advancing the current literature on financial studies 
and company performance and can be useful for business practitioners to apply. Companies are expected to pay more 
attention to applicable regulations for business activities to run smoothly and receive positive responses from all 
parties involved. There is still 69.7% of variables that can explain the timely submission of financial statements, it is 
suggested that future research consider other variables that are not included in this study. Author suggests using 
qualitative data such as interviews with management regarding the submission of financial statement and other 
variables not in this study. This research has limitations and is expected to be an idea for further research. The 
independent variable in this study focuses on the company's internal parties as managers and the external parties are 
only public ownership. It is hoped that external parties and other internal parties can be included in future research.

Abstract 
Transfer pricing is a policy used to decide the transfer price for a transaction with a special relationship. Transactions 
happen between related parties such as sales or purchases of goods, services, intangible assets, or financial 
transactions. This action relates to transactions between companies and unique relationships owned by these 
companies. This study aims to determine the effect of intangible assets, foreign ownership, and profitability on transfer 
pricing indications simultaneously and partially in mining sector companies listed on the IDX from 2016 to 2020. The 
technique used in sample collection uses the purposive sampling technique with a total of 80 observations from 16 
company samples. The research method used is quantitative with logistic regression analysis techniques. The results 
show that the variables of intangible assets, foreign ownership, and profitability simultaneously affect the indication 
of transfer pricing. Partially, the variables intangible assets and profitability have a positive effect on transfer pricing 
indications and foreign ownership variables negatively affect transfer pricing indications for mining sector companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for the period 2016 to 2020. Based on the results of this study, further 
researchers are expected to be able to conduct research by adding a research period and using other independent 
variables such as multinationalism, leverage and audit quality that can influence transfer pricing indications. Company 
management and regulators can pay attention to any policies that have been set regarding indications of transfer pricing 
through intangible assets, foreign ownership and profitability in making every decision.

1. Introduction
The principle of obtaining maximum, profit or profit for subsidiaries or branches of the company will undoubtedly 
cause problems when determining the transfer price of commodities that can be manipulated. Information asymmetry 
related to the determination of the transfer price is found in the company's management and shareholders as agents 
and principals in the agency. Management as an agent, in this case, can determine the transfer price for its interests to 
earn a profit and, of course, has the right to act in every transaction that occurs in the company (Wulandari et al., 
2021). This, triggers transfer pricing. Transfer pricing is a policy used to decide the transfer price for a transaction 
with a special relationship (Pohan, 2019). Transactions between related parties like sales or purchases of goods,

Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022

have been set regarding indications of transfer pricing through intangible assets, foreign ownership and profitability 
in making every decision. 
 
5.4 Validation 
Effect of Intangible Assets on Transfer Pricing Indications 
The variable of intangible assets affects the indication of transfer pricing because the absence of the physical form of 
the asset affects the value of the asset which is difficult to identify. Intangible assets are an obligation for the company 
to be able to carry out the company's operational activities in obtaining profits. Companies can develop business lines 
and take advantage of parties to be able to do the above to parties in low tax areas. The value of large intangible assets 
will be difficult to identify and thus will affect the company's business activities and the difference between the price 
at the time of purchase and the market price. Companies that evaluate intangible assets and have special relationships 
with other companies will tend to take transfer pricing actions through strategic policies in providing decisions related 
to transfer prices. Therefore, companies need to understand the regulations related to intangible assets listed in PP 
PER-32/PJ/2011 which explains the application of the principle of fairness and business practice to intangible assets. 
The results of the study are in line with the results of research conducted by Novira et al., (2020) and Yusmaniarti et 
al., (2021) that intangible assets affect the company's indications of transfer pricing. 
 
Effect of Foreign Ownership on Transfer Pricing Indications 
The variable of foreign ownership affects the indication of transfer pricing because large foreign share ownership will 
get more supervision from the company's management to be able to carry out transfer pricing actions. Foreign 
ownership creates the potential for controlling shareholders to become deeply involved in the management of the 
company and gain power and incentives to be able to negotiate and promote corporate contracts with stakeholders. 
Foreign controlling shareholders can purchase products from controlled companies at low or unreasonable prices so 
as to provide unilateral benefits. Based on agency theory, in fulfilling a cooperation contract that has been made, the 
shareholders will be willing to provide costs to the company to be able to provide internal control in anticipating 
transfer pricing actions that can cause losses to the company. This is done by shareholders to be able to monitor every 
sale and purchase transaction to affiliates in providing profits. If it does not provide a profit, then the company tends 
not to do transfer pricing. The results of this study are in line with the results of research conducted by Nofiyanti et 
al., (2021), Prananda & Nur Triyanto (2020), Supriyati et al., (2021), and Yanti & Pratiwi, (2021) that foreign 
ownership has an effect on indications companies in conducting transfer pricing. 
 
Effect of Profitability on Transfer Pricing Indications 
The variables of profitability affect the indication of transfer pricing because profitability as a measure in assessing 
the company's ability to earn profits to attract investors, the effectiveness and efficiency of the company's management 
can be seen through the performance of earning profits through the assets used. Production carried out by the company 
can affect the level of company profits through the high selling price of the product. The high level of profit will affect 
the company's obligation to pay the tax burden that will be obtained. This affects companies in carrying out transfer 
pricing actions by diverting profits to affiliated companies in low-tax areas through transfer pricing. The company's 
management can reduce tax costs through these actions. This is in line with the impact of agency theory related to 
differences in goals in obtaining individual interests. The company will earn high profits and affect state revenue 
losses through tax payments with low reported profits so that the tax burden obtained is low. The results of this study 
are in line with the results of research conducted by Diana Sari (2021), Mineri & Paramitha (2021), and Yusmaniarti 
et al., (2021) that profitability affects the company's indications of transfer pricing. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results of this study show that the variables of intangible assets, foreign ownership, and profitability 
simultaneously affect the indication of transfer pricing. Partially, the variables intangible assets and profitability have 
a positive effect on transfer pricing indications and foreign ownership variables negatively affect transfer pricing 
indications for mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for the period 2016 to 2020. 
Based on the results of this study, further researchers are expected to be able to conduct research by adding a research 
period and using other independent variables such as multinationalism, leverage and audit quality that can influence 
transfer pricing indications. Company management and regulators can pay attention to any policies that have been set 
regarding indications of transfer pricing through intangible assets, foreign ownership and profitability in making every 
decision.

Estimating Project Costs and Time under Uncertainties: A 
Stochastic Model for Inflation and Supply Changes During 
and After the Covid19 Pandemic

Abstract 
Rising inflation rates have influenced the profitability of many ongoing projects in many economies in 2022. In 
addition, supply shortages due to the Covid19 pandemic have delayed many projects. Accurate estimation of project 
time and costs for a project bid in such uncertainties minimizes the risks of financial losses incurred in an awarded 
project. Conversely, the failure to anticipate the changes in prices and supplies in estimation models decreases the 
profitability and continuance of awarded projects, leading to some ripple effects in society. This paper examines the 
stochastic model to include inflation and supply shortage in estimation models. It suggests a solution for project 
estimators to estimate project costs and time more accurately, given the risks of rising inflation and supply shortage.

Risk, Estimation, Stochastic, Project 
1. Introduction
Accurate estimation of project time and costs for a project bid in uncertainties minimizes the risks of financial losses 
incurred in an awarded project (Rostami & Oduoza, 2017). To achieve this risk minimization objective, project 
planners add inflation changes in the discount rates to calculate net present values (NPV) (Visconti, 2012). From 2021 
to 2022, the soaring inflation reduced the present values of investment projects (Figure 1). 
The question raised here is how cost estimators can prepare accurate cost estimates. On the side of contractors, how 
can they offer a bidding price that maximizes the expected values of their bid projects? Specifically, what discount 
rate can be used in a project considering the inflation rate? What are the different outcomes for strategies dealing with 
inflation to generate an optimal value? 
In the transport infrastructure projects, the private enterprises canceled their projects mainly because their forecast 
usage of the project roads was too optimistic (Demirel et al., 2022; Harris et al., 2003). This requires the planner to 
prepare the other scenarios: pessimistic and most likely events. According to a World Bank report (Harris et al., 2003), 
for the period 1990-2001, 73% of private infrastructure projects in developing countries were undergoing 
renegotiation in concessions or contracts due to unforeseen lost revenue. 
Of the reasons why the private sector cancelled public-private partnership project, the financial loss is apparent due to 
surging inflation (Ruiz Díaz, 2020). Moro Visconti (2012, p. 206) states that ""unless properly contracted, monitored 
and managed, inflation may so have a disrupting and unbalanced impact"" on projects (Visconti, 2012). Therefore, cost 
estimators are supposed to include inflation changes in their formula for net present value. This paper examines a 
stochastic model for project selection, which helps managers to evaluate project risks related to the inflation rate, 
which influences the expenditures of the awarded project. (Figure 1)

5. Conclusion
Budget or cost-effectiveness is crucial in projects with budget constraints. It refers to achieving the project objectives 
at minimal costs (Visconti, 2012). However, when the annual project costs and inflation increase, the budget is 
insufficient to complete the project within the life cycle. Specifically, suppose the project customer has planned an 
annual payment of $20,000 for a project contractor. In that case, a reserve fund of $100,000 for the project is 
insufficient due to changes in yearly cost flows and inflation rate. The simulation results in this paper indicate that 
three-estimate costs (min, most likely, max costs) and stochastic inflation rates, assumed to have a normal distribution 
(i.e., mean of 3% with 0.003 standard deviation) increase the total project cost by 33%. This result is close to the 
allowable contingency of 35% as suggested by Project Management Institute. This finding is helpful for a contract 
estimator in hedging against inflation and cost changes. Alternatively, the project owner should add more cash to the 
future annual payments to adjust for increasing inflation rate instead of planning a fixed annual payment for the 
contractor. The cost estimator should also consider the pessimistic scenario of maximum annual costs due to any 
uncertainty of input prices.

Abstract 
Bond ratings are an indicator of the rating agency's assessment of the relative performance of contract-based debt 
issuers in meeting their contractual obligations. Bond ratings describe the prospects for the reliability and viability of 
the bonds purchased. The purpose of this research to analyze and examine the effect of Liquidity Ratio, Activity Ratio, 
CEO POWER and Economic freedom on Bond Rating (Empirical Study on Non-Financial Companies Rated by PT. 
Pemeringkat Efek Indonesia 2016-2020). Population in this study are non-financial company listed in the Indonesia 
Bond Market Directory and rated by PT PEFINDO in 2016 – 2020. The sampling technique used was purposive 
sampling and obtained 7 companies in non-financial company listed in the Indonesia Bond Market Directory and rated 
by PT PEFINDO with an observation period of five years so that 35 samples were obtained in this study. The data 
analysis method in this study is logistic regression analysis with SPSS 25. The findings of this study are partially 
activity ratio has a significant negative effect on bond rating, while liquidity ratio, CEO power and economic freedom 
does not affect on bond rating. However, simultaneously show that liquidity ratio, activity ratio, CEO power and 
economic freedom on bond rating have a significant effect on bond rating. The conclusion of this study provides some 
support and consideration for company management to increase the total amount of assets.

1. Introduction
Bonds are securities that are sold to the public with various regulations governing the nominal value, interest rate, 
time period, name of the issuer, and other matters regulated in the law passed by the Fahmi and lavianti Institution, 
(2011:116). The advantage of bonds is to provide yields in the form of periodic coupons, the principal is paid on time 
with a specified maturity. Another benefit of a bondholder is that if the company is liquidated, it has priority over the 
assets owned by the company (Widiastuti and Rahyuda, 2016). Even though bonds are a safe investment, investors 
must be aware of the risk of not fulfilling the promise of the bond issuer, namely the risk of the bond issuer failing to 
pay and/or returning the bond principal at maturity (Sejati, 2010). Therefore, before deciding to invest in a company's 
bonds, investors need to have information to consider when deciding to invest. 
Bond ratings indicate a measure of the risk or safety of the bonds issued and provide an informative statement and 
signal the likelihood of a company defaulting. The security of a bond is represented by the company's ability to pay 
interest and principal loans so that investors can obtain information about bond ratings using the services of bond

Effect of CEO Power on Rating Bond 
The higher the Ceo Power, the lower the bond rating, conversely, the lower the Ceo Power value, the higher the bond 
rating. But the results of the regression analysis prove that high or low CEO power does not affect bond ratings. This 
is explained by the descriptive results of CEO Power with the CEO Pay Slice proxy which shows that there are 24 
samples that have CEO Power values below the average. Of the 24 samples, there are 15 samples (42%) that have a 
high investment bond rating. The sample company that has a CEO Power value below the average is PT. Angkasa 
Pura I, PT Angkasa Pura II, PT Jasa Marga Tbk and PT Kereta Api Indonesia. The sample company has a CEO pay 
slice which is relatively the same at every level, because the sample company that has CEO Power below the average 
is a BUMN company that goes public, one of its goals is and according to the UUD No. 19 of 2003 article 2 BUMN 
in the form of a limited liability company that its capital is divided into shares which are wholly or at least 51% (fifty 
one percent) of the shares are owned by the Republic of Indonesia whose main purpose is to pursue profit, so that it 
is required to continue to achieve its strategic goals. So the slice pay has no effect, because the CEO with a larger 
salary does not affect the company's good performance in achieving the company's target so that the CEO's salary 
does not affect the company in increasing the bond rating. 
 
Effect of Economic Freedom on Rating Bond 
The higher the economic freedom, the lower the bond rating will be, conversely, the lower the economic freedom 
value, the higher the bond rating will be. However, the results of the regression analysis prove that high or low 
economic freedom has no effect on bond ratings. This is explained by the descriptive results of economic freedom 
with the unemployment rate proxy which shows that there are 28 samples that have below average unemployment 
values. Of the 28 samples, there are 20 samples (57%) that have a high investment bond rating. This is because of 
covid 19, there will be more open unemployment and some companies have terminated employment with employees, 
which resulted in a decrease in people's income, but the increase or decrease in income does not affect people's 
investment habits, this can be seen from the average increase in the number of investors. from 2018 to 2021 by 42% 
with the lowest increase in 2020 to 2021 this shows that investor interest in the capital market is still high. The results 
of this study show that economic freedom has no effect because high and low unemployment cannot project bond 
ratings.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The findings of this study are partially activity ratio has a significant negative effect on bond rating, while liquidity 
ratio, CEO power and economic freedom does not affect on bond rating. However, simultaneously show that liquidity 
ratio, activity ratio, CEO power and economic freedom on bond rating have a significant effect on bond rating. The 
conclusion of this study provides some support and consideration for company management to increase the total 
amount of assets

Abstract 
This research aim to study the effect of web design quality, sales promotion, and order fulfillment on repurchase 
intention with customer satisfaction as a mediating variable. This phenomenon of the e-commerce marketplace 
transaction value that continue to increase during 2017-2020 period in Indonesia. This increase on e-commerce 
marketplace transaction value triggered by the covid-19 pandemic that force the digitalization on almost all living 
aspects, especially on commerce activities. Commerce activities on e-commerce marketplace technically are the 
same as conventional commerce, where seller aim to achieve repurchase intention through the customer satisfaction. 
There are several things that have influence on these two variables. Several factors including; web design quality, 
sales promotion, and order fulfillment. All of those factors are very important for the e-commerce marketplace. 
Therefore, the author aims to determine the relationship between the variables of web design quality, sales 
promotion, and order fulfillment on repurchase intention with customer satisfaction as a mediating variable.The 
method used in this research is Partial Least Square, and tool used in this research is WarpPLS version 7.0. The 
result of the research found out positive and significant impact on all of the variables studied in this research.

Based on Table 9, the R square values of Customer Satisfaction (CS), and Repurchase Intention (RI) are 0.675, and 
0.673 respectively. These values indicate that Customer Satisfaction (CS) explained by the Website Design Quality, 
Sales Promotion, and Order Fulfillment variables of 67.5%. Meanwhile the Repurchase Intention (RI) explained by 
Customer Satisfaction (CS) variables of 67.3%. The Q square value of both Customer Satisfaction, and Repurchase 
Intention are 0.675, and 0.670 respectively, which indicate that both variable has good predictive ability. 
5.3 Discussion 
This research focused on studying 5 hypotheses. Specifically this hypotheses testing carried out with the 
significance level of 5%. The hypotheses could be accepted when p-value < 0.05, otherwise when p-value > 0.05 the 
hypotheses will be rejected. 
Based on Table 8, Web Design Quality (WD) has positive effect on Customer Satisfaction (CS) with the coefficient 
of 0.256 (p-value <0.001). This mean that H1 is accepted, and consistent with the result of previous study done by 
Wilson et al. (2019). Rahi et al. (2020) also found significant effect on web design quality and customer satisfaction. 
Previous study conducted by Wibowo et al. (2019) found the same result as the others regarding significant effect of 
web design on customer satisfaction. 
Sales Promotion (SP) has positive effect on Customer Satisfaction (CS) with the coefficient of 0.141 (p-value 
0.007). This mean that H2 is accepted, and consistent with the result of previous study done by Antara and Rastini 
(2022) who found that the sales promotion has a significant effect on customer satisfaction. Alvian and Prabawani 
(2020) in their research also found that sales promotion has a good influence on customer satisfaction. Previous 
research by Kresna and Suryawardani (2020) also found an influence between sales promotion and customer 
satisfaction. 
Order Fulfillment (OF) has positive effect on Customer Satisfaction (CS) with the coefficient of 0.498 (p-value 
<0.001). This mean that H3 is accepted, and consistent with the result of previous study done by Camilleri (2021) 
that found order fulfillment has a positive effect on customer satisfaction. Jain et al. (2017) found the same result of 
order fulfillment has an influence on customer satisfaction. Pham and Ahammad (2017) also found a strong 
influence of order fulfillment on customer satisfaction. 
Customer Satisfaction (CS) has positive effect on Repurchase Intention (RI) with the coefficient of 0.821 (p-value 
<0.001). This mean that H4 is accepted, and consistent with the result of previous study done by Napitupulu, and 
Siahaya (2022) found that customer satisfaction has a positive effect on repurchase intention. Research on the 
relationship between customer satisfaction and repurchase intention is also supported by two previous studies 
conducted by Wilson et al. (2019), and Prayogi and Nursaidah (2021) who found similar results. 
6. Conclusion
Main goal of this study is to determine the effect of web design quality, sales promotion, order fulfillment on 
repurchase intention with customer satisfaction as mediating variable. The hypotheses testing shown that all of the 
proposed hypotheses passed the test. All of the variables and research models has good ability to predict the 
phenomenon.

Abstract 
This study aims to provide a basis for households that relates the effectiveness of sustainable fertilizers to the 
vegetation growth of sweet potatoes. The proponents analyzed the vegetative growth results of sweet potato using 
100g, 200g, and 300g of eggshells and 158g, 316g, and 474g of rice husks, comparing it to commercially available 
urea fertilizer with 11.34g and no fertilizer. The factors used to measure sweet potatoes’ vegetative growth were Vine 
Length, Leaf Length and Width, and their overall acceptability through taste test surveys. Using the Kruskal-Wallis 
Test and ANOVA Single Factor, results showed that the highest amount of Eggshell and Rice Husk fertilizer, 300 g, 
and 474 g, respectively, produced the highest mean value of leaf and width, as well as vine length. However, among 
the four fertilizers, there is no statistically significant difference in the overall vegetative growth of the sweet potato. 
Also, in the sensory evaluation, results suggest no statistically significant difference in using any fertilizers on the 
color, taste, aroma, mouthfeel, and overall acceptability of the Sweet Potato Tops. However, the Kruskal-Wallis tests 
indicate urea fertilizer has the highest rating regarding mouthfeel and overall acceptability. Finally, the Eggshell, Rice 
Husk, and no fertilizer received the highest mean rating in color, taste, and aroma. With this, the proponents 
recommend studying the right and proper usage of Urea Fertilizer to ensure its safety and effectiveness as it had the 
most favorable results.

1.0 Introduction 
The Philippines has abundant agricultural land. Food availability is affected by both controllable and uncontrollable 
external interruptions. In 2020, the FAO reported the three-year average number of moderately and severely food 
insecure Filipinos. In 2017-2019, 55.3% of the Filipino population, or 59 million people, were moderately or severely 
food insecure. The country suffers from longtime neglect of the agriculture sector and unprecedented hunger and 
economic hardships due to COVID-19. Natural disasters contribute to Filipino food insecurity. Due to its location, the 
country is prone to strong typhoons and droughts. The typhoon Goni in 2020 devastated Catanduanes' fisheries, rice, 
and vegetable plantations threatening the farmers' food security, nutrition, and livelihoods (Food and Agriculture 
Organization, 2020). Extended displacement due to catastrophic occurrences has become more common, affecting the 
poor and vulnerable who lack options or means to keep them out of congested evacuation centers without enough food 
and sanitation, threatening their nutritional well-being.

fertilizers can be studied to see whether an even higher amount will produce better results. The proponents also suggest 
utilizing more bottomless pots to give plant roots more space, making growth easier. It is proposed to use eggshell 
tea, composted rice husk, and complete fertilizer with 14-14-14 NPK content since eggshell tea fertilizer performs 
better than crushed eggshell in a short period (Wijaya, 2019) and composted rice husk fertilizer is a nutrient-dense, 
biodegradable product (Badar, 2014). A greater sample size of sweet potato plants would yield more accurate and 
representative results. This lets researchers use approaches other than Kruskal Wallis.

Abstract 
Telemedicine development. Such developments are new in Indonesia, so that opening up opportunities for potential 
unprepared legal regulations that cause problems in terms of the construction of the underlying agreement and 
liability to patients as consumers of digital platforms and doctor who are binding to providing these services. This 
paper answers questions about these two things. The results of the study show that the triangular agreement between 
patients, doctors, and digital platform providers is a teleconsultation agreement, which is a form of mix agreement 
between a standard of therapeutic agreement, a standard of use application agreement and partnership of health 
sevice provider agreement that utilizes digital technology. In this case, there is the main agreement and an 
accompanying agreement. The main agreement is a therapeutic agreement between a doctor and a patient and the 
accompanying agreement is a standard agreement that binds all three parties. In the event of a violation of the 
patient's rights, both the doctor and the platform provider can be held responsible together, which is known as joint 
liability.

1) Introduction
Rapid technological developments have an effect on all sectors, unexpectedly in the health sector. One form of 
revolution in the field of health today is treatment from distance called telemedicine. In health law in Indonesia the 
definition of telemedicine is given in Minister of Health Regulation No. of 2019. In this regulation, telemedicine is 
defined as the provision of health services remotely by health professionals using information and communication 
technology, including the exchange of information on diagnosis, treatment, prevention of disease and injury, 
research and evaluation and continuing education of health service providers for the benefit of improving individual 
and public health. From this understanding, the authors simply conclude that telemedicine is a technology used for 
patients to make a diagnosis, treatment, and consultation efforts, in this case carried out remotely. 
This phenomenon when viewed from a legal perspective will look unique, namely that there is something complex 
in telemedicine. Due to the emergence of the platform, changing the pattern of the doctor-patient relationship that 
was previously direct, now becomes indirect and the platform becomes a party that functions as a liaison or means 
of providing facilities for doctors and patients to connect with each other. Therefore, in telemedicine, which is based 
on a platform, the parties involved do not only number two but also become three parties along with the agreement 
that becomes complex.

even though in practice a doctor and platform are only agents and principals and there is a disclaimer stating the 
platform transfers responsibility. However, consumers see them as one unit, and for accountability according to what 
they are part of. Consumers in this case can sue jointly and severally with the doctor as defendant 1 and the platform 
as defendant 2. 
 
In practice this doctrine was used when there was a case experienced by John Lynn Stephens in 1981, Oklahoma, 
United States. In this case, Stephen sued L&A Tire Company with several parties and one of them was Conoc, Inc. 
for the loss he suffered, the loss referred to in the form of accidental injury due to the tires he just bought. In that 
case, the judge who presided over the trial saw the problem from the consumer's point of view. With the intent 
carried out by the L&A Tire Company in the eyes of Stephens and the consumer at large is a representation of the 
quality of the work of Conoc Inc. Thus, the judge views that they are an integral part of their accountability to 
consumers (Justia us law Lee v Helmco, Inc.). And the second case. In the world of applied health, in America at 
that time the Supreme Court of Putnam Country decided based on the Ostensible Agency Doctrine at the Hudson 
Hospital Center. The problem is with an anesthesiologist who causes the patient to be injured. In general, hospitals 
cannot be held responsible for someone who is not a hospital employee, but the hospital is categorized as one of a 
group of independent contractors or principals. For this reason, the representative's responsibility for medical 
malpractice is assigned to anesthesiologists under the Ostensible Agency Doctrine. The judge considered that 
consumers in general would be convinced and impressed that the anesthesiologist had the authority to act on behalf 
of the hospital. Patients who trust let the anesthesiologist perform the procedure because they believe the 
anesthesiologist works or is provided by the hospital (Justia us law Keesler v Small (ostensible agency)). 
 
The doctor's responsibility is seen from consumer protection. Doctors and patients can be categorized as consumers 
and business actors based on Law no. 8 of 1999, this is because consumers in the world of health are categorized as 
recipients of health services and doctors as providers in therapeutic agreements (Triana, 2007). The patient can sue 
the doctor for the loss caused by an error based on Article 19 paragraph (1), namely the patient can claim 
compensation and claim for compensation based on Article 19 paragraph (2), which can be in the form of a refund 
or replacement of goods and/or compensation. The principle of responsibility adopted according to the law is the 
principle of always being responsible, the perpetrator is always responsible and must prove that he is innocent (Aulia, 
2017). What is meant by proving is by presenting facts to provide certainty to the panel of judges regarding the 
occurrence of an event or legal relationship (Abdul, 2000). This is called a reversed proof system which some 
countries have implemented such as in Europe. 
4. Conclusion 
1) The conclusion that can be drawn is that the agreement that occurs in teleconsultation is unique because there 
are three different parties related to each other and each party has an interrelated agreement. The author constructs 
an electronic consultation agreement, this can be supported by arguments: 
 
1. There are three parties to teleconsultation, namely: doctors, patients, and platforms. 
2.  There are three agreements, standardized therapeutic agreements, standard application use agreements and 
health service provider partnership agreements 
3. The first agreement is a standard agreement on the use of an application that has fulfilled the conditions for 
a valid agreement in accordance with Article 1320 of the Civil Code in this case between doctors, patients 
and the platform. This agreement is written in electronic form which will emphasize that the platform will 
be a liaison between doctors and patients. 
4. The second agreement is a standardized therapeutic agreement as the basis for the relationship between the 
doctor and the patient, even though the two are not face-to-face or face-to-face, because basically when a 
patient sees a doctor to be diagnosed, a therapeutic agreement has occurred even though in this case both 
parties, namely the doctor and the patient brought together or connected by a platform with interactions 
defined by the platform. 
5. Health service provider partnership agreement. This agreement applies between the doctor and the 
partnering platform. Doctors will provide health services by using an application facilitated by the platform. 
6. From the agreement that occurs, it can be seen that the therapeutic agreement is the main agreement because 
the patient's intention from the beginning to take treatment and the standard agreement here binds the parties 
to each other. Like the main agreement when the patient and doctor cancel the therapeutic agreement, the 
additional agreement, namely the standard agreement, will also be canceled. However, patients who make

diagnoses in telemedicine must still meet the requirements in the platform conditions, especially the 
patient's skills when creating an account. 
2) Doctors and the Platform can be held responsible for the losses of patients in teleconsultation based on the 
Ostensible Agency Doctrine because they view one party, namely the principal (platform) and the agent (doctor) 
as a single entity without consumers needing to know the relationship more deeply and clearly, this doctrine was 
born because a consumer cannot see clearly what relationship is going on in a party and because of this the 
consumer finally sees the parties as a single entity. In this case the doctor as an online health service provider 
whose practice is carried out with the platform as a facilitator, consumers will see that the platform can also be 
held accountable even though the relationship between the platform and doctors is limited to principals and 
agents. However, in terms of accountability, it is still carried out according to their respective portions.

Abstract 
This study contributes to the existing literature on capital structure by providing evidence regarding the existence of 
a target capital structure, the estimated speed of adjustment, and the factors influencing it. The concept of speed 
adjustment begins with dynamic trade-off theory with the aim that the company achieves optimal leverage targets. 
This paper aims to examine the determinants of capital structure and speed of adjustment in Indonesia’s Health Sector 
companies. For this purpose, we use the Generalized Method of Moments estimation technique. The results of this 
study indicate that the health sector companies adjust their capital structure towards the optimal capital structure with 
an average adjustment period of 1.17 years. The test results also show that distance and financial deficit/surplus did 
not significantly affect the speed of adjustment of the company’s capital structure. 
Keywords 
Determinants of Capital Structure, Optimal Capital Structure, Generalized Method of Moments, Speed of Adjustment. 
1. Introduction
The Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) states that the health sector is a sector that can survive unfavorable 
economic conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic around the world has made people more aware of the importance of 
medicines, medical devices, and health workers. The pandemic has driven many countries, including Indonesia, to 
invest more in the health sector. Since the COVID-19 cases were found in Indonesia, the demand for vitamins, 
supplements, and medicines has increased to the high-demand category. This moment is an evaluation material for 
Indonesia to continue strengthening the national health industry (BKPM, 2020).

6. Conclusion
There is a capital structure adjustment towards the optimal capital structure for the health sector companies listed on 
the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2016-2020 with an average speed of adjustment of 0.848562 (1 - 151438). 
This value shows that the average company in the health sector takes about 1.17 years (1/0.848562) to adjust the 
optimal capital structure, with adjustments that are still below the optimal debt value. 
Distance from the actual capital structure to the optimal capital structure proved to not affect the speed of capital 
structure adjustment in health sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2016-2020. 
Financial deficit/surplus proved to not affect the speed of capital structure adjustment in health sector companies listed 
on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2016-2020.

Abstract 
This paper will discuss the urgency of regulating nominee practices in Indonesian regulations. Nominee is a name 
borrowing practice whose existence occurs in various transactions in Indonesia, both in Limited Liability 
Companies, Foreign Investment, and Capital Market. This practice is carried out by several parties by borrowing 
second parties, where that second parties will act on his behalf. In Indonesia, the provisions regarding nominees, 
are regulated in several regulations, namely Law No. 40 of 2007 concerning Limited Liability Companies, Law 
No. 25 of 2007 concerning Investment, and Law No. 8 of 1995 concerning Capital Markets. With the occurrence 
of the nominee practices, then the purpose of this paper is to find out how the legal validity in Indonesia regulates 
nominee practices, and whether the practice is allowed or not allowed to be used by interested parties. The method 
used in this research is normative juridical, which is research that refers to the approach of applicable laws and 
regulations. The conclusion of this research is that based on the literature review conducted, a nominee is 
prohibited practice in Indonesia because it’s contrary to Article 1329 of the Indonesia Civil Code concerning the 
validity requirement of the agreement, namely admissible cause. Besides contrary to the Civil Code, nominee 
practices are also prohibited in several laws and regulations on Limited Liability Companies, Investment, and also 
Capital Markets although the regulations are only explicit. In the United States, the nominee practices are allowed, 
with a law regulating it.

Abstract 
This paper aims to develop and validating of measuring tools in occupational, safety and health (OSH) culture. The 
development of the measuring tools is by incorporate the measuring tools for safety culture and safety climate. 
Questionnaire used to measure safety climate while maturity model used to measure safety culture. Measuring OSH 
culture is important for an organization to identify their current state and behavior of the organization’s safety. By 
identifying the current state in the maturity model, organization can plan action to improve their current state or sustain 
their good state. The questionnaire will first develop based on five maturity indicators: (1) information and 
occupational safety, (2) operational learning, (3) involvement, (4) communication, and (5) commitment. After the 
development, the questionnaire needs to be validated by experts in order to ensure their validity and reliability as the 
validity and reliability of the tools might affect the quality of the data obtain. The questionnaire is not ready to be used 
to measure the OSH culture until it is validated. Based on the comments by experts, the improvement and changes 
made to improve the questionnaire. Once the questionnaire got validated by the experts then the questionnaire is ready 
to be use as the measuring tools for OSH culture. 
Keywords 
OSH culture, safety culture, safety climate, questionnaire, maturity model. 
1. Introduction
Occupational, safety and health (OSH) culture is about how an organization’s informal aspects influence OSH in a 
positive or negative way (Eecklelaert et al., 2012). Zwetsloot and Steijger (2013) also defined OSH culture as a culture 
where all members of the organization feel they are responsible for accident and injury prevention, and where this 
responsibility is translated into practice. OSH culture often related with safety culture and safety climate. Both safety 
culture and safety climate are interrelated but somehow different with each other based on most researcher. OSH 
culture requires a broad, holistic understanding of several knowledge domains, including features of risk management, 
information technology, business processes, human resources, personal and property safety, auditing and internal 
control, as well as legal and judicial requirements (Orlando, et al., 2019). 
OSH culture can be measure through the measurement of safety culture and safety climate. This project will focus on 
developing measuring tool to measure and evaluate OSH culture in organization with the incorporate of measuring 
the safety culture, safety climate and implementation of safety culture maturity model. Filho et al. (2011) mentioned 
that an integrated approach to matters of occupational safety, environment and culture represents a great challenge for 
improving workplaces and reducing the number of accidents.

After revised and constructed new questions for the questionnaire based on the comments by experts, the questionnaire 
will need to undergo the validation process again to be validated. The questionnaire will only be ready to be use once 
all questions are validated by experts and confirmed to be good enough to measure the OSH culture in organization 
which then from the results collected through questionnaire can be compare with the maturity model to determine the 
current state of safety of an organization in the maturity model. 
6. Conclusion
Measuring OSH culture through safety culture and safety climate is significant in order to identify the current state 
and behavior of an organization’s safety. Current available measuring tools does not incorporate the measurement of 
safety culture and safety climate thus the development and validating of the measuring tools in this research aims to 
incorporate the questionnaire and maturity model to determine current state of organization’s safety. By determining 
the current state, the organization get to know about their current behavior. With that, the organization can plan for 
any action of improvements or changes to improve their current state by moving to the next level in the maturity model 
or to sustain their current good state. 
To have good and reliable measuring tools, validation from experts is required in order to ensure their validity and 
reliability as the validity and reliability of the tools might affect the quality of the data obtain. The survey's validity is 
determined by how well it captures the outcomes it claims on while the reliability is defined as its consistency where 
every time it is conducted, a reliable survey efficiently evaluates the safety climate. Thus, the measuring tools need to 
be validated before being use to collect the data.

Abstract 
In Indonesia, the GMIS is used as an instrument to determine the implementation of Conflict-of-Interest Transactions 
attended by Independent Shareholders. However, in practice, it is found that there are many weaknesses in the 
implementation of the GMIS, so it becomes questionable whether the GMIS has protected the Independent 
Shareholders by the provisions in Article 11 paragraph (1) POJK No. 42/POJK.04/2020 and has prevented the 
occurrence of violations of Conflict-of-Interest transactions. Thus, research is carried out using a normative juridical 
method through legal comparisons with the United Kingdom as a country that uses the Board of Directors Declaration 
instrument which does not involve shareholders in its approval, but from Directors who do not have a conflict-of-
interest. The Board of Directors' statement is considered to have advantages that the GMIS does not have in terms of 
character, procedures, and approvals. This paper aims to determine whether the instrument of the GMIS has protected 
the Independent Shareholders and to find out whether the Declaration of the Board of Directors can be used as an 
alternative to the GMIS in Indonesia. The results found from this research can be used as a reflection for each 
stakeholder on the Conflict-of-Interest Transaction regarding the instruments used before the Conflict-of-Interest 
Transaction is carried out.

Abstract 
In the Indonesian Capital Market, normatively, the position of independent shareholder in conflict-of-interest 
transaction is as strong party that approves or disapproves the conflict of interest transaction. However, the substance 
of the regulation regarding to conflict of interest transaction from 1991 to 2020 has not protected independent 
shareholders. Where, the approval of independent shareholders is not always identical to their strong position, which 
in practice the Director, Commissioner, or Major Shareholder overrides the provisions of the conflict of interest 
transaction, namely without prior approval from independent shareholders. Apart from that, there are six other factors 
that indicate that independent shareholder in conflict-of-interest transaction have a weak position. The weakness arises 
usually because the independent shareholders only learn about the loss of the transaction after the conflict-of-interest 
transaction has been carried out. These weakness include: 1) the concentrated shareholdings system that adopted by 
indonesia; 2) the difficulty of  Bapepam (now Financial Service Authority) FSA)) to monitor the public company 
before conducting a conflict of interest; 3) the occurrence of nominee practices in conflict of interest transaction; 4) 
no matter how many independent shareholders are present, they are unable to affect the continuity of general meeting 
of shareholder (GMS) and voting keep been carried out; 5) not fulfilling the applicable conflict of interest procedures 
and regulations, especially the approval of independent shareholders in the GMS; and 6) law enforcement against 
public companies who violate the provisions of conflict of interest transaction so far does not provide a deterrent 
effect. Thus, it is urgent for Capital Market regulators to be able to make a clear and specific arrangement for 
independent shareholders to be protected from all transaction decisions containing conflict of interest that are 
dominated by subjective elements of the Board of Directors to the detriment of independent shareholders and the 
company.

This article confirms that a public company conducting a conflict-of-interest transaction is required to use an appraiser 
to determine the fair value of the object of the Conflict-of-Interest Transaction and/or the fairness of the transaction. 
This fairness requires a professional, namely an institution and supporting profession in the Capital Market, one of 
which is an appraiser. The appraiser is a party that can provide an assessment of the company's assets if it has been 
registered with FSA. However, Sri Indrastuti Hadiputranto's opinion is correct, the appraiser itself is less independent, 
it can be selected based on and at the behest of the Board of Directors and its staff, namely the Commissioner and the 
GMS which prioritized the votes of the Major Shareholders. Thus, in terms of fairness determined by the Appraiser, 
the subjectivity between the Appraiser and the Board of Directors and Commissioners is still dominated by the votes 
of the Majority Shareholders and the Appraiser's results are always taken into consideration by the Board of Directors 
even though the value may harm the Independent Shareholders and the Company.  
 
Likewise, law enforcement on violations of the provisions regarding conflict-of-interest transactions is still repressive, 
where the act has occurred first so that the loss has been experienced. Sanctions against the perpetrators of conflict of 
interest transactions can be given after losses have befallen the company and or Independent Shareholders whose 
voices are most decisive towards the implementation of the transaction and sanctions against perpetrators of conflict 
of interest transactions are not enough to make the perpetrators regret their actions to the detriment of independent 
shareholders and the company. 
 
4. Conclusion 
It can be concluded that, the history of the regulation of conflict-of-interest transactions was actually made to protect 
independent shareholders, but along with the development of changes in these regulations in practice, many of them 
are overridden by the interests of the Board of Directors, Commissioners and Major shareholders. As the Board of 
Directors and its staff are an extension of the majority shareholders. To straighten out the purpose of regulating conflict 
of interest transactions to protect independent shareholders, two things are needed: 
 
1. 
It is urgent for Capital Market regulators to make more specific laws and regulations regarding conflict-of-
interest transactions, learning from conflict-of-interest transaction cases that have occurred since 1991 until 2020. 
Namely by not to favor of majority shareholders whose votes can dominate company decisions through the GMS. 
2. 
Realizing transaction transparency, transaction fairness and changing the repressive law enforcement system for 
violators of Capital Market regulations, especially conflict of interest transactions, to preventive as an effort to 
fulfil the rights and protect independent shareholders from their weak position.

Abstract 
In today’s modern world, universities are competing to improve their competitiveness worldwide. It is usually 
indicated by ranking systems. Several ranking systems also vary depending on the evaluated aspects. In Indonesia, a 
university ranking system is often associated with the accreditation ensuring the quality of education. A rapid quality 
education improvement is appropriately implemented in public universities. However, this will bring more challenges 
for private universities as they are usually possessing limited resources. Accordingly, an effective decision-making 
system should be proposed, especially to assist private university achieving their goals. This study aims to evaluate 
academic departments in terms of research output in a university using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) 
methods. To develop the model, a case study in an Indonesian private university with 16 undergraduate programs was 
demonstrated. The ANP method is selected to construct a hierarchical structure and to obtain the weights of the criteria. 
Then, a comparative study is conducted applying fuzzy TOPSIS, fuzzy SAW, and fuzzy EDAS to rank the 
departments. In this study, six criteria were identified, while the greatest weight was the citation criterion. Besides, 
these three methods also presented consistent ranks for the best and the worst performing departments. Practically, 
the results can later be adopted by the decision-makers (DMs) in the university to determine the priority-based 
strategies to accelerate improvements for the quality of education subject to limited resources.

1. Introduction
In today’s globalized era, universities have a key influence in developing innovation, producing competent human 
resources, and contributing to economic development. These contributions strengthen their roles as a central education 
institution for multi-dimensional development including both economic and social (Meusburger et al. 2018). Due to 
the development, universities in emerging economies have also experienced a rapid growth. Unfortunately, it is often 
not in line with international competitiveness. For instance, in Indonesia several universities only contribute <10% of 
the total country’s population in 2021 which describes that the national education goal has not been achieved (Yusuf 
2022).    
The increasing number of universities should be followed by efforts to improve the quality of both graduates and 
institutions. For academics, the education quality is usually associated with university rankings according to the scopes 
that can be either international or national. The term university ranking introduced globally since the 2000s has been 
popular in many parties (Brankovic et al. 2018). The systems, moreover, also attract more attention from many 
stakeholders who certainly have influences on competitiveness, existence, and development of higher education 
institutions, in developed and developing countries (Dembereldorj 2018, Johnes 2018). Musselin (2018) even stated 
that the competition to achieve the top rank of those systems has become a multi-level competition.       
In Indonesia, the university ranking is closely related to accreditation. The term accreditation refers to an assessment 
process to determine the feasibility as well as the quality of programs and institutions. To achieve the Top 500 World 
Class Universities during the period 2020 and 2024, the Indonesian authority through the Ministry of Education, 
Culture, Research, and Technology has set academic indicators for selected universities, and applied the indicators to

apply international accreditation where the limited resources possessed by the university can be prioritized to the 
initiative. By considering the result, the decision-making process will be more efficient, and the quality education 
improvement will also be more effective.    
5. Conclusion
This study has developed a decision-making model to evaluate a university performance at the department level. In 
addition, this research has compared several MCDM methods which are relevant and practically applicable to solve 
this case. In this study, the ANP method was selected to weight the identified criteria since it is able to consider the 
interdependent relationships between criteria and sub-criteria. The obtained weights indicated that the citation criterion 
was the most influencing criterion among the others. Subsequently, the three methods selected to rank the departments 
– F-TOPSIS, F-SAW, and F-EDAS – have determined the departments’ ranking aggregated with geomean values. As
each method has its respective principle, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the stability of the decision-
making result. Based on the sensitivity results, the F-SAW method shows a stable rank when uncertainty occurs. Also,
all methods indicate consistent ranking especially for both departments at the top and lower positions. This study
focuses on research output criteria to evaluate the performance. However, it is encouraged to include other aspects
such as teaching and learning aspects and university’s impacts to obtain the thorough performance.

Abstract 
Before making transactions on the capital market, investors need to get accurate information in making decisions to 
buy or sell a stock. Investors consider some information such as the inflation rate, interest rates in a country and the 
current ratio, debt to equity ratio in a company. This study aims to determine the effect of inflation, interest rates, 
current ratio and debt to equity ratio on stock prices. The population of this study is the transportation sub-sector 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2016 – 2020. The sampling technique in this study used 
the purposive sampling method and obtained 77 observational data. The method of data analysis in this study is panel 
data regression analysis which is processed using EViews 12 software. The results of this study indicate that 
simultaneously the variables of inflation, interest rates, current ratio and debt to equity ratio influence stock prices. 
Partially, inflation, interest rates, current ratio and debt to equity ratio variable have no effect on stock prices.

1. Introduction
Investment is an investment activity or money in a company, either directly or indirectly with the hope of getting the 
amount of profit in the future(Tandelilin, 2017:2). Before investors invest in the company, the way investors do is to 
assess the company's financial performance. In principle, the better the company's financial performance in generating 
profits, the higher the company's stock price. This stock price can be a signal for investors or companies. 
A stock price is a price that occurs in the stock market at a particular point in time and can rise or fall in a short period 
of time (Agustina (2019) in Pratama et al., 2020). Demand or supply of shares in the capital market is one of the things 
that affect stock prices. Things that determine stock prices include the highest stock price, the lowest stock price and 
the closing stock price. In this study, the stock price is calculated using the closing stock price, because the stock price 
has a fluctuating period, and the closing stock price is the stock price at the end of the period. The closing price occurs 
at the end of the exchange. 
The phenomenon in this study can be seen from the average share price of the transportation sub-sector companies in 
2018 showing the highest average share price with a value of Rp. 578/share with one of the reasons being PT Transcoal 
Pacific Tbk (TCPI). This is due to the suspension of trading on shares with stock movements experiencing a significant

effect on stock prices in transportation sub-sector companies listed on the Indonesian stock exchange in 2016 - 2020. 
These results are inconsistent with researchers' previous hypothesis that the current ratio affects stock prices. 
 
The Effect of Debt-to-Equity Ratio on Stock Price 
The debt-to-equity ratio has a probability value of 0.1965, where the value is greater than the 0.05 significance level, 
so a decision can be made that H04 is accepted and Ha4 is rejected, which means that partially the debt-to-equity ratio 
has no effect on stock prices in transportation sub-sector companies listed on the Indonesian stock exchange in 2016 
- 2020. These results are inconsistent with researchers' previous hypothesis that debt-to-equity affects stock prices. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The findings of this study partially that inflation, interest rates, current ratios, and debt to equity ratios have no effect 
on stock prices. However, it simultaneously shows that inflation, interest rates, current ratio, debt to equity ratio has a 
significant effect on stock prices. The conclusion of this study provides several considerations for investors to predict 
the possibility of good or bad that will occur in the future for the selected investment company and for regulators to 
access information about threats to the stability of the Indonesian economy.

Abstract 
The capital market can be said to be developed and developing if the involvement of the public is greater than the 
share ownership of the founders. Public share ownership is a reflection of democratization that business entities are 
no longer owned by a few people but have opened up opportunities to be distributed equally according to their share 
ownership. The way in that direction was opened by requiring every public company to sell its shares in a certain 
amount, known as free float. Unfortunately, free float regulations in Indonesia are not ideal compared to other 
countries, this can be said considering the weak legal force of the Surat Keputusan Direksi PT Bursa Efek Indonesia 
No. Kep-00101/BEI/12-2021 Article V. This paper aims to find the latest views in the literature regarding the 
percentage ratio of free floats that can realize the sustainability of the capital market in Indonesia by using a 
comparative juridical normative method of regulations and legal decisions in Indonesia, Germany, Netherlands, 
United Kingdom and Australia. The results of this paper indicate that the regulation of free float in Indonesia is not 
ideal when compared to other countries to be able to support the sustainability of the Capital Market in Indonesia. 
This is due to the very small percentage of shares required to free float in Indonesia, the absence of strict sanctions, 
and the phrase ""dapat (can)"" which has weak legal force. If this arrangement is not revised, it can cause a massive 
failure of public companies to meet the minimum free float percentage obligation, resulting in low market appreciation 
for shares and low price returns and stock liquidity.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 pandemic that has occurred since the early 2020s has changed lifestyles and business processes a lot, 
one of which is the increase in online shopping. Consequently, the need for space to store goods increases. Distributor 
is a business unit that does not have a production process so that the warehouse becomes the main factor that supports 
the success of a business. Each business unit has potential hazards that can be risky, varying from low to high. This 
research aimed to identify and analyze occupational safety and health risks in the warehouse territory, particularly in 
the distribution sector. Hazard identification and risk assessment were carried out using the HIRA-AI method using 
the AS/NZS 43600:1999 standard. Risk is categorized into 3 categories i.e. low, medium, and high. The results showed 
that 15 activity categories in the warehouse territory consisted of 38 hazards and 42 risks. To be specific, there are 25 
low-risk activities, 14 medium-risk activities, and one high-risk activity. Furthermore, from 40 occupational safety 
and health risks, there were 19 residual risks generated. To conclude, risk identification and analysis help organizations 
in achieving their optimum goals.

Introduction
In Indonesia, the economy's upswing is experiencing quite a volatile situation. Previously in 2019, the economic 
growth was 5%, while during the Covid-19 Pandemic, it contracted to -2.1% margin in 2020. However, in 2021 the 
economic upturn rose again by 4.4% (BPS, 2021).In addition, from the whole 17 existing economic sectors in 
Indonesia, BPS noted that three business sectors experienced vast major expansion; these 3 sectors were transportation 
and warehousing, provider and supplier of accommodations, food, and beverages, as well as health services. 
Laila (2020) estimates that the necessity of E-Commerces warehouses is predicted to escalate by about 3,400 hectares 
in the next five years. This statement is supported by the intensified numbers of online buyers and the pandemic 
situation that limits people's activities. Thus, e-commerce entrepreneurs keep pushing on to boost the volume of 
warehouses. It is reckoned that popular e-commerces such as Lazada have 12 logistics warehouses, and Blibli has 20 
warehouses. Meanwhile, Shopee only has two warehouses. 
A warehouse is a matter related to the utilization of storage space, therefore, reaching the optimal, effective, and 
efficient outcomes benefiting the organizations. On the other hand, the related issue of warehousing often escapes the 
attention of business stakeholders since it is not a priority/ major matter in the business processes. Accordingly, there 
are several problems that frequently arise in the field of warehousing, including inefficient warehouse layout, records 
of the inventory, location of goods, picking processes, and quality control. 
Kulinska and Giera (2019) mentioned that diving deep into the identification and analysis of risk factors, especially 
in the warehouse reception section, correlates with the value of goods. Thus, it is critical to identify risk as a form of 
prevention that will arise from certain factors.

Based on the risk assessment, two controls aim to reduce risk to the lowest level. It can be seen in Figure 2, wherein 
the first risk assessment, the number of activities with low-risk was 25 activities, 14 medium-risk activities and 1 high-
risk activity, which then carried out more profound control to produce 19 low-risk activities and no more risk activities, 
neither medium nor high. It aims to achieve an acceptable level of risk and can be controlled directly in order to avoid 
further harm or risk.

5.4 Organization Implication 
This research provides important lessons about the risk for the company's management and external parties to the 
company. The reason is that it can reduce disruption to business processes, resulting in losses for the company itself. 
Occupational safety and health are important in maintaining the stability of activities or activities in the work 
environment. Enforcement of standard work procedures, work instructions, and hazard control forms are tools that 
can be used in an organization or company to control hazards and risks. The results of this research indicate that hazard 
control using the HIRA-AI method can reduce the frequency of disturbances in the company and ensure a safe and 
healthy working environment and conditions. This is evidenced by the amount of risk that can be reduced and can be 
well controlled in the company. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Life after the COVID-19 pandemic has forced all economic sectors to change dynamically. The business processes 
still need to run flawlessly in order to meet the demands. The call for warehouses increases along with rapid changes 
in buying and selling environment, such as from online/conventional methods were mostly changed to online. 
Therefore, it is vital to analyze the risks in the warehouse so that business processes can run well. The carried out risk 
identification includes occupational safety and health risks with a risk matrix assessment that produces 40 risks. 
Although the residual risk generated has been reduced from 40 to 19 risks, the risk remains the organization's 
responsibility. Occupational safety and health in this organization or company also include company policies as stated 
in the company's QHSE policy. 
This research is closely related to the balance of workers' work and a work environment that will create safe and 
comfortable conditions. It is hoped that with this risk identification and analysis, the achievement of company goals 
will be optimal.

Abstract 
E-sports have grown all over the world, as well as events and their audience. Based on many previous studies,
many factors influence the motivation of viewers on their behavior in watching e-sports; several factors have been
shown to affect the motivation to watch, such as Entertaining Features, Competitive Nature, Game Knowledge,
and Skill Appreciation. Thus, the researchers decided to conduct further research on the topic of e-sports with the
SOR model. The research method used is quantitative with a purposive sampling method. The size of the
population selected and used in this study is quite large, especially for e-sports lovers in Indonesia. Researchers
distributed online questionnaires through Google Forms and distributed through social media and acquired 221
respondents. The data that were obtained were analyzed using the SmartPLS application to test the validity and
reliability, descriptive statistics, and structural models (inner model). This study applies the SOR model as well
as motivational factors from previous studies as a stimulus. The research findings show that the stimulation of
motivation is positively related to organisms and response. This study has implications for creating interest and
becoming suggestions for companies that provide e-sports events, for the community, for fans, and for further
research.

1. Introduction
E-sports can be said as a game, competition, or activity using technology either using gadgets such as PCs
(personal computers), Smartphones, or game consoles such as PlayStation or Xbox, and other games or activities
are carried out with regulations both for recreational reasons and for professional reasons. Prasetyo (2017)
revealed that e-sport is a sport that uses video games for competitive matches. Competition in sports has become
a history that cannot be denied because it has created enormous changes in the world. Based on pre-existing
phenomena and the very rapid development of technology, the e-sport phenomenon has emerged throughout the
world, various games appear on both PC and smartphone consoles, and game competitions with high demand and
large audiences are some of the reasons for the explosion of the e-sport trend, several games that have a lot of fans
such as Mobile Legends have been downloaded 50 million times and have become games of various ages, and
social. The popularity of this game gave rise to a lot of research related to the Mobile Legends game. With the
large exposure that this game has and many players, environmental influences make this game one of the most
interesting chat contents among students (Famhi, 2019), thus, causing high interest in e-sport trends in Indonesia
in particular. E-sports is an interesting topic because the audience for e-sports continues to grow every year. In
2019, globally, there were 397 million viewers and then continued to grow, and in 2020, the esports audience
grew again to 435.9 million, and in 2021, it is estimated that there will be 474 million esports viewers, which
means the growth of the esports audience in 2021 is 8.7%. From this data, the audience is divided into 2, namely
e-sport enthusiasts and occasional viewers, where the number of occasional viewers and esports enthusiasts is not
differently significant; even in 2024, it is estimated that the number of esports viewers will be 577 million
(Newzoo, 2021). This growing audience of e-sports raises many questions.

5. Conclusion 
E-sports can be said to have become an interesting topic to discuss, which is not just a game but also a form of 
entertainment and watching activities become something that is inherent in the world. In this study, the SOR 
model and quantitative methods were used to analyze several variables that could affect the intensity of watching 
E-sports. Based on the analysis that has been done, it can be concluded that there is only 1 variable that affects 
the intention to watch E-sport events, namely Entertaining Features. The Entertaining Features variable affects 
the intention to watch E-sports events directly by being influenced by the Flow Experience and Subjective Well-
Being variables. Entertainment or entertainment can be said to be a common intake for human life, where this can 
reduce stress, especially the respondents feel a pleasant experience and get new insights, especially in the world 
of E-sports. The Game Knowledge variable is positively correlated with Subjective well-being.  
 
So, there are only 5 hypotheses that can be accepted. The results also show that flow experience and subjective 
well-being in e-sports have a very important contribution to behavioral intention in watching esports. An 
interesting result in this study is that game knowledge is positively correlated with subjective well-being but not 
with stream experience. These results indicate that a positive correlation between flow experience and subjective 
well-being shows that the audience's behavioral intention requires an experience in which there is a sense of 
interest and curiosity, as well as the behavior of the e-sports audience itself. 
 
6. Implication & Future Research 
6.1 Implication 
This study was conducted to determine the variables that significantly influence the intention to watch E-sports 
through Flow Experience and Subjective Well-Being, which act as mediating variables using the SOR model. 
Based on the analysis that has been carried out, this study reaches the conclusion which shows that only the 
Entertaining Features variable has a significant effect on the intention to watch E-sports. This shows that the scope 
of society in Indonesia has the intention to watch, which is influenced by the entertainment aspect. Our study has 
implications for the field of research by filling gaps that have not been found in previous research related to the 
topic of e-sports, where there is very little research, especially in Indonesia. The next implication is in the business 
sector, where with this research, e-sport event providers can better understand the needs and desires of their 
audience regarding the content they present and can see from the existing demographics that the audience of E-
Sport events is quite diverse, especially in the range age and occupation so that the content provided must be 
suitable for all ages and label if there is content that is not suitable for children and is no exception for the audience 
of the E-sport event itself. With this research, e-sports organizers can focus more on the entertainment provided 
because it is the most significant stimulant to the experience gained and subjective well-being, where subject and 
flow are very important in behavioral intention to watch e-sports. So, it is hoped that this research can help 
organizers in making decisions. 
 
6.2 Future Research 
The research and writing of the results of this study also have the intention of being material for consideration and 
learning from further studies. The limitations of this study are such as the limitations of space and time. The author 
has limitations by only being able to conduct research in Indonesia. However, as is well known, the popularity of 
e-sports does not only exist in Indonesia but in all parts of the world so that further research can be carried out in 
various other places and even in more specific locations and taking into account the conditions and situations of 
e-sports, which will of course always evolve over time. The author hopes this research can be a new step for 
further research in the future.

Abstract 
Intellectual Capital (IC) has been widely studied in various countries, especially Indonesia. However, there are still 
inconsistencies in research results. Some researchers find evidence that IC has an effect on financial performance. 
Some other researchers found results that IC had no effect on the company's financial performance. Therefore, the 
researchers tried to conduct research on the effect of IC on the company's financial performance. This study uses a 
case study on the financial sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for the period 2012-2021. The 
financial sector was chosen because it is considered to have the most intensive IC. In addition, this study also attempts 
to prove that each sub-sector has a different IC contribution to the company's financial performance. IC is measured 
using value added intellectual capital (VAIC) while financial performance is measured using return on assets (ROA), 
return on equity (ROE) and market to book value (M/B). The control variables used in this study are size and leverage. 
This study uses panel regression analysis with the help of E-views. The results of the study are able to prove that IC 
has an effect on the company's financial performance as measured by ROA and ROE. Meanwhile, IC has no effect on 
the company's financial performance as measured by using M/B. In addition, this study proves that each sub-sector 
has a different IC contribution to the company's financial performance.

Based on Table 7 in the financial institution sub-sector, model 1 and model 2 have significant values of 0.000 and 
0.0005 (<0.05), which means that intellectual capital has a positive effect on ROA and ROE with a coefficient value 
of 0.0027 and 0.0054. However, in model 3, the regression results show that intellectual capital has no effect on M/B 
(>0.05). 
 
This study proves that each sub-sector has a different contribution of intellectual capital to financial performance. This 
difference is caused by differences in assets and capabilities owned by the company so each sub-sector will have a 
different strategy in determining the contribution of its assets and capabilities to compete effectively. Some companies 
will rely on intellectual capital, while others will rely more on financial or physical assets to build on their success. In 
Indonesia, in general, the sub-sector that has the highest intellectual capital contribution is the financing institution 
sub-sector, then in the second position is the insurance sub-sector and the last position is the banking sub-sector. The 
bank has the lowest contribution because this sub-sector has not optimized its intellectual capital yet, resulting in a 
low contribution of intellectual capital to the company's performance. In addition, companies in the banking sub-sector 
may still focus on physical capital rather than intellectual capital. Research conducted by Joshi, Cahill and Sidhu 
(2013) and Tan, Plowman and Hancock (2007) supports these results which state that each sub-sector has a different 
contribution of intellectual capital to financial performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of hypothesis testing, intellectual capital has a positive and significant effect on the company's 
financial performance as measured by using ROA and ROE. This is because the company has been able to realize the 
importance of investing in intellectual capital to increase the company's competitiveness. Companies in the financial 
sector have been able to optimize their intellectual capital so they can improve their company's financial performance. 
Meanwhile, intellectual capital has no effect on the company's financial performance as measured by M/B. This means 
that the investment market in Indonesia has not given trust to companies that invest in intellectual capital assets 
(intangible assets). This is because investors do not understand and consider the intellectual capital owned by the 
company as one of the considerations for making investment decisions. 
 
Based on the results of hypothesis testing, each sub-sector has a different effect on intellectual capital on the company's 
financial performance. This is because each sub-sector has different assets and capabilities, therefore each sub-sector 
will have a different strategy in determining the contribution of its assets and capabilities to compete effectively. Some 
companies will rely on intellectual capital, while others will rely more on financial or physical assets to build on their 
success.

This study has some limitations. This study uses only 27 samples of financial sector companies which include 5 
insurance companies, 17 bank companies, and 5 financial institutions and does not include securities companies and 
other sub-sectors so the sample in this study may not represent all companies in the financial sector. Next, the 
Intellectual Capital Measurement only uses the VAIC model which still has calculation limitations so it could affect 
the limited sample that can be used. Future research is expected to use other models such as surveys to represent all 
financial sectors. In addition, we found inconsistencies in the results regarding the influence of intellectual capital in 
various countries. Future study can examine the factors that can affect the inconsistency of these results. 
The implications of this study are that intellectual capital is considered important to be able to increase value added 
for the company because it is proven to influence company performance. For the management, it is expected to be 
able to manage every component of intellectual capital effectively and efficiently to provide value added for the 
company so as to improve the company's financial performance. For investors, it is hoped that the intellectual capital 
aspect can be taken into consideration when investing in various companies that enter the financial sector.

Abstract 
Safety Management System (SMS) is part of a company's safety management program and it’s a way of managing 
Occupational Safety and Health (OSH). It helps reduce safety risks and improve overall OSH performance. This study 
was conducted to prioritize the SMS variables using the Decision-Tree technique.  Questionnaires were administered 
to assess the current practice of SMS from a selected manufacturing industry. The study examined 7 independent 
variables which are Management Commitment, Employee's Attitude, Work Related Stress, Colleague Encouragement, 
3 Sub Factors namely Recognition, Fear and Self-awareness that was adopted from previous studies. These variables 
were prioritized using the Decision Tree technique and overall efficiency of the present SMS were established for 
further improvements. 
Keywords 
Safety Management System; Decision-Tree; OSH Hazards 
1. Introduction
The objective of this study is to investigate the application of Decision-Tree technique in prioritizing Safety 
Management System (SMS) variables. The data is evaluated, and improvements based on prioritize data using the 
Decision-Tree technique is then proposed. 
The complexity of industrial processes and the use of hazardous substances make future injury risks uncertain and 
frightening (Gholizadeh & Esmaeili, 2015). A good SMS is critical to success, good governance, and overall business

the work hours such as sports and social activities. This variable refers to management's commitment to keep-up 
employees mental wellbeing (Corporate Wellness Magazine, 2022).  
 
In this study's, Colleague Encouragement variable is least valued. The survey indicated that least interactions among 
employees in OSH related discussion and sharing information. To increase the Colleague Encouragement, 
management should hold regular OSH related meetings, discussions, forums involving employees (Shangareev, 
2018; Ashford, 1997). 
 
The OSH committee and management should consider giving recognition to employees who complies with OSH 
policies diligently. Management should encourage and recognize employees publicly, so encouraging and 
strengthening the company's good safety culture and practices among employees. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The study investigated the application of Decision Tree technique in safety management system prioritizing as outlined 
in the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994. The independent and dependent variables have been identified, and 
the decision tree diagram has been constructed. Management commitment is the highest priority variable as 
management commitment to safety is a distinct and crucial component in an effective OSH management. The 
employee's attitude is the second highest prioritized data, while positive attitudes will support to strengthen the 
importance of safety procedures and equipment.  Many successful companies have built strong safety cultures that 
have led to excellent and efficient work units. Research has shown that one way to build that kind of culture is to get 
the management and workers actively engaged and involved in safety related discussions, forums, employee 
suggestions etc. Recognition, fear, and self-awareness are the least prioritized variable in this study, but still, they are 
vital to an organizations OSH management system.

Abstract 
Electric vehicles can reduce pollution and lower the use of fossil fuel. However, currently, in Indonesia, the supporting 
infrastructure for electric motorcycles is still very limited.  The lack of infrastructure charging station for electric 
motorcycles causes some problems for the community to access power. This research develops an idea of mobile 
charging station swap battery technology (MCSSB). Apart from preparing infrastructure battery swap for the 
community, MCSSB can be used as commercialization equipment for entrepreneurs. This study aims to determine the 
Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of MCSSB.  The results of the development of technological innovations are at 
the feasibility study stage. It means that attention should be paid to the aspects for technological feasibility, such as 
operational aspects, market aspects, environmental aspects, and organizational aspects. The TRL calculation is at level 
5, which means that the code validation and components are in a simulation environment.

1. Introduction
Electric vehicles are one of the important things to overcome problems related to environmental pollution, the limited 
and decreasing supply of conventional fuels, and global warming due to the increasing use of fossil-based fuels in 
transportation equipment (Kumara & Sukerayasa, 2009). The use of electric-based vehicles (KBL) can be a solution 
to reduce the use of fossil fuel vehicles (Iskandar, 2021). Electric vehicles are considered a substitute for fossil fuel 
vehicles due to rising fossil fuel prices and accompanying environmental problems, and are predicted to increase 
dramatically shortly (Nazari Heris et al., 2022). Based on a survey conducted by Populix with 1002 respondents in 
Indonesia in February 2022, as many as 13% of respondents already have an electric motorbike, and 29% plan to buy

environment. A laboratory-scale technology prototype has been created. The integration of technology systems and 
lab-scale design has been completed. 
5. Technology Readiness Level 5
In MCSSB technology it is possible to only reach level 5, which means code validation, and components in a new
simulation environment will be implemented. Due to the absence of prototype preparation and component integration.
80% readiness to fulfill indicators of hardware production preparation and market research & laboratory research to
select the fabrication process. 20% readiness to fulfill prototype manufacture, testing of supporting machines and
equipment, integration of the system to be tested or simulated, prototype accuracy, laboratory conditions similar to
the real environment, and reviewing of the production process.
4.3 Lesson Learned 
Broadly speaking about MCSSB, namely, new mobile charging station swap battery technology innovations can 
improve charging infrastructure, making it easier for people who use 2-wheeled electric vehicles (motorcycles) to 
charge because they are flexible, can move from place to place, and do not take time. long. In addition, video Tron on 
mobile trucks can be used for commercialization by SMEs. Inside the mobile truck, the transporter carries 4 exchange 
batteries. The technology is still in the feasibility test stage, and the technology readiness level is at level 5. This 
research is still conceptual, it can still be further developed to the feasibility testing stage in the actual environment so 
that it can be adopted by the community. 
5. Conclusion
The increasing use of 2-wheeled electric vehicles is not matched by the existing infrastructure. The limited 
infrastructure for charging station swap batteries makes people anxious and worried. Therefore, the Mobile charging 
station swap battery for 2-wheeled electric vehicles is a new technology idea. MCSSB can be moved, flexible, and 
not bound by time. An analysis of the development of technological innovation and a rapid analysis of the level of 
technological readiness is carried out. The results obtained from the development of technological innovations at the 
feasibility study stage, in the cycle of development of a prototype, patenting and approval, production, marketing, and 
adoption stages cannot be implemented, because MCSSB technology is still about the concept. The level of technology 
readiness is at level 5, which indicates code validation, and components in a simulation environment. The three 
important components in the MCSSB have been identified, the technology regarding swap batteries, electric three-
wheeled vehicles, and billboards in the form of video Tron has been proven. So that the concept of MCSSB Lives to 
make a single unit of a product. In the future, it is hoped that the feasibility study will discuss the analysis of techno-
economic costs.

Abstract 
If less effective quality control is applied in the company repeatedly, the number of failed products will increase. The 
company can identify failures based on severity, occurrence, and detection criteria using the Failure Mode and Effect 
Analysis (FMEA) method. The result of multiplying the three criteria becomes the Risk Priority Number (RPN). 
However FMEA has a weakness that has attracted many criticisms, namely the potential for the same RPN results but 
not considering different failure risks. Thus, the FMEA method is integrated with grey theory to become a Grey Failure 
Mode and Effect Analysis (GFMEA) method that can improve RPN priority determination. Determination of the 
weight of importance between criteria in the GFMEA method is strengthened by the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy 
Process (FAHP) method so that the level of accuracy in determining the RPN will be better. This study aims to identify 
failures for each component in CV. ABC, electric batik stove company, and determine the priority of the causes of 
loss in the production process of electric batik stove products based on analysis using GFMEA method. However, 
there was no detail on the type of failure. So it was difficult to optimally determine the causal factors, root causes, and 
risk of loss. The analysis found nineteen failures can potentially cause failure in the company’s electric batik stove 
production process. After that, three potential failures with critical values  must be prioritized, including broken bowl 
heaters, uneven coloring, and slanted body folds with a Grey RPN result of 0,50001; 0,50512; and 0,51156.

1. Introduction
If less effective quality control is applied repeatedly, the number of failed products will increase. Each company seeks 
to maintain the quality of its products by implementing quality control to comply with the company's quality standards 
(Kafetzopoulos et al. 2015). CV. ABC is a company that produces electric batik stoves. Based on the results of 
observations and interviews with the company, it was found that the problem that occurred was the identification of 
failures carried out on each component, but it was not known in detail the type of failure so that it was difficult to 
know optimally for causal factors, root causes, and the risk of failure that occurs. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze 
the quality control at each stage of the production process. 
The Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method can be applied to identify failures based on the criteria for 
severity, occurrence, and detection (Stamatis 1995). The result of multiplying the three criteria becomes the Risk 
Priority Number (RPN) (Cicek and Celik 2013). However, according to Chang et al. (2013), FMEA has a weakness 
that draws a lot of criticism, namely the potential for the same RPN results, but different failure risks are not 
considered. Thus, the FMEA method is integrated with grey theory so that it becomes a Grey Failure Mode and Effect 
Analysis (GFMEA) method that can improve RPN priority determination (Li et al. 2018). Determination of the weight 
of importance between criteria in the GFMEA method is strengthened by the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process 
(FAHP) method which has a wider decision-making range than AHP so that the level of accuracy in determining the 
RPN will be better (Chen 2020).

3. Proposed corrective actions from researchers are expected to be considered for companies to overcome failures
that may occur in the production process of electric batik stoves.
6. Conclusion
In the FMEA method, to consider the most important failures are used from the largest to the smallest RPN. However, 
the calculation of RPN with traditional FMEA has a weakness that is widely criticized because it has the potential to 
have the same RPN result, but different failure factors are not considered. Thus, to improve reliability and accuracy 
in determining the value of the RPN, the GFMEA method is used to assist decision making with limited and uncertain 
information with assessments in the form of relationship analysis and modeling. Determination of the weight of 
importance between criteria in the GFMEA method is strengthened by the FAHP method so that the level of accuracy 
in determining the RPN will be better. 
In this study, based on the results of observations and interviews at the company, it was found 19 types of failures that 
have the potential to cause failure in the production process of electric batik stoves at CV. ABC. After that, there are 
3 potential failures with critical values and must be prioritized. The determination is based on the calculation of the 
value of the GRPN. Priority 3 potential failures, including broken bowl heater, uneven coloring, slanted body folds 
with a GRPN result of 0.50001; 0.50512; and 0.51156. Proposed corrective actions are given for priority failures so 
that failures that occur in the electric batik stove production process can be minimized, including ensuring suppliers 
provide raw materials according to standards, checking tools before production takes place, and making routine 
machine maintenance schedules.

Abstract 
Carbon-based emissions from greenhouse gases (GHGs) from transportation make a harmful impact on climate change 
and human health. The traditional combustion of vehicles makes severe consequences on the environment. Electric 
vehicles are regarded as a key technology to decarbonize the road transport sector for environmental protection and 
sustainability because the EVs reduce the carbon footprint, dependence on fossil fuels, and noise levels and increase 
the efficiency of conversion. The research about EVs has significantly increased since 2018 because EVs are used in 
practical transportation. This paper provides essential information on emerging trends and the Future of research 
involving EVs. The method used in this paper is to use five stages of screening and the application of VOS viewer for 
constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks. Based on the results obtained, the most frequently used keywords 
in research related to electric vehicles are electric vehicles, electric vehicle batteries, and electronic waste. Research 
on electric vehicle batteries will still be interesting research to discuss in the next few years. In addition, the topic of 
energy and environment is also a topic that must be raised because the final product from used batteries is still an 
obstacle for every country that has started to switch from ICE to EV.

1. Introduction
Carbon-based emissions from greenhouse gases (GHGs) from transportation make a harmful impact on climate change 
and human health. The traditional combustion of vehicles makes severe consequences on the environment (Thorhauge 
et al., 2020). Electric vehicles are regarded as a key technology to decarbonize the road transport sector for 
environmental protection and sustainability (Hou et al., 2022). The EVs reduce the carbon footprint, dependence on 
fossil fuels, and noise levels and increase the efficiency of conversion (Xie et al., 2020).  The EVs require fewer 
number components as compared to the internal combustion engine (ICE) (Islam et al., 2022). EVs can replace 
conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) (Kumar & Revankar, 2017). Promoting electric vehicles 
(EVs) to phase out conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles soon is a crucial strategy for worldwide 
countries (Chen et al., 2020). Increasing EVs in circulation can reduce transport costs and the effects of greenhouse 
gas emissions, compared to fossil-fuel-powered engines in addition to strengthening electric mobility through the high 
penetration of renewable energy sources (Kucukoglu et al., 2021). 
The research about EVs has significantly increased since 2018 because EVs are used in practical transportation, e.g., 
personal vehicles and taxis. In common car markets, commercial EVs include hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-
in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) (Suttakul et al., 2022). The rising demand for electric 
vehicles is due to their several advantages over conventional vehicles. Studies have shown that electric vehicles are 
energy efficient in that about 60% of the electrical energy from the grid is converted to power at the wheels compared 
to about 20% of the energy stored in gasoline for powering at the wheel for internal combustion engine vehicles (Liu 
et al., 2018). In addition, an electric vehicle has zero emission of carbon dioxide and other tailpipe pollutants as well

5.2 Proposed Improvements 
Research on electric vehicles is a topic that is currently attracting the attention of researchers. Various aspects can be 
researched, such as regarding recycling, environment, sustainability, battery, and others. The development of research 
on electric vehicles that will still be widely discussed is related to batteries, both regarding the material of the battery, 
durability, recycling, charging process, and others. The next is related to the energy and environment of electric 
vehicles which will attract attention and continue to grow. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The electric vehicle is a very interesting topic to be researched lately. Research on EVs has greatly increased since 
2018 because EVs are widely used in public transportation. Based on bibliometrics that has been carried out on the 
SCOPUS database based on the occurrence value of keywords that are often used in research, electric vehicles, electric 
vehicle batteries, and electronic waste are the top three most frequently used keywords. As for the development of 
research in the next few years, the topic of batteries in electric vehicles is still an interesting topic to research. In 
addition, the topic of energy and environment is also a topic that must be raised because the final product from used 
batteries is still an obstacle for every country that has started to switch from ICE to EV.

Abstract 
This paper presents a method to estimate broiler weight automatically using computer vision approach and machine learning model. 
The data used in this paper obtained using a broiler cage video and manual weight calculation on daily basis for 33 days. The 
broilers image is processed using several image processing methods such as noise removal, adaptive thresholding, morphological 
operations, and image segmentation to generate morphological data of each broiler. The model development is carried out by 
utilizing morphological data of each broilers which increased along with the increase in weight.  Five features of broilers were used, 
namely area, perimeter, mean radius, maximum radius, and major axis. The proposed model then was validated using a 10-fold 
cross validation method. The proposed model performance is calculated using the RMSE metrics, which shows SVR model has 
the best performance with RMSE value of 144,7 grams. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Livestock is one of the industrial sectors that make a significant contribution to the Indonesian economy, one of the 
sub-sectors in the livestock industry is poultry farming. Currently the large number of meat demand encourages broiler 
breeders to increase the productivity of broiler chicken cages. Nyalala (2021) mentioned productivity in chicken cage 
is commonly measured using FCR (feed conversion) ratio which is the ratio between the weight of feed consumed by 
broilers and the weight of broilers. Low FCR ratio is desired because it is indicating high productivity. Farm X strives 
to achieve a low FCR value by monitoring the weight development of broiler chickens every day during the growing 
period to allocate the right amount of feed every day. When allocating the amount of feed, farmers need to know how 
much weight the broilers have grown in the last 3-4 days and how much weight they need to gain for the next 3-4 days 
(Mollaha et al. 2010). The daily weight of broiler chickens in farm X was measured manually by putting several 
chickens into sacks and weighing them at once to obtain the average weight of each broiler in the sack. 
Manually measuring the weight of broilers has the disadvantage that it requires a lot of time and labor and can also 
make broilers easily stressed (Mortensen 2016). To increase productivity, farm X requires an automatic method of 
measuring broiler weight. One alternative method of measuring broiler weight automatically is to use an 
image/computer vision-based approach (Daud 2020). In simple terms, the image-based approach measures the weight 
of chickens by using images that are processed using certain machine learning algorithms. Image based approaches 
can be grouped into two parts, namely image retrieval and image processing, this research focuses on the image 
processing section. Image processing is carried out to convert image data into feature data that can be used to determine 
the weight of broilers using certain model. The alternative modek that will be chosen in this study uses a machine 
learning approach. 
The machine learning approach is an approach developed to study patterns from a dataset to perform the inference 
process independently. The machine learning approach can be used to make classifications or predictions based on 
previous historical data. Some of the algorithm that are often used in various studies include linear regression, decision 
trees, support vector machines, random forests, artificial neural networks, naïve bayes, k-naearest neighbors, etc.

4. Conclusion 
Collecting frequent and accurate weights of broiler is important for breeders to achieve high productivity level. This 
research provides one alternative way to collect broiler weight automatically on daily basis by using computer vision 
approach. Image processing method were used to identify morphological data of each broiler inside the image. These 
broiler’s morphological data were used to estimate broiler weight using machine learning model. Based on 
performance result SVR model is the best model to estimate broiler weight, with RMSE = 144.7 gram. To fully utilize 
this research for automatic weight estimation, another research is needed to develop the image collection method.

1. Introduction
Outsource logistic services; known as Third Party Logistic (3PL) is taking more and more role in various type of 
industries. Companies are using 3PL services in order to get some benefit such as having more efficiency in 
transportation, warehouse management and additional services with added value in logistics (Kale, 2021). To be able 
to give those beneficial things, 3PL companies are encourage increasing their level of services. One of them is by 
using an information system in their work process. Defined as a compilation of interrelated elements which gather, 
process, keep and share information in order to make an outcome and manage them in an institution, information 
system grant their user in having a costs and failure reduction and enhance the information flow between all 
departments (Kiba-Janiak & Cheba, 2019). Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is one of the most advanced 
information systems currently available for use by the 3PL companies. 
The purpose of this research is aimed to give the outsourcing logistics companies a clear view on having information 
system for their work process, especially Enterprise Resource Planning.  
2. Literature Review
Third Party Logistic (3PL) as an outsourcing logistic services company are having increase in demand nowadays. The 
COVID-19 pandemic situation has changed the way of people or institutions conduct a procurement. The pandemic

Top level support, sufficient member team, training, guidance and evaluation and also minimum custom on software 
are some of the critical factor that should be studied well before carrying the project (Aboabdo et al., 2019; Kiran & 
Reddy, 2019; Reitsma et al., 2018). 
6. Conclusion
This literature review tells the demand of outsourced logistics is increasing. Pandemic situation also strengthens this 
demand. Outsourcing companies or third-party logistics (3PL) have to compete among others to have their business 
sustain. Moreover, to compete with others, 3PL companies should have information technology or system to escalate 
their performance. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is the right answer for 3PL to win the competition. With the 
benefits offered, 3PL companies would increase their performance and decrease cost to get customer satisfaction but 
take a good care for the critical success factor. Have them studied carefully before decided to have an ERP 
implementation. Otherwise, winning a competition would never be achieved.

Abstract 
Composition in bankruptcy is permitted by Article 144 of Law No. 37 of 2004 regarding Bankruptcy and Suspension 
of Debt Payment Obligations which gives the Debtor the right to offer composition to all Creditors. However, in case 
that the bankruptcy comes from the failure of Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations because the composition plan 
offered by the Debtor was rejected by its Creditors, the Commercial Court and the Supreme Court do not share the 
same view regarding whether it is permissible to make a composition in bankruptcy. In the bankruptcy case of PT 
Hanson International Tbk., the Commercial Court using an extensive interpretation method held the view that 
composition in bankruptcy that comes from Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations is permissible, while the 
Supreme Court using a restrictive interpretation method held the opposite view. Therefore, in this study, the authors 
conducted a study of these disparities by using the grammatical interpretation method of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy 
and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act. 
Keywords 
Composition in bankruptcy, Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations. 
1. Introduction
In their quest to obtain the satisfaction of economic needs and benefits, individuals and businesses engage in various 
activities to achieve these goals. These activities involve entering into agreements with individuals and/or other 
entities, which then create rights and obligations for each party bound by the agreement. The party obliged to pay the 
debt is referred to as the debtor, while the party entitled to sue is referred to as the creditor (Subekti, 2003). 
Debts owed by debtors to creditors cannot always be settled by the debtor (Simanjuntak, H.A., 2019). One of the 
factors that can lead to this is the debtor's inability to pay and/or continue to pay their debts to the creditors. In such 
circumstances, the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act provides several options that can be 
taken by the debtor or creditor. The first option is suspension of debt payment obligations (hereinafter referred to as 
PKPU) if the debtor or creditor requires the debtor to submit a composition plan containing an offer to pay the creditor 
part or all the debt. There is also a second possibility, namely bankruptcy.

decision has the right to offer composition to all creditors. Since the method of grammatical interpretation of the 
definition of bankrupt debtor is clear and explicit, there is no need for another interpretation of the definition of 
bankrupt debtor. 
Furthermore, to determine which interpretation is in accordance with the grammatical interpretation of Article 144 of 
the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act, it is necessary to know whether the bankrupt debtor, 
in this case PT Hanson International Tbk., has the right to offer peace to its creditors in the process of bankruptcy that 
comes from PKPU. To answer this question, the syllogism of Article 1 (4) of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt 
Payment Obligations Act is needed, which are as follows: (Table 3). 
Table 3 Syllogism of Article 1 (4)  
of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act  
in the Composition in the Bankruptcy of PT Hanson International Tbk. 
Major Premise 
A bankrupt debtor is a debtor who has been declared bankrupt by a court decision. 
Premis Minor 
PT Hanson International Tbk., is a debtor who has been declared bankrupt by a court decision 
(Verdict No. 29/Pdt.Sus-PKPU/2020/PN.Niaga.Jkt.Pst., dated March 5, 2020). 
Conclusion 
PT Hanson International Tbk., is a bankrupt debtor. 
After concluding that PT Hanson International Tbk., is the bankrupt debtor within the meaning of Article 1 (4) of the 
Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act, a syllogism was made on Article 144 of the Bankruptcy 
and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act in the case of PT Hanson International Tbk., as follows: (Table 4). 
Table 4 Syllogism of Article 144  
of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act  
in the Composition in the Bankruptcy of PT Hanson International Tbk. 
Major Premise 
Bankrupt debtor is entitled to offer composition to all creditors. 
Minor Premise 
PT Hanson International Tbk., is a bankrupt debtor. 
Conclusion 
PT Hanson International Tbk., is entitled to offer composition to all creditors. 
From the syllogism of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act in the 
bankruptcy case of PT Hanson International Tbk., which uses a grammatical interpretation, it can be concluded that 
PT Hanson International Tbk., which is a debtor in bankruptcy that comes from PKPU, has the right to offer 
composition to all creditors. This means that an overview can be drawn that debtors in bankruptcy that comes from 
PKPU have the right to offer composition to all creditors. Indeed, the bankrupt debtor that comes from PKPU was 
declared bankrupt based on the court decision. Therefore, Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt 
Payment Obligations Act provides an opportunity for bankrupt debtor, both directly from the granting of the petition 
for bankruptcy or from the failure of the PKPU process to offer composition to all creditors. 
After concluding regarding the policies contained in Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment 
Obligations Act above regarding composition in case of bankruptcy that comes from the failure of PKPU due to 
rejection of debtor's composition plan by creditors, it is necessary to determine which method of the extensive 
interpretation method held by Central Jakarta Commercial Court and the retrictive interpretation method of held by 
by the Supreme Court in the bankruptcy of PT Hanson International Tbk., is in accordance with Article 144 of the 
Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act. 
Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the extensive interpretation method held by Central Jakarta 
Commercial Court is in accordance with the grammatical interpretation method of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy Law 
and the PKPU. The extensive interpretation method proposed by the Commercial Court of the Central District Court 
of Jakarta and the grammatical interpretation method of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt 
Payment Obligations Act both allow composition in case of bankruptcy that comes from the failure of PKPU process 
because the debtor's composition plan was rejected by its creditors. 
Furthermore, based on an analysis of the arguments made by the Supreme Court regarding the reason for the Supreme 
Court's opinion that it is not permissible to have a composition in bankruptcy that comes from the failure of PKPU 
1955","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022

process due to the rejection of the debtor's composition plan by the creditors, it can be concluded that the Supreme 
Court produced a restrictive method of interpretation using the systematic interpretation method. This is because the 
argument constructed by the Supreme Court is to link one regulation to another (Shidarta, 2013). This connection is 
demonstrated by the Supreme Court by linking the regulations of Chapter III of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of 
Debt Payment Obligations Act to Chapter II of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act 
using the argument of stated explicitly and clearly (expresis verbis) to link the two regulations. 
Then, from the analysis of the restrictive interpretation method presented by the Supreme Court, it can be concluded 
that the restrictive interpretation method is contrary to the grammatical interpretation method of Article 144 of the 
Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act. That is because the restrictive interpretation method in 
the Verdict No. 667K/Pdt.Sus-Pailit/2021 provides a different conclusion from the grammatical interpretation method 
of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act. The restrictive interpretation 
method presented by the Supreme Court concludes that it is not permissible to have a composition in bankruptcy that 
comes from the failure of PKPU because the debtor's composition plan was rejected by the creditors, while the 
grammatical interpretation method of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act 
conclude that the composition in bankruptcy that comes from the failure of PKPU because the composition plan of 
the debtor was rejected by the creditors. 
4. Conclusion
From the above analysis, it can be concluded that the interpretation method which satisfies the provisions of Article 
144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act is the extensive interpretation method using 
grammatical interpretation method of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations 
Act. This is what makes this study unique. In general, the grammatical interpretation method produces a restrictive 
interpretation method. Indeed, the interpretation according to the language, among other things by looking at the 
lexical definition, generally limits the applicability of a rule, hence resulting a restrictive interpretation method. 
However, in this study, the grammatical interpretation method produces an extensive interpretation method with the 
analysis previously described above.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown and social distancing have changed the consumers purchasing behavior and 
habits. Consumers are learning to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic by using internet and information technology 
in their daily life. Firm and marketer should adapt to the change in consumers behavior by investing more in digital 
advertising and digital influencer. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of digital advertising exposure and 
trust to digital influencer on consumers attitude toward digital advertising in COVID-19 pandemic. This study

digital advertising. Furthermore, this study also examines the influence of both trust to digital influencer and digital 
advertising capabilities (entertainment, informativeness and personalization) on attitude toward digital advertising. A 
research model was developed based on theory of reasoned action and was empirically examined through data 
collected from 461 of digital advertising consumers in Indonesia. Result shows that trust to digital influencer have 
positive impact on purchase intention. Furthermore, the result also shows that entertainment, informative and 
personalization also have significant impact on attitude toward digital advertising. These findings can help brand to

5.3 Discussion  
Research on attitude toward digital advertising is developing, however most studies neglected the role of digital 
influencer. To fill the gap, this research drawn on consumer trust to digital influencer and digital advertising 
capabilities as antecedents toward attitude to digital advertising and purchase intention. Using PLS-SEM as analytic 
tools, here are discussion about the result. 
 
First, the result stated that trust to digital influencer positively influence consumers attitude toward digital advertising, 
thereby supporting hypotheses 1. Research by Hsu et al (2013) support this finding that trust to digital blogger 
influence consumers attitude (C. L. Hsu et al., 2013). 
 
Second, the result showed that entertainment, informative, and personalization are significant as predictor toward 
consumers attitude toward digital advertising where the t-values are above the recommended values, thereby 
supporting hypotheses 2. Research by Tsang et al support this finding that entertainment and informative are positively 
influence attitude toward mobile advertising  (Tsang et al., 2004a). The study by Gao and Zang also support this in 
finding that both entertainment and personalization have significant impact on attitude toward mobile advertising in 
China (Gao & Zang, 2016).  
 
Third, the result also showed that consumers attitude toward digital advertising significantly impact on purchase 
intention, thereby supporting hypotheses 3. This result is supported by several studies  that proved consumers attitude 
toward advertisement positively influence their intention (Gao & Zang, 2016; Tsang et al., 2004a; Wardhani & Alif, 
2019). 
 
6. Conclusion  
There are several theoretical contributions from this research. First, this study contributes to digital advertising 
research in developing trust to digital influencer as one of antecedent’s factors that build consumers attitude toward 
digital advertising. Consumers attitude toward digital advertising is acknowledged as important predictor for 
advertising effectiveness and there are many research that study consumers attitude toward digital advertising and its 
antecedents (Gao & Zang, 2016; Tsang et al., 2004a; Wardhani & Alif, 2019). This research argues and demonstrate 
that trust to digital influencer is influential in building consumers attitude toward digital advertising. Second, this 
study makes empirical contributions in the COVID-19 pandemic. This research conduct research on consumers in the 
COVID-19 context. This research findings point out that trust to digital influencer, entertainment, informativeness 
and personalization are important predictor for consumers attitude toward digital advertising during COVID-19 
pandemic. 
 
Beside theoretical contributions, this research also contribute to practice. The findings provide strategy to build 
effective digital advertising for business and marketers. This research suggest that digital influencer endorsement is 
important to improve digital advertising effectiveness in COVID-19 pandemic, because consumers trust toward digital 
influencer influence their attitude toward digital advertising in COVID-19 pandemic. Business and marketer should 
endorse digital influencer and digital advertising to increase the effectiveness of their digital marketing. The findings 
in this research also revealed that the entertainment, informative and personalization of digital advertising positively

influence consumers positive attitude toward digital advertising. The result indicate that business and marketers should 
focus to create a digital advertising which interesting and entertaining for their consumers, and the information in the 
digital advertising should be concise, easy to understand to gain positive response from consumers. Business and 
brand also should apply personalization technology when delivering their digital advertising to ensure that their 
message reach the right consumers effectively and efficiently.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of non-debt tax shield (NDTS), firm growth, liquidity, and profit 
volatility whether simultaneously and/or partially towards debt policy in building construction firms listed on 
Indonesian Stock Exchange period 2016-2020. This study uses panel data regression with fixed effect model to 
estimate 60 samples from 12 companies selected through purposive sampling. The results show that NDTS, firm 
growth, liquidity, and profit volatility simultaneously have a significant effect on debt policy. Partially, firm growth 
and profit volatility have a positive significant effect on debt policy, while NDTS and liquidity have no significant 
effect. These findings suggest that Indonesian building construction firms do not consider liquidity and non-debt tax 
shield as a consideration of increasing or decreasing debt. Moreover, Indonesian building construction firms with 
strong firm growth and high profit volatility actually have a low proportion of debt.

1. Introduction
Over the past ten years, Indonesia's GDP has steadily increased, this indicate the economy of Indonesia is currently 
expanding. Gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the metrics used to assess how well the performance of the 
economy is. Firms in the infrastructure sector can be regarded as one of the pillars in fostering economic growth in 
Indonesia, as this sector can support the flow of economic activities (Yunitasari & Dewi, 2016). Infrastructure progress 
in Indonesia is reflected in the progress of infrastructure sector firms, because the progress of infrastructure sector 
firms can have an impact on infrastructure development in Indonesia. This research focuses on one of the ten sub-
sectors of firms in the infrastructure sector, namely the building construction sub-sector. Building construction firms 
are more specific in providing their services, namely in construction services such as toll road construction, housing 
and hotel construction, concrete supply, contractor and civil service provision, electricity transmission, and so on. The 
building construction subsector is comprised of 23 firms. The number of registered building construction firms in 
2016 to 2020 continues to increase. The increase in the of building construction firms aligns to the expansion in toll 
road construction in Indonesia. The construction of the toll road certainly has a good impact on building construction 
firms, but financing for large development projects requires large capital so that a good debt policy is needed for 
company management. 
According to the data from the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) in Yanwardhana (2020), the 
government expects 346 km of toll roads to be built by 2021, with 97 km already inaugurated and operational, and the 
remaining 249 km expected to be inaugurated before the end of 2021. However, based on the firms’ financial report 
data, the average debt of building construction companies from 2016 to 2019 continued to increase, starting from 2016

5.5 Validation 
5.5.1 The Effect of Non-Debt Tax Shield on Debt Policy 
The non-debt tax shield (NDTS) has no effect on debt policy, thus hypothesis H01 is accepted while HA1 is rejected. 
The results of this study are inconsistent with the findings of Fachri & Adiyanto (2019), Miraza & Muniruddin (2017),  
Nainggolan et al., (2017) which states that non-debt tax shields have a significant effect on debt policy or DER, 
however in line with the research of Mulyani & Agustinus (2022) and E. S. Wulandari et al., (2017) which state that 
the non-debt tax shield has no effect on DER or debt policy. The non-debt tax shield has no effect on debt policy 
because depreciation savings are not in cash, which has no effect on firm financing. Tax savings from depreciation 
have little effect on debt, implying that building construction firm debt is used to finance company operations rather 
than company assets. 
 
5.5.2 The Effect of Firm Growth on Debt Policy 
The regression coefficient value of the firm growth (GROWTH) is -4.9719 with a probability value of 0.0184 less 
than the significance 0.05, means that the firm growth variable has a significant negative effect on the debt policy, 
thus hypothesis H02 is accepted while HA2 is rejected. The results of this study support previous research which states 
that company growth has a significant negative effect on debt policy (Rubiyana & Kristanti,2020; Setiawati & 
Veronica, 2020). 
 
Firm growth has a negative effect on debt policy, which means that the bigger the firm's growth (in this case 
characterized by the number of assets), the lower the DER value, or in other words, the proportion of the firm’s debt 
compared to equity is decreasing. This is because growing firms with increasing asset values do not fund their assets 
with debt, but rather with retained profit or their own capital. 
 
5.5.3 The Effect of Liquidity on Debt Policy 
The liquidity (LIQ) regression coefficient value is -0.3150, with a probability value of 0.8747 greater than the 
significance 0.05. The value shows that the liquidity variable has no effect on debt policy, thus the hypothesis H03 is 
accepted while HA3 is rejected. This supports the previous study that has shown that liquidity has no effect on DER or 
debt policy (Adhitya & Santioso, 2020; Anzella et al., 2019). However, the findings of this study oppose those of 
Natasia & Wahidawati (2015), Nasution et al. (2017), Wulandari & Artini (2019), Utami & Suprihati (2021), who 
show that liquidity has a significant negative effect on DER or debt policy. 
 
Liquidity does not affect debt policy because liquidity only represents the value of the company's current debt. The 
company's current debt will be financed by current assets, so the company's liquidity value will not affect debt policy 
because the payment of current debt comes from current assets, which are the company's internal funds. This is also 
supported by the pecking order theory, which explains that if the company's liquidity is high, then the company has 
large internal funds so that the use of the company's internal data will take precedence. 
 
5.5.4 The Effect of Profit Volatility on Debt Policy 
The regression coefficient value of the profit volatility (PVOL) is -74.2848 with a probability value of 0.0003 less 
than the significance 0.05. This value means that the profit volatility variable has a negative effect on debt policy, thus 
H04 is accepted while HA4 is rejected. This is inconsistent with the findings of Anwar (2019), Maulida & Ikhsan (2018), 
and Utomo & Djumahir (2013). 
 
Profit volatility has a significant negative effect on debt policy, which means that the higher the level of volatility in 
the firm’s profit, the lower the DER value, or in other words, the smaller the proportion of corporate debt compared 
to company equity. This is because firms with volatile profit are considered risky by creditors, making it more difficult 
to receive external capital especially debt. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on this research, we can conclude the following: (a) Non-debt tax shield, Firm growth, Liquidity, and Profit 
volatility simultaneously affect the debt policy of building construction firms listed in Indonesia for 2016-2020 period. 
(b) Non-debt tax shield and liquidity has no significant effect on the debt policy of building construction firms listed 
in Indonesia for 2016-2020 period. (c) Firm growth has a negative significant effect on the debt policy of building 
construction firms listed in Indonesia for 2016-2020 period. This indicates that the more the firm expanding, the debt 
decreasing (d) Profit volatility has a negative significant effect on the debt policy, the result indicates that a firms with 
volatile profit are considered risky by creditors, making it more difficult to receive external capital especially debt.

These findings will certainly have implications, be it for the firm, customers and investors. The firms is expected to 
increase the company's growth because based on research, companies that experience growth will reduce the amount 
of debt. For the investors and creditors of building construction firms in Indonesia, it is important to consider the the 
determinant factors of debt policy and the debt policy itself of the firms before investing and giving credits.

Abstract 
Urban transportation currently has a very important or crucial role because it is one of the factors that strongly support 
the ongoing economy. One of the transportation modes that is currently had a very high demand in Greater Jakarta is 
Kereta Rel Listrik (KRL). KRL need to provide not only availability and facility, but also focus on reliability and 
safety. Had a good operational strategy, especially in the maintenance of rolling stock should be done. Reliability 
centered maintenance (RCM) is one of approach to optimize the rolling stock maintenance practices given that several 
critical components have been operating for certain number of periods. The maintenance concept that focuses on 
reliability brings a good on determining treatment decisions or maintenance strategies. It is also minimized the 
technical problem in operation by knowing its failure mode. Purpose of this research is to provide an overview of the 
reliability concepts for rolling stock maintenance from several research journals. This paper contains of several up-to-
date literature for improving the effectiveness of rolling stock maintenance from each case of journals and papers. 
Future maintenance work is based on establishing reliability-based systems. To provide high reliability rolling stock, 
it is important to introduce reliability analysis methods and to make use of new management indices that consider the 
impact of faults on transport and cost performance.

1. Introduction
Rolling stock in railway industry is a vehicle that can move on rail roads, has special characteristic and advantage to 
transport passenger and goods in mass quantity, punctuality, saving energy safety and has a low level of pollution and 
is more efficient for long-distance and in city transportation. Rolling stock that serve public transportation must be 
safe in operation. Rolling stock maintenance plays an essential role in offering customers safe and reliable transport 
by ensuring that rolling stock is always in good order. Current rolling stock maintenance in Indonesian Railways 
Company is based on the concept of preventive maintenance according to the law of Ministry of Transport. In other 
words, repairs and maintenance are carried out before equipment fails to ensure that operations continue normally. 
Preventive maintenance is composed of the following parts: wear and tear prevention, rolling stock and equipment 
suffer some natural wear and tear during normal operations. Regular rolling stock maintenance, including lubrication, 
replenishment and replacement of consumables, cleaning, adjustment, etc., helps ameliorate this wear and tear. Rolling 
stock maintenance, including inspection, replacement, and repair of worn parts, plays an important role in fault and 
accident prevention.

The application of the RCM framework will assist the expert in determining the treatment program. The preventive 
maintenance based on fixed time intervals makes simple maintenance scheduling, however, to ensure the desired of 
maintenance productivity will be very difficult if the rolling stock is in different uses. Thus, any malfunction of the 
rolling stock depending on its impact on the whole system, will require certain maintenance tasks. RCM to all 
maintenance units and the complexity of the work must be used following step: 
 
Step 1. The first RCM systematic approach used to implement maintained system functions, identify failure modes, 
prioritize failures used to implement maintained system functions, identify failure modes, prioritize failure modes, 
and perform PM tasks. 
 
Step 2. Second stage is to measure that failure on rolling stock has serious problem that effect to the management 
standard by knowing system function and functional failures through: 
 
1) Mean-time between failures (MTBF).  
2) Total maintenance cost.  
3) Mean-time to repair (MTTR).  
4) Availability. 
 
Step 3. The next stage is to analyze the critically factor of potential to occur in each rolling stock component that 
has a high impact on safety, operational failure and maintenance costs. Equipment failure impacting to performance 
of rolling stock requires analysis considering generating critical analysis to work priority (risk priority number). In 
general, the failure mode, effect, and criticality analysis (FMEA/FMECA) require identification of the following 
basic information, the algorithm for calculating equipment criticality is presented. Several approaches are proposed 
in the literature to find a threshold value that distinguishes the critical failure mode from the negligible mode after 
performing the FMECA procedure. Some of them are imprecise and inefficient while others are just qualitative 
procedures to identify two data sets. To overcome the subjectivity of setting a threshold between acceptance and 
non-acceptance of risk, a new analytical procedure has been proposed in this paper. This method begins with the 
aim of identifying two distinct subsets characterized by two distinct trends: the first subset of the RPN grows 
gradually and the second undergoes a sudden increase. (Catelani et al., 2021). 
 
Step 4. Logical tree analysis (LTA) is a decision tree structure to determine the appropriate maintenance task. From 
this figure, where decisions are made operational reliability and safety, operational comfort, and cost efficiency. To 
select optimal maintenance task, each failure mode is assessment trough some quality questions determined by 
maintenance expertise or top management. The first question is asked: Did the failure affected to safety and followed 
by did the operator can detect or monitor the failure mode in normal operation, know that something abnormal or 
detrimental had occurred at the plant? The operator does not need to know exactly what is wrong for the answer to 
be yes. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Improving rolling stock reliability. Previous fault-prevention management focused mainly on the number of faults 
using parameters such as the number of faults per million-operation km. However, indices based only on the simple 
number of cases do not quantify the effects of differences such as traffic density and track section conditions. For 
example, a 10-minute stoppage due to a fault is counted in the same manner as a complete stoppage in operations. 
Clearly, this is not an accurate index of faults. Future maintenance work is based on establishing reliability-based 
systems. To provide high reliability rolling stock, it is important to introduce reliability analysis methods and to make 
use of new management indices that consider the impact of faults on transport and cost performance. The basic 
considerations for introducing reliability methods are listed: 
 
Awareness of impact on customers 
• Individual management of equipment with large impact on train diagrams when fault develops 
• Achievement of effective repair of faults 
Awareness of cost performance 
• Company-wide awareness of cost-effective fault prevention 
• Ranking maintenance method by railway line and elapsed time

Development started in 1988 and the system was put into use gradually from 1991 until it became operational in 1995. 
In addition, this Railway Management System is positioned as part of the Integrated Railway Operation System. 
Especially for components that require maintenance selection with condition monitoring, with recent developments in 
sensors and information technology (IT), conditions at railway facilities can be continuously monitored using sensors 
installed in rolling stock (Tsunashima, 2019). Purpose of systematization, the various data collected on rolling stock 
used to be recorded, documented, and saved by each rolling stock depot and workshop. In addition, data on faults was 
input by depots into operations office computers and by workshops into the workshop Information Management 
System. However. Since both sets of data were managed separately, it was not used to the best effect. Consequently, 
a new system was developed for the following purposes: 
 
• To integrate and share data collected by depots and worships, etc.  
• To make effective use of collected data in improving rolling stock reliability.  
• To make rolling stock management and inspection planning responsive and efficient.

Abstract 
The recently increasing development of electric vehicles (EVs) is the world's attention to reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions as mandated in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The development of EVs in parallel is also aimed at reducing 
fossil fuel consumption. Countries in Europe, America, China, and South Korea showed leadership in developing the 
number and market share of EVs. On the other hand, ASEAN countries, including Indonesia, are still in their early 
stages, and the market share of EVs is still under 1%, although various policies have been launched. Answering this 
gap, the purpose of this study is to conduct a literature review related to the factors affecting EV adoption and an 
understanding of the role and relation of each actor or sub-system in the EV ecosystem. Furthermore, based on the 
literature review results, a conceptual model of the relationship between actors in the EV ecosystem is constructed 
based on variable EV adoption factors. In the following study, this conceptual model can be further improved 
regarding the interdependence of actors within the EV ecosystem in the system thinking framework to select effective 
EV production and adoption policy under a dynamic EV ecosystem.

The world's concern for reducing greenhouse gas emissions was realized with the approval of the Paris Agreement to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on December 12, 2015, in Paris, which was followed 
up by the signing of the agreement on April 22, 2016, in New York. The key agreements in the Paris Agreement are 
mitigation actions to keep global temperature rise below 2°C and strive to keep global temperature rises at 1.5°C, net-

Abstract 
In Indonesia, with high railway use, many of the rail infrastructures intersect with roads in the form of active and 
passive crossings. Several measures had been put to ensure safety on railway crossings, which are the use of 
flashlights, sirens, and gates. However, there were still violating behaviors of road users that cause accidents on 
railway crossings. The study of road users’ behavior at railway crossings had been conducted in numerous countries. 
However, the study of road users’ intention on violating railway crossings in Indonesia is still limited, especially for 
motorcyclists. The motorcycle is the highest transport mode used in Indonesia, which took 80% of total vehicle 
ownership. Hence, underlying factors that might influence motorcyclists’ intention on violating railway crossings need 
to be further studied. In this study, several factors were elaborated, which consist of demographical factors, 
environmental factors, and the use of The Theory of Planned Behavior to explain risky crossing behavior. The findings 
in this study would be used as a reference for further study.

1. Introduction
Traffic accidents were the eighth biggest cause of all casualties in the world with 1,35 million casualties each year 
(World Health Organization, 2018). Among traffic safety issues that need to be concerned is the safety issues at 
railway level crossing. Railway level crossing, often referenced as a railway crossing, level-crossing, highway-railroad 
crossing, or railroad crossing, is the intersection of a road or highway with a railway that is equipped with traffic signs 
and safety devices to ensure a safe crossing of road users (United Nations Economic and Social Council, 2008). 
Despite all the measures to ensure safety at the railway crossing, there were still accidents that took place every year 
involving road users. In Europe, though accidents had reduced significantly in 2020, there were still 1331 railway 
accidents with 687 persons killed and 468 seriously injured (Eurostat, 2022). More than half of fatalities involved 
unauthorized persons on tracks with one-third occurring at level crossings (Eurostat, 2022). In the USA, collisions on 
railway crossings had increased about 13% from 2020 (1902 collisions) to 2021 (2147 collisions) with 236 fatalities 
and 666 injuries (Federal Railroad Administration, 2022). There were 180 accidents caused by road users on highway-
rail crossings that consisted of user inattentiveness, misjudgments, violation, weather, deliberately disregarded 
crossings, and others (Federal Railroad Administration, 2022).  
In Indonesia, rail trip is a widely used transportation mode. There are still many railway infrastructures intercepted by 
highways and roads. Until 2019, there were 4,716 crossings, of which 2,046 (43,4%) of them are passive crossings, 
and 1,431 (30,3%) of them are illegal crossings (Kementrian Perhubungan Direktorat Jenderal Perkeretaapian, 2019). 
It is noted that until October 2020, 198 accidents happened at railway crossings (KAI, 2020). The accidents that 
happened in railway crossings are involving train drivers, rail systems, and road users which are dominated by 
motorized vehicle drivers. The impacts of the accidents are not only the loss of lives and injury, but also infrastructure 
damages, traffic disruptions, and damage to railway institutions’ reputations (I. Watson et al., 2020). In Indonesia, 
KAI (Indonesian Railway Company) experienced losses which was the damage to the trains that escalates from 2020 
(208 damages) until 2021 (213 damages) (Ministry of Transportation Republic of Indonesia, 2022). Recently, until 
March 2022 there were 36 damages to train locomotives. Not only damage to the locomotives, but the accidents also 
resulted in delays in trips that escalated by 14% from 2020 (3.982 minutes) until 2021 (4.554 minutes). Delayed trips

Abstract 
Up to now, the people of Mantewe (South Kalimantan, Indonesia) have utilized ironwood waste by turning it into 
commercial charcoal. However, most charcoal production processes still use traditional combustion methods which 
have negative impacts on the environment and society, such as air pollution due to incomplete combustion. Therefore, 
this study aims to analyze the environmental impact of the charcoal production process using the Life Cycle 
Assessment (LCA) method and to design improvement strategies to reduce environmental impacts using the 
Analytical Network Process (ANP). This study selected a wood charcoal industry in South Kalimantan as the case 
study with a “gate-to-gate” scope. The CML2001 method with nine impact categories selected in the LCA. 
Furthermore, the ANP method is used to design environmental impact reduction strategies based on the LCA results. 
The result of the analysis shows that the main critical point in the wood charcoal industry is the burning of ironwood 
waste, while the second critical point is the use of heat energy from peat soil. Based on the weight, the environmental 
impact reduction strategies obtained from the ANP method are product diversification (0.4031), formulating the right

This method produces a process output in the form of wood charcoal as a final product and waste debris in the form 
of dust and ash. This is detrimental to the charcoal business because there is less charcoal produced, so the method 
used needs to be changed. In addition, the smoke produced from the combustion process is considerable by using this 
method. One alternative method that can be used is to use an environmentally friendly furnace method. Mardijanto 
(2018) designed a green, ergonomic, and environmentally friendly coconut shell charcoal burning stove with a 
combination model of record kiln, ear mound kiln, and drum kiln. The furnace made has green ergonomic 
characteristics, which is more environmentally friendly because 2% of the combustion dust waste is concentrated in 
the drum and can only be spread in a 3m radius around the production site so that there is less exposure to harmful 
dust. The chimney is 4-5m long, so the smoke is spread over the house's roof, and the smoke pollutant is relatively 
more minor. In addition, not much material is burned into ash and dust to produce more charcoal. The calorific value 
of coconut shell charcoal produced has calories of 6,489 cal/gr; an increase in calorific value indicates a reduced water 
content so that less smoke is produced. The water content produced is only 5.704%, and the low water content in the 
charcoal produced also indicates that the smoke produced is relatively small.  
Soolany (2007) recommends making charcoal using the drum kiln method by modifying the chimney section with a 
liquid smoke installation pipe added to make liquid smoke with minimal pollution. In addition, the handrails on the 
drum kiln blanket are also designed to facilitate the disassembly process. Making charcoal with this method is not tied 
to location (it can be moved), and the cost is relatively cheap. In addition to using the drum kiln method, another 
method is the double burner pyrolysis furnace, which can produce two products at once, namely, charcoal and wood 
vinegar. This method is more environmentally friendly because the pyrolysis system involves a carbonization process 
that can minimize the elements that form smoke and soot. In addition, the products produced using this method are of 
good quality. This is also following research conducted by Elsaprike, (2018), which explains that the results of the 
charcoal quality test include the calorific value and the bonded carbon value produced by the double burner pyrolysis 
furnace method, which is significantly higher than the brick lin method. However, the value of water content, volatile 
matter, and ash content was significantly lower. The combustion method using the furnace method also has 
disadvantages, such as it requires skilled workers and the cost of making a furnace is expensive. The combustion 
method can be replaced by using a green ergonomics-based furnace method that has been designed and experimented 
with by Mardijanto (2018), in which the process of making the furnace is relatively easy to imitate because it uses 
used materials. However, the company needs time and energy to make the stove. Moreover, Bailis et al. (2013) 
analyzed comparatively the environmental impacts between hot-tail kilns and metal container kilns. In terms of a 
number of environmental performance indicators, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water demand, energy 
return on investment (EROI), ozone depletion potential (ODP), photochemical oxidation (PCO), acidification, and 
eutrophication, the research recommends that container kilns perform better than hot-tail kilns.  
The results of this ANP processing were consulted with the owner of the wood charcoal industry. Based on the results 
of interviews, product diversification from ordinary charcoal to charcoal briquettes only emits a little smoke when 
burned and is more efficient. However, product diversification into charcoal briquettes is difficult currently because 
there is no consumer need for this product. Meanwhile, the company that cooperates with the owner of the wood 
charcoal industry in Mantewe, namely PT. CPU (collector) only orders ordinary charcoal products. Formulating the 
suitable composition of ingredients, for now, is commonly used in burning wood charcoal in Mantewe. This is done 
to maintain the wood charcoal's quality and reduce the smoke generated from the combustion process. The quality of 
wood charcoal will be even better if a lot of thatch/straw is used in the combustion process. This can happen because 
the weeds block the soil from entering the woodpile undergoing the burning process so that the charcoal produced is 
clean. It is impossible to replace raw materials using coconut shell waste because it is difficult to obtain in Mantewe, 
and no consumers have purchased this product. The combustion method using the furnace method can be done. It just 
requires a large enough capital. Meanwhile, the owner obtains capital from collectors who cooperate to buy their wood 
charcoal products. 
6. Conclusion
Environmental impact analysis on the wood charcoal industry has been carried out using the LCA method with the 
help of GaBi© software. Nine impact categories were obtained with the 2001 CML method, namely, AP, GWP, 
ADPE, ADPF, FAETP, TETP, ODP, HTP, and EP. The critical point in the wood charcoal industry is the burning of 
ironwood waste which contributes the first most significant impact, which is more than 60% on AP, 70% on GWP, 
almost 100% on FAETP, 90% on TETP, 100% on ODP and HTP, and approaching 90% on EP. Thermal energy from 
the ground contributes the second-largest impact, 80% on ADPF, 33% on AP, and 20% on GWP. Meanwhile, the

impact of the use of water, the impact of the use of gasoline, and flakes of charcoal and ash are not too significant 
compared to the two previous impacts. Then, after selecting an alternative strategy using the ANP method, the results 
of the priority weights of each alternative are obtained, then the product diversification gets the highest priority weight, 
which is 0.4031, formulating the suitable material composition with a weight of 0.2765, replacing raw material with 
a weight of 0.26027, and using the furnace method with a weight of 0.0618.

Abstract 
Manipulation of financial statements is an action taken to make a material misstatement of the company's financial 
statements in order to improve performance. Such activities in financial reporting may be brought on by party pressure 
and performance expectations, which do not accurately reflect the parties' true financial situation and performance. 
There are several factors that influence this practice, namely xbrl technology, dividend payout ratio, and net profit 
margin. This study aims to determine how the influence of xbrl technology, dividend payout ratio, and net profit 
margin on the manipulation of financial statements. This study uses quantitative methods. The population in this study 
is State-Owned Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2018-2021 period. The research sample 
was taken using purposive sampling method and 17 companies were selected. The data analysis method used in this 
research is panel data regression analysis and uses EViews 12 software. Result showed that the application of xbrl 
technology, dividend payout ratio, and net profit margin simultaneously affect the manipulation of financial 
statements. Partially xbrl technology and net profit margin have a negative and significant effect on manipulation of 
financial statement, while dividend payout ratio has no significant effect on manipulation of financial statement.

1. Introduction
An entity that is crucial to administering Indonesia's capital market is the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The Indonesian 
stock exchange plays a significant role in boosting the country's economy. The growing number of businesses listed 
on the IDX each year is evidence of this. The Indonesia Stock Exchange now has 787 businesses that are openly 
traded. These businesses include a variety of business models, one of which is a state-owned enterprise (BUMN). 
State-Owned Enterprises are companies in which the public directly participates and owns all or the majority of the 
capital, which comes from segregated state assets. 
Financial reports, which are intended to update stakeholders on the state and financial performance of the company, 
are the result of a number of processes for recording and summarizing business transaction data (Hery, 2018). 
Maximum performance in the company's economy usually leads to the most common crime in the company, namely 
manipulation of financial statements to make it better (Christy et al., 2015). Based on Omar et al., (2014) manipulation 
of financial statements can be defined as a misinterpretation or misrepresentation of financial statements by financial 
market participants, intentionally or unintentionally, by providing false information or manipulative about the

3. The Effect of Dividend Payout Ratio on Manipulation of Financial Statement
Based on  the partial test results (t test) show the coefficient value -0.844161 with a probability value of  0.0065 which
is smaller than the significance level of 0.1 (10%), it can be concluded that Ho is rejected, so that the net profit margin
partially has a significant negative effect on manipulation of financial statements in state-owned companies listed on
the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2021. That is, when the company's net profit margin is high, the level of
manipulation is low or does not manipulate financial statements.
Net profit margin is one of the ratios of profitability that is used to show the company's ability to generate net profits 
after tax. Companies with lower profits tend to give impetus to management to overestimate income or expenses such 
as having significant errors in financial reporting (Kreutzfeldt and Wallace in  Zainudin & Hashim, 2016). 
6. Conclusion
This study aims to analyze the effect of XBRL technology, dividend payout ratio, and net profit margin on the 
manipulation of financial statements in state-owned companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 
2018-2021. The sample in this study were 17 companies with a research period of 4 years and the total data processed 
were 68 companies. In processing the data, this research was assisted by using Excel and EViews 12 software. Based 
on the results of the tests that have been carried out, several conclusions were obtained as follows: 
1.
Based on the descriptive analysis, it can be concluded that:
a. The XBRL technology variable in BUMN companies listed on the IDX for the 2018-2021 period, there are
52 companies that report financial statements in XBRL format, equivalent to 76.47%, while 16 companies
do not report financial statements in XBRL format, equivalent to 23.53%.
b. The dividend payout ratio variable in state-owned companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the
2018-2021 period has an average value that varies in the number of increases and decreases in each study
period.
c. The net profit margin variable for state-owned companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the
2018-2021 period has an average value that varies in the number of increases and decreases in each study
period.
2.
Simultaneously, the XBRL technology variables, dividend payout ratio and net profit margin have a significant
influence on the manipulation of financial statements in state-owned companies listed on the Indonesia Stock
Exchange for the 2018-2021 period. Based on the results of testing the coefficient of determination obtained a
value of 0.105826, meaning that the independent variable consisting of XBRL technology, dividend payout ratio, 
and net profit margin can explain the dependent variable, namely financial statement manipulation by 10.59%
while the remaining 89.41% is explained by other variables outside of the study.
3.
Partially, the influence of each independent variable is as follows:
a.
XBRL technology has a significant and negative effect on the manipulation of financial statements in state-
owned companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2021.
b.
The dividend payout ratio has no significant effect on the manipulation of financial statements in state-
owned companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2021.
c.
The net profit margin has a significant and negative effect on the manipulation of financial statements in
state-owned companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2021.

Abstract 
The purpose of this research is to develop the conceptual model for a sustainable performance framework for 
agriculture businesses in Malaysia that benefit from the positive impact of the entrepreneur competency, the 
dynamic capability of the Internet of Things (IoT), and government support. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has 
brought a devastating impact on the agricultural industry around the world. Farmers were unable to sell their 
agricultural products to the market as a result of a movement control order imposed by the government in order to 
curb the disease outbreaks from spreading to the community, thus, resulting in massive losses. Therefore, this study 
proposed the idea of establishing the ideal framework for farmers as agriculture business entrepreneurs to benefit 
from the entrepreneur competency, dynamic potential of IoT, and government support to sustain their earnings in the 
face of potential future challenges. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis will be used to evaluate the 
hypothesis in this study, which will be done among local Malaysian business farmers who own or manage their own 
farms. The sample will be drawn from a list of farmers registered in the contract farming program run by Malaysia's 
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry (MAFI). The finding may aid farmers, the government, and academia in 
developing the ideal program, which will perpetually contribute to the sustainability of agricultural businesses in the 
future.

Abstract 
This article reviews and tests the relation between co-creation attitude, entrepreneurship self-identity, and 
entrepreneurship intention. Furthermore, this research also explores the antecedent of the co-creation attitude which 
are consist of an interaction attitude, a responsive attitude, and knowledge sharing. The research model that is being 
constructed is leading to the Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) Theory. This study uses a quantitative approach, an 
online questionnaire is used to collect the data. The sample of this research consists of 100 respondents, purposive 
sampling is used to take the sample. Respondents are college students who took the entrepreneurship subject. Data 
analysis and hypothesis testing are using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) software namely Smart PLS. The 
findings of this research are that interaction attitude, a responsive attitude, and entrepreneurship self-identity are 
positively related to a co-creation attitude. Nevertheless, knowledge sharing has no effect on the co-creation attitude. 
Another finding from this study is that the co-creation attitude influences entrepreneurship intention. However, 
entrepreneurship self-identity has no effect on entrepreneurship intention.

1. Introduction
The number of studies examining entrepreneurship intention has grown quickly. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) 
was used by most earlier studies to forecast entrepreneurial intention (Al-Mamary & Alraja, 2022; Tseng et al., 2022). 
An antecedent of entrepreneurship intention is TPB, which is comprised of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived 
behavioral control, according to very clear findings from prior research (Doanh & Bernat, 2019; Yasir et al., 2021). 
The limitation of earlier study is that it was unable to explain in detail the type of attitude, which eventually plays a

The service dominant logic theory method serves as the foundation for the models in this study. The co-creation 
attitude proposed by the service dominant logic theory consists of interaction attitude, knowledge sharing attitude, and 
responsive attitude. As a result, this study examines how co-creation attitude affects entrepreneurial intention. This 
study will also attempt to determine how one's self-identity as an entrepreneur affects one's intention to pursue 
entrepreneurship. 
 
The study's initial conclusion is that co-creation attitude is influenced by interaction attitude. The behavior of persons 
who like interacting with others is the topic of interaction attitude. People with strong interaction attitudes enjoy 
interacting with others, especially those who share their objectives. Through these connections, people will pick up 
ideas, viewpoints, and views that can encourage acting creativity. When seen in the context of entrepreneurship, those 
who want to start their own business would typically engage with other business owners to gain new ideas, which will 
impact how they behave when it comes to innovation. Additionally, this study's findings indicate that responsive 
attitude influences co-creation attitude. Being adaptable to changes or acting fast in response to them is referred to as 
having a responsive attitude towards customer recommendations and criticisms. When people behave in a responsive 
way, they will adjust to changes and use those changes as an incentive to act creatively and foster the co-creative 
attitudes that already exist inside them (Ahn et al., 2020). This study also demonstrates the impact of entrepreneurial 
self-identity on co-creation mindset. This indicates that persons with strong entrepreneurial self-identities will have 
confidence, self-assurance, and optimism, and this might encourage people to interact with other entrepreneurs in a 
positive manner (Musona et al., 2021). The findings also demonstrate a relationship between co-creation attitude and 
entrepreneurship intention. People with a strong sense of co-creation will like interacting with the entrepreneurial 
community in order to gain fascinating experiences that will fuel their ambition to start their own business (Zadeh et 
2038","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
al., 2019). This is consistent with the service dominant logic theory, which holds that people will act in ways that help 
them achieve their goals (Brodie et al., 2019). 
. 
The study's intriguing conclusion is that the attitude toward co-creation is unaffected by knowledge sharing. The 
findings of this study are at odds with those of Guan et al. (2018), Markovic, and Bagherzadeh, among others (2018) 
This outcome is brought about by the tendency of those who are interested in starting their own business to learn a lot, 
pay close attention to what other entrepreneurs have to say, and listen more than they speak. This is due to the fact 
that the person still feels he is unable to impart knowledge to others since he lacks experience and knowledge. This 
study's finding that entrepreneurship self-efficacy had no impact on entrepreneurship intention is another finding that 
conflicts with earlier studies. Entrepreneurship self-identity is the conviction that one can launch their own business. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that while entrepreneurial self-identity does not directly influence entrepreneurial 
intention, it does strengthen the link between the two. When people are confident and self-assured about starting their 
own business, it might pique their interest in following through on their entrepreneurial goals. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The findings of the research mentioned above serve as the foundation for making conclusions, and in this study, the 
conclusion is that the co-creation attitude is influenced by the interaction attitude and responsive attitude. However, 
the attitude toward co-creation is unaffected by knowledge sharing. An additional finding from this research is that 
both entrepreneurial ambition and co-creation attitude are influenced by entrepreneurship self-identity. The study's 
last finding is that the goal to become an entrepreneur is unaffected by one's self-identity as an entrepreneur. However, 
the connection between a co-creative mindset and entrepreneurial intention is further strengthened by entrepreneurial 
self-identification.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has managed to bring the entire world to its knees. It has struck the Philippines and exposed 
the Department of Education’s dilemma in implementing technological capabilities. Although the education sector 
has adopted the use of Learning Management Systems, the Department of Education has trailed in this direction since 
many of the public-school students cannot easily cope up with such technological advancement considering their 
financial capabilities. As a matter of fact, the department opted to implement modular classes through distribution of 
self-learning kits, citing the impossibility of conducting classes using internet now. This research focuses on assessing 
the capabilities of common e-Learning platforms used by public schools in the Department of Education, Region III, 
Division of Pampanga. It also focuses in developing a tailored-fit platform to reduce the data charges incurred by 
stakeholders and base the features according to the requirements and needs of the Department of Education, Region 
III, Division of Pampanga. According to the results of this study, the utilization of Virtual DOM and Base64 in the 
tailored-fit platform has significantly reduced the data charges incurred compared to using common e-Learning 
Platforms.

1. Introduction
People all over the world are acclimating through the new ways of how to do things because it has been over a century 
since the last pandemic, the h1n1. At the present time, the populace is facing an equally devastating pandemic brought 
about by COVID-19. The Philippines has faced an economic meltdown during the first quarter of 2020. The education 
sector, under the supervision of the Department of Education, was one of the most affected by the pandemic. As a 
matter of fact, one of the considerations during the early phases of the pandemic was an academic freeze. 
Considering the president’s directive, to make the Philippines digitally at par with other nations, the Department of 
Education, headed by Sec. Leonor Magtolis-Briones, began to incorporate technological advancements to its charter 
through the use of DepEd’s LRMDS, DepEd Commons and DepEd LIS even before the pandemic happened. Despite 
these initiatives, this unexpected phenomenon has shown that these major leap for the Department of Education, in 
terms of its technological capability may be a little too late. Considering that most of these platforms are not tailored-
fit for the existing orders, memoranda and guidelines, the Department of Education has decided to push for modular 
learning, providing learners with self-learning kits. Majority of the schools that have utilized e-Learning platforms in

Figure 3 shows that according to respondents the most common internet problem that they experience when using e-
Learning platforms is an intermittent signal in their respective area. This comprises 232 respondents or 66.9%. 
Secondary to this problem is the slow internet connectivity which 196 respondents or 56.5% claim. In the Philippines, 
ISP providers offer free data if only texts can be viewed. The problem is that most learning materials used in the public 
education sector are in pdf and picture formats. To solve this main problem, virtual DOM and Base64 was utilized in 
creating the new platform.

Based on the data gathered and analyzed as shown on Table 3, respondents claimed that they have accumulated no 
data charges at all when using the developed platform to download modules / lessons given by their teachers. It has a 
mean of 1.22 and a standard deviation of 0.47. Respondents also claimed that they have accumulated slight data 
charges when using common developed platform to accomplish tasks given by their teachers. It has a mean of 1.66 
and a standard deviation of 0.71. 
 
 
Figure 4. Internet Connectivity Issue 
 
Figure 4 shows that according to respondents the most common internet problems were resolved by the development 
of a new e-Learning platform thru the utilization of Base64 and Virtual DOM compared to what they have experienced 
when using e-Learning platforms. A total of 197 respondents or 56.8% claim that the internet issues were totally 
solved while 99 respondents or 28.5% agrees that it was highly solved. A total of 50 respondents or 14.4% claim that 
the internet issue was moderately solved. In conclusion, the implementation of a new e-Learning platform considering 
the data charges imposed by internet service providers in the Philippines was a success. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The objective of this research is to address the problems that users in the public education sector experience when 
using the common available e-Learning platforms, particularly internet connectivity and data charges. From the result 
of the analysis in the data obtained from 347 respondents of the study, the following conclusions were drawn: 
 
(1) Using the common e-Learning platforms, the students use high volume of data when downloading the 
modules / lessons given by their teachers; hence most students prefer to go to school and personally pick up 
the printed materials despite risks brought about by the pandemic. 
(2) Using the common e-Learning platforms, the students use high volume of data when accomplishing the tasks 
/ assignments given by their teachers; hence most students prefer to go to school and personally deliver their 
printed outputs despite risks brought about by the pandemic.

(3) Using the developed platform which utilizes Virtual DOM and Base64, the students do not use data at all
when downloading the modules / lessons given by their teachers; hence, it solves the internet connection
problem experienced by stakeholders. Base64 converts files into encrypted text format, this was used to take
advantage of the free data charges given by ISPs in the Philippines.
(4) Using the developed platform which utilizes Virtual DOM and Base64, the students use slight data charges
when accomplishing the tasks / assignments given by their teachers; hence, it solves the internet connection
problem experienced by stakeholders.

Abstract 
Financial technology makes it easier for people to access financial products and services. One type of financial 
technology that is an alternative to meet the financing needs of the community is Peer to Peer Lending (P2P Lending). 
P2P Lending is a platform that brings together lenders and borrowers. Funds that lenders lend to borrowers through 
the P2P platform may face various risks, such as the borrower being unable to repay the loan. This study aims to 
analyze the mechanism of P2P lending companies in verifying the ability and eligibility of borrowers based on 
applicable regulations and how the legal responsibility of P2P lending companies to lenders if the borrower is unable 
to pay the loan. The research method used in this research is juridical-normative. An important finding in this study 
is that P2P lending companies carry out credit scoring and risk assessments when providing loans to borrowers. 
However, the legal responsibility of P2P lending companies to lenders is only limited to conducting credit analysis of 
borrowers to reduce the risk of default. However, to protect against the risk of default by borrowers, P2P lending 
companies protect them with insurance or protection funds. Therefore, Financial Services Authority (FSA) needs to 
educate P2P Lending, borrowers, and other users regarding the process and responsibility for funds provided by 
lenders.

Abstract 
In the framework of Total Quality Management, this study discusses how the concept of leadership has developed 
(TQM) through a systematic literature review and tries to explore areas that still have opportunities for further 
research. In this paper, the literature analysis carried out examines papers that are only sourced from the Scopus 
database, this has the impact of limitations and may not cover all papers and research related to Total Quality 
Leadership and Management (TQM). This systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). Initial search returns 1.949 documents and 
after applying the screening process, 28 documents successfully passed all the inclusion criteria set. The following 
parts will go over the study's findings in greater depth: Total Quality Management (TQM), Leadership, Performance 
(impact). The results of the synthesis of the merger and synthesis of 28 papers, found a research gap, namely the need 
to build a robust (robust) TQM model, which helps organizations achieve business excellence, improve quality, be 
competitive and become a force to achieve higher productivity, profitability, and sustainable business performance. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Total quality management (TQM) is a management philosophy that stresses organizational and personal values 
(Krajcsák, 2019). Total quality management is a management concept that aims to boost customer happiness and 
productivity (V. Kumar & Sharma, 2017). TQM is widely acknowledged as a general management tool that may be 
used by any company (R. Kumar et al., 2011). Companies that adopt TQM result in a strong production system 
(Banuro et al., 2017). Building a strong TQM model will help organizations achieve business advantage, quality 
improvement, and competitiveness (Psomas & Antony, 2017). TQM has a major impact on all facets of long-term 
sustainability (Tasleem et al., 2019). TQM approaches require time to make an influence on organizational 
performance (Qasrawi et al., 2017). 
TQM is a crucial part of leadership (Sfakianaki et al., 2018). Leaders take a fundamental role in quality improvement 
efforts (Rodriguez et al., 2018). A competent leader may blend and adjust his style to the group's traits, its members' 
maturity, the work at hand, and the environment (Sfakianaki et al., 2018). Successful leaders are those who can 
influence those around them to ensure that optimal performance is achieved from the resources within the organization 
(Alloubani et al., 2019). Leadership commitment and direction involving a quality workforce that understands and 
participates effectively in managing operations, quality tools, The use of data and information in conjunction with a 
well-thought-out strategy will yield the desired results (Alanazi, 2020).

productivity and work effectiveness (Akparobore & Omosekejimi, 2020). Situational leadership has an impact on the 
success of TQM implementation (Kustono, 2019). Leaders with the sensing-thinking (ST) and sensing-feeling (SF) 
personality types are comfortable with continual improvement, but leaders with Organizational innovation is more 
important to the intuitive-thinking (NT) and intuitive-feeling (NF) personality types (V. Kumar & Sharma, 2017). 
Barriers, problems, and risks encountered in the review in this paper are around the absence of top management and 
ineffective leadership are the main obstacles in implementing TQM (V. Kumar et al., 2020). It is interesting to note 
together, according to Kustono (2019) situational leadership has no effect on employee performance levels and 
according to Kwateng & Darko (2017) management competence and understanding related to quality management 
are the main problems in implementing TQM. 
6. Conclusion
Total quality management (TQM) is a management philosophy that places a strong emphasis on both organizational 
and individual values (Krajcsák, 2019). Varied sectors and nations have different approaches to TQM (Amin et al., 
2017). Teachers of TQM such as Deming, Crosby, and Juran agree that leadership is critical in quality management 
(Bouranta, 2020). Leaders take a fundamental role in quality improvement efforts (Rodriguez et al., 2018). The most 
crucial factor in achieving TQM is leadership (Vimal Kumar & Sharma, 2018). TQM is an important aspect of 
management (Sfakianaki et al., 2018). Successful TQM must be initiated and maintained by top management 
(Rodriguez et al., 2018). 
One thing that is the main highlight in this paper is as stated in RQ5. Research gap areas (opportunities)? Ilieş et al., 
(2017), state that another research direction in the future is to continue to analyze the components of the TQM system, 
to approach the integration of the TQM system with other systems, such as environmental management. Building a 
strong TQM model will help organizations achieve business advantage, quality improvement, and competitiveness 
(Psomas & Antony, 2017). TQM is part of standard quality management; however, the definition varies from one 
researcher to the next (Amin et al., 2017). TQM has a significant impact on all facets of long-term sustainability 
(Tasleem et al., 2019). TQM refers to a company's ability to boost productivity, profitability, and long-term 
performance (V. Kumar et al., 2020). As a result of combining and synthesizing 28 selected papers for review, it was 
found that the research gap in this review is to build robust (robust) TQM models. 
In this paper, the source of the search for papers reviewed only comes from Scopus, of course, this has a limited impact 
and may not comprehensively cover all papers and research related to Total Quality Management (TQM). For further 
research, it is highly recommended to involve data and other sources in compiling related papers, so that the review 
will be more solid. 
In conclusion, despite some of the noteworthy limitations of this paper, this paper can be a source of reference for the 
discussion of Total Quality Management (TQM). And this paper as a whole has discussed and answered all of the 
research questions of this paper, starting from an overview of the development of research related to TQM to 
discussing opportunities that are areas of research gaps. It is hoped that this paper can be useful for various groups to 
be able to develop better TQM topics in the future.

Abstract 
The Islamic capital market is a securities trading system whose instruments and transaction mechanisms do not 
conflict with sharia principles. Thus, the Islamic capital market has the obligation to comply with applicable laws 
as well as Islamic law. One of the principles in the Islamic capital market is the prohibition of gharar or 
uncertainty. However, the capital market is inherently uncertain in the form of investment risk. Knowing this, this 
thesis aims to find out how legal protection guarantees a sharia compliant transaction for retail investors in the 
Islamic capital market. The reasearch was conducted using a normative jurdicial method which was then carried 
out a qualitative analysis od the data found. The results of this study indicate that the provisions governing the 
transaction mechanism in the islamic capital market have provided protection that ensures the implementation of 
investment of investment activities does not conflict with sharia prinsiples. Protection is provided through an 
online-based trading system that automatically rejects transactions that contain elements that are contrary to sharia 
principles. However, the transactions carried out in the Islamic capital market are still too small when compared 
to transactions in the conventional capital market. So that legal protection for transactions in the Islamic capital 
market cannot affect the stability of the market as a whole. Yet, this does not mean that there are no protection at 
all. The Indonesia Stock Exchange as a facilitator who has a function as a capital market regulator, has imposed 
restrictions on trading volume with provisions for trading halts and price limits. However, due to the dynamic 
nature of the capital market, it is necessary to review and update repeatedly in order to produce effective provisions 
for stabilizing the capital market.

Abstract 
As part of citizens, the fulfilment and protection of the rights of people with visual impairments must be 
considered by the state, including services in banking financial services institutions. The implementation and 
protection of rights for blind customers with disabilities in Indonesia are regulated based on Law Number 8 of 
2016 concerning Persons with Disabilities. This study aims to analyze whether Law Number 8 of 2016 concerning 
Persons with Disabilities has guaranteed legal protection for persons with disabilities who are blind in accessing 
services in banking institutions. In addition, what efforts should be undertaken to fulfil the rights of persons with 
disabilities who are blind to banking services. This research uses normative legal research methods. Based on the 
research that has been done, it was found that Law Number 8 of 2016 has not provided protection and fulfilment 
of the rights of the visually impaired in banking services. In addition, banking institutions in Indonesia have 
generally not provided friendly banking facilities for people with visual impairments. Therefore, the government, 
in this case, the Financial Services Authority, should make more specific and detailed regulations regarding 
accessibility for people with visual impairments in banking services.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the legal protection of customer personal data in internet banking services and what 
customers can take legal remedies if their data is not protected. Customer data in this service needs to be 
considered because it involves a person's privacy data and must be provided to the Bank to carry out transactions. 
The research method used is normative legal research by examining legal principles and systematic law with 
qualitative data followed by a conceptual approach and legislation. The result of this research is that there are two 
forms of the legal protection of customer data in internet banking services, namely preventive legal protection 
with a self-regulation approach from the internal legal rules of bank administrators and a government regulation 
approach in Law Number 10 of 1998 concerning Banking and Law Number 8 of 1999 concerning Consumer 
Protection. Second, repressive legal protection is the responsibility of the Bank in the form of handling customer 
complaints to compensation for losses to customers as regulated in Bank Regulation No. 10/10/PBI/2008 
concerning Settlement of Customer Complaints, Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 10/1/PBI/2008 concerning 
Banking Mediation, and Law Number 19 of 2016 concerning Electronic Information and Transactions has 
regulated the protection of personal data of customers who use Internet Banking. Efforts that customers can make 
if personal data in internet banking services are not protected can make customer complaints and mediation. If 
there is no agreement, the customer can take legal remedies consisting of civil legal remedies, criminal legal 
remedies, and administrative, legal remedies.

1. Introduction
Technological developments have had a major impact, especially in the banking sector, with the innovation of 
electronic banking service products, one of which is Internet banking. Internet banking is different from 
conventional banking; on internet banking, the invisible process raises many questions about legal arrangements 
for customers' personal data. (Tacino, 2013) 
In banking law number 10 of 1998, the personal data held by the customer becomes secretive the bank must 
protect that. Just like humans in general, which is not inputted from the perfect word, resulting in the bank not 
being able to provide maximum protection in safeguarding the personal data of its customers, this will give rise 
to the misuse of customer personal data by people who do not have authority over the right to the data which is 
then used for personal, commercial needs or other interests that can harm customers. (Sarapy, 2013) Thus, there 
are two problems formulated in this research: (1) How is the legal protection of customers' personal data in internet 
banking services? And (2) What efforts can be made by the customer if the customer's personal data in internet 
banking services are not protected? 
1.1 Objectives 
The purpose of this research is to find out the form of the legal protection of customer’s data in internet banking 
services, as well as what customers can make efforts if their data is not protected or data leaks due to negligence 
or by a third party so that it can result in losses. Therefore, this research has several limitations, such as the research 
being conducted on regulations governing banking and regulations governing Internet Banking Services. 
Furthermore, the research is conducted on regulations governing legal protection in the form of regulation of 
customer data.

of customer personal data to third parties due to statutory orders, this is legal and legal following legal provisions 
and needs to be done. However, it is different if the bank secret is leaked illegally or as a result of the bank's 
negligence. So this, of course, will give losses to customers. Because the data is leaked, and if it reaches 
irresponsible hands, it will undoubtedly provide several losses for the customer whose personal data is spread 
freely. 
 
Therefore, customers who feel aggrieved can take many legal remedies to demand accountability from the bank. 
The initial step that the aggrieved customer can take is to make a complaint under the rules stipulated by PBI 
Regulation No.7/7/PBI/2005 regarding the settlement of customer complaints which can be done in two ways, 
namely verbally by directly coming to the bank or call the call center, the second in writing sends an email to the 
bank concerned. 
 
In the case of making a complaint using the methods mentioned above, the customer concerned must attach: 
1. Photocopy of identity. 
2. Proof of deposit or withdrawal. 
3. Proof of savings book or deposit slip. 
4. Proof of checking account. 
5. Or other data that can support the complaint. 
 
The bank that receives the complaint from the customer who feels aggrieved is obligated to accept the complaint 
from the customer both verbally and in writing; then, the bank is obliged to explain the chronology, and the 
problem of the incident parties (customer and bank) can mediate. (Bernadette, 2022) 
 
The process for implementing banking mediation is also regulated in Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 
8/5/PBI/2006 jo. Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 10/10/PBI/2008 concerning Banking Mediation. Consumer 
complaints by financial services authorities according to Financial Services Authority Regulation No. 
1/POJK.07/2013 concerning Consumer Protection in the Financial Services Sector in Article 40 paragraph (1), 
paragraph (2), paragraph (3). However, if this problem shows that there is a criminal or civil case, then the 
resolution process will go through criminal or civil lines; following the written rules, all bank offices can receive 
customer complaints, which can be done through mediation. (Raditio, 2014) 
 
Mediation is a dispute resolution process in the form of negotiations to solve problems through a neutral and 
impartial outside party who will work with the disputing parties to help find a solution in resolving the dispute to 
the satisfaction of both parties. If there is no agreement between the two parties, then legal action can be taken, 
namely the litigation process in the District Court. Legal remedies that can be taken consist of civil, criminal, and 
administrative legal remedies. 
  
Thus, the dispute resolution process through the District Court is carried out as in filing an ordinary civil dispute 
lawsuit by filing a claim for compensation, whether based on an unlawful act based on an element of error. The 
consequence of the choice of dispute resolution in the District Court is the length of time for settlement of cases, 
and the decisions handed down often reflect the absence of a unified work or unified legal opinion between the 
District Court, High Court, and the Supreme Court. (Febby, 2022) 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the research conducted by the author, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
 
1. There are two forms of legal protection for customer data in internet banking services, namely preventive 
legal protection and repressive legal protection. Preventive legal protection is an effort made by the 
government to protect consumers or customers in general with a self-regulation approach from the 
internal law of the Internet Banking service provider itself and the government regulation approach in 
Article 29 paragraph (4) and Article 40 paragraph (1) and (2) Law Number 10 of 1998 concerning 
Amendments to Law Number 7 of 1992 concerning Banking and Article 4 of Law Number 8 of 1999 
concerning Consumer Protection. Repressive legal protection is an effort taken if a problem occurs that 
has the potential to harm customers. The problem occurred because of the leakage of unprotected 
customer data. So the efforts that customers can make if a data leak causes losses are the responsibility 
of the digital banking service provider, namely the bank itself. The accountability of the bank can be in 
the form of handling customer complaints to compensation for losses to customers as regulated in Bank 
Indonesia Regulation (PBI) Number 7/7/PBI/2005 in conjunction with Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 
10/10/PBI/2008 concerning Settlement of Customer Complaints, Bank Indonesia Regulation No.

Transactions has regulated the protection of personal data of customers who use Internet Banking. 
2. Customers can make efforts if personal data in internet banking services are not protected, meaning that 
it causes harm to customers. They can make customer complaints and mediation first. If there is no 
agreement between both parties (the customer and the bank), the customer can take legal action, namely 
the litigation process, in the District Court. Legal remedies that can be taken consist of civil legal 
remedies, criminal legal remedies, and administrative, legal remedies.

Abstract 
Audit Quality is an auditor’s tendency to detect and disclose an error or fraud that occurs in a client’s accounting 
system. This study aims to determine the effect of publication age, audit fee, and committee meeting on audit quality 
both simultaneously and partially. The population in this study were all companies in the infrastructure, utilities, and 
transportation sectors listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2015-2019 totaling 76 companies. The 
sampling technique used purposive sampling with predetermined criteria obtained from 31 companies with a total 
sample of 155 data. This study uses logistic regression analysis using SPSS version 25. This study’s results indicate 
that simultaneously publication age, audit fee, and committee meeting affect audit quality. Partially, publication age 
has a significant positive effect on audit quality. Meanwhile, the audit fee has no effect on audit quality. Committee 
meeting also has no effect on audit quality. Furthermore researchers can use other independent variables that have not 
been included in this study. In addition, further researchers are expected to conduct research with a different object. 
This is intended so that research can provide new insights and a broad picture of what factors affect audit quality.

1. Introduction
Financial reports can be used as one of the decision-making bases as well as to guarantee the third parties and 
community that financial reports can be trusted. In order to gain the client’s trust, an audit process is required on the 
financial statements done by the external auditor. A financial reports audit is essential to the needs of companies and 
management parties of the company to gain the public’s trust. Thus, financial statements do not mislead investors in 
deciding on investing. 
According to DeAngelo (1981) in Pramaswaradana & Astika, (2017), audit quality is the probability of an auditor 
finding and reporting an error or deviation occurring in a client accounting system. However, auditors are not always 
able to produce high-quality audits because they cannot detect an error or fraud in the financial reports. It is proven 
by some cases that occurred, such as cases of Jasa Marga Persero Tbk, Garuda Indonesia Tbk. Inc. and Inovisi 
Infracom Tbk. Inc., which in the end was sanctioned by the Financial Services Authority (OJK) due to cases of bribery 
and fraud in the company’s financial reports. 
In addition, there are still many In addition, there are still many inconsistencies in previous research, such as in 
publication age variables, which greatly affect the audit quality. The longer the publication age of a company, the 
smaller the discretionary accruals which will improve audit quality because earnings management will be detected 
more quickly by the auditor (Amaliatussa’diah & Aprilia, 2021). It is contrary to the research of Paramita & Latrini, 
(2015); Pramaswaradana & Astika, (2017), which stated that  publication age never affects the audit quality because 
the age of the company does not provide a guarantee that the old company has better quality than the younger company, 
so that age is not appropriate to be used as a provision in producing good quality.  
On the audit fee variable, according to Andriani & Nursiam, (2019) the fee audit obtained by the auditor has a big 
effect on the audit quality produced by the independent auditor. It aligns with the research of Pramaswaradana & 
2079","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

publication age affects audit quality. These results are in line with the hypothesis that the researcher has put 
forward that publication age has a positive effect on audit quality the longer a company goes public, it is 
considered to have good quality in various ways. Managers are also considered capable of providing clear 
sources of information so as to facilitate the auditor in conducting audits because of the availability of 
information to detect if fraud occurs. However, the results of this study indicate that publication age affects 
audit quality. The results of this study align with research conducted by Amaliatussa’diah & Aprilia (2021), 
which state that publication age affects audit quality. It was explained that the age of the company provides 
a guarantee that the old company has better quality than the younger company, so that the age of publication 
is appropriate to be used as a benchmark in producing good audit quality. 
2.
The regression coefficient value of the audit fee is 0,009 and the significance level is 0.952. The value is
greater than the significance level (α), which is 0.05. Thus, H03 is accepted, and Ha3 is rejected, meaning that
the audit fee does not affect audit quality. These results do not align with the hypothesis that the researcher
has put forward that audit fees have a positive effect on audit quality. The results of this study are in line with
research conducted by Novrilia et al., (2019) which state that audit does not affect audit quality. It is because
whether a high audit fee is given does not make it possible to predict the audit quality of a company. Quality
can be seen from the attitude of an auditor whether the auditor has a professional and independent attitude or
not.
3.
The value of the regression coefficient of committee meeting is 2,004, and the significance level is 0.062.
The value is greater than the significance level (α) of 0.05. Thus, H04 is accepted, and Ha4 is rejected, meaning
that committee meetings do not affect audit quality. These results do not align with the hypothesis that the
researcher has put forward that committee meetings affect audit quality. The results of this study are in line
with the research conducted by Trisnawati & Nurbaiti (2019), which state that committee meetings do not
affect audit quality. It is because although one of the duties and responsibilities of the audit committee is to
review the financial information that will be issued by the company to the public, to review the compliance
with laws and regulations related to the activities of public companies and to review the implementation by
internal auditors and oversee the implementation of actions taken by the company. Further action by the
Board of Directors on the findings of the internal auditor will not affect any opinion that will be given by the
auditor. There are many other considerations that may greatly affect the auditor's opinion. The auditor will
provide an opinion according to the condition of the company.
6. Conclusion
This study aims to determine the effect of the independent variables consisting of publication age, audit fees and audit 
committee meetings on the dependent variable, namely audit quality at infrastructure, utility and transportation service 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2015-2019 period consisting of 31 companies. with a study 
period of 5 years. The number of this study was 155 samples, but in this study, there was outlier data with the results 
of outlier data being 146 samples. Publication age, audit fee and audit committee meetings have a significant 
simultaneous effect on audit quality in Infrastructure, Utilities and Transportation sector companies listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2015-2019. Publication age partially has a significant positive effect on audit 
quality in Infrastructure, Utilities and Transportation companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 
2015-2019. Audit fee partially has no effect on audit quality in Infrastructure, Utilities and Transportation sector 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2015-2019. Committee meeting partially has no effect on 
audit quality in Infrastructure, Utilities and Transportation sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
(IDX) in 2015-2019. For further research, this research can be used to develop knowledge about audit quality in 
Infrastructure, Utilities and Transportation sector companies and to re-examine the variables of audit fees and audit 
committee meetings which has no effect in this study. The next researchers can use other independent variables which 
were not included in this research. Moreover, the next researchers are expected to do research with different objects. 
It is intended so that research can provide new insights and a broad picture of what factors affect audit quality.

Abstract 
Six sigma as a proven improvement methodology has been widely used among organizations in various industries. It 
focuses on improving production processes, reducing variation, and eliminating waste leading to higher efficiency and 
profitability. Six sigma has been applied in Indonesian manufacturing industries and continues to grow. This paper 
discussed six sigma implementations in Indonesian manufacturing industries that identifies sigma levels from various 
manufacturing sectors and summarizes current evidence that contributes to revealing the current sigma level. This 
study reviews six sigma project cases from one of six sigma consulting firms in Indonesia. Six sigma project cases 
were collected from 2019-2022, the total project cases during that period included 120 six sigma project, and 58 
projects that meet the criteria has been selected for this study. The results show that from 58 selected projects, the 
average sigma value of the observed industries was 3.7 before improvement and 4.1 after improvement. However, the 
highest sigma level before improvement was 4.8 which came from fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector and 
the highest sigma level after improvement was 5.4 which came from the packaging sector.

1. Introduction
Six sigma first introduce 1987 in Motorola by Bill Smith for project improvement (Antony et al. 2017). 
Implementation of six sigma is broadly used as a guideline for making better quality products and decreasing 
manufacturing process variation (Tjahjono et al. 2010; Herlambang 2020). Six sigma as a quality improvement method 
widely used by organizations because six sigma very popular in industrial sectors for quality improvement initiatives 
(Smętkowska and Mrugalska 2018; Utomo 2020; Singh and Rathi 2020). In Indonesia, six sigma has been 
implemented in many manufacturing sectors, like automotive, heavy industry, food and beverage, petrochemical, oil 
and gas, and small-medium enterprises (Widjajanto and Purba 2021). 
This paper was created with the background of seeing the sigma level in the Indonesian manufacturing company. 
Project quality improvement cases were collected from one of the training and consulting firms in Indonesia that focus 
on helping many companies and professionals in implementing six sigma. This firm has helped many companies 
implement six sigma through training and consulting programs. This research aims of seeing the actual sigma level in 
the manufacturing sector in Indonesia by measuring and transforming the quality improvement project into a sigma 
level.

5. Conclusions and Future Research 
This study reveals sigma value for various manufacturing sector based on an improvement project case study in 
Indonesia, in total 16 manufacturing sector has been studied. The average sigma value for all sectors in this study was 
3.7 before improvement and 4.1 after improvement, there is increment 10%. This shows that six sigma initiatives 
bring better process performance. Increased sigma value will reduce the defect hence cost of poor quality (COPQ) 
will be reduced. Reducing the COPQ can be a gold mine for companies. Systematic application of the six sigma 
DMAIC methodology in manufacturing will help companies bring down the cost of quality and increase profit 
(Murumkar et al. 2018). The highest sigma value obtained in this study was 5.4, still below 6 sigma, this still needs 
radical improvement to achieve a better result. After a deep investigation of the case study, it appears that utilization 
of six sigma tools not yet maximized. Most of the the tools being employed in the project is the simple tools. Utilization 
of advance tools is still required for example the application of design of experiment (DOE) for quality improvement, 
since none of the project case study employs this powerful tool.

Abstract 
Taxes are mandatory contributions to the state by individuals or entities of a coercive nature. The company is one of 
the taxpayers who must carry out their obligations in carrying out tax payments. But from the company side, tax is a 
burden that will reduce net profit so that the company will look for ways to reduce the tax burden, one of which is 
through tax avoidance. This study aims to examine and obtain empirical evidence about the effect of capital 
intensity, company age, and company size on tax avoidance at mining sector companies listed in Indonesian Stock 
Exchange in the period of 2016-2021. The number of samples was determined using purposive sampling technique 
with a total of 66 samples. Tax Avoidance in this study was measured using the effective tax rate (ETR) value. Data 
were analyzed using panel data regression analysis. The results of this study indicate that capital intensity and 
company size have a positive effect on tax avoidance, while company age has no effect on tax avoidance. 
Keywords 
Capital Intensity, Company Age, Company Size, Tax Avoidance, ETR. 
1. Introduction
Taxes are the largest source of income for the Indonesian economy, which is used as a budget for regular state 
spending and national development in accordance with the KUP Law No. 28 of 2007 which contains general 
provisions for tax procedures. Tax is the contribution of the taxpayer to the state owed by individuals or entities that 
are coercive under the law by not getting direct reciprocity and is used for state purposes for the greatest prosperity 
of the people. Tax avoidance is an effort made by taxpayers to reduce or eliminate all tax debts that are carried out 
legally by taking advantage of existing tax regulatory loopholes. This is an obstacle in collecting taxes in the end of 
which it will reduce state revenue from the tax sector. To reduce tax avoidance practices carried out by companies, 
in a company it is necessary to manage the company well. Based on data from the State Budget, tax revenue in 
Indonesia remains the largest source of revenue in the State Budget. The source of this tax revenue is used by the 
state to meet the needs of the state.  
According to Putri and Putra (2017) stated that tax avoidance is a legal way to carry out tax avoidance by taking 
advantage of the weaknesses of tax law, but resulting in the non-achievement of state goals to maximize state 
revenue from the tax sector. Tax avoidance on the one hand is allowed and does not violate the rules but the 
government is less receptive because it greatly affects the state's tax revenue, so the state does not get the maximum 
income. One of the cases of companies that take advantage of the weakness of tax law to do tax avoidance is PT. 
Adaro Energy. 
The existence of inconsistencies carried out by previous research, such as in the variable of capital intensity 
according to research conducted by Nugraha and Mulyani (2019) and Suciarti et al. (2020) capital intensity affects 
tax avoidance because companies that have high fixed assets do not necessarily have tax avoidance purposes, but it 
is possible that the company has other objectives, namely to run  company operations. Meanwhile, according to 
Masrurroch et al. (2021) which states that capital intensity does not affect tax avoidance because most of the assets 
owned by the company are assets for resale. Therefore, the depreciation cost of fixed assets in the company that is 
sampled by this study cannot be intended for tax avoidance practices but tends only to run the company's operations. 
Then on the company age variable according to research conducted by Dewinta and Setiawan (2016) stated that 
company age affects tax avoidance because the longer the company operates, the higher the company's tax

5.3 Discussion 
5.2.1 Effect of Capital Intensity on Tax Avoidance 
Based on table 3 capital intensity partially has a positive effect on Tax Avoidance, so that it supports H1. This is 
because companies that have high fixed assets do not necessarily have the purpose of conducting tax avoidance, but 
it is possible that the company has other goals, namely, to run the company's operations. This is in line with research 
conducted by Suciarti et al. (2020) and Nugraha and Mulyani (2019) which states that Capital Intensity partially has 
a positive effect on tax avoidance. 
 
5.2.2 Effect of Company Age on Tax Avoidance  
The age of the Company partially did not have a significant effect on tax Avoidance, so it did not support H2. This 
is because of the age that has long been listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, it will reveal social responsibility to 
increase investor confidence in order to continue investing so as not to take advantage of loopholes to carry out tax 
avoidance actions. This is in line with research conducted by Bratadilaga et al. (2020) and Permatasari (2020) which 
states that the age of the company does not affect tax avoidance. 
 
5.2.3 Effect of Company Size on Tax Avoidance 
The size of the Company partially positively affects the Tax Avoidance, so that it supports H3. This is because the 
higher the level of profit generated by the company, it will increase the amount of income tax, because the profit 
generated by the company is the basis for the imposition of income tax so that the company will try to avoid tax 
increases by doing tax avoidance. This is in line with research conducted by Dewinta and Setiawan (2016) and 
Anggara and Pratomo (2018) which shows that the size of the company partially affects the positive effect on tax 
avoidance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The test result found that the capital intensity and company size positively affected Tax Avoidance. In contrast, 
company age did not affect Tax Avoidance. This study concludes that the higher the capital intensity and the 
company age, the higher the Tax Avoidance carried out by the company so that it can help the company to get a 
good reputation from stakeholders. This study concludes that the higher the capital intensity and company age, the 
higher the tax avoidance carried out by the company so that it can have an impact on the State Budget. This study 
aims to determine the influence of independent variables consisting of capital intensity, company age and company 
size on a dependent variable, namely tax avoidance on mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange for the 2016-2021 period, which consists of 13 companies with a research period of 6 years. The number 
of this study was 78 samples, but in this study, there was outlier data with the results of the outlier data being 66 
samples. The study was conducted on companies registered in one sector of manufacturing companies, namely 
companies in the mining sector so that it does not describe tax avoidance measures on all manufacturing companies. 
This study calculates tax avoidance using the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) proxy so there are many other proxies that 
have not been used in calculating tax avoidance. This research has limitations in conducting this research with 
relatively short time constraints.

First, further research can use different objects, namely non-first-country companies or manufacturing companies in 
the food and beverage sub-sector. Second, researchers can then use other free variables that are considered capable 
of affecting tax avoidance, such as sales growth, CSR. Third, future research may use different proxy disclosure 
criteria such as CETR.

Abstract 
Logistic service providers in (trucking) needed to support Supply Chain activities. To provide services and improve 
business performance, it is necessary to investigate deeper whether the company's IT capabilities and Information 
Communication Technology (ICT) are the main issues. This literature search was performed as a literature review. A 
literature review is defined as the process of identifying, assessing, and interpreting all available research evidence 
with the aim of providing answers to specific research questions. The keywords are Logistic Service Provider or 
Service Quality or “ICT” or “IT Capability” or “Traceability” or Firm’s Performance or Service Quality or Perceived 
Risk or Traceability or Information Communication Technology. The database used for the literature review was 
Google Scholar. In addition, the company's IT capability is a moderating variable between service quality, perceived 
risk, and traceability variables on company performance. However, ICT positively mediates the relationship between 
perceived risk and company performance. Therefore, enterprise I.T. and ICT capabilities are key to reducing various 
problems.

1. Introduction
Logistics Service Providers, especially trucking, have an important role in export and import activity and domestic 
shipping. In Indonesia, the logistic sector contributes 5.53% of export and import activity (Puspa, 2020). Meanwhile, 
trucking as land transportation is one of the lowest costs and most efficient transportation compared to other transport 
mort such as trains or vessels. 
According to (Hapag-Lloyd, 2022), shipping costs on major global trade routes are about seven times what they were 
a year ago. At this high cost, shipping companies cannot ensure on-time delivery, contributing to schedule quality 
worldwide. 
Global logistics conditions that are experiencing economic contraction make the importance of customer service that 
is more accountable, can be traced easily, and reduce risks for service customers (Lee & Wong, 2021).

5. Conclusions 
The purpose of this study is to provide services and improve business performance in LSPs and to provide a literature 
review of ICT’s contribution to logistics and transportation with two main objectives:  
 
1. classify research based on the main themes and methods as a guide for practitioners and academics; and 
2. propose directions for future research, mainly for academic research. 
 
6. Limitation and Future Research 
The literature limitations are that the researchers used the Google scholar database for searching the literature. The 
research quality discovery using Google scholar varies. Therefore, future research should use Scopus or Web of 
Science. Those databases curate high-quality research papers. Second, the literature review method uses a narrative 
approach. The limitation of the narrative literature review is too subjective. Therefore, future research should use a 
bibliometric approach using prominent software.

Abstract 
As one of 4.0 revolution technologies, artificial intelligence or AI has been used in various areas, including legal, to 
help humans do cognitive tasks. It brings out the authors' attention to examine the use of AI in legal areas and how AI 
works has to be regulated. Then, the development of AI in China, the United States, and Indonesia are subject of the 
author's examination. The study uses a normative legal research method with a legal, conceptual, and comparative 
approach. Later on, the study finds out that the implementation of AI in legal has been used both in the private and 
public sectors, including judiciary systems. The type of AI used in legal fields is a machine and deep learning, big 
data exchange, optical character or facial recognition, and robotic process automation. It concludes that most AI 
applications in private sectors are used as platforms to analyze or make documents, provide portal information, and 
consult or find the right lawyer. Meanwhile, most of the AI application in the public sector is used for digitalizing the 
administration process, evidence and documents, portal information, and recidivism systems for judge's consideration 
of defendants. In the judiciary system, AI has helped minimize judges' bias to reach fairness and improve time and 
cost efficiency. However, the regulation shall be existed to reduce the risks that may arise, provide legal protection 
for its users, and avoid the development of AI that can harm the public.

Artificial Intelligence, Law, Legal Service, Judicial Systems, AI regulations 
1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence as a technology of the 4.0 revolution has become one of the most important factors since 2010 
(Patnaik and Ravi 2021). Patnaik and Ravi (2021) said that this is because AI can store large amounts of data and 
process it at a very high speed, solve problems, and compete with human capabilities. AI applications can be easily 
found on voice services such as Siri, Ok Google, Alexa, automatic customer service used by banking and internet 
services, e-commerce, autonomous vehicles, curriculum vitae screening of job applicants, and even AI capture clearer 
images in surveillance videos. In addition to these fields, AI is also carried out in legal area. The use of technology in 
the legal area is known as LegalTech terminology (Mania 2022). Szostek (2021) said that LegalTech combines 
technology to provide legal services. Collaboration between technology and law, LegalTech allows as a means or 
facility to support efficiency and justice for its users (Zatucki 2021). 
In the legal field, recent advances in AI provide ideas for building predictive models that can be used to reveal the 
patterns that drive court decisions. It can be helpful for lawyers and judges as a tool to quickly identify cases and extract 
patterns that lead to specific choices (Aletras et al. 2016). Some countries, such as China and the United States, have 
used AI in their justice systems (Contini 2020). It is done by seeing AI's potential to improve procedural and 
administrative efficiency, help decision-making, and produce consistent predictions (Reiling 2020). Seeing the potential 
use of AI, especially in legal area, this research then analyzes the practice of using AI in the direction and the 
development of AI regulation in China, the United States, and Indonesia. It is intended to provide an overview of current 
practices and how the potential use of AI in the legal field in Indonesia can be carried out.

for the United States, there is no single regulation of personal data but refers to the arrangements in each state and 
sectoral.  
Regulations already owned by China and have not been regulated in the United States and Indonesia are regarding 
algorithms regulated in the Internet Information Service Algorithmic Recommendation Management Provisions or 
algorithm rules that take effect in 2022. Article 2 of the Algorithm Rule stipulates that this regulation applies to 
developers or users of algorithm technology that refers to the use of generative or synthetic type, personalized 
recommendation type, ranking and selection type, search filter type, dispatching, and decision-making type. Algorithm 
Rule regulates obligations in using algorithms such as transparent disclosure, ethical use of recommendation 
algorithms, and strict oversight on services with ""public opinion and social mobilization capacities."" With the 
Algorithm rule made by the Chinese government, it marks China's further efforts in regulating AI. (Table 3). 
6. Conclusion
AI has been used in the field of law, both by the private sector and the courts. The United States and China have used 
AI in systems and court proceedings, which Indonesia has not done. Therefore, Indonesia needs to initiate the use of 
AI in courts. Regarding regulatory developments, the stages of development in China, the United States, and Indonesia 
have similarities, namely the development plans and guidelines that contain the principles of AI. Regarding regulatory 
development, China and Indonesia have first compiled ethics for using AI, which in the United States is still being 
discussed. Of the three countries studied, neither China, the United States, nor Indonesia has specifically regulated AI 
at this time. However, the components related to the use of AI in the form of personal data protection and cybersecurity 
have been owned by each country. Although in Indonesia, data protection regulations have not been expressly 
regulated. In terms of statutes, China has first regulated the issue of algorithms that have an essential role in the 
development of AI. Looking at the use of AI in the future, the development of AI settings will continue to evolve to 
ensure protection for users. Based on paragraph above, there are several proposed improvements should be done such 
as Indonesia needs to start the AI development in courts such as in court administration process to improve the 
efficiency in courts. Referring to AI regulations, Indonesia government should formulate AI ethical guidelines as a 
guide in the use of AI and need to immediately regulate the protection of personal data in more specific regulations 
therefore, the Personal Data Protection Law needs to be passed immediately by the Government.

Abstract 
The application of the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (AS/RS) in the warehouse has been improved 
significantly over the last few decades. In the recent years, a new type of AS/RS, Shuttle Based Storage and 
Retrieval System (SBS/RS) has taken many industries interest by storm due to its flexibility and throughput 
performances. This paper studies the mathematical optimization of item location assignment and task scheduling in 
SBS/RS mainly with tier-to-tier system which allows the shuttle to transport between tiers using a lift system. Since 
this system is mostly applied in giant e-commerce industries, considering order data set and multiple stock keeping 
unit (SKU) in the mathematical model formulation will give a significant benefit in the real-life scenario. This paper 
also proposed a modified genetic algorithm to solved both item location assignment and task scheduling with a good 
computational time result for large size instances within a reasonable amount of time.

1. Introduction
Today, manufacturing industries have grown fast into a new era (Industrial 4.0) which utilizes more sophisticated 
automation technology in their process including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. By using the 
automation technology, companies can save more labor costs as well as providing a better floor space with better 
movements. In the case of warehouse and storage logistics system, AS/RS is one of the most commonly used among 
giant manufacturing industries. Not only can give the best throughput performance, but it is also flexible for many 
different types of items depending on the design of the system itself.  
There are many different types of AS/RS that has already been found such as: unit-load AS/RS, deep-lane AS/RS, 
mini-load AS/RS, man-on-board AS/RS, vertical lift storage module (VLSM), etc. However, Shuttle Based Storage 
and Retrieval System (SBS/RS) is the newest AS/RS type and it is considered to be the best one in comparison with 
other types. According to the study literature conducted by Kosanic et al. (2018), it has been proven that the system 
performs better than mini-load AS/RS. Since the system consists of 2 sub-systems (lift and shuttle), it greatly 
increases the efficiency of the warehouse part-picking operation. Nowadays, the application of SBS/RS is increasing 
significantly especially in pharmacy and e-commerce industries such as Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, or Alibaba.

The result for large size instances is shown in Table.6. Crossover rate, mutation rate, and elitism rate that are used 
respectively are: 90%, 1%, 2%. The population size used in these experiments are 250. Any greater population size 
(above 250) will increase the time for each generation very significantly. It is very noticeable that number 
generation for each trial is decrease since the parameter are getting bigger. All five algorithm experiments are 
terminated under 1 hour. Any experiments attempt to passed the 70 tasks, in most of the cases, ended up with 
memory limitation error (N/A). The solutions that are generated by the algorithm in this large size instances are 
compared with random generated solution. The value of random solutions (𝒁𝒓) are the best objective function value 
among all random solutions that is generated within one hour. The percentage difference, notated as 𝑷𝒎, is 
calculated in the Eq.(29) as follows: 
𝑃𝑚= 𝑍𝑟−𝑍𝑚

8. Conclusions 
In this paper, mathematical optimization of item location assignment and task scheduling for tier-to-tier SBS/RS is 
studied for minimizing the total time. Many originality considerations are proposed such as the task clustering 
assumption and rack status update. As for cost, not only travel time cost that is considered, but also the penalty time 
due to the lateness of task operation.  The author believes that the proposed mathematical model could benefit the 
SBS/RS research in the future. Furthermore, this paper also introduced an algorithm that capable of showing good 
results in comparison to the proposed mathematical model. Some important points regarding this proposed model 
that can be improved in the future are:  
• 
Multiple of shuttles and multiples of lifting system  
• 
Each order might contain a different number of task (multiple k)  
• 
Dual command cycle system for both shuttle and lift system

Abstract 
Although the medical interventions provided by Outpatient Departments (OPDs) are scheduled, the process of 
patient arrival is often unpredictable. This can lead to a variety of issues such as overcrowding, long waiting times, 
and patient dissatisfaction. Therefore, predicting the patient arrival rate is necessary to allow healthcare managers to 
be more proactive and make more efficient and realistic decisions. In this context, this real-life study aims to predict 
the hourly rate of patient arrival in a multi-specialty outpatient department using Machine Learning (ML) 
algorithms. The considered OPD regroups three specialties: pulmonology, allergology, and cardiology. One-year 
patient arrival data for all specialties were extracted and preprocessed. Thereafter, the exhaustive feature selection 
was applied to identify the best subset of features. Next, seven ML algorithms were investigated and assessed to 
determine the best predictive model. The conducted experimental study revealed that support vector regression 
shows the best performance for the prediction of pulmonary patient admissions, while random forest was identified 
as the best predictive model for the other specialties.

1. Introduction
Healthcare planning in Outpatient Departments (OPDs) is highly challenging (Vermeulen et al. 2009). Indeed, the 
medical structures in these departments are constantly affected by their environments and are subject to a high 
degree of uncertainty due to the complexity of the clinical pathway and the fluctuation of patient demand, as well as 
the unpredictability of their arrival (Aissaoui et al. 2022).It is well known that outpatient arrival processes, which 
decide independently when they arrive, differ from arrival processes generated by appointment schedules (Kim et al. 
2018). In fact, the appointment generated arrival processes theoretically have a quasi-periodic structure defined by 
time slots of appointments. Nevertheless, it is commonly reported in the literature that actual arrival processes can 
vary significantly due to several factors that lead to schedule disruption (Cayirli and Veral 2003). In fact, several 
studies have shown that patient non-punctuality causes extensive trouble for health care managers and reveal that 
patients often arrive earlier rather than later (Klassen and Rohleder 1996; Lehaney et al. 1999), resulting in 
overcrowding (Welch and Bailey 1952). Similarly, the patient no-shows are a worldwide concern that increase 
healthcare costs (Incze et al. 2021) and affect the performance of appointment systems (Ho and Lau 1992). Extant 
studies have suggested that the observed probabilities of missed outpatient appointments vary by department 
specialty (Aebi et al. 2007; Mohamed et al. 2016). In addition, the walk-ins, or patients who come to OPD without 
an appointment, constitute another patient arrival pattern. Patients who require urgent medical care and can 
potentially preempt the current patient visit are a special type of the walk-ins. Like the no-shows, the probability of 
walk-ins varies by specialty (Field 1980) and by hospital type and location (Munavalli et al. 2021). Furthermore, 
Swartzman (1970) have emphasized that walk-ins and emergency patients' arrival rates vary significantly during the 
2134",,"Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Future research will focus on integrating the predictions of the best performing ML models into a demand-driven 
resource allocation approach that would help healthcare managers to be proactive and more effective in their 
decision-making.

Abstract 
Entrepreneurship is essential to Indonesia's economic progress. 99.9% of all Indonesian firms are micro, small, and 
medium-sized (MSMEs). Sixty percent of Indonesia's registered micro, small, and medium–sized businesses were 
held by women (MSMEs). However, it is difficult for more than 70 percent of female entrepreneurs to expand owing 
to a lack of funding and market access. Most female entrepreneurs operate in the informal and conventional female 
industries. There are still prevalent gender inequalities in essential company management abilities. Women frequently 
lack the vocational and technical abilities and job experience necessary to operate enterprises. By sending 
questionnaires with closed-ended questions on a 5-point Likert scale, the research was able to acquire primary data 
from 230 women entrepreneurs in Greater Jakarta. This study contributes significantly to the existing literature on 
entrepreneurship by comparing the entrepreneurial orientation of female entrepreneurs along three dimensions: 
innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking. In addition, the Rasch model was applied in this study. According to 
the study's findings, the entrepreneurial orientation of female entrepreneurs varies insignificantly with their level of 
education. This study's findings may be translated into actionable measures for identifying women business owners 
who are focused on growth. The report also proposes development approaches for encouraging the growth of women 
entrepreneurs.

1. Introduction
Considering their outsized importance in Indonesia's economy, MSMEs will be a vital component of growth and 
poverty reduction. MSMEs accounted for more than 99.9 percent of the total number of enterprises in Indonesia, 
which was projected to be greater than 57 million. The Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection 
estimates that 60 percent of Indonesian micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are owned by women, 
representing about a quarter of the work force (Melissa et al, 2015). The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor indicated 
that around 26 percent, or 22 million, of Indonesia's total adult female population of 85 million are active entrepreneurs 
(Nawangpalupi et al., 2015). While estimates vary due to differing classifications of women entrepreneurs and 
inadequate data, all approximations indicate a high absolute number of female entrepreneurs in Indonesia, as well as 
a very high proportion of the adult female population that is entrepreneurial.

5.3 Discussion  
Surprisingly, the innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking dimensions of female entrepreneurs' entrepreneurial 
orientation do not differ significantly based on their educational level. This finding contradicts the findings of previous 
research, which suggested that educational level plays a role in entrepreneurial orientation. These findings are likely 
attributable to the characteristics of Indonesian female entrepreneurs that are unaffected by educational attainment. 60 
percent of Indonesia's small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are owned by women. 
 
The majority of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia are engaged in 'necessity' businesses, so these figures must be 
interpreted with caution. Typically, these entrepreneurs operate their own businesses from their homes. High 
unemployment and low wages in the formal sector force women in Indonesia into self-employment, resulting in a 
large number of ""necessity"" women entrepreneurs in the country. Women entrepreneurs with a greater entrepreneurial 
orientation are more likely to gain access to capital and the market, thereby increasing the likelihood of business 
expansion. However, this study found that growth-oriented women entrepreneurs, as indicated by entrepreneurial 
orientation level, cannot be differentiated by university education level. 
 
If we investigate the entrepreneurial aspects in greater detail. Whether or not they have a university education, 
Indonesian women entrepreneurs are characterized by a high level of proactiveness and risk taking, but a low level of 
innovativeness. Both non-bachelors and bachelors are frequently seeking opportunities, exploring any opportunities, 
and seeking more productive new methods. It indicates that they are capable of being growth-focused female 
entrepreneurs. 
 
Thus, it can be argued that we cannot target growth-oriented female entrepreneurs based on their level of education. 
In Indonesia, there are numerous expanding businesses run by women who did not attend college. The activities they 
engage in should be the primary focus of your investigation. For instance, many female entrepreneurs are successful 
because they frequently enroll in training programs, attend trade fairs, are involved in their communities, etc. 
 
This finding has important implications for developing female entrepreneurs, particularly in Indonesia. Women 
without a bachelor's degree and women with a bachelor's degree have equal potential as growth-oriented female 
entrepreneurs. It must evaluate applicants solely based on their level of entrepreneurial orientation, focusing on 
innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness. Moreover, emphasis must also be placed on increasing the level of 
innovation among Indonesian women entrepreneurs. To enhance the innovation of the product or service, these 
programs must support them. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In Indonesia, more than 99.9 percent of all businesses were comprised of MSMEs. 60% of micro, small, and medium-
sized firms (MSMEs) in Indonesia are held by women. The statistics suggests that Indonesia has a large number of 
female entrepreneurs. However, more than 70 percent of female entrepreneurs find it difficult to expand due to a lack 
of capital and market access. Most female entrepreneurs are engaged in informal and traditional sectors. There are still 
persistent gender disparities in fundamental business management skills. It highlighted the need of studying the 
entrepreneurial orientation of female entrepreneurs. 
 
This study's major purpose was to determine whether women entrepreneurs had distinct levels of entrepreneurial 
orientation based on innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness. The Rasch Model was used to assess the data 
obtained from 230 female entrepreneurs using closed-ended questionnaires. Surprisingly, the innovativeness, 
proactiveness, and risk-taking elements of the entrepreneurial orientation of female entrepreneurs do not vary 
considerably with their educational degree. The major conclusion of this study, however, is that we cannot target 
growth-oriented female entrepreneurs based on their degree of schooling. In addition, the study indicated that 
regardless of their educational background, Indonesian women entrepreneurs exhibit a high degree of proactiveness 
and risk-taking, but a low level of innovativeness. 
 
Both non-bachelor and bachelor entrepreneurs have significant potential for business success, according to the 
conclusions of this study. The findings of this study provide fresh insight on women's entrepreneurial development, 
notably in Indonesia. It shall evaluate women entrepreneurs entirely based on their entrepreneurial orientation, with 
an emphasis on inventiveness, risk-taking, and initiative. In addition, there must be a focus on boosting the degree of

creativity among Indonesian women entrepreneurs. These initiatives must assist the innovation of the product or 
service to improve it. 
 
This study's limitation to data from Greater Jakarta is a deficiency. Several questions remain unresolved. First, 
comparative study on the performance of entrepreneurs with and without a bachelor's degree is necessary. Second, 
greater study is necessary to find the most effective strategy and curriculum for fostering female entrepreneurs.

Abstract 
The phenomenon of Korean brand ambassadors (Hallyu) has been identified as one of the most effective marketing 
strategies to increase sales, specifically in e-commerce. Fans of these celebrities do not hesitate to buy products 
promoted by Hallyu repeatedly and in a high amount as the devotion to their idols. The attractiveness of Hallyu 
predicts can stimulate consumers hedonic motivation, a shopping motivation driven by fulfillment of emotional or 
other subjective needs. This motivation then leads to impulsive buying behavior, unplanned buying due to sudden 
desires. E-commerce enjoys the benefit of impulse buying phenomena because consumer buying process occurs easily. 
It is different from other buying behavior which usually takes time because consumers need to consider their choices 
carefully. This research aims to identify the relationship between brand ambassadors, hedonic shopping motivation, 
and impulsive buying behavior, with fanaticism predicts to moderate the relationship between brand ambassador and 
hedonic shopping motivation. Using a technique of purposive sampling, 160 samples have been selected from

1. Introduction
Due to the changes caused by globalization, all business sectors must be ready to quickly adopt new technologies. 
Changes in the trading system from traditional to all-digital trading platforms also contributed to this change 
(Mialiawati 2020). According to Union (2021), the current number of national internet users has grown compared to 
the year 2018. Currently, the number of internet users has increased by 54.25% nationwide. In Indonesia, the trend of 
internet users has unquestionably risen during the previous five years, claims (Istiqomah 2022). Based on the news 
through kompasiana, it was explained that Internet users compared to Indonesia's population reached 277.7 million 
people. Here it shows in figure 1 that the use of cellular mobile is 370.1 million. Internet users in Indonesia reached 
204.7 million or 73.7% compared to the total population of Indonesia. Meanwhile, active users of social media are 
191.4 million or 68.9% of the total population of Indonesia. (Figure 1)

Abstract 
Since the work report made on behalf of the 16th CPC Central Committee to the 17th CPC Central Committee, 
China has emphasized culture as part of the country's soft power. Recently, with the cultural industry being 
introduced as a pillar industrial sector in the 12th Five-Year Plan, China has developed cultural policies to manage 
its cultural industry, such as film and drama. After the establishment of the ""going global"" strategy, Chinese 
entertainment media are now more accessible and receiving much attention from foreign audiences. With the 
emergence of Chinese dramas on several international streaming platforms and the latest digital cultural industry 
policy issued in 2020, this article offers an analysis of the implementation of the Chinese cultural policy through 
a TV Drama ""Word of Honour"" as a public diplomacy practice.

1. Introduction
The rise of China's economic basket case for an economic superpower (Peng & Keane 2019) allowed China's 
global economic presence to be unparalleled (Keane 2016). Despite having an indisputable 'hard' influence (Keane 
2016), China's cultural and socio-political presence was not very popular. Thus, China hopes to re-establish its 
significance as a major cultural power (Liu 2019) by using soft power and public diplomacy to change the image 
of rising China from a hard to a soft rise (Wang 2008). 
Joseph Nye popularised the term soft power. He defined soft power as the ability to achieve the outcomes you 
want from others through the power of attraction and persuasion (Nye 2004). Soft power rest on the ability to 
shape the preference of others through the attractiveness of a country's culture, political values, and foreign policy 
(Nye 2004). The concept was prevalent in many countries, including China. 
Recently, soft power has emerged as a core concept in the Chinese cultural development policy framework (Zhang 
2010). President Hu Jintao stressed the need to enhance Chinese culture as part of the country's 'soft power' in the 
work report made on behalf of the 16th CPC Central Committee to the 17th National Congress of the Communist 
Party of China (Zhang 2010). It reflected the strategic importance of culture in China (Zhang 2010). 
In the Chinese understanding of soft power, they emphasize culture as the core of soft power (Wu 2018; G. Zhang 
2017) and an essential resource for state power creating the terms cultural soft power (wenhuan ruan shili) (Becard 
& Filho 2019; Glaser & Murphy 2009; Keane 2016). While Nye's explanation of soft power is U.S.-centric and 
focuses on American popular culture and political models, the Chinese counterpart focuses on China's traditional 
culture and economic development model (M. Li 2009; Y. Zhang & Zhang 2012). It includes China's national 
cohesion, social justice, political reform, anti-corruption, moral level, and others (M. Li 2009; Y. Zhang & Zhang 
2012). 
To expand Chinese cultural clout and soft power externally, the Chinese Government exercises a cultural policy 
that integrates society by showing a clear national identity internally (Lim 2013). In practice, the Chinese

6. Conclusion 
With soft power emerging as a core concept in Chinese cultural development policy, the Chinese Government 
executes a cultural policy to expand their cultural soft power. The Chinese Government had prioritized cultural 
industries as a pillar industrial sector and thus started to develop a cultural industry policy. With the current 
development of technology and digitization, the Government issued a digital cultural industry policy to create 
new forms of employment and jobs and form industrial chains that adapt to new technologies, new forms of 
business, and new consumption development industrial chains. 
 
China's decision-making process is state-centric due to its nature as an authoritarian country. Thus, the Central 
Government has control over the policy, while the non-state actors could only follow the direction given by the 
Government. The content of the High-Quality Development of Digital Cultural Industry Policy implied the 
messages China wanted to tell. It emphasized China as an advanced country with a rich culture. Its plan for 
international cooperation also implied that China was a cooperative partner and not a threat. The international 
cooperation could be seen through the distribution of the ""Word of Honor,"" aired on several countries broadcasting 
platforms. Moreover, it is also broadcasted on international streaming platforms such as YouTube and Netflix, 
which aligns with the ""going global"" strategy. Thus, it could be concluded that the international broadcasting of 
the drama ""Word of Honor"" is part of an implementation of cultural policy that worked as public diplomacy and 
helped China expand its cultural soft power.

Abstract 
Technology that is developing rapidly affects human life, one of which is in gambling. Gambling that was originally 
done conventionally then turned into gambling that can be done online. Online gambling is gambling using the 
internet. Some countries such as Singapore and the UK have strictly regulated and legalized online gambling, but there 
are still countries that have not explicitly regulated such as Indonesia and Malaysia. This study will discuss the scope 
of online gambling regulation in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the UK, as well as how to apply effective laws 
that can be applied in Indonesia, after a comparative arrangement has been made. By using normative research 
methods and Systematic Literature Review then based on the theory of comparison, convergence, and legal 
effectiveness. 
From this study it was found that online gambling in Indonesia and Malaysia is considered a prohibited activity, 
because it is against the law as well as religious and decency norms that grow and develop in society. Malaysia itself 
already has regulations to prohibit gambling, although online gambling has not been explicitly regulated. Singapore 
regulates gambling so that people are not harmed or exploited by remote gambling. Then the UK regulates online 
gambling by reducing the number of types of gambling and minimizing the influence of organized crime arising from 
gambling. Indonesia can apply gambling rules as did Malaysia, Singapore, and the UK, of course, with due regard to 
the effectiveness of the law so that this law is ideally applied in Indonesia while still paying attention to aspects of 
effective law formation.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, technology is increasingly developing, especially when the internet is present during society. With the 
internet anyone, anywhere, and anytime can exchange information and interact through cyberspace. In cyberspace, 
the process of interacting with people in life has changed, because this cyberspace is a new space, cyberspace, a space 
without boundaries, not a real space with clear boundaries. The cyber world is not just about making life easy, it is 
about making a different or better life or making a new life (Lessig 2006). 
This technological development has a huge impact on life, one of which is the gambling industry. Ease of access is 
one of the factors that make online gambling increasingly popular. In addition, online gambling is in great demand by 
players because it is considered safer when playing (Dwiwahyuni and Agus 2021). The online gambling industry is 
increasing with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, this increase occurs because many conventional gambling 
places such as casinos, bingo, horse racing, lottery, betting, poker, and several other types of gambling are innovating

Abstract 
Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the tourism sector has been severely affected with a high decrease in its activities. This 
sector, as well as all services, is looking for a way to adapt to the new market with new strategies and generate new 
value propositions in activities. Therefore, over the years, Lean Methodologies have been used as a solution for 
continuous improvement and to face new challenges. This research has posed the following question: What is the 
effect of applying the lean methodology in service operations offered by the tourism sector globally? The type of 
research has been developed with a systematic literature review of one hundred and twenty-six (126) articles published 
between 2017 and 2021. These articles were selected based on keywords related to Lean methodologies in the tourism 
sector. The results show that applying Lean methodologies allows for an increase in efficiency, a decrease in 
production and service time, a focus on the value chain, and an increase in customer satisfaction and empowerment 
of employees.

1. Introduction
Currently, around the world, several industrial sectors have been affected by the covid-19 pandemic, mainly the 
tourism sector (Tortorella et al. 2021). In 2020, 381 million tourists earned $300 billion in tourism revenue, and global 
tourism activity declined by 74%, affecting the service operations of many travel agencies, hotels, food consumption, 
and tour guiding. Today, however, the service industry is looking for the best way to adapt to this change and not be 
affected one more time. 
It should be noted that services permeate all aspects of a modern economy and are the key to connecting nations with 
each other with information, knowledge, goods, and services (Lins et al. 2021). Therein lies the importance of 
improving service operations, specifically, in the tourism sector, given that this sector is the one that has had little 
research in comparison to other services (Arango and Rojas 2018). Likewise, there is a trend in applying Lean tools 
to services in development, compared to what has already been researched for the manufacturing industry (Burch and 
Smith 2019). One of the primary methodologies to implement in service organizations is Lean Service, which 
encompasses value determination, identification of value streams, flow, creep, and the pursuit of perfection. Likewise, 
these have similar applications to manufacturing organizations (Lisiecka and Burka 2016).

Abstract 
Technology is present to provide a more convenient life for people. The online media or social media are one of them. 
In social media, people can easily interact with each other. This can happen because of the presence of the internet. 
The internet is a global resource and there is no single country that can control the protocols and features of the 
internet. The internet is wide; therefore, it is easier for people to take actions that are prohibited by law, one of which 
is committing indecency against criminal law. A crime of decency is an act or behavior that is against by law, which 
violates the norms or rules of decency. In other countries, such as America, Britain, and Canada, they don’t use the 
term decency, but use the term obscenity and pornography. Thus, this study will discuss the scope of decency on 
electronic media and interpret the content of decency. This research will use the normative juridical method, with a 
comparative approach. As well as using the theory of comparison, protection, and law enforcement. This research 
discovers that there are two types of decency regulations in Indonesia, broadly, which includes the regulation of 
decency in the Criminal Code and acts that violate social values, and narrowly, which includes pornography and child 
pornography. In addition, decency regulations in America, England, and Canada are specifically regulated which 
includes obscenity and child pornography.

1. Introduction
Technology itself is an application of scientific knowledge which aims to make human life more practical. In addition, 
technology also presents a development in several aspects, one of which is electronic media. Electronic media is media 
that uses electronics or electromechanical energy which is used by end users or the public to access content. One of 
the sources of electronic media that is often used by the public is online content, which often appears in online media 
or social media (Rahmiyati 2015). Social media is a medium where users can easily interact, participate, share, and 
create content that includes blogs, social networks, wikis, forums, and virtual worlds (Cahyono 2016). 
In running a social media, an internet is needed in it, where the internet is a global resource and there is no single 
country that can control the protocols and features of the internet (De’ et al. 2020). The internet is broad, global, cross 
border, and there are no boundaries of space and time on the internet, which makes it easier for the wider community 
to take actions that are prohibited by law, even though there are no regulations that clearly regulate this internet. The

possession, selling, transmitting, broadcasting, distributing, and representation lewd visuals. Then, in England it does 
not specifically regulate decency crimes, but regulations in England explain the misuse of telecommunications, and 
explain online pornography. Furthermore, Canada specifically explains the prohibition on distributing, transmitting, 
and creating content that contains child pornography and sexually explicit material. 
 
5.2 Interpretation of the content of decency in article 27 paragraph 1 
According to the Joint Decree of the Minister of Communication and Information Technology of the Republic of 
Indonesia, the Attorney General of the Republic of Indonesia, and the Head of the State Police of the Republic of 
Indonesia Number 229 of 2021, Number 154 of 2021, Number KB/2/VI/2021 concerning Guidelines for the 
Implementation of Certain Articles in the Law Number 11 of 2008 concerning Information and Electronic 
Transactions as Amended by Law Number 19 of 2016 concerning Amendments to Law Number 11 of 2008 concerning 
Information and Electronic Transactions, explains the implementation guidelines of article 27 paragraph (1), which 
states that the meaning of the phrase ""the charge of violating decency"" has two meanings, including: 
 
a. Specifically 
Content that violates decency in a narrow sense is defined as pornographic content as regulated in Law no. 44 of 
2008 concerning Pornography and/or acts related to decency as regulated in Article 281 and Article 282 of the 
Criminal Code. In this case, pornography is divided into two, namely general pornography and child pornography. 
 
b. In General 
Content that violates decency in a broad sense is interpreted as content (content) that contains something that the 
community considers violating the social rules agreed in a society, where the rules can be written or unwritten 
and have been agreed for a long time. 
 
6. Conclusion  
After an explanation of decency along with the regulations that govern it, not only in Indonesia, but also in America, 
England, and Canada, the scope of decency is very broad. In the perspective of Indonesian law, the regulation of 
decency can be seen in the Criminal Code and is divided into two types, namely broad and narrow decency, which 
broadly covers decency in the Criminal Code and acts that violate social values. In addition, decency is narrow, which 
includes pornography, including child pornography. In addition, in the legal perspective of other countries, namely 
America, England, and Canada, that the regulation of morality is regulated more specifically than Indonesia. It can be 
seen in America, which regulates the prohibition of obscenity, in the England regulates the misuse of 
telecommunications and child pornography, and in Canada regulates the prohibition of child pornography content.

Abstract 
Therefore, the State of Indonesia has not clearly regulated the rules for cross-border outsourcing. Law Number 13 of 
2003 concerning Manpower serves as the legal umbrella for outsourcing, but in practice it does not provide adequate 
protection for workers. Then, the expansion of outsourcing work practices does not prove that the welfare of workers 
is getting better. Outsourcing is closely related to wages; they work with the aim of earning income for their living. In 
Government Regulation Number 35 of 2021 concerning Work Agreements for a certain time, outsourcing, working 
time, and rest periods and termination of employment are not clearly regulated regarding remuneration for outsourcing. 
Thus, an ideal rule is needed to regulate wages for outsourcing, such as the arrangement regarding wages in the United 
States which is regulated in The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and the Service Contract act of 1965. This study 
aims to determine the United States regulates the wages of outsourcing workers. and find out the ideal arrangement 
regarding the remuneration of outsourcing workers in Indonesia. To answer the problems above, the method used is 
normative juridical by examining Indonesian positive law related to outsourcing.

Abstract 
Transfer pricing means the price that arises because of the existence of transfer goods, services, and other intangible 
assets between the companies that have a special relationship or related parties. If the purpose of transferring prices is 
to meet production needs between companies within the same group, then transfer pricing is carried out neutrally. 
However, if the goal is to avoid taxes, then the practice is called abuse of transfer pricing. This practice is legal based 
on regulations but must be following the arm’s length principle. This study intends to discover how the simultaneous 
and partial influence of tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, and multinationalism on the indication to perform 
transfer pricing. In this research quantitative methods are used with purposive sampling as a sampling technique. 
Manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the year 2016 until 2020 are the population of 
the study. Based on the sample criteria, the sample companies studied amounted to 14 companies with a period of 5 
years. Logistic regression analysis is the analytical technique used in the study through the assistance IBM SPSS 
Statistics 25 application. According to the results, variables of tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, and 
multinationalism simultaneously have a significant influence on the indication to perform transfer pricing. Based on 
the partial test, multinationalism has a significant positive influence on the indication to perform transfer pricing 
whereas tax minimization, firm size, and exchange rate do not influence the indication to perform transfer pricing.

1. Introduction
Globalization is increasingly widespread, making the economy grow. Companies that are oriented to the location of 
their operations in only one country will expand their business on the international scene. Therefore, the company will 
expand its business activities to Indonesia and other countries. This also creates an opportunity for companies 
domiciled in Indonesia to open their subsidiaries in other countries, and even practice transfer pricing (Septiyani et al. 
2018). Pohan (2018) reveals that transfer pricing means the price incurred because of the transfer of goods, services, 
and other intangible assets. This includes the definition of transfer pricing neutrally. However, transfer pricing is then 
connoted as a term that means not good (abuse of transfer pricing). This meaning comes from the transfer pricing 
which is conducted by the company in the form of transferring taxable income from the company in one country to a 
company located in another country within the same group. The purpose of this practice is to shift the profit to the 
company located in a low tax country; the act is intended to diminish the entire tax burden of the group. Therefore, 
the impact on the state is the erosion of tax revenues. 
Transfer pricing in Indonesia is regulated in Regulation of the Directorate General of Taxes PER-32/PJ/2011. If the 
conditions in the transactions between related parties are the same as or comparable to the conditions in transactions 
between unrelated parties that are being compared, the price or profit in the transaction must be the same or within the 
range of prices or profits in transactions with non-related parties. Following the arm’s length principle, the transactions 
are carried out to reflect the fair market price (Yanti and Pratiwi 2021). The practice is legal to do if it is still within

5.2.5 The Influence of Multinationalism on Indication to Perform Transfer Pricing 
Multinationalism significantly and positively influences the indication to perform transfer pricing. In addition, the 
result is following the hypothesis that has been made. In this case, when the company's operations cover cross-border 
transactions, the company will further expand the market share and consumer networks, so it will open subsidiaries in 
other countries to obtain increased profits. The higher level of competition in the international business makes the 
company perform transfer pricing to meet the production needs between affiliated parties and maintain their existence 
in the international business. In addition, multinational companies are more likely to take advantage of different tax 
regulations among countries. This is supported by Rezky and Fachrizal (2018) and Liana et al. (2020) that explain 
multinationalism has a significant positive influence on transfer pricing. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study intends to find out how the influence of tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, and multinationalism 
on the indication to perform transfer pricing. The population in this study are manufacturing sector companies listed 
on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from the year 2016 until 2020. According to sample criteria, there are 14 companies 
with a period of 5 years, then 70 samples of companies are obtained. The study reveals that the independent variables 
namely tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, and multinationalism significantly influence the indication to 
perform transfer pricing. Additionally, the result of the study showed that tax minimization does not influence the 
indication to perform transfer pricing. This proved that to minimize the burden of the tax, companies could do other 
tax planning in a way that legal and permissible. Additionally, firm size does not influence the indication to perform 
transfer pricing. This is proved that the larger the company, the more transactions that occur and disclose in the 
financial statement. So that the company tends to be careful in executing transfer pricing to maximize profit. 
Furthermore, the exchange rate does not influence the indication to perform transfer pricing. Changes in exchange 
rates are like something that has two sides. Exchange rate movements that continue to fluctuate from the transactions 
could provide profits, otherwise, the exchange rate can provide losses. The existence of this makes the company have 
the assumption that changes in the exchange rate do not provide potential profit, so the company did not perform 
transfer pricing. Meanwhile, the multinationalism variable significantly and positively influences the indication to 
perform transfer pricing. The higher the level of multinationalism of a company, the more it indicates the company 
performs transfer pricing. This is done to achieve maximum profit and prosper the business group. Companies that 
establish affiliates abroad will have the opportunity to expand market share and consumer networks. Furthermore, the 
companies could take an advantage of different tax regulations. 
 
According to the results, the multinationalism variable significantly and positively influences the indication to perform 
transfer pricing. For companies that have subsidiaries abroad, when transacting with their subsidiaries, the price or 
profits being transacted must be following the arm’s length principle, for investors who invested in multinational 
companies are expected to understand how companies perform transfer pricing to maximize their profits. Meanwhile, 
the tax authorities are expected to supervise more multinational companies that perform transfer pricing, whether the 
transactions are following the provisions regarding transfer pricing so that tax revenues of the state are not eroded. In 
this study, only 18,5% of the combination of independent variables were able to describe the variation of dependent 
variables. Furthermore, subsequent researchers expected to add other independent variables such as corporate 
governance, audit committee, and tax haven. In addition, further researchers are also advised to be able to expand 
research objects such as the mining sector, agriculture, and other sectors.

1. Introduction
In the era of globalization, consumer demand and needs are increasing in line with the increasing lifestyle from time 
to time. One of the industries that is growing rapidly today is cosmetics and skin care products because the demands 
of society to look good and pay more attention to appearance are primary needs. The Indonesian Cosmetics Company 
and Association (PPAK Indonesia) project that sales of cosmetics and skin care products will grow by 7% in 2021 
compared to the previous year which was stagnant, the cosmetics and personal care industry can become a new 
foundation for the manufacturing sector and the national economy because it is multiplayer, which This means that 
there is still a lot of room for the Indonesian people to develop it. The results of this study are expected to contribute 
to the field of research that examines consumer buying intentions for products that use online media, especially for 
skin care products

In Table 1, the conversion rate value shows that the interest in buying skincare products through online channels is 
still low. Consumers only see the product without making a purchase of the product. Conversion rate is the number of 
visitors who make purchases directly from the website as a percentage of the total visitors (Gudigantala et al., 2016), 
calculated by the formula Total Orders divided by Total Visitors multiplied by 100%. Purchase intention is a person's 
activity or behavior that appears so that it shows the consumer's desire to buy a product. (Then & Johan, 2020),

The results of the simultaneous test (Table 4) obtained that the calculated F-value (136.305) is greater than F-table 
(3.02) and is supported by a sig value of 0.000 which is smaller than the alpha value of 0.05, so it can be concluded 
that the variables brand trust and e-WOM has a simultaneous effect on the variable purchase intention skincare product 
user of online channel. These results mean that to increase purchase intention skincare product user of online channel, 
brand trust and e-WOM must be improved simultaneously, no one should be prioritized. The variables brand trust and 
e-WOM have a significant contribution jointly of 54.2% to the purchase intention skincare product user of online 
channel variable and the remaining 45.8% is explained by other factors not examined. In other words, within the scope 
of this research, there are still many other factors that can be explored that affect consumer buying intention in addition 
to brand trust and e-WOM (Table 3). Based on the results of research which revealed that brand trust has a positive 
effect on buying interest, for the aspect of brand trust, companies should pay attention to brand preference, namely 
the consumer's view of a brand when compared to other similar brands. In connection with the results of research that 
e-WOM has a positive effect on buying interest, the aspects of e-WOM that need to be improved by companies are 
usually positive aspects, namely reviews given by application users or consumers who are generally positive.

Although it has similarities and is supported by several previous, this study differs in terms of units of analysis as well 
as the underlying conditions. The units of analysis are skincare product user of online channel. The conditions are 
different from previous research, namely where this research was carried out in conditions of the Covid 19 pandemic 
which is estimated to greatly affect the use purchase intention skincare product user online channel.  The limitations 
of this study are: 1) the factors that are thought to influence buying intention are limited (only 2 variables), the number 
of samples is limited, and the scope of the observation area is small. The research results obtained in this study support 
the three hypotheses that have been stated previously 
 
5. Conclusion  
Based on the discussion that has been described, some conclusions and recommendations can be expressed as follows: 
1) Brand trust has a significant influence on purchase intention online channel skincare product. 2) Electronic Word 
of Mouth (e-WOM) has a significant influence on purchase intention online channel skincare product 3) Brand trust 
and e-WOM have a positive and significant impact on purchase intention online channel skincare product.  
 
To be able to improve brand trust, the company should change the preference for local products to be better than 
imports and the high price of the product does not mean the product is of good quality. To increase e-WOM, 
Companies should control both positive and negative user reviews. Recommendations for further researchers 1) 
Increase the number of respondents in order to get more accurate results. 2) Expanding the scope of observations 
because in this study the sample was limited to online channel product skincare in Jakarta.

Abstract 
Organizational culture brings commitment between leaders and members in work activities that have long been applied 
in organization. The Islamic Rural Bank (BPRS) XYZ is bank that operates based on Islamic sharia principles with 
Non-Performing Financing (NPF) as one of its performance indicators. A performance gap from the increase in NPF 
since 2016 indicates a change in performance of activity patterns within organization. This study aims to identify the 
current and future organizational culture in risk mitigation. The research was conducted by collecting OCAI 
questionnaires and mitigating financing risk with 1S + 5C method, data processing and decision analysis Multi-
Objective Optimization based on Ratio (MOORA). The OCAI results showed that the current organizational culture 
is hierarchy culture (28%), and the expected organizational culture in the future is clan (27%). However, considering 
risk mitigation which is processed using MOORA analysis and current organizational culture data, the recommended 
organizational culture in future is hierarchy culture, while the MOORA decision uses risk mitigation criteria and 
expected organizational culture is market culture. This research suggests that BPRS XYZ can implement market 
culture.  Risk mitigation is carried out based on market organizational culture, and Account Officers identify 1S+5C 
with a focus on goals, oriented to results, and winning market competition.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a country where most of the population is Muslim, so Islamic banks have become the choice of the 
Indonesian people. Islamic banks are one of the fastest-growing sectors of the global financial industry; Badan 
Kebijakan Fiskal  Islamic banks are also believed to be one of the instruments that can support economic recovery 
through community business empowerment (Badan Kebijakan Fiskal, 2021), while BPR is a bank that provides 
services for collecting and distributing funds (Dangnga and Haeruddin, 2018). BPRS XYZ is a one of the banks 
established based on Islamic sharia principles in Indonesia. Non-performing Financing (NPF) is one of the 
performance indicators of Islamic banks in measuring credit or financing risk. Financing is the provision of funds in 
the form of profit-sharing transactions based on an agreement between the bank and another party that is financed 
with an understanding that the other party is obliged to return the funds according to a specific period with 
compensation or profit-sharing (Andrianto and Firmansyah, 2019). Non-performing Financing (NPF) is a financing 
risk that is problematic and has a dangerous impact on bank profitability (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, 2017). Non-
performing Financing (NPF) is caused by the quality of financing that is substandard, bad, and doubtful. The rate of 
this financing is stipulated by Article 9 of PBI No. 8/21/PBI/2006 and PBI No. 10/24/PBI/2008. The Financial Services 
Authority (OJK) will summon Islamic banks with a high Non-Performing Financing (NPF) level, which is above 5%, 
because they are considered to have potential difficulties and will endanger the sustainability of the bank. Banks that 
have Non-performing Financing (NPF) criteria of more than 5% will be subject to incentive supervision for a 
maximum of 1 year (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, 2017). Based on the BPRS XYZ Annual Report for the last five years, 
starting from 2016 to 2020, the percentage of Non-performing Financing (NPF) continues to increase, and there is a 
gap that can be seen in Table 1.

the BPRS, which is to improve the quality of life of the 
people through sharia banking. 
 
6. Conclusion 
1. The current perceived organizational culture based on the OCAI questionnaire at the XYZ BPRS is Hierarchy 
culture with a percentage of 28%, clan culture at 26%, adhocracy culture at 21%, and culture and market at 
25%. The current organizational culture is characterized by a structured, stable, controlled environment, an 
efficiency-oriented leader, formal rules, and transparent policies. 
2. The expected organizational culture based on employee perceptions alone is clan culture with a percentage 
of 27%, followed by hierarchy culture at 25%, adhocracy culture, and market culture at 24%. A family 
environment characterizes the expected organizational culture based on employee perceptions, leaders who 
become facilitators and mentors, teamwork, loyalty, trust between employees, and employee commitment 
and concern.

3.
The expected organizational culture based on employee perceptions and the addition of financing risk
mitigation criteria using Multi-Objective Optimization based on Ratio (Moora) is a market culture
characterized by competitive, result-oriented, productivity, and profit-oriented demands for achievement,
suitable for companies that have a transaction mechanism to create a competitive advantage.
4.
The proposed 1S + 5C risk mitigation (Sharia, Character, Capacity, Capital, Collateral, and Condition) is
carried out by analyzing the expected organizational culture of each employee, namely a market culture, by
applying a goal-oriented, aggressive, high-demand culture character. They are achieving results and winnings 
and achieving targets.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the challenges faced by the whole world and almost all aspects of life, including 
the economy. With the impact that was given after the COVID-19 pandemic, many SMEs were unable to continue 
their business and tried to survive to get customers back due to the limited access they had during the COVID-19 
pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant difficulties for SMEs around the world, particularly 
Batik SMEs. Based on data obtained from BPS, it is known that there was a significant decline and the lowest occurred 
in 2020 where only the value of exports and batik products was only USD 21.54 million. (Central Bureau of Statistics) 
This needs to be a concern, SMEs must continue to exist given the important role they play in supporting the economy. 
SMEs must continue to produce the best results they can in challenging situations like the one we face today. To 
survive during the Covid-19 pandemic, SMEs must also think creatively and develop solutions that can increase their 
competitive advantage. The performance of SMEs is influenced by various factors, both internal and external. internal 
elements such as relational skills, entrepreneurship, and innovative skills in digital marketing.

Some of the things that have been mentioned are obstacles that often occur in SMEs. The definition of an obstacle is 
something that can hinder the progress or achievement of something. The obstacles that occur can be overcome by 
carrying out other more relevant strategies. Based on the literature study conducted, several strategies can be used to 
utilize digital marketing including: 
 
1. Maximum use of social media. Based on research conducted by Tabuena et al. (2022), the most in-demand 
marketing currently is the use of social media. The most popular social media, especially for batik SMEs, are 
Instagram, Facebook, and the website (Tutiasri et al. (2020) 
2. Invest in people and systems. Based on research conducted by Dumitriu et al (2019, This can be done by 
MSMEs conducting training for employees and developing the best possible digital marketing system that is 
currently being used. Based on Astuti et al. (2022) the development of knowledge and skills of human 
resources this can increase productivity. 
3. Refine their business model and set sustainable goals. Based on Dumitriu et al. (2019), explain that a good 
business model can provide many benefits, bussines one of which is business plans make it easier for planners 
and decision makers in the company to see the logical relationship between the components in their business, 
so that value for consumers and value for the SMEs can be generated.  
4. Focusing on competitive prices, according to Dumitriu et al. (2019) ad with online buying and selling which 
is currently widely used, price is quite crucial, most consumers will choose the best price in determining what 
to buy. 
5. Take advantage of recommendations from old customers to increase the targeted market share, research 
conducted by Astuti et al (2018) Dumitriu et al (2019) using voice of customers or providing customer service 
as a place for customers to convey their problems. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the study, it was found that the obstacles that occur include 6 aspects including, lack of 
employee skills, delivery problems, payments, development, content, customer satisfaction, and funding. in aspect 
lack of employee skills it contains lack of knowledge about promotion, lack of ability to do digital marketing, shortage 
of skilled labor, competence in using technology, and not being able to use the internet properly. in aspect delivery 
problems obtained results delay in delivery, damage during the delivery, late delivery from the supplier, delivery does 
not match the buyer's address and goods not delivered. in the aspect of payment obtained, transaction fraud and 
manipulation of admin numbers, slower than cash payments via face-to-face, consumers late in making payments. in 
aspect developing a content, there is limited soft skills to create promotional content, do not have a plan/strategy, lack 
of capital to do advertising. in aspect customer satisfaction there is lack of direct interaction, goods does not meet the 
buyer's expectations and lack of trust about security privacy  and in last aspect is funding. not only knowing the 
obstacles that occur, but this study also knows the application of other strategies that can overcome the existing 
obstacles. strategies that can be applied are as follows maximize use of social media, invest in people and systems, 
improve their business model and set sustainable goals, focus on competitive prices, take advantage of 
recommendations from existing customers to increase targeted market share. This strategy can be applied to Batik 
MSMEs, it is hoped that research on the strategies carried out can be useful for MSMEs to increase batik sales.

Abstract 
The study in the area of ESG has not been able to draw an ultimate conclusion that define the phenomenon. The 
purpose of this research is to give a more complete and accurate analysis of the development trend of ESG and 
competitive advantage from the earliest ESG publication in Scopus in 2010 to 2022. The purpose of the study is to 
establish bibliometric analysis as an extensive review ESG and competitive advantage literature. The method used in 
this study consists of five steps: defining search keywords, initializing search results, compiling preliminary data 
statistics, and analyzing data. The result shows that as many as 40 datasets were and collected from Scopus databases 
and visualized using Vos viewer. The limited number of the study indicated opportunities for potential topics for future 
study based on the analysis of keywords with less frequent occurrence.

Figure 6 represents the period of the research topic which was conducted over the range of years. It can be seen that 
the most occurrence keywords appear from 2018 until 2020. For example, the research topic of ESG, sustainability, 
and sustainable development were relatively new (2020) compared to other research topics such as competitive 
advantage which appeared in 2018 
 
5.6 The Potential Topic in ESG Performance (RQ6) 
Figure 7 shows density visualization using Vos viewer, which indicates the depth of research studied in certain areas 
of ESG and competitive advantage. The density of items determines the appearance of keywords in the number 
represented by the color. The more concentrated colors indicate the research has grown in high numbers. Thus, we 
could notice the keyword with less frequent occurrence represented by un-concentrated color, which means the 
research topic is still limited that need more investigation for future study (potential topic). Some sample of these 
keywords such as social, esg, and sustainable development. Thus, these research topics provide opportunities for 
researchers to identify the potential topic as a novel contribution to work in ESG performance research.

6. Conclusion  
This study employs bibliometric analysis to review all literatures from the Scopus database in ESG and competitive 
advantage. The literature has increasingly raised each year which was marked by the number of publications in recent 
years. According to the result, at the initial result stage, obtained as much as 40 datasets from Scopus database. The 
result of this study shows the trends of ESG and competitive advantage research, publication outlets (peer-reviewed 
journals), contributing authors, and productive countries. The analysis of keywords with less frequent occurrence 
indicates the potential topics for future study as contribution of this study. Thus, this study also intended to notice 
research development and predict potential advancement in future research through bibliometric analysis because 
there has been a significant increase in ESG performance research. The Vos viewer application had been successfully 
demonstrated in mapping and visualizing the bibliometric data.  The limitation of this study is datasets only taken 
from Scopus database especially peer-reviewed journals as resources. Thus, we recommend that further research 
should use various electronic databases such as Web of Science (WoS), Springer, IEEE Xplore et cetera in order to 
get better scientific contributions.

Abstract 
Japan is known for its conventional business management style. The influence of culture on business management 
style requires all workers to do face-to-face. In addition, Japan is also known for its employees who have long working 
hours. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, suppressing the positive number of Covid-19, a telework system was 
implemented, which caused many employees in Japan to stay at home more. So, this research aims to know the impact 
of telework on the work-life balance of employees at the Japanese company during pandemic Covid-19. The method 
used in this research is descriptive quantitative. Source data collect by distributing questionnaires to employees in 
Japan. The collected data is tested statistically and associated with the work culture in Japan. Through this research, 
it can be concluded that telework has a significant and positive impact on work-life balance but with a weak 
correlation. Telework has a positive impact because it can help overcome problems such as long working hours, and 
reduce stress levels and work pressure, so employees' work-life balance in Japan can be improved. Then, the factors 
that cause a weak correlation are the difficulty of managing time due to distractions such as family, motivation, and 
forgetting the time due to the absence of boundaries between the time of work and place of residence.

1. Introduction
Japan is known for its conventional management business. Before the pandemic, Japan’s culture influences the style 
of management that makes all the employees must work face to face, from planning, doing the project, discussing, 
and making decisions. When working face to face, superiors can see the employees doing their work and advise on 
the result. Japanese employees like to read their interlocutor's body language and expression. So, in everything related 
to the job, they must do it face to face. A lot of face-to-face meeting makes time used for telecommuting a lot too. For 
example, when going to duty to another city for negotiation or go to meeting at the branch office, the commuting time 
will be affected to increase the working time for the employees in Japan. It will reduce the productivity of their work. 
Besides the management style, Japan's employees also have long wrought hours and are willing to work overtime 
without being paid. In international comparison, working hours in Japan are longer than OECD (Organization for 
Economic Co-operation and Development) average working hours (Ono, 2020). Even though the government has set 
the regulation on working hours, many employees are still willing to work overtime because they want to show their 
loyalty to the company. It can show how little their time to rest if their work late every day and they must get up early

4.
仕事と人生に感謝しなさい。 (Grateful for work and life)
The perception of employees in Japan above regarding the notion of work-life balance is also close to the notion of 
work-life balance; according to Kossek, Lirio, and Valcour (2013) (Tamunomiebi & Oyibo, 2020), there are 
satisfaction and perceptions of success in meeting work and non-work demands, the low conflict between roles and 
opportunities for increased achievement between roles. With the evidence above, it can be said that employees in 
Japan can understand and realize the importance of work-life balance. 
The implementation of telework during the Covid-19 pandemic makes employees who have never worked telework 
before must be willing to adapt. In an open-ended question, it was also asked whether there were other reasons for 
implementing telework, apart from Covid-19. Of 31 respondents, 20 answered no, and 11 answered yes. Most of the 
20 respondents said there was no specific reason other than Covid-19, and there was also an opinion that it depended 
on the type of work. For 11 people who have reasons other than Covid-19, namely because of family and living far 
from work. This means that most employees will not implement telework. 
 if there is no Covid-19 pandemic. 
The lack of interest in implementing telework can occur when associated with Japanese culture because business 
culture has been done face-to-face for centuries. But on the other hand, such to the research results that have been 
obtained, telework also has a positive and significant impact on work-life balance because it can reduce pressure and 
stress and increase productivity and time efficiency. This is also conveyed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and 
Communications (2020) (Ono, 2022) that telework has a significant influence and role in part of work style reform 
because it can improve the quality of work-life balance and increase productivity and secure workforce in the 
workplace. During a population decline phenomenon in Japan. So even though the implementation of telework is still 
limited due to Covid-19, in the future, it can be one of the factors that can improve the work-life balance of employees 
in Japan. 
5. Conclusion
Research shows that the relationship between telework and work-life balance among employees in Japan during the 
Covid-19 pandemic has a significant and positive relationship, although the correlation is weak. Every increase in the 
implementation of telework will increase the level of work-life balance for employees in Japan. 
The weak correlation between telework and work-life balance is caused by factors that cause distraction, namely 
family, motivation, and forgetting time due to the absence of boundaries between work and place of residence. 
However, telework indeed has a significant and positive effect. This is because telework can help reduce travel hours, 
reduce long working hours, reduce stress levels, work pressure, and make time more productive and effective so that 
the effect on the work-life balance of employees working in Japan also increases.

Abstract 
Fishing is one of the important primary industries and can contribute to economic development in many countries. As 
one of the countries with the largest islands and waters in the world, Indonesia has a large fishery production potential. 
In the fishing industry, many stakeholders are involved, from the capture process to distribution to customers. The 
many entities involved make division necessary so that stakeholders can carry out their duties and responsibilities 
properly and the process of distributing fishery products is efficient. In addition, inequality in the fishing industry, the 
benefits of each stakeholder, and the quality of cargo on cruise ships also underlies the need for collaboration. 
Therefore, the authors try to analyze the variables that affect collaboration from various aspects of the problems that 
exist in each stakeholder based on a survey and analysis of the literature. The author makes several collaboration 
schemes from fishermen, the performance of shipping companies, expeditions, terminals, and regulators that can be 
applied in industrial fisheries. The collaboration scheme formulated by the author from various stakeholders in the 
fishing industry can make the process from fishermen to consumers more efficient because no stakeholders take 
advantage of opportunities in fishery distribution. Collaboration with other stakeholder regulatory schemes can also 
protect marine ecosystems, qualified facilities and market certainty and positively impact various stakeholders, waste 
management and good regulatory implementation. Indonesia's fishery export potential in 2030 will reach 1.7 million 
tonnes. This export potential can be achieved if there is collaboration from various stakeholders.

8.3 Forwarder Performance 
Collaboration between forwarders and other stakeholders can create a more efficient fisheries supply chain system. 
Collaboration involving forwarders is also expected to reduce costs in the distribution process. Established freight 
carriers are reliable and help efficiently plan, coordinate, and move your cargo to its destination. They may also be 
required to liaise with different government agencies depending on the type of cargo to be exported, for example. 
limited goods, certain types of food products, and others. Freight forwarders must also follow the importing country's 
laws, rules and regulations. Because of their relationship with the government and other service agencies, they can get 
the job done smoothly, apart from getting fares, favorable schedules, etc. 
8.4 Terminal Performance 
The terminal must have adequate facilities and capacity to accommodate ships and cargo, this is because the terminal 
has a function as a place to lean on ships in loading and unloading cargo. The application of technology is also very 
important to support the processes that occur at the Port. Therefore, collaboration between terminals and other 
stakeholders can provide port facilities and operating systems. Accessibility challenges and the need for collaboration 
with regulators. Regulators have a very important role in dealing with pollution in fishing ports. 
8.5 Regulator Apllications 
Collaboration between fishermen and regulators is formed when fishing gear regulations. Trawl regulations and 
trawling nets are implemented due to reduce marine damage. Trawls and trawl nets are used to catch demersal fish 
and provide the most excellent yields. Therefore, the government issued a ban on trawling and seinse net. The 
government needs to collaborate with fishermen and terminals in implementing ""perikanan terukur"" which is expected 
to reduce overfishing and illegal transshipment. With this collaboration, long-term conservation and responsible and 
rational exploitation of fisheries resources will be. 
9. Conclusion
The maritime logistics collaboration system is important in distributing fishery products from fishermen to consumers. 
In maritime logistics collaboration, all related stakeholders influence each other. Therefore, all stakeholders must be 
able to adjust their respective fisheries distribution. So that the quality of the cargo sent is maintained and of high 
value. In this study, the authors analyze the factors of various stakeholder issues in the fishing industry. The author 
makes several collaboration schemes from fishermen, cruise ship performance, forwarders, terminals, and regulators 
that can be applied in the fishing industry. The collaboration scheme formulated by the authors from various 
stakeholders in the fishing industry can make the process from fishermen to consumers more efficient because no 
stakeholders take advantage of opportunities in fisheries distribution. Fishermen as one of the main players in the 
fishing industry get welfare, because they get market certainty, facilities and regulations that support fishermen. 
Regulatory collaboration with other stakeholders can also maintain the sustainability of the sea, and better waste 
processing in the fishing industry. The potential growth in Indonesia's fishery product exports in 2030 reaching 1.7 
million tons is also inseparable from the support and collaboration of various relevant stakeholders. The projected 
growth in exports of Indonesian fishery products can be realized if the relevant stakeholders work together.

Abstract 
Machine translations are commonly used for translation, but the result may not be correct, and the user might not 
know if the mistranslation happened. The research aims to identify the translation result of Japanese onomatopoeia 
that was translated using google translate to Indonesian, the difference between the google translate result and the 
Indonesian translated version, and the cause of mistranslation. The qualitative method through library research was 
applied. The data source was from the comic entitled Komi Can’t Communicate by Tomohito Oda. Translation results 
would be analyzed using the descriptive analysis method. It can be concluded that the research found that google 
translates onomatopoeia translation had differences from the Indonesian version from the difference in word usage to 
mistranslation due to language ambiguity and missing data. The author also finds the possibility of the lack of Japanese 
onomatopoeic data on google translate or the lack of data for translating Japanese onomatopoeic to Indonesian, which 
causes translation errors. In addition, the authors also found that the translation technique used by Google Translate 
in translating onomatopoeia mainly uses the word-for-word translation method so that it produces one word from each 
translation process. However, there is also translation using the free translation method, which uses two words to 
translate one onomatopoeia so that the translation results can be better understood in the target language.

1. Introduction
To be able to communicate effectively, language is used to connect in daily life. In this modern time, technological 
advances rapidly make our life easier. However, with the increasing number of interactions between cultures that 
occur in a short time, a problem must be resolved, namely the need for a way to translate and understand messages 
from one language to another. By using the services of a translator, everyone can understand the meaning of 
information received from other languages. However, it will take time which in modern times will take a long time 
and is expensive. Therefore, we need a solution that can translate from one language to another in a fast time. 
One of the solutions to solve this problem is to use machine translation services. Machine Translation is a part of 
computational linguistics that studies software to translate spoken or written messages from one language to another. 
With this machine translation service, everyone can easily translate from one language to another. With machine 
translation, everyone can easily and quickly translate and understand information obtained from other languages. At

In this category, there are translations that are not captured by google translate and corrected automatically, causing 
translation errors. Insufficient data can be the cause of this problem, so google translate corrects words that should be 
correct into other words contained in the data, causing unnecessary corrections in the translation process. This is also 
one of the errors in the analysis stage according to Nida and Taber's theory (in Suryawinata & Hariyanto, 2016, p. 8) 
which is the first stage of the translation process. 
5. Conclusion
After conducting the data analysis process in chapter 4, the author found that the results of the onomatopoeic 
translations contained in the comic ""Komi Difficult to Communicate"" by google translate can be divided into four 
categories, namely: 
a. The result of the translation that says the same and has the same meaning
The result of this translation is the result of an onomatopoeic translation that uses words of the same level and meaning 
as those produced by the Indonesian version of the comic so that the resulting translation can be said to be equivalent
to the translation found in the Indonesian version of the comic.
b. The result of a translation that has the same meaning but uses different words
The result of this translation is the result of an onomatopoeic translation that uses words that are different in level from
the Indonesian version but still have the same meaning so that the translation process is successful and can be
understood by the reader. In this category, many translations produced by Google Translate, compared to Indonesian,
are not functionally the same as onomatopoeia, thus showing the lack of Google Translate in understanding words
that are sounds or onomatopoeic as well as human translators even though the translation results have the same
meaning.
c. The results of the translation used are different, and the meaning shifts.
The result of this translation is the result of an onomatopoeic translation that uses words that are different in level from
the Indonesian version, and the meaning has shifted so that the results of the google translate translation in this
category are difficult for readers to understand. Translation errors in this category can occur in the language transfer
process.
d. The translation results used are different, and the meaning is not close at all
The result of this translation is the result of an onomatopoeic translation that uses words that are different in level from
the Indonesian version, and the meaning is not close at all. In this section, some results show onomatopoeia that may
not be in the google translate data, so there are ways of translating, such as changing the onomatopoeia directly to
Indonesian by using the Japanese reading method, translating it from English to Indonesian, and performing automatic
corrections on the onomatopoeia into words that approaching and in the google translate data and then translated into
Indonesian.
By comparing the results of the google translate translation and the Indonesian version of the comic, the author finds 
that many errors in the onomatopoeic translation by google translate occur due to language problems that have 
ambiguous nature. This causes many errors at the analysis stage of the onomatopoeia before being translated into 
Indonesian. In addition, the author also finds the possibility of the lack of Japanese onomatopoeic data on google 
translate or the lack of data for translating Japanese onomatopoeic to Indonesian, which causes translation errors. 
In addition, the author also finds that the translation techniques used by Google Translate in translating onomatopoeia 
mostly use the word-for-word translation method so that it produces one word from each translation process. However, 
there is also translation using the free translation method, which uses two words to translate one onomatopoeia so that 
the translation results can be better understood in the target language. 
The author realizes that this research is still far from perfect due to a lack of knowledge, time constraints, and data 
studied by the author, especially in selecting the data to be analyzed and looking for reliable sources to find the 
meaning of the onomatopoeia in both Japanese and Indonesian, which caused the writer to reduce the data. Therefore, 
for future research, the author suggests taking more data to add variety, looking for reliable sources, and having many 
data to clarify the meaning of onomatopoeia. With this research, it is hoped that it can help the general public, those 
who use machine translation services, and subsequent research to understand translation using machine translation.

Abstract 
Translating Japanese to Indonesian using the Google translation engine is an easy thing. However, the results of the 
google translate translation must go along as possible with reasonable accuracy. This study aims to determine the 
accuracy of Google Translate translation in translating Japanese articles into Indonesian. The research uses combined 
research methods through literature studies from various literature sources. The theories used in this study are 
Machali's assessment theory (2009), Hartono's translation theory (2017), Bassnett-McGuire's addition and subtraction 
theory (1991), and the BLEU algorithm (2002). The data is taken from a speech of the Ambassador of Japan to 
Indonesia, taken from an official article on the embassy's website. The research found the correct semantic assessment 
value, incorrect semantic assessment value, type of semantic error, and the value of the BLEU algorithm assessment. 
Google translate can provide a correct result in terms of semantics or meaning. The average correct semantic value 
indicates this is around 88.03%. The assessment of the BLEU algorithm for google translate text gets an assessment 
result of 37.11. This average value includes a low value, which shows a significant difference in structure between the 
google translate text and the translator text. In other words, the results of google translate are suitable for conveying 
the meaning of the results of the translation. However, it is essential to improve the sentence structure of the results 
of Google Translations.

1. Introduction
Along with the development of globalization, many things can go out and enter from abroad into Indonesia or vice 
versa. It is starting from clothes and food to language. One of the examples is products or goods originating from 
Japan. There are so many changes in trends and preferences in Indonesian society towards Japan. Because of this, now 
it is not foreign to see products or things that have Japanese nuances and are written in Japanese in Indonesia. However, 
to fully enjoy and understand Japanese, many people rely on google translate without learning Japanese grammar first. 
The reason is that this is considered much more practical and easier to do. Siregar (2017:6) explains that ""translation 
allows us to discover that certain ways of human behavior and interactions around us take very different forms in other 
parts of the world. This knowledge can help to understand other cultures through language that can provide a broader 
view."" In short, translation products expand and deepen one's world of consciousness in indescribable ways. Therefore, 
the translation results using google translate become an essential point in delivering information received and 
developed in a person. The quality and accuracy of the results of the Japanese translation using google translate must 
be appropriate to convey information or knowledge. If there is an error in the translation of google translate, there will

5. Conclusion
The conclusions of this study indicate the accuracy of google translate in the translation results from Japanese into 
Indonesian for article data. The analysis carried out shows that google translate can provide a correct translation result 
in terms of semantics or meaning. This is indicated by the average correct semantic value is around 88.03%. Then the 
occurrence of shifting or incorrect translation results is about 11.94% of the total. 
Then the results of the semantic assessment above are different from the results obtained from the BLEU assessment 
for google translate text, where the average BLEU algorithm assessment produces a value of around 37.11 out of 100. 
This BLEU algorithm average value is a low value, which means it shows a difference the structure is quite far between 
the google translate text and the translator text. In other words, it can be said that the results of google translate are 
suitable for conveying the meaning of the results of the translation, but it is essential to pay attention to and improve 
the sentence structure of the results of google translate translations.  
From the research conclusions that have been described. The author realizes that there are still many shortcomings 
that can be found due to the limited time and data studied by the author. Especially in the amount of reference data or 
translator data which is used as a comparison for the assessment of google translate results. Therefore, for future 
research, the authors suggest taking more diverse data with more than one reference data to get more accurate results. 
Also analyze other linguistic aspects contained in the results of the google translate translation. In addition, the results 
of this study are expected to help the general public and future research. With the results of the assessment in terms 
of semantics, Machali, R. (2009) and the BLEU algorithm to be able to help further understand the good results of 
google translate and become a theoretical basis that can be developed for future research.

Abstract 
Banks are one of the financial institutions that play a vital part in the Indonesian economy because banking is involved 
in all national economic activities such as consumption, investment, and export-import transactions. This study is 
conducted to examine the effect of Profitability, Liquidity, Managerial Ownership, and Company Growth on Dividend 
Policy in Banking Companies Listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2017-2020 period. This study employed a 
quantitative approach with panel data regression method. The results showed that simultaneously Profitability, 
Liquidity, Managerial Ownership, and Company Growth have a significant effect on Dividend Policy. Partially, 
Profitability has a negative and significant effect on Dividend Policy, while Liquidity, Managerial Ownership, and 
Company Growth have no significant effect on Dividend Policy.

1. Introduction
In Indonesia, banks are among the financial institutions that play a significant role in the economy. According to Law 
Number 10 of 1998, a bank is a business company that gathers funds from the public in the form of savings and 
distributes them to the public in the form of credit and/or other forms to better the people's standard of living. Banking 
in Indonesia serves as a collector and distributor of public funds with the goal of assisting in the implementation of 
national development to promote the equitable distribution of development and its outcomes. One of the pillars of 
economic growth and national stability to improve people's living standards in terms of the financial sector is banking. 
Banking is integral to all national economic activity, including consumption, investment, and export-import.  The 
contribution of consumption and investment accounts for 80% of the economy.  Based on data from the Central 
Statistics Agency (BPS), the contribution of the financial and insurance sectors to GDP in the second quarter of 2020 
only reached 4.44%. In helping to drive the national economy, PT Bank Central Asia (BCA) has increased lending 
due to the increasing need for credit in the infrastructure, pharmaceutical, retail, distribution, and plantation sectors. 
Dividend policy can be observed by looking at the Dividend Payout Ratio. Dividend Payout Ratio is the percentage 
of the amount of dividends distributed to shareholders (Nazar, 2021). The size of the dividends paid can affect 
investors in making decisions to invest. The following is a diagram of the number of banking companies that 
distributed dividends in the 2017-2020 period: (Figure 1)

Both roles bring their respective advantages to managers. The role as an investor by getting dividends as well as a role 
as a manager with agency costs from the owner of the company which will increase the income for the manager. So 
that any policy taken by the company will not affect the manager's attitude towards the Dividend Policy. The results 
of this study are in line with the results of research conducted by Roy (2015) which states that managerial ownership 
has no significant effect on dividend policy. 
The Effect of Company Growth on Dividend Policy 
Based on the results of the study, the company's growth variable has a probability value of 0.1746 which is greater 
than the 0.05 significance level so it can be concluded that the company's growth partially has no significant effect on 
dividend policy in banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 period. 
It is found that from 48 samples, there are 22 samples of company growth that are above the average and 22 samples 
of dividend policies that are above the average. Meanwhile, there are 26 samples of company growth that are below 
the average and 26 samples for dividend policy variables. These results reveal that banking companies in 2017-2020 
still have low company growth values and more companies have below average company growth. 
Based on the data that has been tested, the company's growth does not have a significant effect on dividend policy, it 
means that growth does not affect the amount of dividend payout ratio, both companies that are growing rapidly or 
not growing. The results of this study infer that dividends are paid without considering the company's growth.  In other 
words, this dividend policy does not depend on the company's growth but depends on the profits earned by the 
company. The results of this study are in line with the results of research conducted Basri (2019) which states that 
company growth has no significant effect on dividend policy. 
6. Conclusion
The purpose of this research is to evaluate and analyze the effects of Profitability, Liquidity, Managerial Ownership, 
and Company Growth on Dividend Policy. The object of research used was banking companies listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange for the period 2017-2020. The results found in this study are that profitability, liquidity, managerial 
ownership, and company growth simultaneously affect dividend policy, while partially profitability has a negative and 
significant effect, liquidity, managerial ownership, and company growth have no significant effect on dividend policy. 
This study is aimed to serve as a knowledge resource. The authors propose that future researchers substitute the 
variables analyzed above with other variables that affect dividend policy, as well as replace or add to the research 
sample. Companies should pay more attention to company profitability, liquidity, managerial ownership, and company 
growth in creating added value to increase company value. For investors, the results of this study can be used as 
information and an illustration of what factors can affect dividend policy. So that investors can consider it in making 
decisions to invest.

Abstract 
This study was conducted due to the emergence of problems related to the low job satisfaction of marketing division 
employees who are included in the millennial category which is considered quite less optimum. Since millennial 
generation is very plentiful with emotional differences, thus emotional intelligence is suspected to playing a role in 
shaping their job satisfaction. The data processing method used in this study is Partial Least Square. The results 
showed that emotional intelligence affects the organizational culture of millennial generation employees, 
organizational culture has an effect on job satisfaction of millennial generation employees, emotional intelligence 
affects the job satisfaction of millennial generation employees, and organizational culture mediates the influence of 
emotional intelligence on job satisfaction of millennial generation employees. Thereby, the main conclusion is that 
emotional intelligence influences organizational culture thus affects job satisfaction for millennial generation 
employees in automotive industry in East Java. This means that companies are encouraged to educate all employees 
about the importance of companionship and appreciation among fellow employees, especially employees of the 
marketing division born in the millennial era who may tend to be more ignorant or mediocre to the environment so 
that later it can increase employee job satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Employees in a company consist of various groups and various generations. The millennial generation (Gen Y) is 
known as a generation that is always sought after and coveted by marketers and brands. Millennials generation are 
always connected, fickle, but they can make an impact as a trendsetter. However, they can strengthen the brand or 
destroy the brand. This generation is characterized by those who are never separated from the media. The Millennial 
generation starts from those born in the 1981's to the 1996's. That means, from adolescence to early adulthood (24 
years – 42 years in 2022) (Tapscott, 2013). The elemental difference between Generation Y and previous generations 
is that Generation Y is more influenced by popular media such as movies, TV, magazines and video games which will 
eventually shape their perceptions and beliefs. Generation Y already has accessed to computers, the internet and most 
importantly Generation Y has lived with the internet and they are very competent in using it to find information about 
products. Furthermore, the internet tends to be the main source of reliable information (Tapscott, 2013). 
Research conducted by Deloitte Indonesia in 2019 showed about the complaint from some companies about high 
turnover rate of millennial employees, thus this made the Department of Human Resource challenged to maintain and 
play a part with the millennials. This happens since companies nowadays are no longer succeeded in compelling their 
workforce to stick to the companies’ principles. Millennials for most with typical aspects chose to leave the companies 
instead of being forced, which derived in high turnover (Devina & Dwikardana, 2019). Meanwhile the presence of 
Generation Y in the workplace will continue to grow and dominate, as is the case with the emergence of Gen Z who 
are starting to enter the workforce (Santoso & Soehari, 2020). In this study, the millennial generation will be appointed 
as the focus of research.

Nadzar (2016) which explains that emotional intelligence has a significant positive effect on job satisfaction. 
Indirectly, emotional intelligence affects job satisfaction through the organizational culture of millennial generation 
employees. This shows that emotional intelligence will have the ability to change employee job satisfaction only if 
they are able to improve the company's organizational culture. So that the employees of the millennial can be 
concluded that they really hope for emotional intelligence in forming a culture that can provide increased job 
satisfaction.  
 
5. Conclusion  
After testing using the Partial Least Square method, this study found several conclusions that can be described as 
follows: 1). it was found that emotional intelligence has an effect on the organizational culture of millennial generation 
employees which means that if the millennial generation employees have the ability and intelligence to regulate their 
emotions, it will most likely encourage a good organizational culture in a company; 2). Furthermore, it was also found 
that organizational culture had an effect on job satisfaction of millennial generation employees which shows that when 
an employee already feels a positive culture, they will be satisfied when working in a company, because it is very 
difficult to be able to form a conducive environment in a company; 3). The results show that emotional intelligence 
directly affects job satisfaction of millennial generation employees. This means that the millennial generation 
employees are very concerned about the emotional intelligence abilities of other employees. Good emotional 
intelligence will make other employees feel comfortable working and of course with this situation, one of the factors 
of job satisfaction is formed; 4). The indication that emotional intelligence indirectly affects job satisfaction through 
organizational culture of millennial generation employees. This shows that emotional intelligence will have the ability 
to change employee job satisfaction only if they are able to improve the company's organizational culture. So that the 
employees of the millennials can be concluded that they really hope for emotional intelligence in forming a culture 
that can provide increased job satisfaction. 
 
Meanwhile, recommendations for further research are as follows: 1) Increasing the respondents’ number to get more 
accurate results; 2) Expanding the scope of observations since this study only focus on millennial generation 
employees in automotive industry in East Java. Moreover, the practical implications that can be described are as 
follows: 1. That referring to the emotional intelligence variable, it was found that the highest factor loading value on 
the emotional intelligence variable is indicator number 3 with the contents of the statement ""I feel that my co-workers 
have feelings of empathy"" which means that this indicator is the indicator that most strongly reflects the variable 
emotional intelligence, so that in order to increase emotional intelligence variables, companies are advised to educate 
all employees about the importance of brotherhood and empathy among employees, especially marketing division 
employees who were born in the millennial era who may tend to be more indifferent or indifferent to the environment 
so that later they can improve their jobs. employee satisfaction; 2. Referring to the organizational culture variable, it 
was found that the highest factor loading value in the organizational culture variable is indicator number 2 with the 
contents of the statement ""I feel that the distribution of resources to work is balanced"" which means that this indicator 
is the most strongly reflects the variable of organizational culture, so that in order to improve organizational culture 
variables, companies are advised to re-evaluate the distribution system of resources in the company such as the 
distribution of equipment, the needs of other employees such as tools or equipment that can help the work of other 
employees so that later it can increase employee job satisfaction.

Abstract 
The popularity of electric vehicles has been on the rise lately. This is evidenced by the large number of manufacturers 
that present new models of plug-in hybrid vehicles and batteries. However, the revolution's success in the birth of 
electric vehicles also depends on the presence of consumers, the involvement of many users, and the many 
psychological mechanisms hindering it. What is the actual user's feeling about this type of electric vehicle?   Are 
people ready for automation and no driver position? The purpose of this paper is to present and discuss the 
psychological aspects that influence the adoption of electric vehicles in Indonesia.   Topics such as charging stations 
or electric vehicles first and performance anxiety, e.g., range anxiety, will be discussed in this paper.

1. Introduction
Research discussing Electric Vehicles (EVs) has existed since 1911. There have been as many as three articles, and 
until now, there have been 128,644 articles, starting to appear a lot since 1965. This research is limited to social 
science, business management and accounting, economics, econometrics, and finance. The author took data from 
2000. There were about 5,700 yield documents. 
The era of electric vehicles is coming quickly, but there are obstacles regarding the sound of electric vehicles. These 
electric vehicles have no sound. The silence of electric vehicles is still a matter of debate. On the one hand, reducing 
noise pollution is also feared and will pose a danger to pedestrians, visually impaired people, and other vehicles. 
(Singh et al., 2014). 
Countries in the world, such as in Europe, require electric vehicles to have a distinctive sound, where the regulation 
is used to protect pedestrians. The result is a device to be adopted, the ""Audible Vehicle Alert System"" (Commission 
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017), the type of sound must not resemble animals, sirens, horns, and music (Ministerial 
Regulation 33, 2018).  
One of the major electric car manufacturers, Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) from Germany, asked one of the 
world's most famous composers and academy award winners, Hans Zimmer, to create a decent electric car sound 
BMW M IconicSounds Electric and the i4 in the M version. Other car manufacturers, such as Porsche, also developed 
a   new car audio system called the ""soundtrack of my life project"" that can produce unique sounds and be set for 
leisurely driving. Porsche also has its library of original music bits or pieces. This can make it easier to develop 
projects that will then be combined and arranged by the audio system algorithm so that they can be played according 
to the wishes of Porsche sports cars.   One of the luxury manufacturers of sports cars, Maserati, is also not lagging in 
producing electric sports cars. Even though it is electric-powered, the manufacturer will not remove the smell of

Figure 5. Profile of SoC  
 
In Figure 4 EV drivers feel uncomfortable when the battery SOC drops below the threshold caused by the fear of 
being stranded in the middle of the journey (Franke & Krems, 2013)—for example, using an electric vehicle with with 
an autonomy of  300 km based on the manufacturer. With a  buffer consideration of 20% as a comfort level, so EV 
has 240 km of autonomy if it starts with a full SoC.   Based on the Figure,  such trips are usually carried out no more 
than 5 per year. If the manufacturer then considers increasing the battery capacity in the future, suppose reaching 400 
km of autonomy in the next three years,   the days of anxiety will be halved to 2 or 3. 
 
The conclusion is that range anxiety can be said to be more rhetorical or just a concern, to some extent that the body 
allows. Users who are still pessimistic about electric cars and do not want to switch to EVs will say that their wishes 
are out of reach. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The conclusion in this writing is the primary attitude most influential in the transition from conventional to electric 
vehicles. The primary purpose is to consider users' reactions to new electric vehicle products. Some studies describe 
the characteristics of early adopters, but subsequent studies determine general characteristics, for example, addition 
to socioeconomic conditions and high incomes. This is also because electric vehicles at the embryonic stage are still 
expensive compared to conventional vehicles, which are not too expensive. 
 
Such fears belong to a wider range of anxiety. This anxiety was discussed, and attempts were made to evaluate it 
numerically, suggesting that although similar situations can occur several times per year, it is still one of the main 
obstacles to the use of EVs precisely because of the theory of reactions to innovations, which does not allow a person 
to abandon the certainty of the present

Abstract 
The knapsack problem with setup (KPS) is a challenging problem in combinatorial optimization. This paper deals 
with the generalized problem of KPS called multiple-choice knapsack problem with setup (MCKS). The MCKS has 
several applications in industry such as the assignment of production to plants. A combination of Iterated local search 
with integer linear programming is provided and enhanced by LP-relaxation to solve the MCKS. The provided mat 
heuristic is called LP-ILS&IP. A sensitivity analysis is provided the justify the components of the LP-ILS&IP and 
numerical experiments are conducted on a set of 120 benchmark instances to show the competitiveness of the LP-
ILS&IP compared to the best state-of-the-art solving techniques.

1. Introduction
This paper deals with the multiple-choice knapsack problem with setup (MCKS) (Yang 2006; Adouani et al. 2019). 
The MCKS has several applications in industry e.g. the assignment of products (families of products) to plants is 
equivalent to the assignment of items (class of items) to knapsacks in MCKS. In fact, the selection of one plant to 
produce each item is justified by: the capacity and global budget that limit the production, the procurement of raw 
materials and logistics operation costs that differ from a plant to another, and the setup and running-in times that is of 
utmost importance. Moreover, items from the same family can be produced in different plants respecting Jordan and 
Graves (1995). In addition, to move from one item production to another, a setup is required. We note that the setup 
between items from the same family is quite negligible e.g. simple setting is required, but the setup from one class of 
items to another is time consuming and costly e.g. change the molds in the molding machine. The price of an item 
depends on the plant where it is produced i.e. the profit for an item varies from a plant to another i.e. plant dependent 
parameter, but the processing time remains the same i.e. plant independent parameter.  
The MCKS is a general extension of the classical knapsack problem (KP) (Martello and Toth 1990) where the items 
belong to classes and an item can be processed in a knapsack only if its class is assigned to this knapsack. The 
installation of a class requires setup time i.e. resource consumption and cost. MCKS is a generalization of KPS (Chebil 
and Khemakhem 2015) to multiple knapsacks. It is also a special case of MKPS (Lahyani et al. 2019) while items 
from the same class can be assigned to different knapsacks. The generalized quadratic multiple knapsack problem 
(GQMKP) (Avci and Topaloglu 2017) is a special case of MCKS that considers additional profit when two items (j, 
j’) are assigned to the same knapsack.  
Approximate and exact methods have been developed for KPS variants. Yang and Bulfin (2009) proposed an exact 
approach based on a B&B for KPS and showed its limitation for large instances. Yang et al (2009) provided a B&B 
framework based on the two-stage strategy for the KPS, and particularly analyzed the influence of the correlation 
between the profit and weight of items on the effectiveness of the framework. Chebil and Khemakhem (2015) 
proposed a DP algorithm and showed its limitation for large-scale KPS instances (up to 10000 items). For the same 
problem, Pferschy and Rosario (2018) provided a DP algorithm based on reduction techniques that outperforms the

Table 1. Numerical results on the benchmark instances (Adouani et al. 2019) 
Table 1 also shows the performance of the LP-ILS&IP on benchmark instances in terms of computation time. We 
notice that LP-ILS&IP is considerably faster on average than VNS&IP and ILP: 2.17 seconds with LP-ILS&IP versus 
13 seconds with VNS&IP and 2868 seconds with ILP. 
5. Conclusion
In this article, we studied the multiple-choice knapsack problem with setup (MCKS). A new mat heuristic called LP-
ILS&IP combining LP-relaxation enhancing ILS with ILP is provided to solve the MCKS. The performance of the 
LP-ILS&IP components are studied. The LP-ILS&IP is tested on 120 benchmark instances. Numerical results showed 
the effectiveness and the efficiency of LP-ILS&IP compared to IP (solved with CPLEX 12.7) and the best algorithm 
in literature (VNS&IP). The LP-ILS&IP particularly reaches optimality for 25 instances and provides best-known 
solutions for 118/120 instances.  For future work, we expect to improve and generalize our LP-ILS&IP algorithm to 
deal with other variants of KP problems such as generalized knapsack sharing problem (GKSP).

Abstract 
During this pandemic of Covid-19, many people changed their transactions from offline to online transactions. One 
of which is transactions using crypto assets. Crypto assets can be said to be a type of digital currency generated from 
a very complex cryptographic algorithm in order to provide a safe and convenient medium for users. One of the 
advantages of transactions using crypto assets is that when making transactions you don't have to show your identity. 
But it can make it possible to become a new tool for criminals to store and process data and money from crimes 
perfectly. This study will discuss the importance of KYC in crypto assets transactions and how KYC will help in 
minimizing the threat or problems during transactions. KYC itself is a principle applied by the bank in order to know 
in depth the identity of a customer and monitor customer transaction activities including reporting activities on 
suspicious transactions. The importance of applying the KYC principle to crypto assets is in terms of minimizing the 
crime that will occur as well as providing a huge advantage that businessmen can easily monitor client activities and 
avoid the risk of adverse things that relate to crypto assets.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the development of technology in the world, especially in Indonesia, is increasing rapidly and has changed 
all aspects of human life which have caused the emergence of many activities that can be done easily, namely by using 
digital means or relying on internet technology (online) which of course is an option for many people. One of the 
activities carried out is to make transactions online. An online transaction is a transaction carried out by sellers and 
buyers online through the internet media where each party no longer has to meet or meet face to face in person just to 
make a transaction, one of the transactions that can be done online is a transaction using crypto assets. A transaction 
using crypto assets is a digital asset transaction that is used to make transactions virtually on the internet network and 
this digital currency is known as ""Cryptocurrency"".  
During the Covid-19 pandemic, one of the alternatives used by many people to seek profits is to try to invest in crypto 
assets. The trend of making investments using crypto assets in Indonesia began in 2020, reporting from the databox 
website, namely in 2020 crypto asset transactions in Indonesia were at Rp 64.9 trillion. However, in 2021 crypto asset 
trading is increasing, which was previously at IDR 64.9 trillion then increased by 1,222% to IDR 859.4 trillion, Then 
in 2022, namely in May, the number of crypto asset trading transactions in Indonesia has reached IDR 192 trillion. In

5.5 KYC Regulation in Indonesia 
In Indonesia, the Principle of Knowing Your Customer (KYC) has been regulated in various laws and regulations 
as follows: 
o 
Law No. 8 of 2010 concerning the Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering 
o 
Permenkeu No. 30/PMK,010/2010 concerning the Application of Know Your Customer Principles 
for Non-Bank Financial Institutions 
o 
Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 14/27/PBI/2012 concerning the Implementation of Anti-Money 
Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Programs for Commercial Banks 
o 
POJK No. 12/POJK.01/2017 concerning the Implementation of Anti-Money Laundering and 
Prevention of Terrorism Financing in the Financial Services Sector 
 
Based on the table above, it can be said that the entire implementation of KYC rules in laws or other provisions will 
be used as internal policy standards owned by each company. 
 
5.6 Application of KYC on Crypto Assets in Indonesia 
In Indonesia regarding crypto asset trading, OJK has expressly prohibited financial service institutions from using, 
marketing, and/or facilitating crypto asset trading and urged institutions/ministries that supervise legal entities 
outside the OJK's authority, to ensure the use of bank accounts in accordance with applicable regulations. Both 
legal entities that carry out savings and loans, trade, and/or investment businesses involving public funds, which 
are beyond the authority of the OJK to supervise. So that efforts are made to ensure that bank accounts are not used 
to commit unlawful acts such as fraud, gambling, money laundering, illegal investments, and/or containing Ponzi 
schemes, banks are asked to be vigilant so that bank accounts are not used as a reservoir of funds from activities 
such as crypto or investments with Ponzi schemes. 
 
6. Conclusion  
During the current pandemic, there is an increase in the number of people who make transactions online, where 
transactions using crypto assets are one of the people's choices in making a transaction. In Indonesia, transactions 
using crypto assets have not been fully regulated in the applicable provisions which makes people who want to make 
transactions have to bear the consequences caused by losses incurred through the transaction. Based on the results of 
research in Indonesia in conducting transactions using crypto assets, it is only supervised by Bappebti, but regarding 
the use of crypto assets for illegal purposes such as money laundering and terrorism financing as well as the 
development of weapons of mass destruction. This has been regulated in Bappebti Regulation No. 6/2019 which 
regulates the implementation of AML-CFT programs by crypto asset traders in accordance with regulations regulated 
in ba, such as the obligation of the Customer Due Diligence Process, the obligation to monitor transactions and the 
obligation to report any suspicious crypto asset transactions.

Abstract 
This research aims to investigate the influence of Indonesian and New Zealand cultures on the leadership styles of 
Indonesian restaurant owners in New Zealand and to explore the influences of leadership styles on the performance 
of Indonesian restaurants in New Zealand. This is exploratory research that was conducted using a qualitative research 
method. The data was collected by conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews to thirteen interviewees that include 
the owners and one to three employees from each of the four selected Indonesian restaurants in Auckland and 
Wellington, New Zealand. Then a thematic data analysis was used to analyze the data. The research found that the 
leadership styles of the four owners of Indonesian restaurants in New Zealand were influenced more by Indonesian 
culture and slightly by New Zealand culture. Moreover, they applied a combination of transformational, servant, and 
transactional leaderships styles in leading their employees and running the restaurants. Furthermore, these leadership 
styles influence the businesses’/restaurants’ performance. In conclusion, there is a relationship between culture, 
leadership styles, and business performance of Indonesian restaurants in New Zealand. 
Keywords 
Business performance, Indonesian - New Zealand cultures, Indonesian restaurants, leadership styles. 
1. Introduction
Food, including beverages, are the basic needs of human life. With many different cultures in this world, it makes the 
food and beverages in the world have various varieties. Every country in the world has its own unique traits and 
characteristics of their food and drinks. It makes the food and beverage industry one of the fast-growing sectors 
globally because it has a high demand. 
As a tourism country, New Zealand gains many tourists visiting and enjoying the country’s food, drinks, culture, 
panorama, and attractions. The visitor arrivals in New Zealand keep increasing every year since 2012. More than 
500,000 international visitors come to New Zealand during the holiday seasons. According to Stat NZ (2021), in June 
2019, there were around 210,000 international tourists entering New Zealand. Therefore, the revenue from tourism 
and hospitality keeps growing. As reported by IBISWorld (2021), the industry is expecting an annual increase of 0.6 
percent throughout the year.  
There is a variety of international cuisine in New Zealand brought by tourists from all around the world, bringing their 
food and drinks along with the culture. There are more than a dozen kinds of international cuisine in New Zealand, 
that include Thai, Indian, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, Korean, Turkish, Greek, Indonesian, and many more. 
According to popularity by trends, the top five most popular international cuisines in New Zealand are led by Thai 
food with a score of 78 followed by Indian food (51), Chinese food (49), Italian food (31), and Japanese food (30) 
(Williams 2020).  
1.1 Indonesian Food and Beverage Market in New Zealand 
According to Razzaq (2016), there is an increase in Muslim travelers coming to New Zealand. They mostly come 
from Indonesia and Malaysia. Besides that, the change in the economic and social situations of the Muslim population 
growth increases the demand for halal food and beverages. According to Razzaq (2016), New Zealand is number 45

performance in the future. Transformational leaders emphasize open communication and give trust to the employees 
(Nanjundeswaraswamy and Swamy 2014). A servant leadership style is when the leader always puts the employees 
before themselves. A servant leader always wants to teach and develop the employees to be more skillful and 
encourages them (Gandolfi and Stone 2018).  
 
The employees mentioned that the leadership and working culture is related with the business performance. The way 
the owners or the leaders treat the employees and solve the problems affect the employee performance which leads to 
the business performance. The statements from the interviewees are in line with the statement from Valdiserri (2009), 
in which small business failure is caused by the poor management, leadership, capitalization, business planning, 
industry knowledge, and a lack of vision leads to failure. This is aligned with the respondents’ responses that the 
leadership of the leader in the way he/she treats the employees affects their business performance.  
 
All the employees feel comfortable and enjoy working with people that have the same culture as them. Most of the 
employees responded that they enjoy working with an Indonesian leader and feel proud to work in an Indonesian 
restaurant. The employees said that is easier for the employees to discuss with the owner to ask for flexibility. One of 
the owners said that it is easier to manage the employees when all the employees come from the same culture.  
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations  
The aim of this research is to recognize the different leadership applied by Indonesian restaurant owners in New 
Zealand by exploring the influence of Indonesian and New Zealand cultures on the leadership styles of Indonesian 
restaurant owners in New Zealand and its influence on the business performance. The findings were gathered based 
on the interviews with four owners and nine employees from four Indonesian restaurants. According to the findings 
and analysis, culture has a significant influence on the leadership styles of Indonesian restaurant owners by affecting 
the way the owners manage and lead their businesses. Indonesian culture has a greater influence on the working culture 
of Indonesian restaurants in New Zealand. All the interviewees were born and raised in Indonesia. That is shown in 
how big the influence of Indonesian culture is. The interviewees applied New Zealand culture to adjust with the market 
and environment. It was also found that the management and leadership affect the business and employee performance. 
These two aspects are related to each other. All four applied a different leadership style but all the restaurants share 
the same goal to introducing Indonesian food to the New Zealand local market. Out of the three leadership styles, 
servant leadership, was found to be the least popular for Indonesian restaurant owners to apply. Most of the owners 
applied transformational and transactional leadership styles. The leadership and the way of managing the business is 
found to affect the business performance. 
 
For the managerial implications, these research findings can be beneficial for other Indonesian business players in 
New Zealand. The culture, specifically Indonesian and New Zealand cultures, affect the working culture and 
leadership of the owner, which leads to the business performance. It will help people to achieve good business 
performance by analyzing their leadership styles and learn from it. 
 
The limitations during the research include: a limited number of restaurant owners were interviewed because some of 
them were not available or unwilling to be interviewed. The locations of the restaurants were in different cities, so the 
researchers needed air travel to have face-to-face interviews, and there was a limitation to find more restaurants that 
had been running for more than a year, because there are not many Indonesian restaurants in New Zealand and some 
of the Indonesian restaurants had closed their businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, for future research, it is 
recommended to find more respondents to obtain more robust findings and a deeper analysis. Besides that, it will be 
beneficial to focus more on the employee retention and employee well-being in analyzing the performance. Then it is 
suggested to apply a mixed method for the analysis, using both qualitative and quantitative methods.

Abstract 
East Asia is a region because of its economic activity. Current transformation 
towards a digital economy, East 
Asia must also transform their synergy to maintain its economic growth. China, which has become a leading economy 
in the international environment, must address its capability to lead East Asia into a more united region. Therefore, 
this article will discuss two main topics. First is the current condition of regional economic integration in East Asia 
regarding digital economy transformation. Second, how China could manifest and lead the region's digital economy 
development.

1. Introduction
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is the longest regional institution in East Asia, founded in 
1967. On the establishment, ASEAN is constructing three communities to realize three pillars: economic community, 
political-security community, and socio-cultural community. The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) envisions 
ASEAN becoming a single market and production base, resulting in a common market arrangement for promoting 
regional cooperation and integration in East Asia. ASEAN's main principle is the non-interference toward the national 
sovereignty of its member while creating intergovernmental among ASEAN members. (Dent 2017) The effect of 
ASEAN towards East Asia integration has led to several progression throughout ASEAN + 3, East Asia Summit, and 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which will be later discussed in the chapter, emanating economic integration 
inside the region. As a counterpart of ASEAN, the Northeastern Asian states (China, Japan, and South Korea) decided 
to make an institution called NATC. 
NATC (Northeast Asia Trilateral Co-operation) was created as a compeer of ASEAN, which took place in 1998; there 
are several reasons why NATC was made to conduct a trilateral meeting. The first was to reduce and minimize 
miscommunication between the three leaders. These circumstances have resulted in many disturbances within the 
region. Moreover, the second is to increase mutual exchange that, in time, will smoothen the relations among the three 
states that would progress in regional integration. However, the result of NATC is not going as intended. Although 
after the trilateral meeting was conducted, there was an increasing volume of mutual exchange however the meeting 
did not highly influence it. It happened due to the increased amount of exchange outside Northeast Asia. The first 
reason to minimize miscommunication is also proven to be a failure because the perception gap among the three 
leaders was never narrowed. Meanwhile, the dispute regarding their perception of their historical events still has not 
reached the middle ground (Kan 2014) (Dent 2017).

On the other hand, transport costs also benefit from the RCEP agreement, where the movement of goods among 
countries would be more efficient due to increased production. Hence, the logistics and shipping industry will get 
more opportunities and increase RCEP members' overall intraregional trade. Thus, the digital economy is accelerated 
due to the ease of digital infrastructure construction, goods movement, and prices brought into non-advanced RCEP 
countries in digital technology. The development of East Asia's economic integration would intensify through China's 
Digital Silk Road plan. 
6. Conclusion 
East Asia regional integration has been an issue for more than a decade. Multiple attempts have been tried to bring 
unity to East Asia, yet it remains futile, and some event even brings regress to the integration process. Nevertheless, 
East Asia is highly functioning as a region in economic terms; with the development of industry 4.0, creating a digital 
economy through digitalization and ICT development has created a new space for East Asia countries to face. For a 
long, Japan and China have competed in the economic sector. However, with the arrival of the digital economy, China 
has won in its digital economy development. The concurrent China policy, and their expansion of digital infrastructure 
throughout the world, will bring East Asia to the creation of RTA. RCEP could be perceived as one result of this. With 
the existence of RCEP, digital economy development in East Asia is reassuring for the region's prospects. China leads 
in the digital economy, which has created circumstances for RCEP to be ratified by Asia-Pacific countries. The 
imperfect competition and scale economies of China have to bring cost reduction and trade suppression for e-
commerce and digital market goods, which RCEP covers in their agreements. Digital Silk Road -their master plan to 
enhance digital connectivity- creates development in e-commerce implementation in countries like Indonesia and 
Malaysia. Due to the high production of digital goods and the close geographic position of China, Japan, and South 
Korea, the three countries have intensified their trade relations. With China's focus on digital development, East Asian 
countries are experiencing a spillover effect where most of them are manufacturing electronic computing components 
and adopting them as their main exports. Lastly, due to their trade intensity, the reduction towards removal of custom 
duties on trade inside RCEP members has occurred this year.

Abstract 
Air transportation in Indonesia is developing very rapidly which is the main factor causing the increase in 
operational activities at airports in Indonesia from year to year. Indonesia has 17,499 islands with a total area of 
about 7,810,000 km2 consisting of an ocean area  of 3.25 million km2, an Exclusive Economic Zone area of about 
2.55 million km2, and land with an area of about 2.01 million km2. This study aims to analyze the productivity 
level of airport companies in Indonesia managed by PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) 
for the period 2011-2020. This study uses the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) method to calculate the level 
of productivity of each company. There are two variables used in this study, namely the input variable and the 
output variable. The input variables consist of number of runways, terminal size area, number of employments, 
and total expense. Meanwhile total number of aircraft movements, total number of passengers, total freight, and 
total revenue as variable output. This research show that PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) is unproductive, while PT 
Angkasa Pura II (Persero) is productive. According to previous statement, it can be summarised that PT Angkasa 
Pura II (Persero) more productive than PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) to manage inputs and outputs owned by 
company.

1. Introduction
Transportation is a business of transporting and carrying passengers and goods from one place to another place. 
These field is important in Indonesia considering Indonesia is one of the largest archipelagic countries in the world. 
There are three types of transportation classified from the angle of the road or the road surface as well as the means 
of transportation used, namely land, sea and air transportation (Kamaludin, 2003). Air transportation the latest and 
fastest means of transportation because this transportation uses airplanes as a means of transportation and air or 
space as its path, so it is very suitable for mountainous areas, ravines, and so on. Judging from the vast territory 
of Indonesia which consists of thousands of islands, air transportation operations are an attractive option, especially 
as a means of connecting people and goods from one region to another. 
Air transportation in Indonesia has experienced very rapid development, the trigger for which is the concept of 
Low Cost Carrier which has changed the rules of the game in the aviation industry (Setyarini & Ahyudanari, 2017). 
This makes air travel more affordable for people on a moderate budget. Furthermore, air transport is the only 
means of accessing remote and less developed areas to benefit from connections with the outside world. 
Judging from the aircraft movements and passenger movements of PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa 
Pura II (Persero) for the 2011-2020 period tend to increase, although there are several years where it has decreased, 
especially in 2020 which experienced a very significant decrease when compared to the previous year. In contrast, 
cargo throughout 2020 PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) experienced a slight growth, namely by 2.09% from 427,135

average value of PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) are distributed normally, and PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) is 
distributed abnormally. The following are the test results of the difference in the average TFPCH value of PT 
Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) using the Mann-Whitney U Test.

Based on the results of the TFPCH average difference test using the Mann-Whitney U Test in Table 7. above 
between PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) during the 2011-2020 period has an 
Asymp level. Sig (2-tailed)>α (0.05). So, the H0 hypothesis is accepted, which means that there is no significant 
productivity between PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero).  
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis and discussion of the results of research on the level of airport productivities in Indonesia 
managed by PT Angkasa Pura I and PT Angkasa Pura II using the Malmquist Productivity Index during the 2011-
2020 period by conducting productivity testing, it can be concluded as follows: 
 
1. MPI results show that the average TFPCH value of PT Angkasa Pura I is not too high. This means that 
PT Angkasa Pura I is not productive in managing its inputs and outputs, this happens because of the use 
of less-than-optimal technology in managing operational activities at airports managed by PT Angkasa 
Pura I. However, PT Angkasa Pura I has been quite efficient in managing its inputs and outputs because 
the average value of EFFCH is standard. 
2. MPI results show that the average TFPCH value produced by PT Angkasa Pura II is high. This means 
that PT Angkasa Pura II is productive in managing its inputs and outputs. This productivity occurs 
because PT Angkasa Pura II is efficient in managing its inputs and outputs and is supported using optimal 
technology in managing its inputs and outputs. 
3. Based on the comparison between the productivity of PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa Pura 
II (Persero), there are differences in the level of productivity. Which can be said that PT Angkasa Pura II 
is more productive than PT Angkasa Pura I in managing its inputs and outputs because the results of 
measuring the level of productivity show that PT Angkasa Pura I is not productive, and PT Angkasa Pura 
II is productive in managing its inputs and outputs. Even though, the result of different test TFPCH mean 
show that the difference between PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) is not 
significant.

Abstract 
Businesses are adapting to build supply chain resilience to ensure long-term sustainability in response to globalization, 
rising climate, health, and poverty issues. The recent global health crisis has forced us to contribute to the Sustainable 
Development Goals in the supply chain, especially Agriculture Supply Chain Management (ASCM), which is 
responsible for food production and distribution. Farmers have a function as producers but are frequently 
disadvantaged, and stakeholders often lack coordination. There is a paucity of knowledge regarding data transmitted 
between players and goods from the upstream to the downstream. The ASCM can consider employing blockchain 
technology (BT) to address these concerns. The ASCM anticipates that blockchain technology will enhance its 
operation and sustainability by maximizing value creation in each supply chain phase. This study aims to investigate 
the current state of Indonesia's ASCM, provide insight into the usage of blockchain, and propose a blockchain 
architectural model to enhance the value creation of ASCM in Indonesia. The researcher evaluates and assesses 15 
publications, compares them to current situations, and recommends an improvement analysis for the future’s system. 
The final analysis reveals the proposed architectural model in ASCM using blockchain technology with Ethereum, 
and Interplanetary File System that enables traceability, transparency, and great coordination among stakeholders. The 
possible created values mentioned are Business process improvements; Improving customer experience; Data security; 
Learning – developing of new capabilities; Coordination; and Tokenization.

1. Introduction
Supply chains are critical to the present and future success of the global economy. This role corresponds to the 
evolution of development issues and the industrial revolution 4.0. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a 
global action plan for ending poverty, reducing inequality, and protecting the environment. All aspects are expected 
to contribute to this long-term development. SDGs linked to global supply chains are met through the United Nations 
(UN), which requires an inclusive, sustainable, efficient, nutritious, and healthy food system (Banker 2021; Quaralia 
2022). With a 50% increase in the world's population, global food demand is expected to double by 2050. Most growth 
occurs in developing countries, notably on the African and Asian continents (Pullman and Wu 2021). The most crucial 
food crop agricultural harvest commodities are produced by China, Brazil, India, Argentina, Indonesia, and the United 
States. Food crop agriculture is critical to Indonesia's economic development. According to the Indonesian Central 
Statistics Agency (BPS), agriculture contributed 13.70 percent of Indonesia's GDP in 2019 and employed 29.46 
percent or 33.4 million people. Food crops are one of agriculture's many sectors. Food crops are a sector capable of 
producing staple foods for more than 90% of Indonesia's population (Nurliza et al. 2017). Rice, corn, cassava, potatoes, 
vegetables, and fruits are examples of food crops. This sector is regarded as having a remarkable ability to generate 
quality growth (growth with equity) (Lokollo 2012). Therefore, agriculture in the food crop sector requires 
improvement and development to distribute agricultural products of food crops from producers to consumers, ranging 
from raw materials to semi-finished and finished products. It is necessary to apply the Supply Chain Management 
(SCM) concept. Agriculture Supply Chain Management (ASCM) is an integrated system between a network of

access to agricultural data causes supply chain setbacks due to unclear information flow, making it difficult for 
authorities to analyze problems. As technology, economy, and population growth, the agricultural supply chain must 
innovate and create value to remain sustainable. Blockchain technology is expected to help the flow of information in 
the agricultural supply chain. Researchers have reviewed 15 papers to find out how the current state of the agricultural 
supply chain is in Indonesia. Then, describes the integration between agricultural supply chains with blockchain 
technology assisted by IoT products, and proposes an architectural model of blockchain technology implementation 
in agricultural supply chains in Indonesia regarding (Patel et al, 2021) and analyze the expected value creation that is 
realized from the resource, activities, and capabilities of the proposed architectural model. Based on the literature and 
researcher's analysis of the capabilities of the proposed architectural model, the values that are expected to be obtained 
from value creation are Business Process Improvement; Improving Customer Experience; Data Security; 
Coordination; Learning-Developing New Capabilities; and Tokenization.

Abstract 
This study aimed to evaluate the effect The Effect of Village Official Competency, Community Participation, 
Information and Technology Utilization and Internal Control System on Village Fund Management Accountability 
This study used primary data through questionnaires to 144 village officials consisting of the village head, village 
secretary, finance officer, head of government, members of the Village Consultative Body, and community leaders 
from 12 villages located in Bakarangan District, Tapin South Kalimantan, Indonesia. Validity and reliability test were 
used to test the quality of the data. The data analysis technique used was multiple regression analysis.  
The result on this study indicate that Village Official Competency and Internal Control System partially has no effect 
on Village Fund Management Accountability. Community Participation, Information and Technology Utilization 
partially has significant effect on Village Fund Management Accountability.

1. Introduction
Government Accounting has a position in the management of public finances in realizing good governance, starting 
from central, regional, or village financial management. Principles in government accounting such as accountability 
and transparency. Management of public finances is not only a form of obligation from the central government, but 
also for areas such as villages. The village as a government organizational unit that deals directly with residents with 
all backgrounds of interests and needs has a very strategic role. 
According to Law Number 6 of 2014 article 72 paragraph 1, village funds also come from original village income, 
village funds sourced from the State Revenue and Expenditure Budget, part of Regional Taxes and Regency/City 
Village Retribution, financial support from the Provincial Revenue and Expenditure Budget and Revenue and 
Expenditure Budget Regency/City, grants and third-party donations, and other legal village income. Nowadays, there 
are more media reports discussing the embezzlement of village funds by village officials, including the village head, 
Village Treasurer, and others. The budget given by the central government to regional governments, especially through 
the State Revenue and Expenditure Budget from year to year continues to be increasing, which is one aspect of the 
irregularities in the use of village funds.

4.1.7. The Effect of Internal Control System to Village Fund Management Accountability 
The test results of multiple linear regression analysis show that the internal control system variable has no effect on 
the accountability of village fund management. The conclusion is drawn based on the results of hypothesis testing 
which shows the t-count value is 0.269 which is smaller than the t-table value, namely 2.016 and the significance level 
shows a value of 0.787 which is greater than 0.05. These results indicate that this study has not been able to prove that 
the accountability of village fund management is influenced by the internal control system. This research is in line 
with research conducted by Ani (2020) which states that the internal control system has no effect on the financial 
management of village funds. 
5. Conclusions
Based on the results of research and discussion, the following conclusions can be drawn:
1. The competence of the village fund management official does not affect the accountability of village fund
management in a negative direction. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis and agency theory, the
village official as an agent has not been able to maximize its performance well. The relationship of related
competencies in terms of characteristics, communication, knowledge, and skills has not been implemented
effectively and efficiently, resulting in the ability of the village official or the competence of the village official to
significantly influence the performance of village financial management.
2. Community participation affects the accountability of village fund management. The results of this study are
sufficient to support the hypothesis and agency theory where the community as the principal is aware of the
importance of participating in assisting the village government in decision making, voting rights and conveying
aspirations and contributions related to the management of village funds so as to create accountability in order to
improve village development.
3. The use of technology affects the accountability of village fund management in a positive direction. The results of
this study support the hypothesis and agency theory where the application of good information technology is
expected to minimize the occurrence of information asymmetry between the government and the community
regarding the management of village funds so as to increase public trust as principals to the village government.
4. The internal control system has no effect on the accountability of village fund management. The Village
Consultative Body here acts as the party given the mandate (agent) to carry out the process of audit, evaluation,
monitoring and other supervisory activities on the implementation of organizational tasks and functions in order
to provide adequate confidence to realize good governance so that it can improve financial accountability through
evaluation and improvement. The results of this study do not support agency theory where The Village
Consultative Body as an agent has not been able to maximize its performance properly. This could be due to the
weak internal control carried out by the Village Consultative Body and the village government on the management
of village funds in Bakarangan sub-district.
5.1 Suggestion 
The suggestions given are expected to be used as a reference for improvements in similar research in the future, are: 
1. Future research should expand the object of research so that it is not limited to only one sub-district.
2. Further research is recommended to further examine the variables that have no effect, namely the competence
variable of the village official and the internal control system
3. Further research is recommended to add other independent variables that can affect the accountability of village
fund management such as village official training, work motivation, clarity of budget targets and so on.

Abstract 
The ban on exporting Lobster Seeds has resulted in rampant smuggling cases in Indonesia. This study aims to analyse 
the implementation of the current regulation on the smuggling of Lobster Seeds against Case No. 8/Pid.Sus-
Prk/2021/PN.Jkt.Utr, as well as to propose an economic analysis of law in formulating criminal law policies, 
particularly related to Lobster Seed smuggling sanctions. This research uses a normative research method with a statute 
approach and a case approach. The result of this study is an imbalance between the sanctions imposed on the smugglers 
and the profits obtained by the smugglers, and the potential state financial losses caused by the smuggling of Lobster 
Seeds. Therefore, it is necessary to use economic analysis of law in taking action against smugglers so that in addition 
to preventing the crime of smuggling, it also benefits the country's economy.

Abstract 
Modern marketplaces need constant adaption of firm offerings due to their urgency. In order to fully satisfy the needs 
and expectations of each partner (workers, consumers, and other stakeholders) and to preserve competitive value, the 
creation and continuous improvement of the quality would be necessary. The company where we perform our 
experiment will attempt to enhance customer satisfaction while raising the quality. A well-known FMCG (Fast 
Moving Consumer Goods) company in Indonesia is the consumer product business group PT XYZ. The cashew 
version of the chocolate pasta stick is one of the goods created by PT XYZ's Chocolate Division. There is a packaging 
step involved in the flow process of creating these chocolate paste sticks with cashews. During the product's packing, 
there is a difficulty. 
Finally, Six Sigma, a powerful approach, helps with cost cutting. Better products, more effective processes, and defect 
prevention lead to increased profitability and market share. This is accomplished using the Six Sigma sub-
methodologies DMAIC and DMADV (Andersson et al., TQM Mag 18:282-296, 2006). The implementation of the 
six-sigma technique in a wider range of manufacturing activities is made possible by a case study that was presented. 
Researchers studying quality management, individuals working in the industrial sector, and anybody else interested 
in quality improvement should find this article informative. The findings of this study will improve the sigma level's 
worth and lessen business losses brought on by cases that involve both material and moral issues.

1. Introduction
A company's production process can be evaluated using the Sigma quality level, which measures the process defect 
rate. The DMAIC methodology is one of the most often used approaches for achieving Six Sigma objectives, according 
to (Koning and Mast 2004). Numerous top-tier businesses have implemented Six Sigma, which has a proven track 
record of success (Maleyeff and Kaminsky 2002). According to (Rajagopalan et al. 2004), Six Sigma techniques 
enhance operational performance to raise client satisfaction with a company's goods and services. Six Sigma is defined 
in the first stream as a set of statistical techniques used in conjunction with quality management to build a framework

4.2.1 Conduct Audit Checklist 
An audit of the manufacturing line should be performed to confirm that the process followed the existing procedure 
and that the defect amount did not rise. A checklist can make the audit go more smoothly and control the current work 
system like in the Figure 10.

5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
 
5.1 Conclusion 
Chocolate pasta has several flavors, one of which is a cashew chocolate variant with a 10-gram package. The flow 
process in the manufacture of chocolate paste, starting from the raw material transit warehouse, central kitchen, filling 
section, metal detecting, and packing section. There is a problem with the packing machine, namely the empty outer 
packaging. This is caused by several factors, the size of the chocolate paste, the sensor of the packing machine, the 
angle of the sliding hopper, and the brush in the auto feeder. 
 
The modification has the potential to drastically reduce the total cost of the defect. The corporation may save 46.5 
percent on costs. The whole cost before improvement was $47.628 per month, however after improvement, the total 
cost was only $22,148 per month. 
 
In conclusion, the aim of this project was successful to apply systematic technique line efficiency for identification, 
determining solution, planning improvement, implementing the improvement plan, and evaluating solutions at the 
packing section and filling section to suggest the appropriate solution to reduce the cases of empty outer package 
5.2 Recommendation 
As a result, several projects and manufactured products in which was involved are considered state confidential 
information, and only a few specific projects were given permission to be discussed because they have a lower level 
of confidentiality. 
 
Aside from the issue of confidentiality, A few suggestions for the overall research that could make:

●
To reduce cases of empty outer packaging, activating sensors on all packing machines both on line 1 or line
2 must be done immediately
●
The ideal center seal size for reducing cases of empty outer packaging is between 0.65 and 0.75 cm. The
middle seal's width can accommodate all inner packaging widths.
●
The slope angle of the sliding hopper on the packing machine can be standardized in the range of 19 - 20
degrees, because it has been proven to reduce the case of empty outer packaging.
Monitoring activities on the tilt angle of the sliding hopper, sensor, and revolver axles should be started in order to 
maintain the trend of no cases of empty outer packaging.

expect not only for the amazing show itself, but also the friendliness of staff, the cleanliness of the area, and the benefit 
package for family as family is the targeted segment for any amusement park industries. In fulfilling the full 
satisfaction of customer, the amusement park service provider should always provide what the customer needs and 
close the gap between what expected and perceived by the customer. The challenge is that customer not always at the 
right time and moment revealing what their expectations and critics. One way to get what genuinely customer feels 
about the service is through the reviews gathered from social media. In addition, there will be abundant and various 
customer feedbacks unconstrainted by time or any pressures. Hence, we proposed text mining and Kansei Engineering 
methodology taken an empirical study on an amusement park services in Indonesia. It was found that the critical 
Kansei was “safe” and the service attribute was “the amusement park rides for family”. Adding new amusement park 
rides and providing its regular maintenance schedule might be considered as sufficient solutions, with regard to limited 
resources.

1. Introduction
Kansei Engineering (KE) method has evolved. It has been applied extensively in physical products and non-physical 
services. Due to the complexity of customer Kansei, an approach in investigating and finalizing the “real” and 
representative Kansei has been proposed. It is a new approach in refining the exploration process of Kansei words. 
Hartono et al (2021) have tried to propose a study of Kansei-based mining and robust design for internet service 
provider. It is a refined KE methodology with confirmatory analysis (Hartono, 2020) incorporating mining process. 
The rationale is that how do we collect Kansei accurately and then match it to the service design items and attributes? 
It leads to a question, are the Kansei words really representative? Are they robust enough? Though, an opportunity to 
refine the methodology due to the dynamics of problem and customer Kansei is always open.

According to Pareto principle, there were 8 service attributes prioritized for improvement (as shown in Table 2), and 
it was found that the service attribute “the amusement park rides for family” deemed to be the most critical one. 
Through literature review and benchmarking process, there were several improvement initiatives, such as adding new 
amusement park rides for family, regular maintenance schedule for amusement park rides, and providing user-friendly 
apps for amusement park rides. The service provider should prioritize which one of these three improvement initiatives 
is chosen due to limited resources or possible constraints.  
 
 
5. Conclusion  
Fulfilling customer emotional needs (Kansei) is quiet challenging. It is not only because of the translation process, but 
also how to ensure appropriate and representative Kansei. Both external and internal factors influencing customer 
Kansei should be considered and put in the service design and development, especially for tourism industry which is 
of interesting in today’s economy. Hence, text mining and Kansei Engineering methodology taken an empirical study 
on an amusement park service in Indonesia was proposed. This study might be enhanced especially in the relationship 
between Kansei and perceived service attributes. Due to Kansei dynamics, more appropriate methods are welcome to 
investigate, and might also include usability analysis for technology-enabled products/services (Prastawa et al., 2019). 
It is also supported by the complexity of product or service experiences. More complex product or service will lead 
the more complex Kansei.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a devastating economic, social and health toll. Although vaccines have been 
developed to combat it, access to them was not equitable for all, especially in developing countries. Peru faces 
additional challenges: a tight budget, shortage of health personnel and poor health and road infrastructure. The 
objective of this study is to define the optimal location for vaccination centers in the most adverse regions of Peru. A 
mathematical model for the optimization of the location is presented taking as a reference the Set Covering, Maximal 
Covering and P- Median models. Coverage, location costs and travel distance were prioritized. The sample used was 
the district of Kimbiri in Cusco. Of the seventy rural communities and nine health centers available, 55 and 7 were 
included, respectively. One vaccination center was assigned per rural community. The resulting metrics were 93.6% 
coverage, 77.78% resource utilization and an average travel distance of 929.25 meters. This model can be used to 
optimize immunization processes in developing countries.

1. Introduction
Vaccines against COVID-19 have already been developed around the world, yet accessibility is not equal to all. 
According to the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (2021), by February 2021, while the vaccination ratio 
was about 1 person/sec in some countries, there were still countries that had not yet started their vaccination process. 
It is in this scenario that developing countries, including Peru, are trying to tackle the consequences of the pandemic 
while managing several hindrances in the vaccination process, i.e., slow access to vaccines, lack of budget, and fragile 
health care infrastructure (United Nations, 2020) 
In their report “Estrategia para el acceso universal a la salud y la cobertura universal de salud,” from 2014, the WHO 
recommends countries to invest at least 6% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on health care; however, Peru had 
only made a 5.3% GDP investment by 2019 (Sociedad de Comercio Exterior del Perú, 2021), which proves a 
2430","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Furthermore, three performance indicators were proposed and assessed for model results analysis: (Table 6) 
• 
Coverage: represents the population covered by a health care facility. 
• 
Resources used: represents the number of health care facilities assigned as vaccination centers for, as mentioned 
above, resources used are proportional to the number of vaccination centers available. 
• 
Average travel distance: represents the average individual travel distance between the health care facility and the 
rural community, weighted by the population of each community.

Upon comparison of the optimization results from the base scenario and from the other scenarios, it can be noted that 
when alternating location cost and travel distance priorities, the resources used for location should increase in 28.57% 
as to reduce the average travel distance in 14.66%. However, the current average travel distance is less than 1 km, 
significantly less than the maximum travel distance established (4 km). Therefore, the decrease in average travel 
distance is less substantial when compared to the increase in resources used.  
 
Likewise, when comparing the results from the other scenarios, it can be observed that both alternative scenario 2 
which prioritizes the decrease of the travel distance over the decrease of location costs, and alternative scenario 1 
which assumes all health care facilities are to be assigned as vaccination centers, have the same results and indicators.  
This would indicate that the health care facility distribution from the base scenario provides an optimal distribution.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The mathematical model for location optimization successfully defined an optimal location for vaccination centers in 
the most adverse regions of Peru, and it was attained by using Lingo software with reliable results. Additionally, after 
comparing the results of the main optimization scenario with alternative one, it can be concluded that the location 
distribution is optimal. Finally, due to the nature of the method and data used in this optimization, the model can be 
used to optimize immunization processes for different vaccines or for other medications, and it can be applied in other 
developing countries.

Abstract 
In Indonesia, the development of fintech has emerged since 2006. In September 2015 fintech companies in Indonesia 
only gained public trust since the establishment of the Indonesian Fintech Association (AFI). At that time, people had 
looked at one of the Fintech-based loans, namely Peer-To-Peer Lending (P2PL) because it had its own advantages 
compared to banks, this was because not many people could meet the collateral requirements in applying for loans. 
Then, the Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) issued a special regulation, namely the POJK No.77/POJK.01/2016 
concerning Information Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services. The legal relationship between the 
parties in Peer To Peer Lending arises because of an agreement that has been agreed upon by both parties that is 
binding and creates rights and obligations for each party. The Peer To Peer Lending service system requires clear 
authorization from the lender to the provider to channel the funds to the Debtor (loan recipient). However, it is possible 
that with all the conveniences obtained there will be no legal problems. Considering that it is very risky because the 
parties do not directly carry out the agreement or transact. So that legal protection both preventively and repressively 
is needed for legal certainty for the parties in the event of default and/or default from both the loan recipient and the 
organizer. In this regard, this research further aims to find out and analyze how the concept of legal protection for the 
parties, especially the organizers, is related to the risk of default and/or default in Peer To Peer Lending-based loan 
services.

1. Introduction
Financial Technology or often called fintech is an innovation in the financial services industry that utilizes the use of 
technology developed by startup companies by utilizing software. The presence of fintech is expected to facilitate the 
process of financial transactions such as loans or financing, namely providing loans without collateral and the 
financing process is fast, easy and does not need to meet in person. In principle, fintech operates only between lenders 
(investors / creditors) and borrowers (debtors) so that credit execution and money loan contracts are completed 
electronically using an application owned by an online loan company. 
The development and existence of fintech began around 2015. This was marked by the establishment of the Indonesian 
Fintech Association (AFI) with the initial goal of providing quality business partners. Based on Fintech Lending 
providers that have been registered and licensed at OJK as many as 106 companies as of October 6, 2021. To regulate

In contrast, the form of repressive legal protection is in the form of sanctions such as interest, fines, compensation or 
other additional penalties after a dispute occurs. Disputes in this case can occur between users and other users or 
between users and Peer To Peer Lending service providers. Based on the provisions of Article 18 POJK No. 
77/POJK.01/2016 regulates the agreement for the implementation of information technology-based lending and 
borrowing services including: 
 
a. 
Agreement between the Operator and the Lender; and 
b. Agreement between the Lender and the Borrower. 
 
So that the platform has a legal relationship with the creditor due to an agreement to grant power of attorney from the 
creditor to the organizer as the beneficiary acting for and on behalf of the creditor to distribute money loans from 
creditors to debtors. Further regulated in Article 37 POJK No. 77 of 2016 states that ""The Operator must be responsible 
for User losses arising from errors and/or negligence of the Board of Directors, and/or employees of the Operator."" 
This means that the company as the organizer is limited to efforts to seek and assist collection. Errors and/or omissions 
by the organizers are only limited to errors caused by them and the organizers will be responsible if the organizers 
make mistakes in the evaluation of loan applications and debtor data. In addition to the obligation of the operator to 
evaluate the identity data of the debtor for the loan application, the operator should provide preventive conditions such 
as the form of guarantee provided to minimize the risk of default experienced by the debtor. 
 
6. Conclusion  
As explained above, the agreement made by the parties based on Article 1320 of the Civil Code applies as law for the 
parties in accordance with the provisions of Article 1338 Paragraph (1) of the Civil Code. In this case, there is a legal 
relationship between the parties, namely the existence of rights and obligations, but it cannot be denied that things 
such as default by the debtor can occur. Default can be done intentionally or unintentionally. The occurrence of default 
results in other parties being harmed, especially for creditors and the organizers. 
 
The principle of legal protection is one of the very basic principles in contract law. The concept of legal protection is 
divided into 2 (two) namely preventive legal protection which is preventive in nature and repressive legal protection 
which has a deterrent effect. So the form of protection for creditors and providers is that the debtor bears the 
consequences of not carrying out obligations which can be in the form of cancellation of the agreement or fulfillment 
of the agreement accompanied by demands for compensation, or only demanding compensation. In addition, another 
form of protection is to give the debtor an opportunity due to overmacht (forced circumstances).

Abstract 
The trend of women choosing a profession in the accounting field is increasing. Based on data from the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) it turns out that 50 percent of accounting graduates are women. 
The increase affects the development of the number of women who pursue the accounting profession. In 1996 it was 
recorded that 25 percent of public accountant certificate holders in America were women. Audit quality is needed so 
that auditing standards become audit guidelines. The phenomenon in the world of auditor practice is still showing 
various reductions in audit quality (reduced audit quality). There are 2 gender models, (1) equality and complementary 
contribution models, (2) Sex Role Stereotypes and Managerial Stereotypes. The first model assumes that there are no 
differences between men and women as professionals in management and that of women, thereby describing equal 
access. The second model between men and women have different abilities so that they need differences in managing 
and different in assessing, recording, and combining to produce a synergy. The purpose of this study was to examine 
the effect of gender and social interaction on perceptions of fraud among government auditors. Questionnaires were 
used for data collection. The research sample is auditors at the Inspectorate of South Kalimantan Province. A sample 
of 100 auditor respondents was used to prove the hypothesis. The results of the study state that auditor gender diversity 
has a significant effect on the perception of fraud, where female auditors have a higher perception of fraud. This 
means that female auditors have higher ethical behavior so that there is a tendency for female auditors to have higher 
perceptions of fraud. Social interaction also has a positive and significant effect on the perception of fraud. This means 
that the auditor in good association, in a religious environment will have a positive ethical view so that he will view 
fraud as something wrong and illegal. 
Key words
Gender, Social interactions, Fraud. 
1. Introduction
Professionalism is an absolute requirement for people who work as Auditors or KAP employees. Public accountants 
who have a high view of professionalism will make contributions that can be trusted by decision makers. To run that 
demands wider responsibilities, employees whose responsibilities are expanding, KAP employees must have broad 
insights about the complexities of modern organizations (Shorea Dwarawati, 2005). Currently, there is an increasing 
trend of women choosing a profession in the accounting field. Based on research conducted by the Accountant 
2454","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
showed significant results (p = 0.008 < 0.05). This illustrates that auditor respondents with broad social relationships 
will have a higher perception of fraud. Thus Hypothesis 2 is supported by research data. 
This study examines the role of government auditor characteristics, namely gender and social relationships on 
perceptions of fraud. The subjects in this study were government auditors at various levels in the Inspectorate of South 
Kalimantan Province, Indonesia. As has been suspected and supported by research, previous research shows that 
female auditors have higher ethical behavior so that there is a tendency that female auditors have a higher perception 
of fraud. The view that fraud is an act that is contrary to honesty and ethical aspects that must be adhered to, makes 
female auditors feel that they have a greater concern for fraud as an unethical behavior carried out in carrying out their 
duties. As human beings who are outwardly considered to have emotional rather than rational specs, women will have 
a greater resistance to injustice than men. 
The results of testing hypothesis 2 show that the social environment has a significant influence on the perception of 
fraud in a positive direction where individuals with a high social environment tend to have a higher perception of 
fraud than individuals with a low social environment. This means that individuals who take advantage of social 
interactions in many of their activities will have greater opportunities to apply a better work ethic and reject fraud. 
This is also supported by TRA where subjective norms (social influence) will also determine behavior interest. 
5.4 Proposed Improvements 
This study has several limitations, including in data collection and the number of samples of government auditors at 
the Inspectorate who are still very tied to the bureaucratic culture that is still thick in Indonesia. In addition, this study 
involves variables that require sensitive research instruments so that there is a possibility that the given is less 
representative of the actual conditions. Further research involving a larger sample needs to be carried out with the 
consequence of widening the sample coverage. Finally, improving the research instrument using softer words and 
using case assessment may minimize sensitive questions or statements from the instrument. 
6. Conclusion
The social environment is related to the social environment, including all conditions, circumstances, and human 
interactions that surround it. However, humans will interact with the social environment that surrounds their lives. A 
person's social environment will include the type of interaction around the house in which one lives, the type of work 
one does, one's available income, and the laws and social rules that govern that person. The social environment 
involves individuals, both familiar and unfamiliar; group; organization; and community and includes all social 
institutions that influence individual behavior. This means that someone who is surrounded or is in a good social 
environment such as in a religious environment will have a positive view of ethics so that he will view fraud as wrong 
and illegal. 
The results of this study lead to a conclusion that women have a better perception of fraud than men. This is a follow-
up to many studies that women have a better work ethic than men. The emotional nature that is greater than the rational 
nature makes women feel more emotional when they see injustice and things that have low ethics. The social 
interaction factor obtained has a positive influence on the perception of fraud. wider social interaction will view fraud 
as something that is not worth doing. These results support the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) can explain what 
explains a person's behavior to report violations

Abstract 
The importance of innovativeness is one of the most discussed topics in several studies. But theres is still 
inconsistencies about the effect from innovativeness to performance. Especially in the dynamic environment and 
under-performance condition like financing industry in Indonesia, which has declined in growth from the past 
decade. This research seeks to analyze the most influential factors on performance and innovativeness in terms of 
the variable strategic approach and variable ways of gathering information at the manager level in the finance 
industry. Study literature will be use to build some hypothesis at first stage, then quantitative research method will 
be implement at second stage for hypothesis testing. Sample technique that use in this research is two stage stratified 
random sampling. Data collection by questionnaire from 242 managers in financial industry will be analyzing with 
Partial Least Square. After finalize data analysis, the result showed that the effect of innovativeness on manager 
performance was not significant. The novelty in this research is the explanation why the managers in financing 
industry are difficult relatively to enhance their innovativeness. The results expected can be used as 
recommendations for enhancing innovativeness and manager’s performance, especially for the performance 
improvement in the financing industry.

1. Introduction
In the last decade, the finance industry in Indonesia has been growth decadence. At the beginning of the decade, 
account receivables grew by 23%, but at the end of the decade currently decreased to be 2% only (OJK, 2019). It 
followed by a decline in profit growth. At the beginning of the decade, profit was grown 33%. But at the end of the 
decade, profit growth decreased to be 10% only (OJK, 2019). This condition reflects a decrease in the productivity 
of employee performance in the financing industry. It is confirmed by the decline in the profit per employee cost. At 
the beginning of the decade was 1.17, now has decreased to 0.87 at the end of the decade (OJK, 2019). This data 
interprets that at the beginning of the decade, every currency of employee cost can generate a profit of 1.17 times. 
But at the end of this decade, every employee cost can generate a profit of 0.87 times only. 
This decline in employee productivity in the finance industry is quite in line with the decadence at the industrial 
level. If this condition compared to the progress of the financial technology industry continues to grow with many 
start-up companies with a variety of digitalization technology innovations, it feared to erode the performance of the 
financing industry. Various theories and research on declining performance in volatile environments had widely 
published. Many studies believe and confirm that innovativeness or innovation ability is closely related to superior 
performance because this is the best way to achieve competitive advantage and redesign competitive advantage 
(Celtekligil & Adiguzel, 2019). Other studies confirm that innovativeness will influence business performance 
(Hult, Hurley, Knight 2004). It supported by another research, which explains that innovativeness has a positive 
effect on performance (Burns and Stalker 1961; Hurley and Hult 1998; Porter 1990); or to create competitive 
advantage (Ismail & Alam, 2019). Even the majority agreed that innovativeness contributes to business 
performance, but there is a lack of research about the drivers of innovativeness and how these drivers operate 
through innovativeness to influence performance (Hoq & Chowdhury, 2012).

innovativeness. In this case, the feedback from the field by the branch manager should be considered by 
headquarter’s manager to produce a breakthrough and innovations. 
 
According to this research, enhancing the innovativeness to improve performance can be started by the annual 
performance alignment method. Alignment in the performance appraisal method with the right indicators can trigger 
the emergence of innovativeness. It is very crucial as a catalyst or trigger to create more innovative managers rather 
than pragmatic managers. Training about creative thinking to increase innovativeness can be implemented as 
complementary, especially for analytical thinking manager. It is necessary because the financing industry often 
dominated by capabilities in financial analysis, credit analysis, or risk mitigation which are more science-oriented. 
After complement with strategic art’s approach, it is expected that the technostructure at the head office can also be 
maximized to supporting the creation and innovative breakthroughs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the hypothesis test above, there is several conclusions and recommendations. At the first hypothesis, 
innovativeness has a positive relation but insignificant effect on manager performance (H1a is rejected, H1b is 
accepted). Then strategic approach has a positive and significant effect on innovativeness (H2 is accepted). From 
this relationship, it can be interpreted that the strategic art approach has a positive and significant relationship to 
innovativeness (H2a is accepted). Conversely, the strategic science approach has a negative and significant effect on 
innovativeness (H2b is accepted). Then the strategic approach variable has a positive and significant relationship to 
manager performance (H3 is accepted). From hypothesis testing, it can be interpreted that the strategic art approach 
has a positive and significant relationship to managerial performance (H3a is accepted). Conversely, the strategic 
science approach has a negative and significant relationship to performance (H3b is accepted). Then the manager's 
way of gathering information also has a positive and significant effect on the strategic approach (H4 is accepted). 
Based on this, intuitive managers tend to be a strategic artist (H4a is accepted). And sensing managers tend to be 
strategic scientist (H4a is accepted). 
 
The research here still has several limitations, so further research is required. Further research that can be carried 
out, for example, to analyze whether there are differences between the functional manager at the head office, 
regional offices and branch offices, is indeed a factor that influences and becomes a differentiator. In this case, the 
difference between the branch manager and headquarters manager. Branch managers often designed as an 
operational manager.  In different language, they act as executive manager to monitor day to day activities and act 
as transactional leaders. While headquarter manager often designed as a think-tank for their company. They are 
work as technocrats to create business policy, guideline and system operating procedures. Then operating 
procedures will be published to be implemented in the branch office. So this further research can be carried out 
using discriminant analysis techniques to prove this.

Abstract 
This study aimed to identify, calculate, and design risk mitigation that occurs in Supply Chain Risk Management 
activities using the House of Risk method. The research method uses the mixed method with descriptive research type. 
The analysis tools used are the SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) and House of Risk method uses data 
through observation, interviews, and questionnaires. The results of the SCOR identified 19 risk activities and 14 risk 
factors, and the House of Risk identified 3 causes of the problem and 3 preventive measures. Therefore, the company 
must identify risks regularly to avoid problems in the supply chain.

1. Introduction
The rapidly increasing era of globalization is intensifying competition in Indonesia. Indonesia's economic growth is 
supported by domestic demand as consumption and investment growth and is supported by improved revenues, the 
development of infrastructure projects, and the maintenance of purchasing power in line with low inflationary 
pressures. 
This research was conducted on companies engaged in the metalware industry that has been in existence since 2015 
and produces household appliances, namely wire grids shelves with nail wire raw materials with a location in North 
Jakarta. The problem faced by the company is; first, the raw material does not conform to the standard because the 
nail wire material is hard or too soft, and excess oil components. Non-standardized raw materials complicate the 
production process, which leads to longer production times, as the machine still uses human labor. Too much oil leads 
to a defect in the finished product, i.e., black spots appear on the product. To cover this, a repainting process must be 
carried out, leading to higher capital prices. Second, Limited raw materials, since raw materials are needed to produce 
the shelves, namely nail wire. The Indonesian government limits the number of imports to Indonesia affects every 
domestic company that normally purchases imported wire. Switch to the local nail wire, which means that not much 
wire is in stock (limited), and unstable every month prices affect. 
Based on previous research conducted by Ahmad & Susanty (2019) that has problems with raw materials that do not 
meet standards and limited raw materials, this study uses the House of Risk (HOR) method to overcome these 
problems. The results of this study show that there are 23 priority risks and 17 priority risk causes based on Pareto 
diagrams, in which the three main risks are selected, namely the risks of project processes that are not in line with the 
supply of raw materials. limited transportation and the unavailability of raw materials at suppliers as production 
increases, resulting in 3 risk mitigation plans based on 3 risk factors. 
Based on previous research by Alitosah & Kusumah (2019) where there are problems with non-standard raw materials 
and with limited raw materials, these problems are overcome using the house of risk method. The results of this study 
show that there are 19 priority risks and 5 priority risk factors and select 5 main risks, namely operators who are not 
working as they should, sudden requests from buyers, improper machine repair plans, increased production from 
suppliers, and Raw materials that do not meet the standard of the supplier who creates 10 risk mitigation plans that 
are the result of mitigating the 5 risk causes.

4. Conclusion 
The House of Risk method at the company identified 19 risk events and 14 risk causes that could disrupt supply chain 
activities. Based on House of Risk 1, there are three most influential risk causes when calculating the ARP values 
(Aggregate Risk Potential); namely, only one supplier, human error, and communication system within the company 
and with distributors is not going well. 
 
Based on the analysis of the House of Risk 2 data, we can take preventive action by calculating the value of ETD, i.e., 
Looking for other raw material suppliers, conducting training for employees, and improving communication with 
internal companies and distributors.

Abstract 
The development of fashion industry in several countries has experienced rapid development. However, the growth 
of the fashion industry causes fierce competition among brands that leads them to intensify their marketing. In an age 
of digitalized interactions, some of the classic aspects of marketing have evolved including the usage of social media 
and influencer marketing. This study aims to determine factors that affect consumers’ attitudes toward social media 
influencers and that impact on brand attitudes and purchase intentions toward the fashion industry using the conceptual 
model of Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). A quantitative approach is employed, with the data collection method 
using an online survey from 159 respondents and continued to be researched. The data obtained has been tested using 
Smart PLS3 software. The results of the study indicate that consumers’ attitudes toward the influencer have a positive 
and significant influence on brand attitude and purchase intentions. This study also indicated that perceived behavioral 
control and perceived expertise are also found to be positively impacts while perceived credibility and trust negatively 
impact the consumers’ attitude towards the influencer.

1. Introduction
The development of the fashion industry in several countries has experienced rapid development (Winto, 2021). There 
is a phenomenon and great market potential for Muslim fashion industry in Indonesia (Winto, 2021). In Indonesia, 
86,9% of the population is Muslim. As a country whose population most Muslims, then the development of fashion 
cannot be separated from the background condition of Indonesian society. The positive contribution to the increase in 
gross domestic product (GDP) is a sign that the country’s fashion industry has experienced significant development. 
Muslim Community Indonesia really cares about fashion so that Indonesia can become a fashion center Muslims in

Abstract 
The fashion industry is growing rapidly in Indonesia. Many of the latest trends that appear in the season, generating 
the demand for fashion products to increase. The growth of the fashion industry causes local brands must be able 
to compete with global brands. Therefore, electronic word of mouth has an important role in influence consumers to 
brand perceptions. Local entrepreneurs leverage social media to increase consumer ethnocentricity so that the 
assessment of brand equity also raised. This study aims to analyze electronic word of mouth, consumer 
ethnocentrism and brand equity on local children's fashion brands. Data collection method using online survey in 
distributing questionnaires. There are 265 respondents who participated in filling out the questionnaire, but only 
201 of them were valid. The data obtained has been tested using IBM SPSS 25 software. The variables in this 
study are electronic word of mouth, consumer ethnocentrism and brand equity. The results showed that each 
variable had a significant positive effect on local brand equity in children's fashion.

1. Introduction
Social media-based marketing has received considerable attention in part since the recall rates for social media 
advertisements are higher than those for conventional advertisements (Seo & Park, 2017). Thus, business 
development in Indonesia is relatively swift, this is due to the high demand of social media users (Ananda et al., 
2019). Besides being worthwhile as a marketing place. Social media also helps businesses to conduct transactions 
directly with consumers (Gilliam, 2015). The modernization that occurs in the world community is caused by 
globalization. Trade between exports and imports has become commonplace (Tran et al., 2017). So that, 
consumers can freely determine their choice to buy foreign products or domestic products. However, people who 
preserve their culture will choose to support domestic products (He & Wang, 2015). Ethnocentric consumers have 
the notion that their product is superior. By buying local products, it is tantamount to helping in improving the 
country's economy (Tran et al., 2017). Product innovation, ease of purchase, marketing and branding techniques 
encourage businesses to grow (Syana, 2021). Word of Mouth is very influential in determining the perception of 
a brand. Brand equity can be influenced by negative or positive opinions given by someone (Hennig- Thurau et al., 
2004).

Abstract 
Limited liability is a principle where the shareholders are considered separated from the assets of the company, 
and their losses are only limited to the shares owned. Limited liability can result in moral hazard and irresponsible 
domination. To prevent such a situation, many countries have adopted the doctrine of Piercing the Corporate Veil, 
which makes the veil that limits legal entities with their shareholders can be torn so that this doctrine allows 
shareholders in certain cases to be responsible for their personal assets. In determining the applicability of Piercing 
the Corporate Veil, courts in the United States have developed some legal tests, namely, alter ego and 
instrumentality rules. However, this doctrine is not as easy and simple as it seems because its application is 
determined based on a case-by-case basis and the courts have great freedom to make judgments. Thus, it become 
generally recognized that Piercing the Corporate Veil is lost in a fog of metaphor. Due to such a reality, one of 
the purposes of law as stated by Gustav Radbruch (justice) is not fulfilled, where it makes third parties rarely get 
compensation, and does not provide a deterrent so the actions against the law of the company organs will continue. 
Therefore, this research will be conducted through a normative juridical research method using a statutory 
approach and a of comparative law approach. This paper will present comprehensive theories regarding piercing 
the corporate veil, as well as the case law from United States and Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Based on the theory of fiction, a company is an artificial person whose characteristics are that it has no form 
(abstract), will, and reality of substance (Adolf A. 1947). This means that the company should be a legal person, 
has a legal position, rights, and responsibilities, but on the other hand, the company is also a separate legal entity 
from the directors and shareholders. As an artificial person, the limited company cannot carry out legal actions 
alone and must be represented by humans as a bridge, namely the Board of Directors, the Board of Commissioners, 
and the General Meeting of Shareholders. 
According to Article 3 paragraph (1) of Law No. 40 of 2007 concerning Limited Liability Companies, the status 
of an independent legal entity makes the owners or shareholders not personally responsible for the company's 
losses exceeding the shares owned. This limited liability of shareholders can cause a moral hazard, especially if 
its applied absolutely, since the limited liability principle can be misused by company organs that have bad faith, 
where they can look for loopholes in the legal construction of the company, namely through domination without 
responsibility. 
To prevent such a situation, it is necessary to have the Doctrine of Piercing the Corporate Veil which according 
to Friedman is defined as (Friedman 1987):

judge 
In practice, Ray Flemming Fruit Company from the beginning was a one-man company, which 
never held an AGM. In addition, there are no other shareholders or employees of the company other 
than the Board of Directors, W. Ray Flemming. Rey Flamming became the only person to ever 
receive a salary, dividend, or any form of pay from the Ray Flemming Fruit Company, and he also 
had a say in any decision. Thus, only the Board of Directors is the exclusive beneficiary of the 
existence of his company. Flemming will treat the company like its own cash register, the amount 
of funds withdrawn annually is limited only by the amount available in the corporation. On that 
fact, the court justified the abandonment of the corporate entity on the basis of fairness and equality 
so that the Defendant could be personally liable for the debts of his company. 
 
Meanwhile, the Alter Ego and Instrumentality legal tests are tests applied by most of the courts today in the world 
and are often seen as interchangeable. Both tests have the same elements of control and fraud (injustice). However, 
the two also have a slight difference, namely, the rule of instrumentality has a causal element. In the case of 
William Passalacua Builders, Inc., the Plaintiff in his consideration made two arguments, one of which was to 
apply alter ego and the other to apply instrumentality. Then, the Court asked the Plaintiffs to change their 
considerations to only one argument, because Alter Ego and Instrumentality have ""almost similar"" characteristics. 
Therefore, the legal test of Alter Ego and Instrumentality are basically the same, so to penetrate the corporate veil 
it is more effective to use the three-pronged test that has been discussed above. (Table 6) 
 
6. Conclusion 
Piercing the Corporate Veil Doctrine has been adopted in Indonesia through Law no. 40 of 2007, which stipulates 
that shareholders can be personally responsible if the shareholders take the actions that have been formulated in 
Article 3 paragraph (2). Meanwhile, the Board of Directors (Article 97 paragraph (3)) and the Board of 
Commissioners (Article 114 paragraph (3)) can also be held responsible if they are negligent or make mistakes in 
carrying out their duties. This doctrine is important so that shareholders, directors, and the board of commissioners 
do not abuse the limited liability principle of the company. Unfortunately, the Article a quo is in fact rarely used 
by judges so that this Article is only empty. As a result, the company's organs are rarely reached for accountability 
to their personal assets. Based on such facts, the author recommends that Indonesia: 
 
1) Learning from the United States, it becomes urgent for Indonesia to apply the Alter Ego and Instrumentality 
legal test as an alternative for judges to uncover the corporate veil. These two legal tests are often seen as 
interchangeable because they have similar properties, so Indonesia is recommended to use three tests that are 
considered more complete, namely: The existence of perfect control of the company's organs over the 
company, control for inappropriate purposes, and causality between act of domination with the resulting loss. 
2) Consideration is needed for the Indonesian government to revise all laws and regulations which regulate 
corporations so that they can incorporate the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, alter ego, and 
instrumentality into related regulations. This is intended so that corporate organs that act beyond their 
authority (ultra vires) and use corporations to commit criminal acts can be held personally liable.

Abstract 
In this research, we address the issue of outsourcing the clearance operation to a third party, in the context of 
multi-partner and multi-product. The outsourcing operation is a widespread industrial practice and requires a well-
defined process to follow to be successful. Indeed, to choose the best partners (or retailers) from a potential set of 
candidates, a company must define its selection criteria, as well as the selection method that should be applied. 
This paper aims to develop a framework for the clearance partner selection process. Using multi-objective 
optimization and based on the suppliers’ evaluation according to the established criteria, appropriate partners are 
selected, and optimal allocation of unsold quantity is determined.  
Keywords 
Outsourcing decision, clearance partners, multi-product, multi-partner, multi-objective optimization. 
1. Introduction
The excess inventory represents a frequent problem for companies. Indeed, the unsold products quantities in 
various sectors are significant and should not be underestimated: they exceed 40% in the agri-food industry, about 
30% for electronic products and reach 50% in the textile industry. The rates are more important in other areas 
such as publishing, where the value of surplus stocks is about 60% [Mechmech et al., 2022].

4.1.Results and discussion 
In both presented cases (Figure 8), only three clearance partners are selected. However, the selected partner, the 
allocated quantities and the selected products are not the same. In the first case, the selected partners are: 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂8, 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂1 
and 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂2. However, in the second one, 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂1, 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂2 and 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂6 are the selected ones. Comparing the two simulations (1) 
and (2), we point out that the tolerated risk value and the minimum performance one is decreased. Accordingly, 
we note the substitution of the 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂8 by the 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂6 since the latter has a lower risk value (Table 8). 
We emphasize that the optimal decision does not necessarily involve a partner for different types of products: a 
partner can be selected even for a single product. Although the number of selected partners is the same, the 
solutions differ in terms of non-allocated quantities and products (Table 13). This is due to the capacity constraints 
of the partners that are product dependent.

Our major finding is that the optimal solution differs according to the values of 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚. Therefore, their 
values must be carefully established based on a well-studied benchmark that includes all relevant actors in this 
decision. We underline that in our case (considering the current numerical values), some values of 𝑅𝑅𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and 𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 
did not even lead to feasible solutions.  
5. Conclusion
The selection of the best clearance partners, also called ORs retailers, based on relevant, well-defined, and 
effective criteria is one of the most crucial decisions that contribute to the success of the clearance chain process. 
This research presents an extension of the conducted work by Mechmech et al (2020) to the multi-item context. 
A framework for clearance partner selection. Indeed, a four-step decision-making framework is developed, which 
represents a useful tool for selecting clearance partners. In a second step, an extension of the mathematical model 
developed by Mechmech et al (2020) is proposed. The latter aims to select partners and allocate the unsold 
inventory for a single product, using the ε-constraint technique. The model of the present work aims to handle the 
multi-product multi-partner case, while explicitly considering three objective functions. The resolution is carried 
out with the lexicographic multi-objective optimization using the CPLEX software. Results show that the optimal 
solution is highly dependent on expert opinions and performance risk evaluations. Similarly, we point out that 
two solutions differ in terms of total profit and liquidated quantity per product even if they have the same number 
of selected partners.  
In this work, the evaluation of the clearance partners is conducted based on the subjective opinions of managers 
and subjective MDMC methods. Future work will explore other selection methods that are less subjective.

Abstract 
As stipulated in the Indonesian Labour Law, every worker/labour is entitled to have a work safety and health 
protection. The Labour Law no. 13 Year 2003, for instance, regulates the working hour and overtime, break, and 
leaves, and the rights of employees.  in fact, the rights of workers in film industry are already ensured by the 
Government in the Law of Film Year 2009. 
However, to this day Indonesian film industry does not seem to officially implement these laws. There were 
several cases of Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE), which caused dead or fatal injuries to film workers, 
without applying the regulations mentioned above. Other HSE issues include the cases where only few film 
producers gave insurance to the film workers or apply proper risk assessment or provide first aid kits. 
By having in-depth interview with key persons of the field, such as the workers who are also assessors of   
Indonesian National Work Competency Standards (Standar Kompetensi Kerja Nasional Indonesia . SKKNI), as 
well as and film producers, this research aims to map out such issues and answering why and how the laws on 
work health and safety are not implemented in the Indonesian film industry.  This research has resulted in the 
maps of problems, recommendations for the policymakers, film workers, and related institutes concerning HSE 
and the rights of film workers.

Abstract 
Soybean price fluctuations become an important problem in Indonesia every year. The demand for soybeans increases 
every year in line with population growth and the soybean processing industry. The current problem is that soybean 
demand is increasing, but domestic production cannot match it, local soybean production is still low and cannot meet 
demand. The problems that arise in the logistics of the Central Java soybean supply chain are interrelated. Another 
logistical obstacle often faced by farmers in the long chain of the trade from farmers to consumers is the distribution 
and marketing of soybeans. In terms of distribution of market price competition, the price of imported soybeans is 
much cheaper than local soybeans. Soybean dependence on imported products has consequences on local soybean 
prices that are not able to compete, resulting in price instability. This study will develop a dynamic system model that 
aims to support soybean price stability with several policy simulations (case study: in Central Java Province). The 
relationship between variables that will be simulated with a dynamic system is about food needs (demand), total 
soybean availability (supply), and soybean prices (distribution) using a dynamic system framework. The result of the 
model scenario is the Bulog intervention policy (re-functioning Bulog's role as a soybean procurement agency). These 
policies can be used as supporting material for government and stakeholder decisions in developing strategies for

Abstract 
Due to the nature of the activities performed, the welding position in the metal-mechanical processes exposes its 
workers to various risks that generate severe damage to their safety and health, affecting both the worker and the 
company due to the loss of man hours due to medical breaks that impact on lower productivity, as well as economic 
losses. Dysergonomic risk deserves special attention due to the high frequency and severe consequences of 
Musculoskeletal Trauma that it can generate in its workers, and in this sense the objective of the research is to improve 
the productivity of the welding position through the prevention of dysergonomic risk by providing an occupational 
health management model for its application. By means of the Nordic Standardized Questionnaire, the analysis of 
musculoskeletal symptoms was carried out, selecting as object of study the welding activities performed for the 
modification of excavator buckets, observing as risk factors the postural effort and the manual shuffling of parts, from 
which the REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment) and the NIOSH (The National Institute for Occupational Safety 
and Health) methods were selected for the evaluation of the dysergonomic risk. In conclusion, an 11% increase in 
average productivity levels has been achieved. 
Keywords 
Musculoskeletal trauma, ergonomics, productivity, occupational health, welding station improvement. 
1. Introduction
Ergonomics is a priority for workplaces, as it is a useful tool to improve productivity and reduce operating costs, so it 
is considered an investment and not an expense. Peruvian legal regulations are demanding in relation to the elimination 
of occupational hazards present in work activities, as in the case of the Occupational Safety and Health Law, which 
states that it is the employer's obligation to ""ensure the safety and health of workers in the performance of all aspects 
related to their work, in the workplace or on the occasion thereof"" (Law N.°29783 2011), so the necessary control 
actions must be adopted being precisely that ergonomic practices receive special attention and that in the Peruvian 
case is expressed in the Basic Standard of Ergonomics and Dysergonomic Risk Assessment Procedure, noting that 
regardless of the nature of the activities performed in the company, they must incorporate ergonomic assessment as a 
component of preventive processes aimed at improving productivity (Ministerial Resolution N.°375-2008-TR). 
On the other hand, the ergonomic conditions of the activities performed in the metal-mechanic sector are diverse and 
involve tasks with manual handling of heavy loads, frequent repetitive movements, forced postures, among other 
factors, whose consequences are musculoskeletal disorders; a situation that if ignored and not controlled in time can 
generate chronic and severe damage, and the employer would take corrective actions when he observes that this can 
affect the organization economically.

Finally, a pilot test was applied considering a sample of the last 15 similar jobs within the welding area comparing the 
average time before and after the intervention, which allowed a surplus in production efficiency, having a decrease of 
11% of the average time for the completion of tasks and absenteeism due to medical breaks for Musculoskeletal 
Trauma in less than 1% of the monthly scheduled hours (See Table 5).

6. Conclusion
The results of the research have shown that by means of the standardized Nordic questionnaire it was possible to 
establish that welding technicians were more exposed to Musculoskeletal Traumas and in this way two critical tasks 
were identified: the modification of excavator bucket and the manual loading of weights, achieving in the short term, 
through the application of the REBA method and the NIOSH method, an increase of 11% in the average productivity 
levels in welding work and a rate of less than 1% for worker absences. 
Based on the results obtained in this study, it can be affirmed that by reducing dysergonomic risks in the company, 
greater efficiency in productivity can be obtained, due to the fact that the operator has reduced the risk of seeing his 
health affected by the dysergonomic risk, improving the average time per job; which is congruent with the study of 
Gonzales et al. 2016 that presents the application of the REBA method in a tinplate packaging factory demonstrating 
after the evaluation and the proposed improvements the REBA score was reduced from an average of 11.5 points to 
9.25 points with positive effects increasing productivity by 1.95%. 
There is evidence of similar works in other sectors, such as the research of Abdullaha et al. 2020, presenting 
automotive maintenance jobs exposed to uncomfortable and repetitive postures executed at different times of the 
workday, becoming habits of bad practices and in the absence of inspections or having standards of execution, favor 
the appearance of musculoskeletal traumas proposing as the best preventive action to regularly apply periods of active 
breaks with stretching exercises. 
It is very remarkable the research of Moradi et al. 2017 that shows that repetitive movements, weight loading, use of 
tools without ergonomic design, lack of rest breaks and standing for long periods of time are risk factors that frequently 
generate Work related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), so it suggests that workers should receive proper postural 
training during the performance of their tasks as well as in the use of appropriate and ergonomic means equipment 
and hand tools being mechanization and automation two techniques to minimize the risk those jobs.

Abstract 
The general objective of this research was to analyze the influence of Digital Marketing on the student recruitment 
process in the Private Higher Education Sector in Peru. To do this, the current context of the Higher Education 
Sector in Peru is described, and the dimensions of digital marketing are explored. The methodology used is mixed 
since interviews with digital marketing managers from Peruvian universities with a business focus were 
conducted, and 380 surveys aimed at students from the same universities were conducted as a sample. 
Furthermore, the data collected through surveys were reviewed, processed, and analyzed using SPSS statistical 
software. Finally, based on quantitative and qualitative research, it was observed that there is a positive correlation 
between the student recruitment process in the Private Higher Education Sector in Peru and the application of 
digital marketing tools, as supported by numerical evidence.

1. Introduction
Marketing is a fundamental axis to the economic growth of organizations. Zambrano (2018) defines marketing as 
the process by which companies create value for final consumers and establish powerful relationships with them. 
Over time, technological and cultural changes have impacted the development of a new type of consumer, 
characterized by being multichannel. In his intervention at the National Marketing Congress in 2017, Isabelle 
Castelain, director of digital marketing and channels at Citibanamex, points out that nowadays, consumers are 
even more demanding than before. That multi-channeling has changed the experience that companies must offer 
to the final consumer. Also, in 2020, a worldwide survey conducted among digital marketing leaders found that 
the most significant challenge in executing digital marketing strategies was providing personalized experiences 
(Statista, 2022). Furthermore, the arrival of new technologies such as the internet and social networks has changed 
the global scene, making the market a field that goes far beyond a geographical space and cyberspace, the stage 
of new commercial confrontations in the world (Meléndez, 2018; De Xena, 2012).  
This technological revolution led to the appearance of the entitled ""Digital Marketing,"" which Enriquez (2021) 
defines as the active and intelligent application of technology to contribute to marketing activities, increasing new 
customers and withholding the existing customers; additionally, it applies to selling strategies through digital 
media such as social networks and new technologies where there are constant interactions and feedback with 
users. It’s important to mention that digital marketing is not only an exclusive tool for companies that intend to 
achieve a rapprochement between the offer and demand of products and services. Currently, it’s also necessary to 
apply digital marketing techniques and procedures in the educational market, to which schools, institutes, 
universities, and other training centers belong. If educational institutions introduce digital marketing strategies, 
they can achieve an efficient position in the market for better recruitment of students and greater retention of them, 
optimally revealing the attributes, benefits, and characteristics of their educational product or service (Enriquez, 
2021). In “The digital strategy to connect with digital youth,” Prieto (2014) emphasizes the importance of a digital 
marketing strategy aimed at promoting universities' educational services worldwide. This is evidenced in reports 
from the Statista portal (2022), where they prove that in 2020, the internet advertising expenses in Latin America

Note: **The correlation is significant at the level of 0.01 (bilateral) 
 
As can be seen in both Tables 9 and 10, the results show a positive correlation, accompanied by an 
“acceptable” level of significance in both variables. 
 
For the case of the general hypothesis, a result of r = 0.528 and p = 0.000 < 0.01 is obtained; therefore, the null 
hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is accepted, where it is specified that digital marketing is 
significantly related to the student recruitment process. The same occurs with the correlation values obtained 
between the dimensions of digital marketing and the dependent variable, where the general result was a positive 
correlation within the range [0.278,0.376]. This is also supported by some authors, such as Enriquez (2021), when 
he mentions that educational institutions, by implementing digital marketing strategies, can position themselves 
efficiently in the market for better student recruitment and retention and achieving to spread the word and make 
known the attributes, benefits and key characteristics of their educational product or service. Here it is important 
to highlight the fact that the marketing managers interviewed mentioned that traditional media is still used by 
Peruvian private universities as a means to spread brand awareness and for institutional communication purposes. 
Being this one of the reasons why the tendency of the coefficient of correlation found is to be moderate rather 
than strong.  
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, through analysis and discussion, the relationship between digital marketing and the student 
recruitment process was studied. The work contributes by studying the dimensions of digital marketing and the 
link with the student recruitment process followed by Peruvian private universities with a business or 
entrepreneurial focus. Finally, the study found that the social network, email marketing, SEO & SEM, content 
marketing, and customer relationship marketing dimensions of digital marketing have a positive and significant 
relationship with the student recruitment process. Highlighting the fact that the correlation between the main 
variables without any dimension distinction is even higher. In addition, this has been supported by three marketing 
managers who point out that digital marketing tools influence the student recruitment process by reducing 
department costs and time dedicated to following a lead, allowing to reach and attract a greater number of 
prospective students, and providing a greater capacity for segmentation and measurement of results in real-time. 
All of these are key factors in the success of any marketing strategy. Therefore, it was concluded that digital 
marketing and its dimensions are related to the student recruitment process.

Abstract 
Today, the role of ICTs is a relevant factor for teaching and learning processes, mainly due to the new educational 
technologies that have allowed classrooms to evolve considerably in the last 20 years, as is the case at the school level 
or therapeutic. Specific technologies have been developed for this population; many of those technologies (i.e. 
hardware, software) use sensors and embedded systems. Although many studies address Phonological Awareness 
approaches, there have been no systematic reviews of the literature covering tools, methodologies and validations 
related to technology for developing phonological awareness. Therefore, this article presents a systematic review of 
the literature of primary studies related to Phonological Awareness and Technology, which focuses on establishing 
relationships between software, hardware and methodologies that work together to support the development of 
Phonological Awareness. In this study, 115 articles were extracted; from those, only 36 were selected after applying 
the corresponding inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
In today's society, named by the Japanese as a ""super-intelligent society"" (Deguchi et al., 2018), where attendance is 
linked to virtuality, the role of information technologies (ICT) becomes a relevant factor in teaching and learning

degree of agreement of 95% (iii) Validation of the Extraction Criteria, to understand the extraction criteria, the Fleiss-
Kappa statistic was calculated applied to a sample of 86 % of the articles reviewed, obtaining a degree of agreement 
of 98.64% In addition, the evaluation by relevance of the conferences of the articles was obtained of 8.48/10 and of 
citations, an average quality of 8.06/10 was obtained values obtained from the evaluation criteria for assignment 
quality of Montagud, S. (2012). 
6.1 Threats to validation 
Due to the large number of existing digital libraries, only the seven most popular libraries in the field of computer 
science were considered; however, it may be necessary to include bibliography related to Technology and 
Phonological Awareness topics. To improve the results, a manual search was carried out for congresses that publish 
according to the research topic and are recognized within the field and topics on Technology and Phonological 
Awareness.

Abstract 
The significant increase in the generation of medical waste in recent years has raised many concerns worldwide. This 
work aims to determine the environmental impacts produced by the different technologies used for the recovery of 
medical waste as part of waste management (incineration and pyrolysis), thermal treatments considered effective for 
the decontamination and sterilization of infectious medical waste. The Leopold Matrix was applied to evaluate in 
quantitative terms the environmental impacts of each of the processes. For this purpose, the interactions of the 
physical, biological, and socioeconomic elements were established with each of the stages of the waste management 
treatment processes, which were evaluated using the results of a literature review. In the physical aspect, the negative 
impact of soil, air and water contamination was considered; in the biological aspect, the damage caused to flora and 
fauna; and in the socioeconomic aspect, the risk of spreading diseases; despite the generation of employment and 
contribution to the economy. The results showed that both waste management treatments are polluting; however, 
pyrolysis scored higher, reflecting that this treatment generates fewer negative impacts than incineration. This research 
is a starting point for further research into new methods of medical waste management that are environmentally 
friendly and efficient. 
Keywords 
Medical Waste, Environmental Impact, Leopold Matrix, Incineration and Pyrolysis. 
1. Introduction
Medical waste (MW) management is often downplayed, yet since the coronavirus outbreak, a significant increase has 
emerged that has changed the dynamics of waste generation worldwide (Singh et al. 2022). Thirty percent of health 
facilities (60 percent in less developed countries) are not equipped to handle existing waste loads, let alone the 
additional burden generated by the pandemic. This potentially exposes health care workers to a variety of pathogenic 
microorganisms and at the same time affects communities living near poorly managed landfills and waste disposal 
sites (WHO 2022).  
With the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of various medical items such as masks and gloves has become widespread. 
However, the control of disposal of these wastes has lagged the growing demand. For example, in South Korea, the 
demand for these products increased by 816% and 2551% respectively from 2019 to 2020 (Lee 2022). In Indonesia, 
around 12,740 tons of medical waste has been generated every two months. The threat of medical waste that is not 
managed properly is that it causes diseases as it is a point of transmission and therefore at least 5.2 million people die 
every year worldwide (Chowdhury 2022).

claims that investing in this technology would have a rate of return of up to 43%. Negative effects include damage to 
health that can occur in the collection and treatment areas. 
 
After the quantitative evaluation of both treatments, incineration, and pyrolysis, through the Leopold matrix, it can be 
concluded that both processes generate environmental pollution, especially in the physical factor.  
 
The results obtained in the study are like those of Nabavi-Pelesaraei (2020) and Ye (2022) where it is mentioned that 
the production of toxic substances such as ash and dioxin cause air, soil and water pollution, as well as acid rain.  
Similarly, the results of the present study show that the incineration of medical waste leads to increased air pollution. 
Authors Xu (2020), Yoon (2022) and Abouzid (2022) agree that it generates major air pollution, as it easily produces 
dioxins as well as polycyclic aromatic compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls and other highly toxic substances and 
noxious gases, since most medical waste is made of plastic. This is supported by author Rizan (2021) as within his 
discussion it is mentioned that incineration generates the largest carbon footprint. 
 
4.2. Selected Treatment 
Therefore, authors Gerasimov (2019) and Skrzyniarz (2022) considered that the pyrolysis treatment is a better 
alternative to dispose of medical waste because it generates less waste and emits a lower amount of air pollutant 
emissions, such as SO2 and NOx which leads to a lower impact on the environment. Furthermore, Purnomo (2021), 
Chisholm (2021) and Siwal (2021) point out that gaseous and liquid products can be obtained during the process, 
which can be used as a source of chemicals and fuels. On the other hand, Martin-Lara (2021) also mentions that a 
solid product is obtained that functions as an adsorbent for lead present in aqueous media. 
 
5. Conclusions 
After the quantitative evaluation of the environmental impact caused by the management and final disposal of medical 
waste by incineration and pyrolysis using the Leopold matrix, it can be concluded that both methods are polluting and 
harmful to the environment because both obtained a negative value. In the case of incineration, a value of -523 was 
obtained and the pyrolysis method a value of -51. 
 
Although the accuracy of the analyses in this study is inevitably subjective, this research is a starting point for further 
research into new, more eco-friendly, and effective methods of medical waste management and disposal. Although 
treatment and disposal options such as incineration and pyrolysis have been effective in the management of medical 
waste (including COVID-19 waste), new and improved technologies have recently been introduced. Some of the most 
recent include irradiation (UV, Cobalt 60, electron beam), thermal (quartz infrared dry heat or plasma pyrolysis) and 
other inactivation mechanisms (including electrothermal inactivation and gasification) (Andeobu et al. 2022).

Abstract 
Known as the region which has highest added value in East Java, Indonesia, Mojokerto Regency has a potential 
leading economic sector for regional development. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Mojokerto experienced a 
contraction of 1.11 per cent in 2020 then recovered rapidly by 5.15 percent in 2021. This growth was driven by 
the development of the particular economic sectors of the Mojokerto Regency. This study aims to analyse the 
leading and potential sectors in Mojokerto Regency using Location Quotient, Overlay, and Shift Share analysis 
methods. In comparing the trend before and during the pandemic, this study calculates the data of Gross Domestic 
Regional Product (GDRP) published by Indonesian Statistic Agency from 2018 to 2021.  According to the 
empirical calculation, the manufacturing sector is a potential leading sector and has the most significant 
contribution to the GRDP of Mojokerto Regency followed by information and communication and government 
administration. Tourism sectors measured by accomodation, food and beverage industry were the sector which 
experienced the drawbacks from Covid-19 pandemic. In boosting the sectoral competitiveness, stakeholders 
should colloborate in enhancing the rapid recovery especially for tourism which exhibited lower growth during 
the crisis.

1. Introduction
Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) is an economic indicator that can be used to see the economic growth 
rate at the regional level, such as provinces, districts/cities, and even sub-districts. (Habiburrahman 2012). 
According to BPS, Gross Regional Domestic Product or GRDP is the amount of added value generated by all 
business units in a particular area. Therefore, GRDP is a vital indicator with many benefits because it can describe 
the level of progress and economic development and the advantages and disadvantages of various sectors in the 
economic structure (Mutiya 2019). In addition, exploring the leading sector in an area can be used as one of the 
considerations for local governments to maximize development goals (Irmansyah 2019). According to Kuncoro 
(2010), development based on utilizing potential resources can create job opportunities and stimulate local-based 
economic activity. 
Mojokerto Regency is one of the regions that provide the seventh-highest added value for the economy in East 
Java Province, which is 3.65 percent of the total GRDP of East Java (BPS, 2021). Mojokerto Regency is an East 
Java Province district consisting of 18 sub-districts and 299 villages or sub-districts. The economic growth rate 
of the Mojokerto Regency experienced a contraction of up to 1.11 percent in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
This Covid-19 pandemic also causes the 2020 RMTDP target cannot be achieved because of the shocks that are

5.5 Overlay Analysis 
Based on Table 8, the Overlay analysis shows the sectors that meet the Overlay analysis criteria, namely having 
a Positive coefficient (+ + +) from the three analysis tools, the Manufacturing Industry Sector. Another sector that 
can become a leading sector is the Water Supply, Waste Management, Waste, and Recycling sector, which, based 
on the overlay analysis, only has a Combined LQ and DLQ (+) coefficient. In other sectors, based on the 
calculation of Shift Share analysis (Basis and Prospective), there is only one sector, namely the manufacturing 
industry. The study of the leading sectors in Maulana Irmansyah's research (2019) shows that the leading sectors 
in Mojokerto Regency are the manufacturing and real estate sectors. Based on the value of this relationship, it can 
be proven that the level of competition in the manufacturing sub-sector is proliferating compared to other 
economic sectors based on the impact of the spread (Irmansyah 2019). Another study by Hamzah (2020) showed 
results where the manufacturing sector was also the sector with the highest growth in the Bangka Belitung Islands 
from 2015-2019). This is because there is specialization in a region. After all, the processing industry commodities 
produced are superior to other economic sectors (Hamzah 2020). The study results are as follows: the calculation 
of the information and communication processing industry sector shows that the LQ (Location Quotient) index > 
1. This result means that the existence of the information and communication processing industry business 
includes activities based on increasing income (Gross Regional Domestic Product) in Mojokerto Regency area. 
Thus, the processing industry in Mojokerto Regency is a mainstay in regional development. On the other hand, 
potential sectors based on the calculation of the classification typology, namely mining, transportation and 
warehousing, government administration, and other services, can be potential sectors to be developed.

6. Conclusion 
According to the research finding, the manufacturing sector has becoma a leading sector that contributes 
significantly to GRDP in Mojokerto Regency. Meanwhile, the base sector in the GRDP of Mojokerto Regency 
includes information and communication and government administration, defense, and mandatory social security. 
Furthermore, the sector prospective for the GRDP of Mojokerto Regency, apart from the manufacturing sector, is 
the electricity and gas procurement sector. Based on the results of the Shift-Share analysis, the sectors that have 
experienced rapid growth are the water supply and processing industry, waste management, waste, and recycling 
which have type 1. In addition, the Klassen Typology analysis shows that only one sector is included in quadrant 
2588","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Abstract 
The following article is based on the approach of a project management model that aims to solve business problems 
from an innovative perspective, based on consumers’ needs. This model is based on integrating Design Thinking, 
Agile and Lean methodologies. The case of a brokerage insurance Peruvian company was analyzed, which perceived 
various drawbacks around the customer service area. This article recognizes the most appropriate improvement for 
the case studied, by following the steps of the adapted management model; starting with the traditional stages of 
Design Thinking to make a precise diagnosis of the situation and with this information, improvement proposals that 
solve what has been identified are established. Subsequently, the most appropriate improvement is selected under 
objective criteria, and sprints that allow making good use of Agile are organized to develop the specific execution 
using a sequence of steps according to the PDCA cycle, a characteristic technique of Lean where the goal is to ensure 
a constant reevaluation of processes. After the results obtained from the simulation of the studied process, an increase 
in attention span of 88% was obtained, which allows us to calculate a significant economic benefit in the company 
that would represent 29.25% of the revenues achieved in 2021. In conclusion, it’s possible to validate the proposed 
model, verifying its original properties of adaptability and replicability without limit of scenarios regarding the sector, 
area, or company size due to the great synergy existing between the three innovative methodologies unified for the 
development of the proposed model. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
In today’s days, the service experience has become a differentiating element for consumers when choosing companies 
that offer various products or services. However, a greater selectivity is shown with companies that provide services, 
since customers do not finalize the transaction with tangible elements, so the main attraction is the treatment received 
(Julca, et al., 2021). For Theresia and Tan (2021), services that require periodic payments must have good and constant 
communication with customers, because this will increase their trust in the company and establish bonds of loyalty. 
To achieve success, companies must focus on the constant analysis of needs and manage projects based on them, 
which allows adding value and raising the bar in the market to satisfy increasingly demanding customers (Arias-
Bareño, 2020). As stated by D'Mello (2018), there is a high interest among stakeholders in the insurance sector to 
implement innovation projects, because the benefit that these would bring to the experience of consumer users is 
recognized. 
Certain methodologies work as key tools to achieve process innovation (Lichtenthaler, 2020). According to Ciappi, et 
al. (2016), Lean has been a revolutionary concept in the business world, which is recommended to be implemented 
by companies that wish to achieve successful results in the short term. Like Design Thinking, Lean is a methodology 
based on obtaining immediate customer satisfaction through continuous consultation. Furthermore, both Lean and

6. Conclusion  
The present article managed to demonstrate the viability of a project management model based on the Design 
Thinking, Agile and Lean methodologies since the positive results were obtained in the case of application by 
following each of the steps established after the review of literature that allowed knowing the existing synergy between 
these innovation methodologies. 
 
From the investigation and resolution of the practical case using engineering tools, it is feasible to conclude that these 
are versatile and allow optimal and rapid results to be achieved in any type of proposal or business area. The theory 
proposed by the authors Rau et. al (2019) classifies various techniques and instruments according to their scope by 
research topic; This is consistent with what was developed in the present case since what is established is put into 
practice by using tools that are consistent with the objectives set under criteria justified by the problem detected. 
 
It is important to recognize that once the objectives set before the implementation of the management model have 
been achieved, all areas of the company must incorporate and maintain the philosophy of continuous improvement to 
see results with greater impact. This is demonstrated in the present study by finding new opportunities for 
improvement; Therefore, although it was possible to reduce times and increase customer satisfaction from the 
application of the management model for consumer service, it is detected that a greater impact would be obtained by 
reinforcing the company's sales force to take advantage of the positive economic effect obtained and thereby increase 
profitability. A further investigation could evaluate how to connect different areas for the implementation of the 
management model at the company level in its entirety.

Abstract 
This paper studies how knowledge externalities are commons and enhance innovation. Through analysis of public and 
private expenditures on education of OECD countries, it shows that public expenditure on education is not committed 
to collect market failure as stipulated by almost of studies about knowledge spillover, knowledge externalities, and 
social learning processes. Based on context of knowledge as common resource and the complexity of knowledge 
externalities, the paper urges that: i) Knowledge externalities are complex common resources, hence public expenditure 
is done in form of public policy to solve social dilemmas related to these externalities, and ii) Public expenditure is 
allocated on education not only by the factor of positive externalities generated, but also by being complex commons 
constituent of peer production and learning society that are important for innovation. 
  Keywords 
  Knowledge Spillovers, knowledge externalities, knowledge as a common resource, knowledge externalities as 
commons, social learning.  
1. Introduction
The major justification of government expenditure on education by traditional economists is embedded in its 
characteristic of creating knowledge externalities which are public goods1  and thus, government intervention is 
necessary to correct their market externality (Pigou,1946), (Bator, 1958), (Buchanan J., 1962 & 1966) cited by (Lin, 
1976). However, even if this approach has been important socio-political tool for knowledge creation and transfer, it 
does not explain much about mutual public and private participation in the processes and mechanisms of knowledge 
creation and diffusion that have much in common with end use of knowledge and knowledge externalities. Thus, to 
study this problem, this paper considers the nature of knowledge externalities in the context of duality of knowledge 
functions that state that knowledge externality to individualism knowledge ownership is a bad whereas to social or 
collective ownership is a good.    
It bases its analysis on current studies of knowledge creation and diffusion such as E. Ostrom and C. Hess who give a 
step forward to consider knowledge as commons and their important contribution is dual functions2 of knowledge 
(Ostrom & Hess, 2006). This helps to have a new context of knowledge externalities as commons that explain much 
better the raison why of government intervention in form of expenditure rather than that of market failure which 
prejudices innovation context.  This context helps to answer a question of: focusing on knowledge externalities as 
commons for innovation, what makes public and private expenditures3 co-allocation on education? The hypothesis of 
this research is that both public as well as private expenditure are equally concerned with education finance.  
1 This means that there are no exclusion and subtract abilities in knowledge externalities consumption. They are open and nonsubstractable 
resources.    
   Hence, these benefits cannot be governed by market cost-benefits system. Thus, public expenditure is advised.
2 knowledge is a commodity and a social constitutive force and base for innovation. 
3 Private spending on education refers to expenditure funded by private sources which are households and other private entities. This indicator is 
shown as a percentage of GDP, divided into primary, primary to post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary levels. Private spending on education 
includes all direct expenditure on educational institutions, net of public subsidies, also excluding expenditure outside educational institutions such as 
textbooks purchased by families, private tutoring for students and student living costs. Private spending includes expenditure on schools, universities 
and other public and private institutions delivering or supporting educational services (OECD, Private spending on education, 2022).

Abstract
XYZ Ltd. is a company engaged in the bag-making manufacturing industry. The products produced include various 
types of bags such as backpacks, messengers, triangles, body bags, waist bags, and wheeled suitcases. The problems 
currently faced by XYZ Ltd. in its business processes, namely requests that are not the same as forecasts, delays in 
raw materials sent by suppliers, damage to raw materials during storage in warehouses due to the absence of routine 
checks, machine breakdowns that affect production process delays, and returns of finished products from consumers 
due to defect at the time of delivery. This causes the company to lose in terms of time and cost. This study uses the 
House Of Risk method. The House Of Risk method is a modification of the Failure Modes and Effects of Analysis 
(FMEA) method and the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method. The purpose of this study is to identify 
potential risks that may arise in the supply chain at XYZ Ltd, find out the causes of these risks, and design effective 
risk mitigation strategies for the company. In the House Of Risk (HOR) stage 1, namely the risk identification stage, 
there are 33 risk events and 42 risk agents. Then after being analyzed using a Pareto diagram, 13 dominant risk causes 
were found based on the Aggregate Risk Potential (ARP) value. In the House Of Risk (HOR) phase 2, 14 mitigation 
actions (preventive actions) are proposed to overcome the probability of the emergence of risk agents in the supply 
chain of XYZ Ltd.

1. Introduction
Business processes starting from providing quality products and fast delivery are the company's success in this 
globalization era. Companies are required to be able to meet dynamic market demands to survive (Pulansari et al., 
2021). Basically, every company needs goods and services to support all activities within the company. To obtain 
these goods and services, the company carries out procurement activities. In carrying out its business processes, the 
procurement department will face various types of risks and causes of risks that may arise in their business processes 
and cause impacts that disrupt the smooth running of the business processes of procurement activities (Hendayani et 
al., 2021). The types of risks and the causes of these risks can come from within the company or from outside the 
company (Saifuddin et al., 2021). XYZ Ltd. is a company engaged in the bag-making manufacturing industry. The 
products produced include various types of bags such as backpacks, messengers, triangles, body bags, waist bags, and 
wheeled suitcases. Located in the city of Surabaya, East Java and was established in 1990. 
XYZ Ltd. carries out supply chain activities starting from the procurement of materials, the production process to the 
distribution of products to distributors and finally products to consumers. Supply chain activities are inseparable from 
disturbing uncertainty. The problems currently faced by XYZ Ltd. in its business processes, namely requests that are 
not in accordance with forecasts, delays in raw materials sent by suppliers, damage to raw materials during storage in 
warehouses due to the absence of routine checks, machine breakdowns that affect production process delays, and

from HOR data processing stage 1 are that there are 33 risk events caused by 42 risk causes. The results obtained from 
the HOR data processing stage 2 are 14 mitigation actions. The following is an explanation of 14 mitigation actions 
in the company's supply chain activities. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research that has been carried out at XYZ Ltd., the following conclusions are obtained. In the 
House of Risk (HOR) stage 1, there are various kinds of risks that occur in the company, namely as many as 33 risk 
events. From some of these risk events, there were 42 causes of risk (risk agents). So that from 42 risk agents, there 
are 13 most dominant risk agents based on the Pareto diagram from the calculation of the Aggregate Risk Potential 
(ARP) value. 
 
In the House of Risk (HOR) stage 2, 14 mitigation actions have been ranked. Some of the mitigation actions that have 
the biggest impact on the company are looking for more than one supplier from within the country (PA1), using 
outsourced workers (PA4), giving rest hours to workers (PA5), and making SOPs for an annual supplier performance 
evaluation (PA7).

Abstract 
Integrated design process is the basis for green building planning, but how the integration among the designer in each 
stage of green building planning is questionable, makes this process difficult to implemented. BIM is a computer-
aided modeling technology with the ability to develop the design, manage project information, and collaborate 
between project stakeholders, bringing efficiency for the processes in the project life cycle. However, despite its 
advantages, information transparency and operations within BIM in supporting the collaboration of the planning team 
are arguably still limited to certain entities. For those reasons the integrated design process is hard to achieve. 
Therefore, this study aims to develop the green building design workflow through blockchain integration in BIM for 
information transparency among the designer on BIM controlled with distributed ledger technology on a Hyperledger 
fabric platform. A qualitative approach through literature review, benchmarking study, and experiments were used to 
obtain this objective by considering the planning process of green building as a case study. The results of this study 
indicate that model of design workflow was built in Hyperledger fabric blockchain, but integration need an application 
as a tool for blockchain communicated with BIM.

Abstract 
Advanced technology is required to support the needs of metal manufacture in shaping many various products. An 
electrical furnace with inverter topology is one of example advanced technology application to melt and alloy metals 
and refractories. However, a furnace inverter is a non-linear load that creates voltage and current harmonics in the 
electrical network. Harmonics generate distortions and voltage variations in the electrical grid and it makes the grid 
is out of balance. Another effect of an electric furnace is a decrease in power factor, resulting in reduced electrical 
efficiency as well as transformer capacity. In this works, a model investigation and analysis are carried out to 
combine a active power factor correction and active hybrid filters to get the best outcomes for better furnace inverter 
performance to the electrical grid. The furnace inverter is modeled in equivalent power and control circuit to deliver 
the matched value in power factor with 1-3 percent difference to manufacturing data equipment. The results of the 
experiment show that the proposed model for the modified furnace has delivered the improving electrical power 
quality in the power factor by 13 percent to 17 percent. The other promising results are a reduction in power 
distortions, sag, and swell.

5. Conclusion
Several conclusions from the results and analysis are: 
a.
By making improvements, the simulation of the results of the furnace inverter also produces an improvement
in power distortion caused by harmonics.
b.
The results of the simulation model of the furnace inverter have produced a good range of similarities between
data factory and experiment in the value of 1% until 3%.
c.
The addition of active power factor correction and active hybrid filter in the simulation of the furnace inverter
circuit resulted in the highest increase in power factor value for a capacity of 1 ton at a load of 400 kg with a
active power factor correction from 0.693 to 0.865 or 17% correction. At a capacity of 3-ton with a load of
1200kg, a active power factor correction is successfully made from  0.693 to 0.854 with a 16% increment.

Abstract 
During the Covid-19 pandemic, where the teaching process is carried out online, adaptive learning can be an 
alternative choice in distance learning due to different conditions of each student with various learning instruments. 
Despite the many advantages of implementing adaptive learning in online learning and using digital materials, many 
teachers and students are not prepared for this sudden change. Not all teachers feel ready to make adjustments in 
carrying out distance learning and helping students optimally as when teaching directly in class. As a result, many 
students may find online learning materials too simple, or even very complicated. This of course results in treatment 
that is not in accordance with their needs so that learning outcomes are less than optimal. One solution to this problem 
is the use of IT-based learning technology which refers to the adaptive learning method. A decision support system 
(DSS) is built by applying the Simple Additive Weight (SAW) algorithm. From this, the teacher can obtain an 
overview related to the condition of the students as well as recommendations for treatment according to their condition. 
The system was tested in the distance learning process in the Informatics Education study program at Universitas 
Sebelas Maret.

1. Introduction
On January 9, 2020, WHO announced that a mysterious disease caused by a virus had emerged in Wuhan, China
(ECDC’s, 2020) This disease is transmitted from one individual to another through touch, droplets or the air. The 
disease, known to the public as Covid-19, is also slowly starting to attack Indonesia. As a result, starting in March 2020, 
face-to-face teaching and learning activities immediately experienced paralysis (Waruwu, 2020). 
Various ways are done so that the teaching and learning process can still be implemented. There are schools located 
in the green zone that continue to carry out direct learning activities, some do full distance learning, some use a 
combination of both (Malyana, 2020). 
One of the methods that is currently used by teachers in conducting distance learning activities is adaptive learning. 
This learning method observes the needs of students according to the conditions experienced (Sutardi, 2016). This is 
different from learning that applies uniformity of treatment to all students in a class. The teacher pays attention to the 
learning conditions of students and combines with the learning outcomes obtained (Sukajaya, 2017). From these 
parameters it can be seen what treatment is appropriate if given to students, so that each individual will get 
personalization in the teaching and learning process. 
Even though the adaptive learning teaching method is very appropriate and in accordance with current conditions, 
there are still many teachers who feel confused about what steps should be taken in providing appropriate treatment 
according to the needs of each student. This is due to a very sudden change in the situation, from offline to online, so 
that teachers are less prepared with the implementation of adaptive learning (Yulia Indahri, 2020).

6. Conclusion  
The decision support system application for the selection of learning strategy recommendations on the adaptive 
learning method was successfully implemented and received a fairly good response. This is evidenced by the acquisition 
of an average score of 68 from the SUS questionnaire given to a sample of 4 lecturers of the Informatics Education 
study program, Universitas Sebelas Maret. Through these results, the author will make up the  user interface and user 
experience to help end-user to easily understand how to use the application. Long-term development of this application 
is expanding the scope of application to a wider scale, namely in elementary and middle schools.

Abstract 
Job Satisfaction has an important role in work motivation and turnover intention. At PT XYZ it was found that the 
value of Job Satisfaction was still low. This study aims to see whether factors such as Job Insecurity and passion have 
an influence on Job Satisfaction. Quantitative research was conducted on 105 outsourced employees of PT XYZ. The 
data analysis technique used the Partial least Square-Structural Equation Modeling approach with the SmartPLS 
version 3.3 program. The results showed that Job Insecurity was proven to have a negative and significant effect on 
Job Satisfaction and Work Passion was proven to have a positive and significant effect on Job Satisfaction. Of the two 
variables, Job Insecurity and Work Passion, the most dominant influence on Job Satisfaction is Work Passion because 
it has path coefficients (+0.582) greater than Job Insecurity (-0.452).

 passion, Job Insecurity, Job Satisfaction.. 
1. Introduction
Job Satisfaction refers to the likes or dislikes of an employee towards the work environment in which he performs 
work-related tasks (Pathak & Srivastava, 2020). Employees with high levels of Job Satisfaction will have positive 
feelings about their jobs, and conversely, employees with low levels of Job Satisfaction will have negative feelings 
about their jobs. Job Satisfaction is considered as one of the consequences of job insecurity (Shi, 2017). Specifically, 
the perceived threat of losing valuable job features appears to be related to lower levels of overall perceived fairness 
which is associated with lower satisfaction with the organization and lower affective commitment, as well as with 
higher intentions to leave the organization (Lazauskaite-Zabielske et al., 2019). Based on McNeely's research in 
(Pathak & Srivastava, 2020) the level of Job   
Insecurity can affect the well-being of social workers and that dissatisfied workers tend to provide low quality services. 
Job demands such as work pressure and emotional demands, and so on tend to increase tension and reduce Job 
Satisfaction, while job resources such as career opportunities, autonomy, work significance, and so on lead to high 
levels of motivation and Job Satisfaction (Pathak & Srivastava, 2020). Problems related to low Job Satisfaction were 
also found at PT XYZ. PT.XYZ is a company that provides various business unit services consisting of, Information 
Technology Contractor & Services, Graphic Design & Digital Offset Printing Services, Staffing Agency & 
Outsourcing Services. PT.XYZ with Performa Staffing business unit offers outsourcing services specifically for 
Admin, Accounting Admin, IT Technician, and Barista. Performa Staffing is part of PT.XYZ to be able to meet the 
needs of human resources and client business by providing high caliber quality workforce (Outsourcing).  
Outsourcing is a form of employment relationship that falls into the category of precarious work, a term commonly 
used internationally to indicate a situation of employment relationship that is not fixed, certain time, casual work, not 
guaranteed or insecure and uncertain (Herawati, 2010). Outsourcing itself is carried out as a form of company 
effort in terms of human resource management in order to simplify the recruitment process and reduce the cost of 
maintaining human resources.  
Job Insecurity is one of the factors that affect Job Satisfaction. Job Insecurity is defined as the possibility of job loss, 
income, and social status associated with work; thus, it clearly impacts extrinsic Job Satisfaction (Yeves et al., 2019). 
Job Insecurity can be seen as threatening demands, in particular, when demands are higher than resources (provided

2. Work Passion Affects Job Satisfaction 
This study aims to analyze and confirm the relationship between Work Passion and Job Satisfaction. Based on Table 
4.9, the results of the path coefficients and T-Statistics (Bootstrapping) tests through Smart PLS media on H2 (Work 
Passion has a positive and significant effect on Job Satisfaction), the path coefficients value is 0.582 where if the 
path coefficients test results show positive results (+) then the influence of exogenous variables (Work Passion) on 
endogenous variables (Job Satisfaction) is positive. Then the T-Statistics (Bootstrapping) test results obtained a 
value of 9.335 where the test results must have a value> 1.96 to be said to have a significant effect, these results 
prove that the exogenous variable (Work Passion) has a significant effect on the endogenous variable (Job 
Satisfaction), therefore hypothesis H2 is accepted.  
 
This is evidenced by research conducted by (Mustafa et al., 2020) that Work Passion has a positive and significant 
influence on Job Satisfaction. Likewise, research conducted by (Coetzee & Bester, 2019) proves that Work Passion 
has a positive and significant correlation with Job Satisfaction. Then research by (Tarkar et al., 2019) also found 
similar results, namely Work Passion has a positive and significant correlation with Job Satisfaction.  
 
Work Passion is the extent to which employees find and experience meaning, interest, and emotional attachment to 
the work they do (Forest et al., 2011; Vallerand, 2008) in (Mustafa et al., 2020). Factors that can facilitate or hinder 
the development of Work Passion are the work environment, external labor market, social domain and family 
(Coetzee & Bester, 2019). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the discussion and interpretation of the research, the author will conclude that. 
 
1. Job Insecurity is proven to have a negative and significant influence on Job Satisfaction. his can be seen 
from the path coefficients value of -0.452, p-value 0.000 <0.05 and t-statistic value 7.127> t-table (1.96). 
2. Work Passion is proven to have a positive and significant influence on Job Satisfaction. This can be seen 
from the path coefficients value of +0.582, p-value 0.000 <0.05 and t-statistic value 9.335> t-table (1.96). 
3. Of the two variables, namely Job Insecurity and Work Passion, the most dominant effect on Job 
Satisfaction is Work Passion because it has a path coefficients value (+0.582) greater than Job Insecurity (-
0.452).

Abstract 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of Indonesia's industry, so their development is very 
important for the government. One of the efforts of the West Nusa Tenggara regional government to help the SMEs 
is development through facilitating the STIP entrepreneurial incubator, where STIP aims to help the problems faced 
by SMEs, such as the provision of the latest facilities and machines, training for SMEs, as well as exposure and 
marketing assistance, to encourage the performance of SMEs. This is very important in the context of the ongoing 
COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in many SMEs experiencing productivity erosion that threatens their 
sustainability of SMEs. However, support from the government is not always enough for SMEs because there is a gap 
between what is provided by the government and what the business needs, and there is an absorptive capacity factor 
that is an important determinant in determining how successful the business incubation program is. Therefore, an 
evaluation is needed to determine whether government assistance has been effective in improving the performance of 
SMEs, which is the purpose of this study with the Structural Equation Modeling – Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) 
method. The results showed that there was a significant influence of government business support services and 
absorptive capacity moderation on SME performance, with proposals to improve the implementation of the absorptive 
capacity development framework in the entrepreneurial incubation program.

1. Introduction
The government attaches great importance to the sustainability of SMEs, because SMEs are the backbone of the 
industry of developing countries such as Indonesia, with 99.7% of the industry in Indonesia being SMEs according to 
the Ministry of Industry (Santia, 2021). In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the economic recession 
that followed, this is very important, because many SMEs are experiencing productivity erosion due to restrictions on 
economic activities to limit the spread of COVID-19 and the implications produced by these policies, namely declining 
demand, is threatening the sustainability of various SMEs. This problem is supported by data showing that 30 million 
small-to-medium-scale businesses in Indonesia went bankrupt and ceased to operate during the pandemic (Pratama, 
2020). Thus, the urgency for the government as the person in charge of the country's economy and its citizens' welfare 
is to support SMEs so that they can rise again and ensure that this crucial pillar can improve its performance again. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the central government to local governments has made various efforts to help the 
sustainability of SMEs. One of the ways the government distributes this assistance is through the government's 
entrepreneurial incubator facility to help the sustainability of SME operations and development, whereas, in the 
province of West Nusa Tenggara, the form of local government business support services is through the Science 
Technology and Industrial Park (STIP) entrepreneurial incubator. 
STIP was formed to help problems faced by SMEs, such as financial assistance and non-financial assistance namely 
training and marketing assistance. At STIP, as a government business support service, SMEs that need assistance are

5. Conclusion
The results of the outer model evaluation show that the model was valid in a convergent and discriminant manner, as 
well as reliable. Meanwhile, the inner model show that the coefficient of determination was moderate, the prediction 
is relevant, and the suitability of the model was large. There was a positive and significant relationship between 
Government Business Support Services and SME Performance. The Absorptive Capacity exerts a positive and 
significant moderation influence between the relationship of Government Business Support Services to SME 
Performance.The structural model obtained from SEM-PLS as follows: 𝜂𝜂1 = 0.284𝜉𝜉1 + 0.639𝜉𝜉2 + 0.163𝜉𝜉1𝜉𝜉2 + 0.24. 
The SME performance will increase by 0.284 if the Government Business Support Services variable increases by one 
unit and other variables are considered constant, and will increase by 0.639 if the Absorptive Capacity variable 
increases by one unit and other variables are considered constant, and also will increase by 0.163 if the moderation 
effect of the interaction of the Absorptive Capacity variable with Government Business Support Services increases by 
one unit and other variables are considered constant. The proposed improvement obtained based on the results of the 
analysis was the implementation of an absorptive capacity development framework to increase the moderation effect 
of absorptive capacity on the relationship between government business support services on the performance of SMEs.

Abstract  
The development of railway system in Malaysia is no longer seen to fit a needs of land transportation 
system only. The development currently is more to be a method to improve the existing service, 
making public transportation system more widespread and effective. It is also an alternative method 
to solving traffic congestion in the city. In recent decade, development of rail system in Malaysia is 
not only focused to the city center, but also the provision and construction of several routes 
connecting the Kuala Lumpur city center to the surrounding areas which allow residents of outside 
the city working in Kuala Lumpur without having to live in the city. In addition, a construction of 
two-way rail system to replace an existing one-way rail made aggressively across the country as an 
effort to make the rail transportation system more efficient and faster for services. Therefore, the 
system will be becoming a preferred mode of transport in the near future compared to the road 
transport system.  The transport sector is currently an important infrastructure in enhancing the 
economic development of Malaysia at the global level. Advanced pullback of a country can be seen 
and measured by its public transport system.  With the huge provisions in this sector, the goals 
should not only focus to solve the traffic congestion alone but to see how effective the efforts made 
by the Government in increasing the level of public transport use in the city.  The researcher is also 
expecting that the huge provision could create an integrated rail transportation system is not only 
focus on reducing the use of private vehicles but also able to meet the needs of every resident of the 
city in their daily activities as well as to spur economic activities, social services, and improve the 
environment.

Abstract 
As of 2018, Bandung city has approximately 28,000 Street Lighting Equipment (SLE). Government 
constraints in providing funds to optimize SLE lead to limited government ability to optimize SLE. 
However, with the opening of the tap of the private sector's involvement policy in managing SLE 
infrastructure, there is the potential to optimize SLE. The problem in implementing the SLE PPP project 
is determining a suitable PPP scheme for providing SLE in Bandung. The obstacles include investment 
development schemes, the SLE database, and weak coordination between stakeholders. This research 
uses a qualitative approach. Determining the object of the study is carried out utilizing purposeful 
samples. While data collection techniques by performing observation, interview, documentation 
tracing, and audiovisual. Test reliability and validity using triangulation techniques. The resulting 
research concluded that the provision of SLE in the city of Bandung is to involve business entities in 
designing, building, financing, operating, and maintaining SLE infrastructure assets which will later 
become investments of the Bandung City Government. Alternatively, in other words, the PPP scheme 
suitable for the provision of SLE Bandung City is to use the Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM) 
type using the available payment return mechanism.

1. Introduction
As mandated in Paris Agreement Article 4.19, Indonesia formulated a long-term strategy for managing 
low greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The Government of Indonesia is committed to reducing 
voluntary greenhouse gas emissions by 26% until 2020, then increasing to 29% from 2020 – to 2030 
and a reduction of 41% for Conditional Reduction in the Business as Usual scenario (BAPPENAS 
2017; Kurniadi & Suryadi 2021). One infrastructure supporting emission reduction and energy 
conservation programs is the Street heating Equipment (SLE). SLE energy conservation is carried out 
by increasing energy use efficiency and saving 20% of electric power (BAPPENAS, 2019; Sihombing, 
Santos, & Wibowo, 2021). 
SLE energy conservation infrastructure can collaborate with the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) 
scheme (Delmon, 2011). In SLE, steps that can be taken to improve energy efficiency use include using

project is the Availability Payment mechanism. By the Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Nomor 
190/PMK.08/2015, the Availability Payment mechanism can be implemented for PPP projects that 
meet the following criteria: 
 
a. 
For the provision of economic infrastructure and the provision of social infrastructure that has 
great benefits for the community as service users. 
b. For the provision of infrastructure as intended in paragraph a, whose return on investment is not 
obtained from payment by service users to Business Entities; and 
c. 
For PPP with the procurement of Business Entities is conducted through fair, open, and transparent 
election stages and pays attention to healthy business competition. 
Based on these criteria, the SLE project will be suitable for implementation through the Availability 
Payment mechanism because payments by users are made through SLE taxes paid not to Business 
Entities but through electricity bills. 
 
Cooperation with Business Entities is one of the financing models that can be developed. The 
cooperation model between local governments and private parties is known as PPP. This model is 
widely used because of the limited investment capital owned by the government. At the same time, 
infrastructure needs become a basic need that is urgent and needs to be rushed to create increased 
economic growth and community welfare. 
 
In collaborating with business entities, several things need to be considered, namely: 
 
1) Referring to applicable procurement regulations of goods/services 
2) Pay attention to the procurement of SLE goods/services 
a. 
Ensuring the credibility of procurement participants, both the completeness and validity of 
administrative documents. 
b. Technical specifications must be clear, detailed, measurable, and verifiable. 
c. 
SLE equipment guarantee in the form of clear supporting documents.  
d. Quality supervision and control mechanisms with third parties or internal staff. 
e. 
Warranty and maintenance period as a backup for the certification of system 
conformity/components promised by the provider of the goods. 
f. 
The optimum results and packaging work should be in one work package, namely equipment 
procurement and installation. 
g. E-Catalog 
In addition to SLE construction, operations and maintenance will also cooperate with business 
entities. Here are the points of the SLE maintenance mechanism with business entities: 
1) SLE managers must have detailed data/information about the SLE system, including: 
a. 
Predicting the replacement of SLE light ballast 
b. Set an SLE maintenance schedule 
c. 
Open communication media between managers and the community so that SLE complaints 
will be appropriately handled soon. 
d. Create a reporting mechanism / SOP for follow-up community complaints. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the above research results, it was concluded that the provision of SLE in the City of Bandung 
is to involve business entities to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain SLE infrastructure assets, 
which will later become investments in the Bandung City Government. Alternatively, in other words, 
the PPP scheme that is suitable for the provision of SLE Bandung City is to use the DBOM (Design-
Build-Operate-Maintain) type using the availability payment (AP) return on investment mechanism. 
 
SLE infrastructure is one of the essential infrastructures for developing an area. Good lighting by SLE 
will certainly increase economic flows in the area because economic activity is hardly limited by the 
time possible. After all, the road can be adequately illuminated, and good visibility on the environment 
and roads reduces the risk of crime and accidents. With the explanation above, the challenges that can 
arise in SLE infrastructure projects can be adequately managed so that the project can run efficiently, 
both from the time and resources needed.

Abstract 
The research was conducted at the packaging stage in a cement factory. Cases of product defects in cement 
bagging with kraft 50 type occurred from December 2021 to February 2022 with a total percentage of 7.54%. The 
research objective is to identify product defects and minimize waste that arises so that production is more effective 
and efficient. The research uses the lean six sigma method. Lean to reduce waste that occurs in the production 
process. Six sigma to reduce the level of defects by using the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control 
stages. The stage of defining a problem with existing data to improve the process and product quality using SIPOC 
and CTQ diagrams. The measuring stage uses a p control chart to identify product defects, then uses DPMO 
calculations and sigma levels to calculate the capability of defective products with the result before repair that is 
19708 with a sigma level of 3.57 sigma. mapping Value Stream Mapping and calculating Process Cycle Efficiency 
with the result before repair of 6.99%. The analysis phase uses an Ishikawa diagram for analysis. Proposed 
improvements at the repair stage are operator training, display of the 5S concept, and machine maintenance 
checklist. Then the control stage makes a VSM proposal by combining activities. So the calculation of the new 
DPMO is 11985 with a sigma level of 3757 sigma. Then the new PCE count is 7.62%.

1. Introduction
At PT. C produces three types of products, namely composite Portland cement (using cement bags), bulk cement 
products, and concrete products. There are 2 types of cement bags and 2 types of cement bag contents, namely 
kraft 40 Kg, kraft 50 Kg, woven 40 Kg, and woven 50 Kg. The difference between kraft and woven types lies in 
the use of the cement bag. Kraft type is used for cement bags which will be distributed by land route, while woven 
is used for cement bags which will be distributed via waterways. At the cement bagging stage, it is done manually, 
therefore there are still many problems caused by several factors causing waste of production costs issued by the 
company and can have an impact on product quality because it is not in accordance with product standards that 
have been determined by the company. The criteria for a good cement bag is that it must have the SNI (Indonesian 
National Standard) logo which is a sign of meeting the standardization requirements on products that have been

5.  Conclusion  
Based on the results of data processing and analysis of the results that have been carried out, the conclusions that 
can be drawn are: 
 
1. The results of the types of waste and the factors that cause waste in the production process of Portland cement 
composite bagging are waiting time in the process and torn cement bags in the product. This can occur due to 
clogged tubes at the filling station and the method of opening the cement bag is less than optimal 
2.  Before the implementation of the sigma level value in the process of 3.573, it means that the activities of the 
cement bagging production process can be said to be quite good. After the implementation, the sigma level 
value obtained is 3.757 which means that the activities of the cement bagging production process have increased 
after implementation. This can be seen from the increase in the value of the sigma level of 0.184 compared to 
the value of the sigma level that occurred in January 2022. 
3. The results obtained value added value is 10.10 minutes while for non-value added is 134.35 minutes and for 
manufacturing lead time is 144.45 minutes. In the PCE calculation before implementation, the results were 
obtained by 6.99%. Meanwhile, after implementation for non-value added of 122.35 minutes and for 
manufacturing lead time of 132.45 minutes with PCE calculation results of 7.62%. For comparison, PCE 
increased by 0.63% 
4.  The implementation of the improvements made is making a checksheet for cleaning the packer machine, and 
implementing the 5S/5R concept display. The training/training for operators cannot be carried out due to 
insufficient time estimation, while other suggestions for improvement have been made.

Abstract 
Injection machines are already on the market with varying prices based on its capacity. Even the smallest machine 
on the market has a capacity starting from around 100 grams per second, with an expensive price starting around 
USD 13,000. Furthermore, the machine also has a large power consumption as well. This condition is unfavorable to 
the start-up business from the lower middle market, which has limited resources and budget. In this work, the design 
of the plastic injection molding, which is smaller and cheaper compared to the one available in the market is 
proposed. This proposed machine is available in the middle production capacity. In this work, the temperature of the 
heater and the pneumatic electronically are controlled in order to melt resin plastic perfectly. The PID control 
algorithm is applied to control the heater and the pneumatic of the system. The component used to control the heater 
is a solid-state relay. This electronic component can be used as a switch which is turned on and off the heater until it 
reaches certain temperature condition according to the feedback from the temperature sensor. Moreover, once the 
temperature has reached the certain degree that makes the plastic material into a semi-liquid condition, then the 
pneumatic active to push the barrel.  During the experiment, the temperature measured by the sensor on the heater. 
The result shows in accordance with the desired target temperature to melt the resin plastic perfectly without 
exceeding the temperature limit of the system. The temperature target accuracy of the obtained system is 90% to 
95%.

1. Introduction
The raw plastic material is the most common material and widely used for various needs. Therefore, the business 
opportunity in the field of plastic injection is still wide open (Endarwati, 2017). The price of the plastic product 
depends on the type of material and size. The larger the size of the product the greater the size of the injection 
machine. However, the production of a small-sized product with relatively low quantity using a large injection 
machine is significantly not efficient.  
One way to produce the plastic product is by using an injection machine. This machine will process plastic material 
into the plastic product with the desired shape. Plastic injection machine consists of several parts. One of them is the 
heated cylinder which melts the plastic material (Martinez, 2018). In this part, the temperature is greatly affecting 
the melting process. This is because the temperature stability affects the quality of plastics to be produced. Therefore, 
the temperature needs to be kept stable in order to improve the quality of plastic. If the temperature is not stable, 
then the plastic can be hardened or brittle. The faster the temperature is stable at the desired temperature the better 
the quality of the plastic produced (Dubay, Pramujati, & Hernandez, 2005). The stability of the temperature in the

Therefore, the PID controller is installed in the system, in order to control the Temperature of the system to behave 
as the desired material. The coefficient PID is determined based on the experiment. The chosen coefficient is the one 
with the best performance of the temperature to achieve the desired temperature based on the material.  
 
Figure 4.9 shows that the system can be stable in the temperatures of 199 ° c. This proves that the temperature is in 
accordance with the desired. Once the system has been controlled, then the system will be stable at a certain 
temperature. Because the temperature is stable in that condition then the components can be maintained condition 
and the resulting product also has good quality. 
 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this work, the injection machine which priority for lower middle market plastic production, is developed. The 
temperature of the melting process and the pneumatics are controlled, in order to have good and effective plastics 
production. The injection machine in this project is developed for middle-lower business which has middle size 
production. The prototype of the plastic injection machine for middle-low size business is developed. The model of 
the proposed system used in the proposed system discusses in detail. Finally, the performance of the proposed 
injection machine is evaluated experimentally. 
 
The result shows that the system which not applied PID control system is cannot be controlled, the temperature 
continues to grow indefinitely. This condition is very dangerous because it can damage the components contained in 
this injection machine can also damage the product to be produced, therefore the control system is in need in this 
experiment. The condition which applied PID will be stable at a certain temperature. Because the temperature is 
stable in that condition then the components can be maintained condition and the resulting product also has good 
quality. 
  
 
6. Future Work 
In the future, it is needed to evaluate the safest and the comfort of the injection machine, since it is related to a very 
high temperature which could be more than 100oC.

Abstract 
Business start-ups are companies that have not been operating for a long time. These companies are mostly newly 
founded companies and are in the development and research phase to find the right market in the technology. Such 
conditions have an impact on the long process of business start-ups to develop their businesses which have a high risk 
of failure if the process is not followed by the right method to develop their business. Several business concepts are 
used by start-up companies to help develop their business such as the Model Business Canvas (MBC). On the other 
hand, knowledge management system is a type of IT system that stores and retrieves knowledge to improve 
understanding, collaboration, and alignment of processes that can be utilized by business start-ups to develop their 
businesses by managing their knowledge and using Knowledge Management Systems to help them make business 
decisions. Thus, the purpose of this research is to help business start-ups manage their knowledge by combining the 
concepts of validated learning and knowledge management systems to develop their businesses. The research method 
uses a qualitative approach through observation of business start-ups to identify their business problems. Meanwhile,

5. Conclusion
The challenges faced by business start-ups due to limited knowledge and experience can have a serious impact on the 
company's business continuity. With the Business Canvas Model, business start-ups can make plans about important 
parts of the company to be built. By adopting validated learning for components at BMC will generate new knowledge 
that is useful for the company. The adoption of a Knowledge Management System functions to store the resulting 
knowledge and KMS will process the information into new knowledge that can be used to support management 
decision making.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes in every aspect of daily life. Many educational institutions 
around the world have decided to cancel in-person classes and move all classes to online mode. Despite the fact that 
in-person classroom learning is said to be more effective and preferable, online learning has played a significant role 
in limiting COVID-19 transmission. With recent technological advancements, synchronous e-learning allows teachers 
to communicate and interact with students virtually. However, in several studies, the effectiveness of on-site and 
online learning has been studied and compared. According to the survey, about 65.9% of the sample group prefer to 
study on-site rather than study online regards to its limitation of interaction. It would be great if the development of 
learning technology, especially online learning platform, provide the appropriate functionality that supports active 
learning activities. Thus, the purpose of present study was to investigate the key factors that contributed to active 
learning in the context of online learning. This study conducted systematic reviews of the PRISMA-P together with 
96 users interview from both learners and teachers to extract the key factors that related to active learning in online 
learning platform. As a result, the factors that contribute to and support active learning are critical thinking, decision-
making, problem-solving, effective questioning, idea demonstration, participatory, micro-interaction, self-reflection, 
and the positive teacher-student relationship. Implications for future learning technology development were discussed.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted and altered the way business and activities are conducted in our daily lives. 
As a result, many educational institutions around the world decided to shut down and shift their teaching style from 
physical classroom learning to online classroom learning. This was the most suitable way to study during the 2019 
novel coronavirus pandemic as it minimizes the physical contact between students and instructors (Hussein et al., 
2020). With technology advancement, synchronous e-learning has successfully bridged the gap between on-site and 
online learning. It allows the student to virtually attend a class session through video conferencing (Giesbers et al., 
2013). Nowadays, there are many synchronous technology as a tool in online learning, such as Google Meet, Cisco 
Webex, Microsoft Teams, Learn Anywhere, and Zoom.

From discussion above, it is recommended that functions such as visibility control, voice-based discussion, text-based 
discussion, facial expressions, drawing platform, working space, library, real-time response, real-time survey, and 
real-time poll should be integrated with the aforementioned factors of active learning to enhance students’ learning 
effectiveness. Furthermore, these factors can be implemented into synchronous e-learning technology to support active 
learning in the future. However, the suggested functions in present study were only some guidelines. These functions 
still be open for future technology that could support these key factors contributed to the active online learning 
technology.  
  
  
  
5. Conclusion 
The objective of this study was to identify key factors related to active learning in the context of online learning to 
bridge the gap between on-site and online learning by applying these key factors from active learning to the route of 
development of online learning technology. This study conducted systematic reviews of the PRISMA-P together with 
real users interview from both learners and teachers to extract key factors that related to active learning in online 
learning platform. Nine effective factors are critical thinking, decision-making, problem-solving, effective 
questioning, idea demonstration, participatory, micro-interaction, self-reflection, and positive teacher-student 
relationship. These factors are fundamentally support active learning via online platforms that are student-centered 
and communicative (i.e. interaction among students or between students and teachers). As a result, these factors could 
be used as a guideline for the development of synchronous e-learning technology that naturally support active learning. 
 
However, there are some limitations in present study. First, all interview sessions were conducted online, this may 
limit the quality of communication between interviewee and interviewer. Second, the stimulus online learning 
platform were limited only on Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet as these platforms were mainly used in Thai 
university to provide classes during COVID-19 pandemic. Future work should consider to bring these finding factors 
to develop some designing tools for active learning technology development. Moreover, it should be worth considering 
in conducting usability evaluation of each learning technology for active learning activities in order to define the gap 
of user interface and match those need with factors providing from current study.

Abstract 
Some studies have been conducted to cross-culturally adapt the paper-based methods and instruments of ergonomics 
to minimize the accuracy discrepancy when utilized by non-English speakers, including Indonesians. However, no 
comprehensive reports are available on the paper-based methods and instruments in ergonomics adapted to the 
Indonesian versions. Hence, a systematic literature review was conducted to fill the gap. The review focused on 
understanding the adaptation approach, validity, and reliability of the methods and instruments. The literature review 
found six papers that reported adapted methods and instruments in ergonomics, including Rating Scale Mental Effort, 
System Usability Scale, User Experience Questionnaire, Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, Chatbot Usability 
Questionnaire, and me CUE 2.0 Framework. The adaptation approach to determine the Indonesian versions of the 
methods and instruments followed partial or complete stages of cross-cultural adaptation guidelines.  It was found that 
several adapted instruments were valid, with the levels being “excellent” to “good.” Furthermore, the reliability 
assessment indicated that several instruments have Cronbach alpha values ranging from 0.7 to 0.8, indicating that 
some of the adapted versions were reliable. Since limited methods and instruments were adapted to Indonesian 
versions, cross-cultural adaptation attempts have to be continued to ease the ergonomics implementations in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Ergonomics assessments can be performed through direct measurement, self-reports, and observational methods. 
Direct measurement utilizes sensors for gathering physical or cognitive changes of the workers. While some 
technologies are required for ergonomics studies using this approach, only pen and paper are required for the other 
two methods and instruments. The first approach consists of self-reports that rely on workers’ opinions to gather 
information for ergonomics studies. The second category is observational methods, requiring raters to assess the jobs 
based on standardized and validated paper-based instruments (David 2005; Li and Buckle 1999).  
Indonesian researchers and practitioners commonly undergo ergonomics assessments utilizing paper-based methods 
and instruments categorized as self-reports and observational methods. The intensive utilization could be pushed due 
to the flexibility, the less required training, as well as the minimum required investment of the approaches. (David 
2005; Li and Buckle 1999). 
Some of the paper-based methods and instruments categorized as observational methods include Rapid Office Strain 
Assessment (ROSA), Strain Index (SI), and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). Erliana and Zaphira (2019) 
utilized ROSA to perform ergonomics assessments among office workers of a fertilizer company who use computers 
on a daily basis. Restuputri (2018) used the English version of the Strain Index (SI) to assess the ergonomic risk among 
batik workers. Another assessment method widely utilized to assess some jobs of Indonesian small and medium 
enterprises is the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) (Joanda and Suhardi 2017; Restuputri 2017; and Rizkya et 
al. 2018). While ROSA, SI, and REBA are widely used for undergoing the ergonomics assessments, the self-reports, 
e.g., Nordic Body Map (NBM), are widely utilized in ergonomics studies for assessing the musculoskeletal symptoms
of Indonesian small and medium enterprises' workers (Sofyan and Amir 2019).
One of the main challenges while utilizing the paper-based methods and instruments is the language barrier since most 
Indonesians do not speak English in a daily basis. This could happen due the methods and instruments were primarily

were reliable. Since only six methods and instruments were cross-culturally adapted to Indonesian versions, some 
opportunity exists to adapt other widely utilized ergonomics methods, such as Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA).

Abstract 
Over the last decade, a dramatic transform happened in information sources and their use in the digital era. Social 
media networks have brought a new way of expressing the sentiments of individuals. The matter went beyond being 
an expression of separate opinions of some individuals, as companies, official institutions and various organizations 
have pages on the communication sites through which they share various developments, products, opinions, and 
sometimes even official decisions. Social media become a medium with a huge amount of information where users 
can view the opinion of other users that are classified into different sentiment classes and are increasingly growing as 
a key factor in decision making. Twitter is a microblogging service built to describe what is happening anywhere 
worldwide, at any moment. It’s a fascinating forum for more than 500 million messages per day from about 1.3 billion 
people. Twitter data is short, specific, and easily accessible, that’s why it has become one of the best sources for 
sentimental analysis and knowledge discovery by data streams mining. One of the major issues that affect data streams 
mining is that the underlying distribution of data may change over time leading to the phenomenon of concept drift. 
Identification and handling concept-drift in Data Streams is present area of interest. In this study, we present an 
approach to explore and understand the concept drift occurring in Twitter data streams. Two machine learning 
technique Naive Bayes Classifier and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Classifier were applied on more than 
300K tweets from International Technology Companies, and to detect / understand concept drift and specify whether 
concept drift in a technology area is a radical or an incremental innovation.

1. Introduction
The acceleration in the volume of data produced daily is growing constantly due to the increased number of 
applications that generate big amounts of data at a great velocity, such as the content and reactions on social media, 
advertisements click, shares, transactions, streaming content, the Internet of Things (IoT) realms and so much more. 
The need to deal with huge amounts of data has motivated the research in the field of data mining aiming to generate 
knowledge from data, which can be translated as discovering of new and non-trivial patterns, relations, and trends in 
data useful to the user (Schuh, et al. 2019) 
Over the last decade, a dramatic transform happened in information sources and their use in the digital era. Social 
media networks have brought a new way of expressing the sentiments of individuals. The matter went beyond being 
an expression of separate opinions of some individuals as companies, official institutions and various organizations 
have pages on the communication sites through which they share various developments, products, opinions, and 
sometimes even official decisions. Social media become a medium with a huge amount of information where users 
can view the opinion of other users that are classified into different sentiment classes and are increasingly growing as

substantial innovation by firms. Yet, we still lack insight into how these innovations are communicated (Fredstrom, 
et al. 2022). 
 
This study tried to spot the light on understanding the changes that happens in technology through machine learning 
tools and introduce new reading to these changes as innovative change, which may lead to new products or 
technologies. Such an approach can provide important tools for technology companies, market analysts and 
researchers in this field to get an insightful forecast of the trends of future technologies and products. 
7. Future Work: 
This study presented an approach to understand the change in technology (innovation) based on tweets. The study 
focused on 270K tweets of ten technology companies, the focus was on analyzing the sentiment of these tweets and 
detecting/identifying the concept drift that occurred and studying the results of this drift / change to predict the pattern 
of results that could cause the deviation of the concept, which can in turn give some insights about future technological 
change or innovation. 
 
The future work may include one or more of the following: 
1. To use wider data set by increasing the number of tweets and the number of companies to expand the data set 
and include some accounts that usually focus on technology news and latest updates and inventions. 
2. In our study, we depended on one commonly used algorithm for text classification (Naïve Bais) and another state 
of art algorithm in the field, which is XGBoost classifier, it worth to include other algorithms such as artificial 
neural network (ANN), Random Forests and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to compare the accuracy of the 
results and choose the best performance algorithm(s). 
3. In our study, we chose the Error rate drift detection method, and there are many other similar methods that can 
be used for drift detection. Future work may also consider using different methods and comparing the results. 
4. Lastly, Re-perform the study depending on the Patent Records/Documents as new data set for the research and 
compare the results with tweets to better understand the technology changes or innovation.

Abstract 
The intellectual capital disclosure is the additional information presented by the company which includes human 
capital, structural capital, and relational capital to reduce asymmetric information and use the indicators of intellectual 
capital. Banks play a significant role in driving the national economy because they are involved in all economic 
activities, including the primary driver of Indonesian GDP. Consumption, investment, and export and import activities 
are the primary drivers of the national economy. Banking has major role in these three activities and also serves as an 
intermediary institution that provides financing for both consumption and production. The purpose of this study is to 
determine the impact of gender diversity, profitability, and leverage on the disclosure of intellectual capital in banking 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange between 2017 and 2020. The population for this study is the 
company banks listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2017 to 2020. Purposive sampling is used in this study 
and obtained thirty data samples. In this study, descriptive statistical analysis and panel data analysis were used as 
analysis techniques. According to the study's findings, the keywords gender diversity, profitability, and leverage all 
have an impact on intellectual capital at same time. For the 2017-2020 period, gender diversity and profitability have 
no influence on intellectual property in banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange, whereas leverage 
has a negative influence on intellectual capital in banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

1. Introduction
Intellectual capital is an intangible asset tied to a company that can assist in managing and running the company's 
business in order to compete with other competitors, so the management and the intellectual capital disclosure are 
important for companies as a form of strategy that can increase the added value for the company. In addition, the 
intellectual capital disclosure can build the investors’ trust in the additional information disclosed by the company as 
a source of decision making for investors, which has an impact on the investors’ trust in the company. Intellectual 
capital disclosure can reduce asymmetric information, so the greater the disclosure of intellectual capital, the greater 
the disclosure of intellectual capital becomes a source of additional information for investors and the company's 
strategy to increase added value (Anna et al., 2018).

results also support previous studies conducted by Barokah (2019), Ma’in et al. (2018), and Naimah & Mukti (2019) 
which stated leverage affected intellectual capital disclosure in a negative direction. This can happen because the 
company prioritizes using company assets to pay off debt rather than managing it into intellectual capital so that 
intellectual capital disclosure is not optimal. 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations
6.1 Conclusion
The result and discussion of this study, lead the following conclusions.
1. The independent variables, namely gender diversity, profitability, and leverage simultaneously affected on
intellectual capital disclosure of banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2017-2020.
2. Gender diversity did not affect intellectual capital disclosure of banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock
Exchange (IDX) in 2017-2020.
3. Profitability did not affect intellectual capital disclosure of banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock
Exchange (IDX) in 2017-2020.
4. Leverage, in a negative direction, partially affected intellectual capital disclosure of banking companies listed on
the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2017-2020.
6.2 Recommendations 
This research is expected to add information in the field of accounting, especially intellectual capital. Furthermore, 
the company is expected to pay attention to its leverage because leverage is one of the factors that affect the increase 
in intellectual capital disclosure.

Abstract 
The motor automobile rental industry provides entrepreneurs with substantial revenues and customers with several 
advantages. Consumers may utilize the car whenever and wherever it is required without incurring maintenance, 
insurance, or other expenditures. However, this vehicle rental industry frequently involves a number of other parties 
in automotive vehicle rental transactions, which has the effect of raising the overall operational expenses charged to 
entrepreneurs or customers. With private blockchain technology administered by businesses, automobile owners, and 
insurance companies, a car owner no longer need a third party in order to rent his vehicle. Smart contracts may be 
used by renters and automobile owners to conduct transactions with mutually agreed upon terms. Blockchain makes 
data management simpler. The automobile owner's whole trip history is stored on the blockchain, allowing auto 
insurance firms to make more accurate evaluations. Using smart contracts makes the process of submitting insurance 
claims quicker and more precise. A team of mechanics merely examines the most recent automotive data recorded on 
the blockchain to determine the vehicle's condition. Car-related financial transactions are also streamlined by 
blockchain technology. Various subscription services, such as automobile insurance, parking rental, toll road 
payments, and vehicle inspections, may be automated with smart contracts, and payments can be done with 
cryptocurrency, saving time and money. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to assist automobile owners in 
renting out their vehicles utilizing blockchain technology. Observation is used as a qualitative research tool to discover 
difficulties in the automobile rental industry. A literature review is performed to identify alternative information 
technology-based solutions.

Abstract 
 
Automated language translator has wide potential applications especially in plural language countries.  Study on low-
resource languages is very crucial such as making information accessible to people live in less-connected and 
technologically underdeveloped areas, making more digital content available, and making Natural Language 
Processing models more accessible to low-resource languages. Vanilla transformer model has achieved excellent 
performance to address machine translation task. Despite its high performance, the model contains adjustable 
hyperparameters such as the number of encoder-decoder stack depth. This paper presents exploration results on the 
effect of encoder-decoder stack depth to performance of the vanilla transformer model as a neural machine translation 
of Bahasa Indonesia-Sundanese languages. The empiric results of fine-tuning a pretrained vanilla transformer model 
showed that average performances of vanilla transformer model with 2, 4, or 6 stack depth are higher than average 
performance of the model with 8 stack depth. The highest performances achieved by the transformer model with 2 
stack depth are: 0.99 average training accuracy, 0.97 average validation accuracy, and 0.99 average testing similarity. 
Interestingly, according to non-parameteric significance test results with 95% confidence interval, there is no 
siginificant difference on performance of vanilla transformer model with 2, 4, 6, and 8 stack depths. These results 
showed that using vanilla transformer with less number of depth stack is favourable for machine translation as it has 
less number of model parameters but it gives acceptable model performance. From experimentation results, it showed 
that vanilla transformer model with 2 stack depth is potential to be explored further.

Abstract 
Water studies in the scope of agriculture have adopted Internet of Things (IoT) to become a new big data collection 
methodology. This research aimed to deliver a method in water quality categorization. The research methodology for 
this study used a combination of water quality parameter measurement with two integrated IoT water sensors (turbidity 
and TDS sensor) and manual categorization. Based on the water categorization standard, the measured turbidity and 
TDS were matched to one water category. In the sensor precision test, the integrated IoT water sensors showed 94.40% 
for the turbidity sensor and 97.95% for the TDS sensor. Compared to other water samples, drinking water was 
successfully distinguished with valid categorization. Other water samples namely groundwater, tea, and coffee showed 
invalid remarks.

1. Introduction
As a substantial natural resource, water is facing risks that can be described as scarcity, pollution, and contamination. 
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) stated that the increase of water risks is not only caused by an environmental factor such 
as lack of precipitation or unmanageable water resources, but also the complex interaction with other domains such 
as industries (Orr et al. 2009). Schweitzer and Noblet defined that water pollution and contamination in the form of 
biological, chemical, and physical are threatening the safe-consumable water industry even though many initiatives 
have been established to protect water quality (Schweitzer and Noblet 2018).

Abstract 
Freshwater lobsters have a high mortality rate due to poor water quality or cannibalism between lobsters. In the 
lobster cultivation process, the process of monitoring water quality and feeding is done manually so that it has 
problems in the monitoring and feeding process that is carried out at night because lobsters are nocturnal animals. 
This study uses freshwater crayfish with the type of red claw with a total of 20 lobster seeds in 2 ponds with an 
Internet of Things-based system and integrated web monitoring and without an IoT system. This study aims to 
build a system that can increase the survival of freshwater crayfish using an IoT-based system called Smart Lobster 
Feeder. The analytical methods used include Observation, Literature Study, and Interview. The development 
method used is the waterfall method with 6 stages of the process, namely Planning, Analysis, Design, 
Implementation, Testing, and Verification. This research uses the ESP8266 microcontroller, ESP32 Cam, water 
salinity sensor, pH sensor, temperature sensor, ultrasonic, and website monitoring. The results in this study 
obtained a sensor error rate value of < 1.5%, UAT results of 94%, automatic feeding according to the specified 
hour, and a survival rate of 100%. From the study results, it can be concluded that the IoT system can increase the 
survival rate of freshwater crayfish, has a sensor error rate that is by established standards and is a feasible system 
to implement.

1. Introduction
IoT is a system architecture consisting of hardware, software, and the Web (Prihatmoko, 2016). and society to 
become more efficient. IoT is an important element to support the Indonesian government's roadmap of Making 
Indonesia 4.0 (Jamaludin, et al., 2020) IoT technology is one of the solutions made to restore the economy in 
Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the fisheries sector. Based on data from the Central 
Statistics Agency (BPS) (Direktorat Jendral Perikanan Tangkap, 2021) the value of the Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) of Fisheries in the Second Quarter of 2021 is IDR 188 trillion or 2.83 percent of the value of National 
GDP. This GDP value increased compared to the first quarter of Rp. 109.9 trillion or 2.77 percent of the value of 
the National GDP. One of the biggest contributors to the increasing value of fisheries GDP in Indonesia is 
freshwater crayfish aquaculture.  
Freshwater lobster (genus Cherax) comes from Australia, Papua New Guinea, and Irian Jaya, with different 
species. One of the species with the highest economic value isCherax quadricarinatus (red claw) habitat Cherax 
is shallow freshwater, with a muddy substrate and plenty of crevices and cavities for hiding. Freshwater lobster 
has a high mortality rate. Deaths are mainly caused by poor water quality or being eaten by other lobsters during 
molting. As in other fish farming, disease prevention is carried out by keeping the water and ponds clean, 
providing adequate nutrition, and maintaining the cleanliness of equipment related to freshwater crayfish, such as 
hiding places, shelters, and the natural food provided by the lobsters. 
Following the business opportunities for freshwater crayfish cultivation in Indonesia, the author wants to innovate 
by making freshwater crayfish cultivation based on the Internet of Things to provide convenience in monitoring 
water quality and the survival rate of freshwater crayfish. Currently, water quality monitoring is carried out by

5. Conclusion
Based on the results of the analysis of the research conducted, the design and implementation of the Smart Lobster 
Feeder can Wednesdayse the effectiveness and efficiency of freshwater crayfish cultivation by helping field 
officers to feed automatically at night and during the day. This system also helps officers to monitor the water 
quality of the lobster pond to determine the schedule for draining the pond following the freshwater crayfish pond 
water quality standards. Smart Lobster Feeder works by displaying the data read on the sensor to the dashboard 
IoT monitoring that has been made, starting from the DS18B20 sensor, TDS sensor, pH sensor, an ultrasonic 
sensor. the dashboard that has been created will also display the state of the pool directly using the ESP32-CAM 
that has been set to view the condition of the pool in real time. The results of the system implementation carried 
out for 2 weeks also showed the Survival Rate of lobster ponds using the IoT system had a higher level of 15% 
when compared to the Survival Rate from lobster ponds without an IoT system. This shows that ponds with IoT 
systems have maintained water quality because draining is carried out if the existing parameters increase and the 
scheduled lobster feeding hours every 00:00 WIB and 12:00 WIB helps to prevent the occurrence of feed deposits 
in the lobster pond. 
Based on this research, the author has several suggestions such as using an ESP32 CAM which only has VGA 
resolution so that the results of the video displayed have poor quality. The suggestion from this is to use an IP 
Camera or IP CCTV that is connected to the internet to produce much better video quality.

Abstract 
This research provided a solution to raise awareness of Indonesian folklore to the early working age group (15–24 
according to indexmundi.com). To confront the lack of awareness of Indonesian folklore, authors developed a game 
that revolves around Indonesian folklore named Eden Eternal which mainly tell the tale of Bandung Bondowoso on 
Candi (temple) Prambanan folklore. The purpose behind Eden Eternal is to make games that fun and educational at 
the same time. The game is developed using Agile-Extreme Programming methodology and Nielsen-Molich Heuristic 
to have user interface (UI) that is friendly towards users and provide meaningful experiences (user experiences [UX]) 
while they are playing the game. The implementation of Eden Eternal shows a positive outcome. 95.45% of the 
respondents participated in the post questionnaires provided with perfect scores and show more knowledgeable and 
interest towards Indonesian’s folktales.

1. Introduction
Indonesia, the home for 273,523,621 Indonesians located off the coast of Southeast Asia in the Indian and Pacific 
Oceans (World Bank 2021). Indonesia is an archipelago that lies across the equator and spans a distance equivalent to 
one-eight of Earth’s circumference, from Sabang to Merauke (Mustakim et al. 2020). Indonesia stated to be the most 
populous country in Southeast Asia and fourth in the world in the early 21st century (Encyclopædia Britannica, inc. 
2021). 
As one of the largest country, Indonesia possesses a lot of cultures as well but there are some in which are long 
forgotten by most Indonesians such as, folklore. Folklore can be defined as the people’s story and as a statement of a 
group of human’s culture that tells the story of various events related to them directly or indirectly (Taufinaa and 
Syarif 2020, Munirah 2014). Folklore is usually passed down through word of mouth but nowadays many folklores 
are written down in books in order to prevent extinction from the society (Tasliyatun 2021). 
The young generation is less interested on folklore due to be deem as irrelevant anymore in this stage of globalization 
era. It is believed that folklore lose its former glory due to characters that are most likely too old fashioned for current 
generation. Even it is said that the young generation lose its interest on reading or hearing folklore which usually 
relevant to forest, animal, and fantasy world. The young generation are too accustomed with the modern life that they 
felt it was funny for characters in folklore to ride horses and in their mind, it is believed that folklore character need 
to ride jets as Damiri Mahmud, a literature from Medan said (Antaranews.com 2021). 
Game comes in various meaning but according to Oxford Dictionary, game is a form of activity that people do to have 
fun, often has rules, and can win or lose. Game also comes in various form, there are games that can be play socially 
and there is game that can be play using electronic device. People can enjoy while playing the video games. There are 
also a lot of benefits that can be taken by playing the video games. 
Based on the young generation issue regarding to the folklore, authors decided to develop a game dedicated to promote 
Indonesian’s folklore to encounter the problem. The game, named Eden Eternal, mainly tell the tale of Bandung

4.6 Questionnaire Results 
Questionnaires can be a tool to measure the UX of the game. Questionnaires was given to the testers (respondents) to 
find out the results of the experiment. A series set of questions according to Indonesian’s folklore that was in the game 
were given to the play tester. Based on the pre-questionnaire, 59.09% of the respondents shows zero or no knowledge 
of Indonesian’s folklore and only 0.04% of the respondent know Bandung Bondowoso. After the respondents played 
the game, they show positive results and shows more knowledgeable towards Indonesian’s folklore. Table 1 shows 
the total number of respondents that correctly answers and the total number of respondents that answer not correctly 
according to questions number out of 22 respondents. There are 128 questions can be answered correctly by the 
respondents and it is around 21 respondents (95.45%). Based on this result, it shows that Eden Eternal helps the 
respondents to have a better knowledge of Indonesian’s folklore, especially Bandung Bondowoso.

5. Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper shows that game can be a tool to attract interest on Indonesian’s folktales to people in a fun way. Eden 
Eternal was developed along this line and was allowed to provide more knowledge about Candi Prambanan 
Indonesian’s folktales. Post questionnaires was given towards the user at the end of the playtest in order to provide 
the results of the application. 95.45% of the respondents participated in the post questionnaires can achieved a perfect 
score. Furthermore, respondents show more knowledgeable and interest towards Indonesian’s folktales. 
 
Future work is planned to make Eden Eternal better. Authors planned to collect the input of respondents from the post 
questionnaire and try to implement it unto the game. Authors would also love to flesh out the game more to enhance

Abstract 
This research compares the level of media literacy, social stigma, and the correlation between media literacy and social 
stigma in Indonesia and Japan, in order to know the right measures to eliminate the social stigma, as one of the 
inequality that occured in the pandemic. The research question proposed in this study include: 1) Media literacy 
correlation with social stigma towards the infected person, 2) The severerity of social stigma towards the infected 
person, and 3) How to solve the social stigma caused by social media in times of the current digital society. In the era 
of pandemic, people are not only fear the disease, but also the social stigma it brings. With that in mind, we would 
like to see whether or not the media literacy have any significance towards the occurence of the social stigma. In this 
research, we found that people with low media literacy have a bigger chance to have a high social stigma towards the 
person with COVID-19. The result of this research could also be implemented in the government polocy making to 
prevent the ostracization of a certain group related to COVID-19.

1. Introduction
In the early 2020, the world was shocked by the spread of a disease caused by a virus known as COVID-19, which is 
a disease caused by a corona virus that infects the respiratory system andcausing respiratory failure (Abdilah 2020). 
COVID-19 is a new virus that is related to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus and several types 
of viruses that cause the common flu (WHO 2020). Furthermore, the spreading of hoax in social media caused the rise 
of anxiety in the society that fuelled discrimination and attacks against vulnerable people with COVID-19, which 
identified through the public health activity of contact tracing and ended up being blamed and compared to criminals 
by the other civilians (Balfadal and Santoso 2021; Sotgiu and Dobler 2020). Yet, the people with greater income, 
education, social support, and good mental health have been shown to be less worried and be less likely to stigmatize

6. Conclusion
Even though the majority of university student from Indonesia & Japan have a high media literacy and the social 
stigma is not that high, the possibility of having a high social stigma among the people with low media literacy is 
considered high, so the measures to eliminate social stigma must be implemented thoroughly. Furthermore, the 
government must have a mutual interaction with the public in order to have a systematic communication that could 
prevent the misinformation regarding COVID-19, so that the people would have a right perception about what should 
be done for the disease prevention without causing the social stigma towards the victim / sufferer of COVID-19.

Abstract 
Intellectual capital is becoming more influential in a competitive business environment, especially during the 
acceleration of digitalization transformation caused by the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study 
aims to examine the influence of intellectual capital and its components (HC, SC, and RC) on financial performance 
in profitability (ROA and ROE) and market attraction(MBV) of the banking industry in Indonesia during the COVID-
19 pandemic. The study employs Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method to analyze data panel regression consisting of 
50 samples from the Indonesia Stock Exchange ranging from 2020 to 2021. The results indicate that intellectual capital 
has positive and significant effects on company profitability. However, there is no support for interactions between 
intellectual capital and market attractiveness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Human capital efficiency 
(HCE) and capital employed efficiency (CEE) have the highest effect on company profitability. This study answers 
Soetanto and Lim’s (2019) call to examine the Indonesian banking sector, while previous research on intellectual 
capital in financial performance primarily focused on the manufacturing sector. This research also enriches intellectual 
capital literature on the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
In this 4.0 digital era, all human activities have been facilitated and supported by sophisticated technology. The 
evolution of digitalization has altered all aspects of people's daily lives, including the financial division. Wang et al. 
(2021) stated that the prevalence of innovation and technology in the financial sector is undeniable. One apparent 
impact is the use of data to improve product quality which data can be utilized as a bank asset to design a predictive 
analysis using today's technological sophistication. Research by Kimand Davidson (2004) reveals that high levels of 
Information Technology (IT) banks tend to lessen salary costs and improve market share and profitability. With that 
said, the efficient usage of IT strategy can enhance the bank's competitive advantage. The impact of IT continues to 
influence bank performance in this modern era where technology is essential in the banking industry, especially in 
dynamic scenarios. Roy and Thangaraj's (2020) research outcome indicate that prudent spending on technology will 
boost sales, grow employee efficiency, decrease operating costs and build a cordial competitive environment within 
the banks. 
The spread of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic throughout the world also has an impact on 
accelerating digital optimization. Consequently, the banking industry must adapt to the transition of new partnerships 
or collaborations in the digital economy ecosystem by modifying business models and technologies accordant to 
customer demands. Companies must be able to take advantage of their capabilities and assets to respond to this need. 
This feat is achievable by optimizing the intellectual capital owned by the company. Stewart (1994) defines intellectual 
capital as intangible resources in the form of knowledge available to the company that ultimately brings future 
economic benefits by developing innovation and competitive advantage in the company's field of business. One study 
found that ""Intangible resources such as R&D, relationships, skills, and innovation capacity, increasingly represent 
the foundation of competitive advantage of firms and superior business performance"" (Lev et al., 2005). Therefore, 
good management of intangible assets and integrating these assets into the company's strategy will result in a more

Abstract 
Information engineering strategies play a vital role in agriculture 4.0 to increase the product value, one of which is 
sugarcane commodities. Sugarcane production estimation has traditionally been practiced by recording data on a paper 
note. The recorded data were subsequently transferred to a computer by a sugar factory plantation assistant. Errors in 
calculating or inputting data into a computer can occur, storage space for paper documents is also limited, and farmers 
cannot independently calculate their production potential. Therefore, our study aims to create an android-based 
sugarcane production application as an information engineering strategy to predict sugarcane yields by farmers and 
plantation assistants. This study used the waterfall method with the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) model. 
Observations were performed by collecting data. Interviews were conducted with plantation assistants to produce 
related information on how to calculate sugarcane estimation. The analysis was carried out by examining the 
relationship between observation and interview data as a tool for developing an application interface and algorithm 
system design. The application makes it easier for farmers to estimate production potential, allowing them to get data 
on sugarcane productivity during harvest. Hence, the sugar factory could guarantee the quantity and quality of 
sugarcane raw materials.

1. Introduction
Information on increasing commodity production is significant in the current era to be accessible to various elements 
of the agricultural community. An information engineering strategy is crucial in industrial revolution 4.0. countries 
(Davenport & Short, 1990). Indonesia has started implementing an industry 4.0 strategy and applying it to various 
development sectors, for example, agriculture 4.0 in the agroindustry. By putting it in a mobile application, all 
members of society, particularly smallholders in agriculture and plantations, will have simple access to an information 
system and management. Mobile application as an implementation strategy of information engineering can increase 
the big commodities production in Indonesia, especially sugarcane.

The interface design of the sugarcane farming application consisted of a login, dashboard, data list, input data, and 
results. The system executes the analysis process and displays the results of the data assessment when the column had 
been filled in. Data entry into the application field was operated directly by the user (farmer or plantation assistant), 
thereby reducing the weakness of the manual system. Therefore, an algorithm formula was needed in the estimation 
process to perform automated calculations in the process. As illustrated in Figure 5, the interface was created simply 
as a field with several columns. 
 
4. Conclusion 
An application was developed to calculate sugarcane production estimation based on an android mobile system. The 
application development used the waterfall method with the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) model and 
interface design that supports the sublime editor program making it easier for users to access android-based 
applications. Observations, interviews, and literature studies were employed as a requirement gathering process. 
Interviews with plantation assistants were conducted to gather information on how to estimate sugarcane production. 
The application and interface were designed based on observation and interview data. Advancements in technology, 
particularly in the information sector, make it easier for everyone to have access to the same information. Farmers 
could be used the application to predict production potential and collect data on sugarcane productivity throughout 
harvest. Hence, the quantity and quality of sugarcane raw materials could be guaranteed by the sugar factory. The 
mobile application was convenient for plantation practitioners (farmers and plantation assistants) to carry out a fast 
and precise assessment process.  
 
Future works, this application can be added with features that fulfill complete information about sugarcane plantation 
management. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data can be used to improve the performance and ability of this 
application.

Abstract 
Asian languages such as Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean have become popular among Indonesian youth, as more 
people are interested in acquiring the foreign languages. However, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, face-to-
face learning approach has been restricted. This leaves a window of opportunity for online platforms to fill the gap by 
providing the means to learn Asian languages for the Indonesian young generation who tend to consume pop culture 
products from China, Japan, and Korea. This article examines the experience of Indonesian youth in learning the 
mentioned Asian languages using online platforms during pandemic times. An online survey conducted in March 
2022 with a sample of study consists of 310 research participants aged 16 to 30 years old, and 14 of them agreed to 
take part in the interview sessions. The findings suggest that the Indonesian young population continue to show 
substantial interest in learning Asian languages, especially Korean (85%), followed by Japanese (68%) and Mandarin 
(51%). Around 84% of participants were satisfied using online platforms to learn foreign languages. Nevertheless, 
learning foreign languages online is not always smooth sailing, as internet connection often hinders learners to 
maximize their excellent experience with the process.

1. Introduction
According to Babble’s Top 10 Most Spoken Languages in the World in 2021, Mandarin and Japanese are listed at the 
first and the ninth spot, with 1.3 billion and 126 million native speakers respectively. On the other hand, Korean is 
also on the rise in terms of popularity since the huge success of the Korean wave phenomenon (Pickles 2022). These 
three Asian languages are also quite popular among the Indonesian young generation with movies and soap operas, 
among other pop culture products, from China, Japan, and Korea being consumed on a regular basis (Blanco 2020). 
However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has affected how people are learning foreign languages, including Asian 
languages.  
With physical distancing policies in place, many people are now turning to e-learning mode to embark or to continue 
their learning journey. Online learning or usually referred to as e-learning is a learning technique based on information 
and communication technology that requires assistance from a computer system (Chang 2020). Online learning 
includes all learning methods that are supported by electronic media, especially through the internet, web, and 
computers that involve knowledge and skills (Kopylova 2018). These elements of online learning support distance 
education and nurture a virtual learning environment that is more student-centered, more effective and innovative 
(Nedeva and Dimova 2010). 
1.1 Objectives 
Against the background above, this paper aims to examine the experience of Indonesian youth in learning Asian 
languages (Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean) using online platforms during pandemic times. The findings will shed 
some light on their perceptions toward the importance of learning the languages and the experiences in using online 
platforms.

Our interviewees suggest that online platforms succeeded in increasing their knowledge regarding vocabulary and 
pronunciation using the correct intonation. Additionally, during pandemic times where face-to-face learning has been 
very limited, online platforms can be used as an alternative tool in learning foreign languages. However, some 
participants expressed different experiences in using online channels in learning foreign languages: 
Online platforms give you knowledge about foreign languages, but if you wish to master it, you cannot rely 
on online channels. (P3) 
…more to add insight because learning through online channels is used while mobile. Therefore, if you are 
willing to master the language, you have to concentrate more. (P14) 
Online channels can indeed be used to learn foreign languages. However, if we want to master a foreign 
language, we still have to learn using a textbook or take a course followed by regular practice. In my opinion, 
learning through online channels is just for fun, not for mastering the language (P4) 
The narratives above indicate that online platforms are sufficient in adding knowledge about foreign languages, but 
not to a point where one can master it. Since learning a foreign language requires strong knowledge and adequate 
understanding of grammar and conjunctions, the process cannot be achieved merely via online platforms. And as most 
users assert that they are using online channels as a means to learn language in a fun and interesting way, this highlights 
the feature of the utilization which is to fill their spare time. Further study is required to examine how and why the 
interest to learn foreign languages using online platforms may fluctuate, especially when the pandemic is over. 
5. Conclusion
Our study has demonstrated that the current pandemic does not deter Indonesian youth from continuing learning Asian 
languages. In fact, the physical distancing policies put in place by the government stimulate people to use online 
platforms as the approach offers flexibility and access to the learning materials at any time. This paper unpacks the 
experiences of Indonesian youth in learning Asian languages (Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean) via online platforms 
during pandemic times using online surveys and interviews. The findings suggest that most respondents in this study 
are very keen to learn Korean, compared to the other two Asian languages, and their main motivation was to gain new 
language skills and to prepare for their future career endeavors. About 84% of research participants were satisfied and 
very satisfied with learning Asian languages using online platforms. Yet, the process of learning foreign languages 
online is not always smooth sailing, as internet connection often hinders learners to maximize their excellent 
experience with the process. This paper contributes to the literature on Asian foreign languages and the interest of 
Indonesian youth in utilizing online platforms to learn them. On another note, technology advancement such as social 
media is useful in helping creating gender parity and social inclusion (Prihatini 2020).

Abstract 
The window is one of the most important aspects of a building. It aims to obtain good lighting and meet the 
requirements for Indoor Air Quality. A restroom is a place where most surfaces are wet, and it causes the relative 
humidity to become high. As a result, lighting must be considered in this space. The men's toilet on the second floor 
of the Bina Nusantara University campus in Malang is the subject of this research. Interviews with building operators, 
cleaners and firsthand surveys of the location were also undertaken. The author used the results of interviews to help 
specify the ventilation system. The author utilizes a lux meter to measure the lighting layout. According to the findings, 
this toilet uses mechanical ventilation in the form of an exhaust fan. On the other hand, this area employs downlights 
that meet lighting standards in terms of brightness and color temperature selection in the artificial lighting system. In 
the current situation, there is a shortage of energy efficiency. As a result, this study offers a method for preserving 
electrical energy. This study uses an Arduino Mega and several sensors to help automate the operation of these 
electrical devices.

1. Introduction
The restroom is a high-humidity room because it contains clean and unclean water. The toilet's indoor air quality 
(IAQ) is frequently contaminated by pollutants derived from human excreta (Zhang et al., 2021). Polluted air can 
contribute to the development of respiratory infections, asthma, and lung cancer (He et al., 2021). Mainly if the air in 
the toilet is foul, forcing inhabitants to avoid going to the bathroom, which results in chronic diseases and psychiatric 
problems (Lin, 2021). Ventilation is required to remedy the harmful air in the room. Natural ventilation is one method 
of overcoming poor indoor air quality, as trapped air in the toilet can escape via the window or doorway. Additionally, 
this natural ventilation provides energy-saving benefits (Lin, 2021). 
Natural ventilation is generally created by placing a window against one wall. If natural ventilation is not possible, 
mechanical ventilation can be applied, such as placing an exhaust fan on the ceiling. The exhaust fan can remove hot 
temperatures in the room, high humidity, and odours due to ammonia. In addition to removing unhealthy air, the 
exhaust fan will automatically draw clean air outside. 
In addition to providing natural ventilation, Windows can also give natural lighting (Yu, 2021) in the restroom. 
Because the toilet is wet, lighting is needed. Slipping is one of the incidents that occur in the toilet. Therefore, 
insufficient lighting in the toilet might threaten individuals who access it (Şahin & Erkal, 2017). Slipping has serious 
repercussions, as it can result in a head accident. Some post-stroke patients and the elderly are considerably more

It is currently a prototype study, and the results have not been compared before and after the device was installed. 
However, in terms of concept and operation, this instrument can provide energy efficiency by optimizing lighting and 
exhaust fans. According to Table 2 above, the lights only turn on when there are people present and when the needs 
of the space are met. While the exhaust fan does not run continuously, it operates following the sensor reading 
conditions, as shown in Table 3 above.  
 
5. Conclusion  
On the 2nd floor of the Bina Nusantara Malang campus, the lighting system for men's bathrooms has been installed 
according to standards. It may be seen from the lux meter measurement, which gives a value of 120-150 lux. This 
amount is based on the average value of 100-200 lux for public restrooms. Because natural ventilation is not available, 
this room has adopted mechanical ventilation by installing an exhaust fan type inline direct fan with a size of 450 
CMH in the ventilation system. This instrument can assist with the development of good IAQ in the toilet for the long-
term health of its users. 
 
By placing a PIR sensor at the entrance, this room has automated the lighting for energy savings. Even though there 
are still faults in the task, the presence of this technology is quite helpful. As a result, an ultrasonic sensor must be 
added to aid the PIR sensor's performance in controlling the lights, particularly in the cubicle area's automation. This 
sensor is used to determine how far an object is nearby. This sensor reading uses the toilet seat as a reference. The 
sensor will detect a change in the distance if something is blocking it. This amount is used to assume that sensors in 
the cubicle detect humans. As long as there are objects in the closet, this sensor is responsible for turning on the lights. 
 
The DHT22 temperature and humidity sensors aid in the automation of the exhaust fan, which operates continuously. 
If this sensor detects a number less than or greater than the standard, the exhaust fan is activated. The exhaust fan will 
only work if the humidity in the room is less than 40% or more than 50%, based on the average RH of the toilet, which 
is 40-50%. If the sensor detects a 40-50% humidity level, the machine will shut down immediately. As a result, the 
addition of these sensors can assist save electricity in the toilet by adjusting electronic equipment to the needs of the 
area. 
 
This research can be applied to buildings that utilize artificial lighting and ventilation in presenting table data for 
energy efficiency in future research. The following researcher can compare before and after this device is installed. It 
will indicate the percentage of efficiency savings.

Abstract 
This paper aims to study about the impact of  Merdeka Belajar — Kampus Merdeka for university students, a program 
held by the Ministry of Education and Culture of Indonesia to improve university students’ competencies with 
experiential learning, where students are not only improving in their hard skills according to their respective field of 
study, but also improving in their soft skills such as communication skills, collaborative and team working skills, 
cultural enrichment, social awareness, and so on, through various options of learning activities. Along with the 
advancement of technology, Merdeka Belajar – Kampus Merdeka's learning activities have undergone numerous 
developments, innovations, and changes to ensure that the learning activities deliver the expected results in light of 
current societal conditions. The research is done with systematic literature review, by concluding the results from prior 
research and writings. The existence of Merdeka Belajar — Kampus Merdeka for Indonesian university students has 
contributed to supporting various learning ways that can be chosen by students according to their interest and 
capabilities.

Education, Experiential Learning, Hard Skills, Soft Skills and Digital Age. 
1. Introduction
In today’s career environment, fresh graduates especially college graduates are expected to excel not only their hard 
skills according to their respective field of knowledge, but also their soft skills. Soft skill here means as skills related 
to one’s personality, attitudes, and work ethics. Both of these skills are required in order to prepare students to enter 
the industry (Fadilah et al. 2021). In order to excel in both, it is important for students to experience directly to real-
life problems, or also known as experiential learning. Experiential learning is a holistic model of a learning process 
where human learn and grow. It is a process of reconstructing knowledge through transforming one’s experience (Kolb 
1984). As students learned the fundamentals of their field of knowledge through learning-teaching process in their 
universities with their lecturers, it is important for them to also familiarize themselves on how to solve real-life 
problems that they are going to face once they graduate by experiencing it themselves. 
One of the most common practices of experiential learning is internship. Internships have become one of the crucial 
components in higher education. In these past few years, many universities have established internships as a mandatory 
program on part of a particular number of credits that needs to be fulfilled by students on a certain academic period 
(Nghia and Duyen 2019). Existing studies proved that joining internships helped students to develop the required 
professional skills, gain networks, accustom themselves to work life, and improve the quality of employee 
competencies (Kapareliotis et al. 2019). Even so, there are numbers of other activities besides internships that can 
help students prepare their skills in many different aspects. In order to encourage experiential learning to be held and 
experienced by all university students across Indonesia, the Ministry of Education and Culture created a program 
called Merdeka Belajar — Kampus Merdeka which aims to encourage university students to excel the skills that are 
useful for their preparation of entering their desired career path.

a chance to discover the life outside their daily lives. Living outside their usual environment for a few months allows 
them to think outside the box and raise their awareness on the life in rural areas. Through community service program 
also, every process that will be done will contribute to students’ self-development. By experiencing life in new 
environment, interacted with the locals, organizing development programs in the area, community service program 
gives students experiences that is difficult to obtain by solely depending on teaching-learning activities in university 
(Wulandari et al. 2020). However, with no synergy between theoretical and practical, community service program 
will not do much to contribute in developing rural areas. It usually causes either students’ unwillingness to complete 
the process and no significant improvements can be seen in the related area. It may affect universities’ reputation 
negatively since the program isn’t working effectively (Syardiansah 2019). 
 
In the era of technology, there are unimaginable changes that have affected many parts of life, including education 
(Escueta et al. 2017). Technology has removed the barrier of learning in many ways and has changed the way learning 
activities are carried out. For example, in a study conducted by (Nurdyansyah et al. 2017), technology has become an 
important resource of teaching-learning activities, balanced with the preparation and the understanding of educators 
regarding the usage of technology tools. Digital learning media such as interactive videos and digital courses has 
drifted the conventional in-class learning method, widening the possibilities of learning without time and place 
limitations (Yadav et al. 2018). Similar things also happened to the way the learning activities within Merdeka Belajar 
— Kampus Merdeka is done nowadays, also due to Covid-19 pandemic that strikes worldwide, amplifies the role of 
technology in carrying education activities despite facing lots of limitations. Internships, teaching-learning activities 
such as tutoring along with independent study and project, and research are possible to be done through web 
conferences such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Classroom (Sazanova and Morozova 2022). Voluntary acts 
and rural area development programs provided by education institutions are no longer limited to the traditional 
interaction with the society in need, it is also possible to be done through online volunteering platforms (Trautwein et 
al. 2020).  
 
5. Conclusion 
Merdeka Belajar — Kampus Merdeka, including all of the learning activity options within it, aims to improve 
university students’ competencies, both in hard skills as well as in soft skills through experiential learning, according 
to their respective fields of study. Each of the learning activities has provided different ways to improve students’ 
skills in various aspects to prepare them after they graduate from university. From real-life industry experiences, 
further study paths, to directly contributing in society development, currently the existence of Merdeka Belajar — 
Kampus Merdeka has supported Indonesian university students to discover a lot of learning possibilities outside their 
day-to-day teaching-learning activities in their classes. 
 
As a follow up, future research might focus on observing more of the students’ experience of each learning activity 
thoroughly to help us know better what aspects of the program can be improved to achieve the optimal learning 
experience for future students who will undergo an activity within Merdeka Belajar — Kampus Merdeka. In a fast-
changing world like we are experiencing today and along with pandemic that still affects majority of life aspects, 
including in education and industry, future research will also focus on developing ideas on how technology can support 
Merdeka Belajar — Kampus Merdeka to open bigger possibilities in the future that can reach more university students 
in Indonesia.

Abstract 
Countries in the world have been trying to encourage digital diplomacy, using social media such as Twitter. The use 
of Twitter as a diplomatic tool is known as Twiplomacy. Twitter has been widely used by governments in many 
countries as well as diplomatic officials to gather information and enhance the country's international image. Thus, 
the Indonesian government encourages diplomatic officials to actively contribute to the utilization of Twitter. Our 
paper focuses on the role of Indonesian female ambassadors in utilizing Twitter as a diplomatic medium. Where, this 
paper uses a data collection consists of the Twitter accounts of Indonesian female ambassadors as of 12 February 
2021, using descriptive analysis of the extent to which Indonesian female ambassadors can actively contribute to the 
use of Twitter. Our data shows that, although Indonesian female ambassadors have not yet fully used Twitter, some 
of them have begun to realize the importance of optimizing Twiplomacy. For the level of engagement, we found that 
there were differences and similarities for each ambassador's account, where the difference was seen in the contrast 
of engagement as measured by the number of tweets and retweets, while there were similarities in the use of the 
same words related to hashtags. We also found that some of the new ambassadors' accounts on Twitter had more 
followers and some of them had quite a contrasting number of followers.

1. Introduction
Modern diplomacy practices have evolved over the last few years, such as what is known as digital diplomacy. 
There are many studies discussing digital diplomacy which also influenced by the rapid development of technology. 
In this case, digital diplomacy by utilizing social media can be an interactive tool to introduce the State to the public 
both nationally and internationally (Costa 2017). Twitter is one of the most widely used social media as a medium of 
digital diplomacy, where according to the Twiplomacy website, there are 228 ministries of foreign affairs active on 
Twitter (Kampf et al. 2015). Furthermore, Twiplomacy 2018 also noted that 97% of UN member countries already 
have Twitter accounts (Sebayang 2018). In the practice of diplomacy, Twitter functions as a media platform for 
gathering information that is relevant to the formulation of certain policies and can influence the way diplomats 
view issues related to diplomatic forums (Manor and Segev 2020). Thus, social media such as Twitter has become a 
media platform that can be useful for diplomats, especially ambassadors to interact and manage digital 
communications. 
Meanwhile, studies on representation of women in modern diplomacy assert that women continue to be the minority 
in this portfolio. Towns and Niklasson (2018) created a data set of all ambassador appointments made by the 50 
highest ranked countries in terms of GDP in 2014 and suggest that women’s share is around 15%. A recent report by 
the Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy (2021) stipulates that the proportion in 40 countries (including G20 and 
European Union) has increased to 20.7% in 2021. The Asian region sends the least number of female ambassadors 
(Towns and Niklasson 2018). The situation is even dearer in Indonesia as female ambassadors only accumulated to 
5.23% between 1947 and 2021. This figure indicates gender inequality in ambassadorial appointments, in which 
ambassadors are serving as the heads of diplomatic missions, where they represent the national interests of the 
country abroad hence the prestigious status (Krook and O'brien 2012). Nevertheless, the global trend shows that 
more women are being appointed as ambassadors especially in countries with a more gender equal societies. 
On the other hand, governments and diplomats in numerous countries have utilized social media platforms as part of 
digital-based diplomatic missions, considering the role of social media in voicing people's aspirations and shaping

Figure 5. The most popular tweet by Ratu Silvy Gayatri’s Twitter account 
 
The ambassador's account Ratu Silvy Gayatri has the lowest level of interaction among other ambassadorial 
accounts, which is measured by the number of tweets, retweets, and replies. Where the ambassador Silvy Gayatri 
has never tweeted but has interacted based on replies 5 times. However, it should be noted that, although 
Ambassador Ratu Silvy has never tweeted, she has retweeted 28 times, with the most frequently used hashtag is 
'inidiplomasi'. Figure 5 shows the interaction based on replies between the ambassador's account Ratu Silvy Gayatri 
and the tweet account belonging to the Chief of Protocol, Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland.  
 
From these five ambassadorial accounts, there are differences and similarities in the level of engagement for each 
ambassadorial account. There is a difference in the level of engagement as measured by the number of retweets and 
tweets. There are 2 female ambassador accounts that retweeted more than 200 times, one ambassador account that 
retweeted more than 100 times and 2 other accounts had retweeted less than 100 times. Not only that, but the 
difference is also quite a contrast in the level of engagement based on the number of tweets, where there is only 1 
ambassador who has tweeted more than 100 times, and 4 other accounts have tweeted no more than 50 times. On the 
other hand, the similarity in the level of engagement is in the use of hashtags, most of the five ambassadorial 
accounts use hashtags that use the word 'indiplomasi' for each of the top five of the use of hashtags. Ambassador Siti 
Nugraha Mauludiah's account is the ambassador's account that uses the hashtag 'inidiplomasi' the most among other 
ambassadorial accounts. Meanwhile, the ambassador's account of Silvy Gayatri, was the last account to join Twitter 
in 2018 and is in the lowest position in terms of engagement. Meanwhile, the ambassador's account, Adiyatwidi 
Adiwoso, has been on Twitter for a long time and is in the second-highest position in the level of engagement based 
on retweets. While other accounts only garnered less than 60 likes. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Technological developments have affected aspects of people's lives, so that governments in various countries are 
trying to promote technology in various fields, one of which is in the field of diplomacy. Modern diplomacy 
practices have brought opportunities for ambassadors, especially female ambassadors to be able to take advantage of 
digital technology, such as social media as a diplomatic tool. In this case, Indonesian female ambassadors can play 
their role by utilizing social media such as Twitter as a complementary tool for diplomacy to represent Indonesia 
abroad as well as being able to gather information and interact with public audiences, considering that Indonesia is a 
country with the fifth rank as the most Twitter users in the world. In this study, we found that almost 60 percent of 
Indonesian female ambassadors have a Twitter account, and they serve in European and American countries.

The data suggest that newer accounts can outnumbered the older ones in terms of its followers, depending on how 
active the users are interacting in the social media platform. We also found that ambassadors’ accounts that recently 
joined Twitter had more followers than accounts that had been on Twitter for a long time and some of them had 
quite a contrasting number of followers. This reflects how active the ambassadors' Twitter accounts are, which is 
measured by the level of engagement. The level of engagement for each ambassador's account is very diverse, such 
as there are very contrasting differences in the number of tweets, but on the other hand there are similarities between 
these accounts, such as the use of hashtag 'inidiplomasi' being the most often used. We conclude that Indonesian 
female ambassadors have not yet maximized the benefit of Twiplomacy to support their diplomatic duties. Female 
politicians are also divided in utilizing social media during election season (Prihatini 2020) as some of them are 
worried their campaign strategy will be in jeopardy. Further study could expand from here as to why female 
diplomats are lacking in terms of utilizing Twitter to improve Indonesia's digital diplomacy.

Abstract 
Online gender-based violence is still in the spotlight in gender research and feminism in Indonesia. The reason is that 
reporting on this issue has not received more attention in the media. In addition, victims of cases of gender-based 
violence, including on online platforms, are often cornered in media coverage by the framing that is built. For this 
reason, this study wants to uncover how the social constructs carried out by mainstream mass media and special media 
about women write about this issue and how these two different media segments frame online gender-based violence 
in their news content. The mass media selected in this study are Kompas.com and Konde.co. The theories used in this 
research are Postmodern Feminism and Social Construction by Berger and Luckmann. The method used is Robert N. 
Entman framing analysis. The results show that Kompas.com is structured in building its narrative on the issue of 
violence against women, including online gender-based violence. Meanwhile, Konde.co is a more specific medium in 
building the narrative using the storytelling method.

1. Introduction
Mass media is still believed to be the most powerful means of disseminating messages (Baran & Davis, 2014) until 
now, even amid the onslaught of social media. Even though the number of social media users, especially in Indonesia, 
is currently increasing from previous years, the mass media still plays a vital role as a mass messenger. Data to the 
Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association (APJII), in 2019 – 2020, internet users in Indonesia increased by 
8.9% from 2018 to 73.7% (APJII, 2020). However, the mass media still strongly influences the audience (Nur, 2021). 
The phenomena that occur in society are also inseparable from the social construction formed by the media. The 
media's repetition of news consequently influences society's perspective. One phenomenon that occurs from social 
construction from media is gender-based violence. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 
defines gender-based violence as direct violence perpetrated against someone based on their sex or gender. This 
includes the danger or threat posed by physical and mental trauma (RedlineIndonesia, 2021). This issue often does 
not get more attention in Indonesian society because this issue is considered no bigger than political, legal, and 
criminal cases.

These two-mass media, Kompas.com and Konde.co agreed to place women as a group that deserves protection and 
equality in all aspects. Both media also show their side to women, including children, especially those who are victims 
of violence. However, the differences between the two are very visible in constructing a narrative about the phenomena 
that occur. This is in line with Derrida's theory that women are represented in a series of interrelated signs, roles, and 
rituals (Tong & Botts, 2018). In articles made by Kompas.com, it has been explained about online gender-based 
violence, and how it affects individuals. Meanwhile, Konde.co is more specific in explaining the issue. And written 
in more detail and sharper in addressing the issue of online gender-based violence. 
More the difference between the two is seen in the form of writing. While Kompas.com writes in the form of a narrative 
in the standard straight news, Konde.co writes by storytelling. In this regard, it may be influenced by the policies of 
the respective mass media. As a result, the social constructs that the two media want to build are almost the same, 
namely how the community must start to be aware of the threat of perpetrators or other forms of online gender-based 
violence that are around (Berger & Luckmann, 1967). From the two media, both Kompas.com and Konde.co have 
sided with the media, and both agreed that the position of women as social beings has the same rights, including groups 
of children, as written by Kompas.com (Bock et al., 2018; D’Heer et al., 2020; Doko, 2019). 
6. Conclusion
Kompas.com and Konde.co as actors who spread messages in masse are seen as trying to oppose discrimination against 
women. Whereas in two media, there are also women as part of the organizational structure who want to fight for 
gender equality and the protection of their people. It is in line with (Lykke, 2016) research where women refuse to be 
victimized themselves. Even though Kompas.com is independent media, regardless of the patriarchal culture, in this 
case, it can be seen in the analysis in the first article entitled ""Cases of Violence against Women via the Internet 
Increase 3 Times During the Pandemic"" still cornering the position of women who seem to be an uneducated group. 
There are still dictions from the article that was in favor of women. 
Meanwhile, in Konde.co, as a special media for women, the ideology of postmodern feminism is very visible from 
the freedom of writing. Shamelessly, straightforwardly and write down the problems that are built. In more detail, 
Konde.co is not shy about pointing out who is to blame in an issue related to women. This research shows that the two 
media, both Kompas.com and Konde.co, have taken sides with women and children who are often victims of online 
gender-based violence. The narrative that is built, it shows that the level of this violent crime has claimed many 
victims. Although the number of violence during the Covid-19 period has decreased, it is not shown progress because 
many partners of institutions from The National Commission on Violence Against Women do not report the number 
of cases they received (Komnas Perempuan, 2020). We are aware that this research still needs further development 
and observation, so it is hoped that further research will look at other mainstream media and specifically in reporting 
on online gender-based violence, especially the media with the highest viewers.

Abstract 
The present research evaluates dimensions that influence the consumer's satisfaction with the shoe service industry. 
The evaluated factors are comprised of tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy, and the consumer's 
satisfaction. There are five developed hypotheses, and they are tested by multiple linear regression. The instruments 
are extracted by using the online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a five-point Likert scale, and 24 
questions were prepared for presenting the dimensions' representation. A total of 55 respondents participated in this 
study. The questionnaire was distributed in the range of the second semester of 2021, where the covid-19 struck the 
businesses hard. Four out of five hypotheses are generated with positive and significant values. The reliability 
dimension is revealed to be insignificant. The tangible dimension is explored to be the most vital dimension with 
significant effect. The regression formula was generated with the value of Y = 1,601 + 0,488 X1 + 0,124 X2 + 0,129X3 
+ 0,287X4 + 0,129X5. The suggestions, limitations, and implications are discussed further for improving the service
and understanding the consumer better.

1. Introduction
Along with the development of civilization, most people have high mobility in their daily activities. The busy 
schedules were assisted by developing various service providers who assist the community in completing a job. Many 
innovative ideas are raised to help the consumers support their daily life both for products and services (Jin & Shin, 
2020; Khan & Khan, 2009), including the idea of shoe industry (Luximon & Luximon, 2009). The development of 
shoe care worldwide is quite promising, where the projected market value grows from USD 4.92 billion in 2020 to 
USD 6.0 billion in 2025 (Grand View Research, 2019). In Indonesia, the improvement of footwear is seen since 2021 
because of covid 19 pandemic situation (Euromonitor International, 2022). Each type of shoe requires a different 
treatment according to the material used to make the shoe. Therefore, proper and essential shoe care must be carefully 
treated to maintain the quality and lifespan of the shoes (Abd Halim & Zurkarnain, n.d.; Lihtețchi et al., 2014). Shoe 
care is necessary to have unique and specific treatments tailored to the shoe's type and material. Most issues consumers 
face when washing their shoes with shoe washing services are the fear of their shoes being damaged, the color fading, 
and shoe damage. Thus, many shoe care providers compete to provide the best experiences and services to attract 
consumers to choose their brand. However, since a novel pandemic Covid-19 struct the world in late 2019 (Ciotti et 
al., 2020), many businesses have collapsed, including the shoe care industry. The shoe care providers must think hard 
to attract the consumers, where the socialization of physical distancing is massively implemented worldwide.  
Not many studies can depict the solution of the Covid-19 anomaly to business sustainability. However, consumer 
satisfaction is still considered the most critical dimension (Cai et al., 2020; Prasetyo et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021). The 
present research elaborates the consumer satisfaction by seeing the relationship between antecedences factors, namely

dimensions have no heteroscedasticity values, presented by a scatter plot pattern, and the glejser values with more 
than 0.05 significance (0.96; 0.50; 0.92; 0.33; 0.08). The entire dimensions have no multicollinearity, presented from 
the entire VIF values less than 10 (5.11; 4.63; 3.64; 3.18; 3.24). The entire dimensions have no autocorrelation with 
the Durbin-Watson values of 2.18. Based on the analysis result, the regression produces the absolute positive values 
with the detail of Y = 1,601 + 0,488 X1 + 0,124 X2 + 0,129X3 + 0,287X4 + 0,129X5 (the illustration is on Figure 2). 
Figure 2. The model result 
The result projects how tangible,  reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy have significant p-values. Thus 
the entire hypotheses were accepted with positive and significant results. From the entire regression coefficients, the 
tangible dimension is the most significant value, with a score of 0.488. The insight shows where consumers highly 
consider the location, facilities, and supporting attributes. The shoe care industry can capture this revelation by 
improving the supporting facility to attract consumers. The present model contributes to 78 percent (R2) of total 
satisfaction in the shoe care service. Thus, 22 percent of others might come from other dimensions outside the 
evaluated model. 
6. Conclusion
The present research evaluates the effect of tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy on consumers' 
satisfaction. The result indicates that the entire dimensions were proved to have positive and significant effects on 
consumers' satisfaction. The tangible dimension is revealed to be the strongest predictor of consumers' satisfaction. 
Any activities to improve the supporting facility to attract consumers are suggested. There are limitations regarding 
sampling, where the number of sampling should be added in the future to improve the accuracy of the coefficient 
results. Further research also considers adding new dimensions to elaborate the representation of how the consumers' 
satisfaction can be evaluated.

Abstract 
Accurate language translator applications running on low-resource computing devices such as smartphone is very instrumental to 
support tourism industry. The main challenge to achieve such objective is how to optimize performance of machine translation 
model targeted to limited resource of computing devices. Vanilla transformer model has been well known as one of state-of-the-
art neural machine translation model. However, the drawback of this model is its large number of parameter models which might 
not be suitable for low-resource computing devices. This paper presents study findings in efforts to optimize 2 encoder-decoder 
stack depth of vanilla transformer by exploring several activation functions using fine-tuning approach. The pre-trained transformer 
model is fine-tuned using parallel corpus Bahasa Indonesia-Sundanese language to address machine translation task. The 
experiment results found that Sigmoid gives the highest model performance (0.993 average training accuracy and 0.987 average 
testing similarity) and GeLU gives the lowest model performance (0.987 average training accuracy and 0.980 average testing 
similarity) of the tested vanilla transformer models.

5. Conclusion 
The experiment results found that Sigmoid activation function used in the feed-forward layers gives the highest 
vanilla transformer model performance (0.993 average training accuracy and 0.987 average testing similarity) and 
GeLU gives the lowest model performance (0.987 average training accuracy and 0.980 average testing similarity) 
of the tested vanilla transformer models.  This experiment findings validate the choice of Vashmani et al., (Vaswani 
et al., 2017) to use Sigmoid for feed-forward layers as the best activation functions among the tested activation 
functions. However, this experiment findings disagree with previous study reported by (Glorot et al., 2011) which 
concludes that ReLU achieves better performance than Sigmoid and Tanh activation function. This analysis results 
can be used further as a basis for future works in developing a variant of transformer model which is suitable for 
low-resource computing environment.

Abstract 
Companies in Indonesia that listed in the LQ45 Index are companies that have strong fundamentals. This study aims 
to determine the effect of company growth, leverage, free cash flow, institutional ownership and inflation on the policy 
of dividends in non-family companies listed on the LQ45 index in 2013-2020.  This study uses a quantitative approach 
with panel data regression analysis and weight least square (WLS) methods to deal with heteroscedasticity and 
normality problems using EViews 12.0 software. The results of this study showed that simultaneously the growth of 
the company, leverage, free cash flow, institutional ownership and inflation affect dividend policy. Meanwhile, 
partially the company's growth, leverage, institutional ownership has a significant and negative influence on dividend 
policy, and free cash flow and inflation have no effect on dividend policy.

1. Introduction
The LQ45 index is an index that contains 45 companies with good fundamentals and leads to companies that have 
high liquidity and large market capitalization (Solihin et al., 2022). Companies in the LQ45 index come from a variety 
of sectors and company holdings, including non-family companies. The division of power and power of influence 
among shareholders over the operational activities of the entity is reflected in the shareholding structure. In Indonesia, 
non-family companies have the majority of shareholders owned by the government, foreign, and institutional. 
However, non-family companies are usually managed by management who come from professional circles who do 
not have a family relationship with the company owner (Venusita & Agustia, 2021). Supervision of management in 
non-family companies is more effective because the proportion of independent commissioners is higher. So that 
independent commissioners can represent as shareholders. Shareholders with 20 – 25% ownership are considered 
sufficient to be able to play a role in the company's strategic decisions, so these criteria are often used to classify 
Family Firms (FFs) and Non Family Firms (NFFs) (Drake, 2009). According to Kristanti et al. (2019) a family 
company is defined as a company that is majority managed by several family members with one of them founded by 
family members who also own majority shares or members of the company's board of directors have a family 
relationship with the founder of a company. In non-family companies the changes that occur are seen as an opportunity 
to grow and develop (Strike, 2015). Thus, it can be concluded that a company is said to be a non-family company if it 
does not meet these categories. 
The trend of investing in Indonesia is currently a hot topic of discussion. According to the statistical data of  Indonesian 
Central Securities Depository (2020) the number of capital market investors in 2020 increased by 55.83% or a total 
of 3,871,248 Single Investor ID from the previous year's 2,484,354 Single Investor ID in 2019. Among the many 
variations of investment instrument choices that have emerged in Indonesia, investment with the purchase of securities 
in the capital market is still in the interest of the public. According to Nguyen et al. (2021) dividend is the net profit 
of the company which is distributed to shareholders according to the ownership of shares owned and the amount and 
timing of distribution is based on the dividend policy of the General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS). There are two 
potential benefits if investing in stocks, namely profiting from dividend distribution from the company's profit

4.1.6 The Effect of Inflation on Dividend Policy  
Based on Table 7. it is known that the independent variable of inflation has a probability value of 0.3805 which is 
greater than the significance level of α = 0.05 and in the results of the regression model selection the panel data shows 
that the inflation variable has a coefficient value of 0.398442 which means that inflation partially has no effect on 
dividend policy in non-family companies listed in the LQ45 Index in 2013-2020. Thus, H6 is rejected. The results of 
this study are supported by research conducted by Elly & Hellen (2013) which found inflation has no effect on 
dividend policy. These results illustrate the high and low levels of inflation that occur have no effect on dividend 
policy. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study analyzes the effect of company growth, leverage, free cash flow, institutional ownership and inflation 
affecting dividend policy in non-family companies listed on the LQ45 Index in 2013-2020. The results of this study 
found that company growth, leverage, free cash flow, institutional ownership and inflation had a simultaneous effect 
on dividend policy. while partially it was found that company growth, leverage, and institutional ownership had a 
significant and negative effect on dividend policy, while free cash flow and inflation partially had no effect on dividend 
policy. Furthermore, it is hoped that this research can be used as a research reference in the future. The author suggests 
that researchers can then replace independent variables that may affect dividend policy as well as allow subsequent 
researchers to replace or increase the number of research objects. For companies, it is necessary to evaluate more 
related to company growth, leverage, free cash flow, institutional ownership and inflation in order to provide a better 
decision for the company.  For investors, the results of this study can be information about factors that can affect the 
size of the amount of dividends distributed as a consideration before making an investment.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of pain and discomfort in lower extremities of body part. 
Musculoskeletal Disease (MSD) is one of the problems faced by industrial worker in Malaysia. This study targets the 
industrial worker in Malaysia that required prolonged standing. This study uses survey to determine the pain on lower 
extremities of prolonged standing worker. The survey uses online medium which is Google form to collect the 
respondents’ data. The lower extremities body parts involved are lower back, thigh, back leg, front leg, knee, and foot. 
Experiment conducted to validate the pain level reported from the survey. The experiment has three tasks that design 
based on the data analyzed from the survey. The body part rank based on the mean pain level from the survey and the 
experiment. Respondents indicate their pain level based on Likert scale used in the survey questionnaire. The

Figure 4 Mean pain level after tasks for all body parts 
There 3 muscles that exceed the mean pain level of 2 which were lower back, back leg, and foot. The pain level 
during work chosen as the value to rank the muscle pain or fatigue because it was the time that highest pain or 
fatigue occur compared to before and after work. The experiment data analysis we concluded that based on task 
1 the rank of muscle pain or fatigue were as follow foot, lower back, back leg, front leg, thigh, and knee. Based 
on task 2 the rank of muscle pain or fatigue were as follow lower back, foot, back leg, front leg, thigh, and knee. 
Based on task 3, the rank of muscle pain or fatigue were as follow lower back, foot, back leg, thigh, knee, and 
front leg. Comparing the result from the survey data, experiment data and literature review on the muscle pain or 
fatigue. From the survey data the three highest pain or fatigue reported during work were lower back, back leg, 
and foot. Meanwhile from experiment data the three highest pain or fatigue reported were lower back, foot, and 
back leg. Based on the survey and experiment we could see that the three highest pain or fatigue muscle reported 
was consistent. The least pain or fatigue muscle reported in survey and experiment was knee except in task 3 of 
the experiment. (Halim I, et al., 2012) Half of respondents complained of being very fatigue in the left and right 
gastrocnemius muscle (posterior legs), 5 subject complained being very fatigue in erector spinae muscle (lower 
back) and 11 subject complained being moderate fatigue in anterior muscle (anterior legs) [5]. From Assessment 
of Muscle Fatigue Associated with Prolonged Standing in the Workplace by Halim I, et al., (2012) from the 
survey the three muscle that had most complained of being fatigue were posterior legs, lower back, and anterior 
legs [5]. Lastly, to achieve the third objective of this study which was to propose the practices to reduce muscle 
pain on lower extremities of body part. We proposed that worker that required prolonged standing to get rest and 
do stretching on leg occasionally. This will help reduced the pain or fatigue on the lower extremities. Rest help 
muscle to recover form fatigue and stretching on leg help blood circulation on lower extremities. 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation
5.1 Conclusion 
Musculoskeletal Disease (MSD) is common and widely known among the industry workers that required prolonged 
standing. The most occurrence of MSD is in lower extremities of the worker body such as lower back and foot. Over 
the years many studies on risk of MSD were done by industrial researcher to improve the condition of industrial 
worker. The main objective of this project is to determine the muscle pain or fatigue for lower extremities region 
during standing activity which to validate whether the standing activity can cause the changes in muscle activity of a 
person and to see which part of muscle is the most critical during the standing activity. The project also was conducted 
an experiment to validate and support the finding on the survey. The results obtained from the project also will be 
compared with the existing research to see whether the results obtained from the research can be accepted. The study 
focused on lower extremities region of body part which are lower back, thigh, back leg, front leg, foot, and knee. Many 
2940","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

previous studies focused on certain part of lower extremities such as erecter spinae, and gastrocnemius muscle. This 
study included more body part in lower extremities such as knee and thigh muscles. This is because the study wants 
to get a broader view on the prevalence of muscle pain on lower extremities. An experiment in a controlled 
environment had been conducted to validate and support the finding from the survey. The activity done by the 
participants of the experiment determine by the finding of the survey. Both findings then compared to previous study 
or literature review to see whether the findings are true. 52 The conclusion of this study is muscle pain or fatigue is 
prevalence in the prolonged standing worker. The rank of reported body part that experienced the most pain is as 
follow lower back, back leg, foot, front leg, thigh, and knee. The three critical body parts are lower back, back leg, 
and foot as the experiment result and literature review show the similarities. The practice to reduce the pain in lower 
extremities also proposed which are rest and do stretching on legs based on finding from survey. 
5.2 Recommendation 
To improve the outcome of this research, a few suggestions for the overall research that could make: 
•
The respondents for the survey chosen from the industry sector that that required extensive amount of time
standing.
•
The survey conducted physically in the real industry environment.
•
Use same subjects or participant for survey and experiment to maintain same perspective.

Abstract 
Due to the geographical characteristics of Chile, which make it difficult for people to access health services, in addition 
to the consequences of the global pandemic COVID-19, telemedicine has emerged as a solution to the gaps in access 
to medical services. This technology requires specific knowledge and skills for using the platforms, which can bring 
problems for older people. This study seeks to explain the factors that can drive the adoption of telemedicine in the 
Chilean context, looking to establish a model for the adoption of telemedicine in older people. This proposal is 
developed with a combination of PLS-SEM and fsQCA to test the relevance of the proposed determinants in adopting 
this technology and to analyse whether these factors are necessary or sufficient for this behaviour to occur. After the 
analysis, it was possible to observe through PLS-SEM analysis that Effort Expectancy, Performance Expectancy, 
Social Influence, and Price affect the intention to use telemedicine. On the other hand, the fsQCA analysis highlighted 
the importance of Performance Expectancy when adopting telemedicine, with its presence being a necessary condition. 
Subsequently, the sufficiency analysis supports what was found in the necessary condition analysis. With these results, 
the study seeks to contribute to the literature on the relationship between the elderly and information technologies 
through these methodologies and empirical conclusions.

1. Introduction
According to the National Telehealth Program carried out by the Ministry of Health of Chile, in the country, ""due to 
its geographical characteristics where distance and access barriers are a critical factor for the attention of the 
beneficiary population, the incorporation of information and communication technologies is essential. (Narváez et al. 
2018).  In this challenging scenario, information technologies, specifically the emerging Telemedicine platforms, seem 
to be helpful in this situation. This ministry also affirms that Telemedicine represents an innovative strategy that allows 
for optimising specialised human resources, complementing actions and solutions that will enable the beneficiary 
population to experience a substantial improvement in access to care by the health team, becoming a strategy for

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
Regarding future ideas, it is suggested that other studies could apply the model to a more significant number of people 
or apply the combination of methodologies to another technology’s adoption model, either established (TAM, 
UTAUT, UTAUT 2) or some model based on them, seeking to explain the behaviour of older people against 
technology. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The objective of the present study was to explain the adoption of telemedicine services in older people in Chile through 
a model of acceptance of information technologies, combining methodologies that have not been used in the research 
of this thematic area. 
 
Through the proposed model and thanks to PLS-SEM, it was determined that the factors that may affect older people 
to create the behaviour of Intention to Use telemedicine are Effort Expectancy when using telemedicine, Performance 
Expectancy, Social Influence, and the subjective value of the price of the service of these platforms. 
 
On the other hand, according to the analysis of necessary conditions through fsQCA, the importance of Performance 
Expectancy at the time of adopting telemedicine is highlighted; this means that according to the reality of the sample, 
we must ensure that the person has the belief that using telemedicine will improve their quality of life in general, 
resulting in the Intention to Use these platforms in most cases. Finally, according to the results of the sufficient 
conditions, no exogenous variable is enough by themselves to create the intention of use in older people. Still, all are 
sufficient in some solutions to reach this result, except for the Effort Expectancy. 
 
One of the contributions of this study is methodological; the fact of being able to investigate older people and 
telemedicine using a combination of methodologies that can be considered relatively new in the literature of this age 
group and its interaction with new information technologies can motivate researchers to do more studies of this type

Abstract 
PT. Rariza Putra is a company engaged in the distribution of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) 3 kg. The distribution 
route starts from the Oil Fuel Filling Station (SPBE) to each customer venue. In the distribution method, the company 
determines the route only by decisions made by the driver, because the company does not have a fixed distribution 
route. It means that the resulting route is not an optimal route. With the existing problems, the company needs a 
problem-solving method that would provide a solution to calculate the shorter route to reduce transportation and fuel 
costs. This research was conducted on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with the Capacitated Vehicle Routing 
Problem (CVRP) approach, which determines the route by taking into account the capacity of the vehicle, and also 
Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Trips (VRPMT), which determines the route for each vehicle to make more 
than one delivery, and Vehicle Routing Problem with Split Delivery (VRPSD), where each base can be visited more 
than once. The method used in solving this problem is the Saving Matrix and also the Nearest Neighbor methods. 
These two methods will be compared to the initial route that exists in the company, and the method that gives the 
optimal results will be chosen. Based on the processing that has been carried out with the both methods, the Nearest 
Neighbor method is chosen which gives more optimal results in determining the route and also affects the fuel costs 
incurred. The route generated by the nearest neighbor method in one week is 283,37 km with a comparison of the 
initial route length of 391,17 km. While the total fuel cost savings that occur every week on the nearest neighbor 
method is Rp. 208.475 with a cost comparison on the initial route of Rp. 289.773 with a difference of Rp. 81.298. The 
new distribution route provides 28% savings compared to the initial route in the company.

1. Introduction
PT. Rariza Putra is one of the 3 kg Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) gas agent companies. The distribution of 3 kg 
LPG gas is carried out to the customers in the area of the Eastern part of Sleman Yogyakarta Indonesia. One of the 
problems faced by the company is the distribution routes is not optimal. Currently, the distribution route is determined 
only by the driver's decision without any logical and definite basis for consideration. Thus, the decision is not 
necessarily the best route and can cause the length of the route and will affect the amount of distribution fuel costs 
incurred. In this company initial routes, each week produces a total distance of 393.87 km and the total cost of 
distribution fuel is Rp. 289,773.

6. Conclusion 
From the results of the discussion of determining the optimal route of distribution of 3 kg LPG gas at PT. Rariza Putra 
by comparing the initial route, the saving matrix method and the nearest neighbor obtained route and cost savings, 
namely the initial route obtained a total distance of 391.17 km and a total fuel cost of Rp.289,773, In the saving matrix 
method obtained a total distance of 349, 92 km and a total fuel cost of Rp257,439 and the nearest neighbor method 
obtained a total distance of 283.37 km and a total fuel cost of Rp208,475. 
From these results, it is known that the saving matrix and nearest neighbor methods are able to provide savings in 
vehicle mileage and distribution fuel costs. However, from the two methods, the nearest neighbor method gives higher 
savings than the saving matrix method. 
From the results obtained from the nearest neighbor method has savings percentage of 28% compared to the initial 
company route and it can be concluded that the nearest neighbor method generates more optimal route.

Abstract 
Sustainability issues have increased the need for stakeholders toward environmental information disclosure. 
Environmental information is pivotal for stakeholders to assess a firm's environmental performance. A firm's 
environmental performance significantly influences a firm's environmental properly. This study examines the 
influence of a firm's environmental performance on Firm environmental disclosure, moderated by the firm's 
characteristics. The study involved fifty listed firms on Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) and PROPER participants 
(Company Performance Rating Program in Environmental Management) from 2017 to 2020. The firm's characteristics 
in this study refer to size, profitability, and leverage. The estimated Generalized least square panel regression test 
indicated that firm environmental performance significantly explains the variance of environmental disclosure. The 
influence of firm environmental performance on firm environmental disclosure is significantly moderated by 
profitability and firm size.

1. Introduction
Environmental conservation and environmental values are receiving a lot of attention these days. Consumers in today's 
modern world are more conscious and alert when it comes to the prosperity of their society and environment and how 
firms operating in their surroundings handle it (Braam et al.). In recent years, the public's need for information 
regarding investment decisions has grown in financial statements and sustainability reports. The community needs 
information on how the corporation pays attention to social and environmental actions to ensure the people's rights to 
live securely and peacefully, employee welfare, and food security are all met (Solikhah et al.). 
World economic development has environmental impacts that result in global warming, natural disasters, and 
pollution. Consequently, many firms take as much responsibility for environmental concerns as economic issues. One 
argument for this is that firms increasingly reflect rising social expectations and stakeholder concerns. (Suttipun and 
Stanton), (Hidayat et al.). As the public becomes more aware of ""sustainable development,"" such concerns have arisen. 
They want to ensure that corporations conduct their operations more environmentally friendly and responsible.

environmental attributes (Yusoff et al.). If the company aims to increase the share price (company value), it can use 
environmental and social responsibility by paying attention to environmental performance (Solikhah et al.). 
 
This study has not linked environmental disclosure with firm value. Further research can consider environmental 
disclosure as a mediating variable. Several studies have found that environmental performance does not provide many 
benefits for the compensation received, so there is no need to provide too much environmental disclosure (Deswanto 
and Siregar), (Muslichah). The company's participation in the Environmental Performance Rating Program (PROPER) 
is sufficient to gain community legitimacy so that companies do not need to disclose detailed environmental activities. 
Or conversely, the better the environmental performance, the company will be encouraged to make disclosures to 
stakeholders regarding the company's responsibilities to the environment. Therefore, by making the environmental 
disclosure a mediating variable, it is analyzed whether environmental performance can directly affect the company's 
value or must through environmental disclosure. 
 
Further research also needs to consider environmental performance measurement, in addition to PROPER scores such 
as ISO 14031 and ISO 14001. Future research also needs to consider environmental disclosure measurements, in 
addition to the GRI index. The GRI index is less reliable because few companies in Indonesia still publish 
sustainability reports.

1. Introduction
Every human being has basic needs that must be met. Speaking of needs, each individual has a level of need that must 
be met gradually, from the lowest to the highest. This level of need was put forward by Abraham Maslow in a pyramid 
structure known as Maslow's pyramid. Abraham Maslow believes that all motivation happened as a reaction to an 
individual's experience of the five basic types of needs. According to Maslow, there are 5 kinds of basic needs, which 
are always experienced by an individual. As seen below on Figure 1, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory describes 
it as a dynamic holistic synthesis or combination of theories (Iskandar, 2016). 
Figure 1. Maslow Pyramid. 
Food has become one of the leisure options in this modern period with rising stress levels throughout society, 
particularly in the capital city where people rush in every direction. Eating is no longer just about meeting demands 
or feeling satisfied in the stomach; eating is not only just a matter of taste, but the entertainment factor is also taken 
into account during this eating time. That is why the culinary arts are improving all the time. Meanwhile, we can see 
that urban populations do most of the cooking because they are more stressed than rural ones. Culinary pursuits have 
become a way of life in urban areas. Now a day, research in the restaurant sector has focused heavily on ‘culinary’

6. Conclusion  
Many fancies restaurants are contending to introduce different climate to attract guests. They try to draw out the most 
current look that is called the ""experience"". In now a day restaurant we can discover a utilization of new virtual 
innovation to bring an extraordinary dining experience to the guests. The inside of the cutting-edge restaurant turns 
out to be very surprising as a result of the science innovation that makes augmented reality occurred. 
 
Describing the new approach, the researchers summarized that the concept of multisensory eating served to diners at 
several fine dining restaurants in several countries is a new innovation in science. The thrill or experience of dining in 
a restaurant with an interior that presents an immersive experience with virtual technology has just been discussed. 
The popularity of this concept of dining with virtual technology highlights the potential development of virtual 
technology in the later stages. 
 
The word “technology”, which has always been synonymous with definite scientific aspect seems to be able to 
penetrate many aspects of life. It does not rule out the possibility of cooperation between the world of science 
technology and the world of art design can affect the future advancement. The collaboration with various other fields 
of science innovation without limit between art n technology are represented by some case study addressed above. 
Therefore, this study will lead to other researcher for further study about science innovation in technology for art 
design. Hoping that in the future there will be more extravaganza innovations that can be applied to art and design 
field, as the additional of the present virtual technology methods. 
 
Scientific innovation provides knowledge to the public about current technological advances that are far ahead. This 
study concludes that scientific discoveries in the field of virtual technology such as immersive technology, 3D visual 
innovation, artificial intelligence which has been applied in several fine dining restaurants have provided an immersive 
dining experience for their customers

Abstract 
This study examines environmental disclosure and financial distress among Indonesian Environmentally Sensitive 
Industries (ESI) firms and their impacts on firm value. To do so, we investigate the potential moderating variable of 
market capitalization in strengthening the relationship between environmental disclosure, financial distress, and firm 
value. We measure the environmental disclosure using content analysis with GRI 300 sustainability reporting 
standards, the environmental dimension, as the benchmark. To measure the financial distress prediction, we utilize the 
Taffler z-score model and Price to Book Value (PBV) as the proxy of firm value. The research method used in this 
study was VB-SEM with SmartPLS 3. Using a sample of 59 companies on Indonesian ESI’s firm data for the years 
2018 – 2020, a period of issuance regarding sustainability reports in Indonesia, our regression results show that most 
companies have a low level of environmental disclosure. We also find a negative relationship between environmental 
disclosure and firm value. Moreover, we find that market capitalization can strengthen the relationship between 
financial distress and firm value. In contrast, we find no association between financial distress and firm value as well 
as the interaction of market capitalization between environmental disclosure and firm value link.

1. Introduction
Environmental issues have become a major concern in many developing countries (Gerged et al. 2021), including 
Indonesia. According to World Air Quality Ranking, Indonesia is classified as the most polluted country in Southeast 
Asia that mainly caused by business operations of Environmentally Sensitive Industries (ESI) (Kuo and Chen 2013). 
This polluting business operation may decrease stakeholders’ trust and negatively affect their firm value (Sheikh 2018) 
unless they participate in environmental-related initiatives (Deswanto and Siregar 2018). Hence, it is necessary for 
Indonesian companies, especially ESI’s firm, to have green business operations and disclose their environmental 
activities and projects to their stakeholders. 
Some prior studies on the relationship between environmental disclosure and firm value showed mixed results, either 
positive relationships (e.g., Li et al. 2018; Qureshi et al. 2020), negative relationships (e.g., Li et al. 2020; Marshall et 
al. 2009) or insignificant relationships (e.g., Deswanto and Siregar 2018; Hongjun and Xiaobo 2010). According to 
stakeholder theory, stakeholders are interested in receiving information beyond financial performance (Fuente et al. 
2017), such as environmental disclosure. It motivates the company’s initiative to address the company’s environmental 
issues. Stakeholders may appreciate these initiatives and generate a good reputation and competitive advantage, such 
as enhancing stakeholder engagement and loyalty (Rabaya and Saleh 2022), which eventually may enhance firm value. 
Therefore, the more extensive environmental disclosure, the better the firm value (Li et al. 2018).

Abstract 
Investment decision-making is a complex process and play’s vital role in achieving investor goals. The current 
COVID-19 pandemic didn’t mitigate investors’ enthusiasm for investing in Indonesian stock market. The growth of 
investors in Indonesia has hits a new record. By the end of 2021, number of single investor identification will have 
surpassed 7.5 million. This study objectives to investigate factors that affect individual’s Indonesian investor in 
investment decision-making during the pandemic. Four factors such as herding behavior, technology advancement, 
financial literacy, and firm knowledge were explored. To investigate these variables, questionnaire was designed 
utilizing the purposive sample method and the Likert scaling methodology. A sample of 338 Indonesian investors who 
started investing during the COVID 19 pandemic were collected and their data was analyzed using SmartPLS 
application. The findings of this study demonstrated that herding behavior, technology advancements, financial 
literacy, and firm knowledge all had a positive and significant impact on Indonesian investors’ investment decisions. 
However, the results show that technological advances are the most important factor influencing investors’ investment 
decisions. The outcomes of this study will boost investor confidence and broaden investor knowledge in weighing 
decisions for developing better investment activities.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 pandemic evoked the most dramatic stock market crash in history. As the result of limited economic 
activity, this outbreak had a significant economic impact. On January 31, 2020 IDX left level 6,000 and closed at 
5,940. Index was practically in free fall and closed at 3,937 or drop 37.50% by March 24, 2020, compared to the end 
of 2019. This is caused by a steady drop in share prices as investors worry about the distribution of the coronavirus 
and government reactions that implement some policies. As stock markets worldwide average declined, investor

of retail investors in the capital market has set a new record in the history of the capital market. The number of single

Abstract 
While youth and future generations will carry the burden of the crisis's long-term economic and social implications, 
short-term economic and equity considerations may outweigh their business sustainability. The purpose of this study 
is to find out and analyze the entrepreneurial orientation impact on business sustainability during COVID-19 
pandemic. A sample of 101 young respondents was selected from small and medium online businesses in Jakarta. A 
random sampling technique was executed. For this study, a cross-sectional and quantitative research design was used 
based on the survey process. The two-part questionnaire was used for data collection. Structural Equation Model 
(SEM) was used to assess the hypothesis of this study. The result shows that entrepreneurial orientation has a positive 
and significant impact directly on business sustainability. The same situation also occurred as an indirect effect of 
entrepreneurial orientation on business sustainability through innovation performance. This study suggests that online 
small and medium entrepreneurs need to implement entrepreneurial orientation strategy to grow their online customer 
acquisition business process. Young e-business owners are advised that understanding the importance of constantly 
producing, evaluating, and successfully implementing new ideas have a higher chance of surviving and prospering in 
today’s competitive global market.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic forces most of the governments all over the world to respond by refocusing their 
development programs on economic recovery and reorienting policies related to sustainability issues. The impact also 
reverberates through the Indonesian regional economies as the decline in sales of its small and medium enterprises 
presents a sizable effect on the business sustainability (Anggraeni 2020).

successfully exploit new ideas have a better chance of surviving and prospering in the competitive global market. 
Currently, there are more and more competitors in e-business, which prompts young corporations to innovate in 
developing products or services and to be able to produce a sustainable business during the pandemic. 
 
Finally, increasing entrepreneurial orientation during this pandemic is recommended to encourage innovation 
performance in a company or business. During this pandemic, many small businesses have emerged, which means 
there are more players. Therefore, a good entrepreneurial orientation can be used as a reference in determining the 
innovations that must be carried out so that they can become a competitive advantage for these small and medium 
enterprises. 
 
Our sample can be pointed out as a limitation for a couple of reasons. First, we used a young e-business owners. 
Additionally, our population comprised mainly Indonesian people. Thus, in general, our findings could restrict the 
extent of our statistical generalizability. Second, while our results indicate that entrepreneurial orientation is conducive 
to both innovation performance and business sustainability, our study does not provide insights into how such 
orientation could be generated by the youths and what mechanism yield the better result. 
 
Future studies may focus on other factors that are likely to affect the sustainability of SMEs. Secondly, since the 
primary objective of the study was achieved through commonly known methods, future researchers may wish to 
employ advanced methods and techniques in assessing different dimensions of each of the variables.

Abstract 
Congestion in the container terminal stems from many external trucks queuing up to pick up or deliver containers. 
The congestion makes increasing of truck turnaround time which is a vital key performance indicator for both 
container terminal and trucking companies. Based on the results of the analysis obtained two alternative solutions; 
speed up container service time and control the arrival time of external trucks. Controlling the arrival time of external 
trucks can be done by implementing a truck appointment system. This paper categorized studies on truck appointment 
systems based on the methods including the determination of reservation quotas, scheduling and optimization of truck 
arrivals, minimization of empty truck trips, and others. The study of truck appointment systems can also be grouped 
based on the methodologies used, including queuing theory, mathematical models, simulations, and a combination of 
the two methodologies. In this paper, the research of integration and collaboration in a container terminal is also 
reviewed. In research on integrated scheduling in container terminals, most studies integrate scheduling in the seaside 
and yard area. Research that integrates scheduling starting from a seaside, yard area, and landside especially external 
truck operations is limited. In future research, the integrated scheduling that combines seaside and landside operations 
that emphasize the performance indicator of truck turnaround time and vessel berthing time is promising. The 
methodology to handle various stakeholder interests is agent-based. Besides, real-time scheduling is appropriate for 
the development of new smart port technology.

1. Introduction
The port is one of the main infrastructures in the logistics network in the world. From the UNCTAD (2021) statistics, 
the volume of international trade in goods carried by sea is around 80%. However, the increase in port activity causes 
congestion. One of the reasons for the congestion stems from many external trucks queuing up to pick up or deliver 
containers.  
Congestion in the port can cause losses for the container terminal, shipping companies, and consignees. For the 
container terminal, the loss from the high level of congestion in the port results in the delay or at worst the cessation 
of operations at the stacking yard. This happened because many external trucks in the stacking yard made it difficult 
for the yard crane to move or could not move at all. In addition, the high level of congestion can make container 
terminals unattractive in the eyes of shipping companies (Parola et al. 2016). Shipping companies prefer to dock at 
ports with lower congestion levels because their customers, namely consignees, are more profitable to pick up or 
deliver containers at ports with lower congestion levels. 
High levels of congestion in ports can also cause losses for shipping companies. Losses are experienced in the form 
of additional shipping time and costs required for the process of loading and unloading ships at the port than they 
should be (Gui et al. 2022). This is due to a decrease in the efficiency of port operations because of congestion. For 
example, if there is no congestion, the port can serve loading and unloading activities at a rate of 100 containers per 
hour, but there is a decrease to 60 containers per hour if there is congestion. High congestion at ports can also result

Abstract 
EU's Renewable Energy Directive II or RED II was aimed to achieve the renewable energy use target in EU and 
reduce the environmental issues especially greenhouse gas emissions from every industry within the EU’s member 
states. However, the impact of this EU’s environmental policy has grew outside the region, including to Indonesia. 
This article is intended to discuss the growing impact of RED II to Indonesia, especially deforestation as one of the 
EU’s concerns in RED II, and at the same time it also shows how the EU exert influence and bring changes to other 
states. With Cresswell’s (2019) qualitative research methods, we find that since its enactment, EU's RED II in 2018 
had a growing impact to Indonesia including raises awareness regarding environmental issues, leading to changes in 
the environmental policies related to palm oil industry, as to cope with EU’s RED II policies and the previous 
directive’s impact, and indirectly combat and pushing down the deforestation cases in palm oil concession to the 
lowest rate. The result of this study preserving that the collaboration between Indonesia and EU achieving a beneficial 
relation.

1. Introduction
Oil palm is one of Indonesia's most important plantation crops, producing both palm oil and palm kernel. This plant 
is Indonesia's greatest non-oil and gas foreign exchange earner, as well as its second-largest agricultural product. 
Indonesia has held a significant place in the global economy since 2006, when it became the largest country to produce 
palm oil and vegetable oil in the world (GAPKI 2021). In 2018, Indonesia supplied an output of around 40.6 million 
tons, and export volume of 29.3 million tons of palm oil. And ever since, Indonesia has been considered as the world’s 
largest producer of palm oil. Malaysia, Thailand, and Colombia came in second, third, and fourth, respectively 
(Wicaksono 2021). Palm oil's composition is needed for various purposes, including fuel, household necessities in 
many states. India, Pakistan, China, America, and the European Union are the largest states of Indonesian palm oil 
markets which use palm oil for the biofuel’s material as a renewable energy. In 2008, the total of Indonesia’s CPO 
exports to the European Union alone were 2.8 million tons and in 2016, Indonesia's total CPO exports to the European 
Union had reached 4.3 million tons (GAPKI 2022), proving that the European Union recognizes the significance of 
palm oil as a major trading commodity as it stated on Amsterdam Declaration 2015. Furthermore, European Union 
establish cooperation based on free trade agreement with Indonesia. 
Due to its ability to produce vegetable oil, which is needed in many industrial sectors, palm oil plays a significant role 
in the Indonesian social welfare and economy. It supports Indonesia in create jobs and increased farmers' incomes as 
the production divided into three belongings: the people, private parties, and states. In 2018, the industry is able to 
employ up to 4.2 million direct workers and 14.3 million indirect workers, with 4.6 million people working on 
independent smallholder oil palm plantations (Office of Assistant to Deputy Cabinet Secretary for State Documents 
& Translation 2022). In 2020, palm oil industry contributed 3.5 precents to Indonesia's gross domestic products. In 
the same year, the export volume reaches 27.63 million tons, with export value reaches US$ 18,69 million, which is 
directly proportional with the area expansion up to 14.586.597 Ha (Badan Pusat Statistik 2022). 
Indonesia’s significant palm oil production has impacted the national palm plantation and land expansion policies. 
Which then the Indonesian palm oil industry causing several problems in the business practice, which an enormous

cooperation on land-use change practices, such as deforestation, in earlier FTA sections that address environmental 
issues related to trade.  
 
The adjustments in Indonesia palm oil management policy are being tracked once the EU has succeeded in bringing 
RED II to be counted in SIA and making it more legally binding on an FTA between the EU and Indonesia. The policy 
changes are viewed as a kind of ratification of the EU-Indonesia FTAs, which include RED II. The policies that had 
previously suspended permits were promptly altered to cancel all new land clearing permits. In order to comply with 
RED II as an environmental standard, palm oil management standards have also become binding and mandatory for 
palm oil sector players in Indonesia. Even new guidelines are being developed to improve the domestic palm oil 
industry. As a continuation after the changes, the authors found a decrease on deforestation rate in Indonesia, including 
in palm oil concession. 
 
From here, it can be seen that as the EU’s RED II had a growing impact beyond its borders to Indonesia, it indirectly 
helped to combat the deforestation in palm oil concession to the lowest rates, despite the fact that it only employs one 
of the three tools identified by Adelle et al (2018). Step by step, start from raising environmental awareness since the 
enactment, then become a concern for Indonesia’s government to revise the policies, until the deforestation in palm 
oil concession in Indonesia pushed down to the lowest rates. However, the author recognizes that RED II is not the 
only factor contributing to lower deforestation rates in palm oil concessions, and that more research is needed. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Appreciation for the two actors, the European Union and Indonesia, for their commitment to maintaining cooperation 
and addressing existing environmental challenges. We can see how RED II is having a growing impact not only on 
the internal conditions of EU societies, particularly the domestic biofuels industry, but also in Indonesia, where it is 
raising environmental awareness among Indonesian government, leading to changes in palm oil sector policy and 
reducing deforestation in palm oil concessions. The authors recommend that, in the future, the governments of all 
developing countries should be more aware of the standards enacted by prospect markets, particularly if they are 
developed countries. Vice versa, developed countries that have partnerships with developing countries, particularly in 
terms of resources, must be aware of and adapt their policies to their partner countries' capabilities. Other than that, 
both developed and developing countries must be more conscious and adapt their policies quickly to the dynamic 
environmental issues.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to paper describes three ways to increase productivity because productivity is important 
for economy growth in globalization era. In the current era of globalization, the economy is one of the important things 
in every firm, so productivity, which is one of the indicators of economic growth, cannot be ignored. This paper 
describes three ways to increase productivity, namely, exports, foreign ownership, and information and 
communication technology (ICT). Therefore, this paper wants to make companies realize the importance of the impact 
of productivity on firms. The method used in this paper is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR), in which the 
process is to identify, evaluate, and interpret research results to provide answers to research. From the results of this 
paper, it can be found that exports and foreign ownership can have different impacts in different countries and in 
different fields, whereas ICT does not have different impacts on companies that use or do not use ICT.

Productivity, Exports, Foreign ownership, Information and Communication Technologies and Improve Firm. 
1. Introduction
Productivity is the comparison between the results achieved and the total resources used (Fithri & Sari, 2016). This 
comparison is more often described as a ratio of output to input, namely the relationship between how much output is 
produced and how many inputs are needed (Aipassa, 2015; Tania & Ulkhaq, 2014) to provide effective goals 
(Manullang, 2020). When more output is produced at the same cost, this is called an increase in productivity (Suryanto, 
2020). Productivity is one of the important things for firms, so it is important to increase productivity. One of the three 
ways is to export, have foreign share ownership, and improve ICT, or information and communication technology. 
Export is the process of selling goods or services from within the country to other countries (Purwaning Astuti & 
Juniwati Ayuningtyas, 2018; Wulandari & Lubis, 2019), which is one of the factors in increasing economic growth 
(Ginting, 2017). The reason companies export is because exports have minimal risk, are easy because they do not 
require high investment costs, make production more professional, optimize the distribution of resources around the 
world, and are supported by government policies (Ming & Zhijun, n.d.; Rahmadita, 2017). Countries with open 
economies need exports to play an important role in economic growth, especially for developing countries (Hodijah 
& Angelina, 2021; Suparlan & Prihartono, 2017). 
In addition to exports, foreign ownership can play a role in boosting productivity. Foreign share ownership is a portion 
of the total shares (Taufik & Eka, 2010) owned by individuals, legal entities, and the government but not from firms’

Many companies in various countries have felt the positive impact of exports, such as companies in Vietnam and 
companies in Egypt. Exports can help increase the productivity of companies in both countries, especially those in 
Egypt that have experienced a significant impact from exports. Like exports, the effect of foreign ownership increases 
productivity in the manufacturing industry in Turkey by increasing capital accumulation. Technology is in line with 
theoretical expectations and supports the use of new intermediate goods. Then, after export and foreign ownership, 
there is ICT, which can help increase firms’ productivity. However, unlike exports and foreign shareholding, ICTs 
can provide benefits that are not limited to the companies that use them. 
 
While exports and foreign equity ownership can have a positive impact on companies in some countries, they may not 
have a positive impact on every firm in every country. For example, companies in Morocco do not have the impact of 
increasing productivity by exporting. Or in the US, the presence of foreign ownership does not increase productivity, 
and in China, domestic companies show that foreign ownership reduces productivity in the short run but increases 
productivity in the long run. 
 
Not only that, exports and foreign shareholding have different impacts in different fields. As in China, between 
industries with low energy consumption and industries with high levels of foreign capital, the influence of foreign 
ownership can have a different impact on IT manufacturing firms that have higher total factor productivity than IT 
service firms. So, this shows that exports and foreign ownership can have different impacts in different countries and 
in different fields, whereas ICTs tend not to have different impacts on companies that use or do not use ICTs, even 
though the industry is only associated with profitable bilateral trade.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the global economy, including Indonesia. As the backbone of Indonesia’s 
national economy, MSMEs has been affected by the pandemic which adds to the various problems it already has. 
Some of MSMEs problems are weakness of business legality; unclear business model; no separation between personal 
and corporate wealth; limited business capital and human resources; lack of professional management, innovation, 
creativity, and technology literate; and lack of accounting knowledge in making accounting decisions. This paper aims 
to investigate the effect of digital business strategy, mental accounting, and growth mindset on MSMEs Business 
Performance that could help MSMEs overcome their problems. This research uses a quantitative method using 
questionnaires with 66 items. The sampling technique uses convenient sampling. This study uses a sample of 95 
respondents from MSMEs operating in South Tangerang with minimum business age of 3 years. This study uses a 
statistical method with the IBM SPSS Statistics 28 program as a test tool. The result indicates that digital business 
strategy and growth mindset have a positive effect on business performance. Meanwhile, mental accounting does not 
affect business performance. This proves that entrepreneurs need knowledge and vision concerning digital 
transformation to drive competitive advantage. Entrepreneurs need to have creativity and innovation to enhance 
MSMEs' business performance to develop the business.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the global economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
2020 estimated the median global gross domestic product (GDP) dropped by 3.9% from 2019 to 2020, making it the 
worst economic downturn since the Great Depression (Oum et al. 2022). The economic effect of COVID-19 also hit 
Indonesia. According to the data from IMF, Indonesia's GDP dropped by 7.1% in 2020. Although it increased in 2021 
by 5.3%, it is still below pre-pandemic GDP. According to the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, Indonesia has 
64.2 million MSMEs contributing to a GDP of 61.07%. However, COVID-19-related health protocols such as 
restrictions to community activities, limitations on public places visitors, and business operational hour restrictions 
reduce the number of customers needed by MSMEs to survive (Afriza 2021).  In response to the MSMEs problem 
described, this paper aims to research business performance determinants of MSMEs, especially in South Tangerang, 
Indonesia. 
MSMEs in South Tangerang continue to look for information about market opportunities and product development 
(Indrajaya and Bastian 2021). However, in their operation, they have a few other problems such as weakness of 
business legality; unclear business model; no separation between personal and corporate wealth; limited business 
capital and human resources; lack of professional management, innovation, creativity, and technology literate; and 
lack of accounting knowledge in making accounting decisions (Irawan and Chandranegara 2017; Khairunnisa and 
Rustiana 2019). Therefore, a few factors can affect MSMEs' business performance. This paper wants to highlight the 
effect of digital business strategy, mental accounting, and growth mindset as an internal factor of MSMEs that could 
help businesses overcome the stated problems.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a unitary state in the form of a Republic and is made up of Provinces, Regencies/Cities, Districts, Sub – 
Districts and Villages which are the smallest units of the government structure. Based on Law Number 6 of 2014 
concerning Villages which explains that a village is a group of legal communities that have territorial boundaries and 
have the right to participate in government matters, the interests of the surrounding community based on community 
initiatives, origin rights recognized in the government of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia. Batang 
Regency is one of the regencies/cities in Central Java, Indonesia. Based on the Batang Regency Regional Regulation 
Number 7 of 2004 concerning the Establishment of Batang Regency Subdistricts, the number of subs – districts in 
Batang Regency which was originally 12 sub – districts have changed to 15 sub – districts and 239 villages. 
Village expenditure is an expenditure used for the benefit of village activities. The village expenditures in question 
can be in the form of village expenditures in the field of village administration, the field of implementing village 
development, the field of village community empowerment in the field of village community development and the 
field of unexpected spending. Hutami. (2017). Village expenditures in accordance with the provisions of Government 
Regulation Article 100 Number 47 of 2015 namely, at least seventy percent (70%) of the total village expenditure 
budget is used to fund village administration, implementation of village development, village community development 
and community empowerment. village, and at least thirty percent (30%) of the total village budget is used for fixed 
income and allowances for the village head and village officials, village operations, allowances and operations of the 
Village Consultative Body, and institutional assistance used for village operations. Village Expenditures are also part 
of the annual financial plan organized by the village government, village community development, village community 
empowerment, and implementation of village development based on Article 12 of the Minister of Home Affairs

a.
The Effect of Original Village Income on Village Expenditure
The significance value of the independent variable of the original village income is 0.000 which is less than
0.05 (0.000 < 0.05). So, it can be concluded that H1 is accepted, which means that the independent variable
of original village income partially has a positive effect on village spending. (Table 8)
b.
Effect of Village Funds on Village Spending
The significance value of the independent village fund variable is 0.000 which is less than 0.05 (0.000 < 0.05).
So, it can be concluded that H2 is accepted, which means that the independent village fund variable partially
has a positive effect on village spending.
c.
Effect of Tax Revenue Sharing – Retributions on Village Spending
The significance value of the independent variable for tax revenue sharing – Retributions is 0.000 which is
less than 0.05 (0.000 < 0.05). So it can be concluded that H3 is accepted, which means that the independent
variable of tax revenue sharing partially affects village spending.
5.5 Discussion of Research Results 
5.5.1 The Effect of Village Original Income, Village Funds, Tax Profit Sharing – Retributions on 
Simultaneous Village Expenditures 
The results of testing the coefficient of determination (R²) obtained a value of 0.299 or 29.9%. This states that the 
dependent variable of village expenditure in villages in Batang Regency in 2020 can be explained by the independent 
variables of village original income, village funds and Retributions tax revenue sharing with a magnitude of 29 ,9% 
while the other 70.1% is explained by other variables that are not explained in this study. Based on the results of the 
simultaneous test (Test – F) in Table 7, it shows a significance value of 0.000 which is smaller than 0.05 so it can be 
stated that the independent variables used in the study are village original income, village funds, and the profit sharing 
of the Retributions tax has a simultaneous effect on village expenditure in villages in Batang Regency in 2020. 
5.5.2 The Effect of Village Original Income on Village Expenditures Partially 
Based on the results of the partial test (Test – t) it shows the significance value of the independent variable of village 
original income which is 0.000 which is smaller than 0.05 (0.000 < 0.05). Which means that the independent variable 
of village original income partially has a positive effect on village expenditure. If a village gets a high original village 
income, then the village expenditure that will be issued by the village will also increase. 
5.5.3 The Effect of Village Funds on Village Expenditures Partially 
Based on the results of the partial test (Test - t) shows the significance value of the independent variable of village 
funds is 0.000 which is smaller than 0.05 (0.000 < 0.05). Which means that the independent variable of village funds 
partially has a positive effect on village spending. 
5.5.4 The Effect of Tax Revenue Sharing – Retributions on Village Expenditures Partially 
Based on the results of the partial test (Test – t) it shows the significance value of the independent variable of village 
original income which is 0.000 which is smaller than 0.05 (0.000 < 0.05). Which means that the independent variable 
for the results of taxes – Retributions partially has a positive effect on village expenditure. 
6. Conclusion
This study aims to determine whether the effect of village original income, village funds, and revenue sharing – 
Retributions on village expenditures in villages in Batang Regency in 2020. This research was conducted based on 
the report Village Finance obtained from the official website of the Central Bureau of Statistics of the Batang Regency 
Government. Based on the results of the analysis that has been done, namely descriptive statistical analysis and testing

Abstract 
As a form of efficiency from traditional farming systems, hydroponics is an urban farming system that does not use 
soil media. The current conditions in Indonesia and the narrowing of the Malang City area necessitate using 
hydroponics as a solution. Pion Hydro Farm as a start-up assists urban farms in meeting food needs and becoming a 
destination for young farmers. The method employed in this paper is an experimental study carried out in the Malang 
district of East Java, Indonesia. There are four stages in making this start-up business, starting from using simple 
materials such as waste oil gallons and palm oil, purchasing four wick hydroponic systems growing media, purchasing 
hydroponic production equipment in a 36-hole hydroponic starter kit, and purchasing a hydroponic ""A"" style with 180 
planting holes. The investigation was furthered by creating a minimarket design that aims to accommodate Pion Hydro 
Farm production. It seeks to create a good farming system integration and make reaching the intended market easier. 
It aims to improve farming system integration and make it easier for Pion Hydro farm to reach its target market. Pion 
Hydro farm promotes itself as a viable solution for addressing people's daily vegetable needs and a leader in catering 
to the younger generation.

1. Introduction
A conventional farming system still dominates agriculture in Indonesia (Sibarani & Somboonsuke, 2020). Traditional 
agriculture uses traditional techniques that utilize high production sources to obtain high outputs quickly. Traditional 
methods also have a lot of negative impacts on human health and the living environment (AlShrouf, 2017). It is due 
to the dominance of pesticides and the pruning of large amounts of green land to produce superior or quality 
agricultural products (Riedo et al., 2021). Therefore, conventional farming systems require shifting from the ""Green 
Revolution"" design to building a more modern agricultural system to create sustainable agriculture (Aulia Hidayat et 
al., 2020; John & Babu, 2021).  
This transition led the author to switch to the agricultural industry sector using an urban farming system. Urban 
Farming is an agricultural system that utilizes limited land in urban areas by implementing the planting techniques 
that apply sustainable agriculture to complete the future needs (Andini et al., 2021; Indah et al., 2020). The concept 
of urban farming is the transition from conventional agriculture to urban agriculture, with the only difference being 
the farmer and the planting medium (Zuraiyah et al., 2019). This transition is the author's initial step to being a young 
farmer and initiating modern planting media techniques to support food needs in Indonesia.

4. Conclusion  
Long-term food supply completion is hampered by the crisis of a low number of Indonesian farmers. The current 
situation necessitates a transition away from conventional agriculture to meet the need for sustainable agricultural 
goods, particularly vegetables. People are still addicted to eating conventional vegetables and will require education 
to modify their habits. The critical challenge necessitates the younger generation's engagement to meet the farming 
interest. The author became a hydroponic farmer to solve a broad and narrow problem as an example of the first phase. 
As a transitional option from conventional farming, hydroponics provides an effective growing medium as an urban 
farming method. The hydroponics concept serves as the essential foundation for presenting Pion Hydro Farm. It begins 
with a modest implementation stage and progresses to the planning step of building a minimarket store. It seeks to 
create a good farming system integration and make it easier for us to reach the intended market. Pion Hydro farm 
advertises itself as a viable solution for meeting people's daily vegetable needs and a forerunner in catering to the 
younger generation. 
 
This study still uses the manual irrigation system. As a result, it requires an operator responsible for this hydroponic 
irrigation system. The following research can utilize technology in hydroponic irrigation systems using IoT. Watering 
can be done automatically by using a sensor to read the power of hydrogen (pH) of the growing media. Moreover, 
there are still imperfections in the minimarket design. Therefore, the following research can improve a more 
sustainable design by prioritizing green materials.

Abstract 
This paper aims to study the behaviour of formality of 390 microenterprises (ME) and its impact, based on data from a 
survey that was conducted in the city of Casablanca. We explain, on one hand, the choice of the level of formality using 
an Ordered Probit model. On the other hand, we analyse the effect of registration and other factors on productivity, using 
the Stochastic Frontier Approach which considers the risk of self-selection. 
The results from the first model emphasize the effect of the entrepreneur's demographic and socio-economic 
characteristics as well as those related to the ME and its environment. 
The Stochastic Frontier Approach allowed us to verify the existence of a differentiated efficiency bared on the level of 
formality. It also appears that the education level of the owner, gender and age of the employees, the main reason for 
business creation and its size, impact productivity.

1. Introduction: context and purpose of the study
1.1 Context
Before the modernization of economies and the emergence of the sovereign role of States, the informal economy was a
rule and not an exception. Today, the informal sector exists in all countries (with different degrees of importance); its
magnitude is more evident in developing economies.
The study of the informal sector is useful to identify its importance and specificities, as well as to analyse its actors’ 
behaviour. It is also important to understand its links with the formal sector and the conditions for its formalization. 
In Morocco, the strong demographic growth since the 60’s and the rural exodus led to a very important urbanization1. 
The share of the urban population has thus increased from 29.1% in 1960 to 60.3% now. Since economic growth has not 
been able to absorb all entrants into the labour market (especially in 1999, the urban unemployment rate was 22% against 
5.4% in rural areas), the country witnessed a progressive development of informal activities. 
Policies implemented as part of the structural adjustment plan that was adopted between 1983 and 1992 and agreed upon 
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB), helped restore the main global balances 
(reduction of budget deficits and the balance of payments, as well as the pace of inflation). However, they did not put the 
country on paths of sufficient growth: the rates achieved were around 4% on average, but the rate required for countries 
at the same level of development is around 7% (3% to absorb the flow of newcomers into the labour market, 2% to absorb 
the stock of unemployed and disguised unemployed (poverty) and 2% to account for normal productivity gains). These 
conditions have increased the propensity for self-employment, often synonymous with informal activities. According 
1 The growth rates of the total and urban population increased from 2.5% and 4.3% between the 60’s and 70’s to 2.6% and 4.4% between the 70’s and 
80’s. See the website of the Haut- Commissariat au Plan (HCP), the institution in charge of official statistics in Morocco. www.hcp.ma

The increase in the proportion of women in the workforce has a negative and significant impact on productivity. This 
finding supports the conclusions of Becker (1985) and Petersen & al (2006). 
 
When the share of young people (under 31 years of age) increases, efficiency decreases. The experience of the staff 
allows us to refine specialization and therefore contributes to improving productivity. This result is shared by Taymaz 
(2009). 
 
A high level of education will increase efficiency. Education is seen as a factor in developing and refining the 
entrepreneur's management skills (Taymaz, 2009; De Vries, 2010). 
 
To analyse the effect of motivation on entrepreneurs' efficiency behaviour, we included the reasons for the creation of 
the ME in the estimates. The latter show that, compared to entrepreneurs seeking independence, those who did not find 
a job before the creation of their firm are the most productive. This result is explained by the fear of failure among 
these individuals if they are unable to succeed in their project. Launching a project for reasons of profitability is a 
variable that acts positively and significantly increases the efficiency of the UP, all other things being equal. 
 
The seniority of the ME does not seem significant in the efficiency model. The ambiguity of the variable is attributed 
to two neutralizing effects. In one category of enterprises, seniority is reflected in archaic techniques and management 
methods. While in another, a firm that has been in existence for some time, could be more efficient thanks to learning-
by-doing. 
 
The increase in the number of workers leads to an increase in productivity (Chapelle and Plane,2005). 
Contrary to the conclusion of Doms et al (2004), the use of a computer connected to the Internet has no effect on 
productivity improvement. In Morocco, the use of computer equipment in the firm's activity such as stock management 
or advertising is still very limited. The estimate (2, Table 3) shows that the granting of bonuses has no impact on 
productivity growth. 
 
6. Conclusion and limitations of the study 
In developing countries, the informal sector plays an important role in creating value added. Several studies have 
shown that informal activities are often characterized by low productivity, which could have negative effects on total 
factor productivity. Public policies that target the formalization of the informal sector should consider both the factors 
that encourage activity registration and those that impact productivity. 
 
Using data on a sample of 390 Microenterprises (ME) from the city of Casablanca, this paper suggests an answer to 
two questions. The first analyses the determinants of ME choice to declare their activities, using an ordered Probit 
model. The second question verifies the existence of differences in productivities between informal, semi-formal and 
formal units, as well as to study their causes using the stochastic frontier approach12. The risk of ME’s self- selection 
was addressed through an instrumental variable indicating the share of informal inputs in the total inputs of the ME. 
This choice is motivated by the suggestion of De Vries (2010). 
 
The results from the first model focus on the effect of demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the 
entrepreneur on one hand, as well as the impact of the characteristics of the ME and their environment on the other 
hand. 
 
The stochastic frontier approach concluded that the elasticity of productivity over hours worked is greater than the 
one for capital. We also noted the existence of decreasing returns to scale which implies the absence of economies of 
scale. The hypothesis of the productivity gap between the formal, semi-formal and informal units has been verified. It 
also appears that the level of education of the owner and the characteristics of the staff, in terms of gender and 
professional experience, have a significant impact on productivity. The sample data shows that even within units with 
less than ten workers, we can observe heterogeneity of efficiency due to the variation in the size of the ME. 
 
The improvement of productivity after formalization of companies is often due to better integration in the financial 
 
12 We consider an ME is informal if it is not declared to the authorities, semi-formal if it has completed only a part of the procedures and formal if 
it has completed all the registration formalities.

sphere (access to bank credit or loan of honour ...), economic (Government’s support programs for technical assistance, 
vocational training ...), digital (access to new technologies ...) and social (medical coverage and retirement ...). 
Since September 2015, Morocco has put in place a new law dedicated to individuals who work individually. The main 
objective of this status is to promote the formalization of self- employed employees through an administrative 
procedure of simplified creation and dissolution, a specific tax regime and an adapted social coverage13. 
Despite the efforts and ambitious measures implemented by the public authorities, the Informal sector remains a 
structural and resilient component of the national economy; it induces multiple economic and social risks: 
- Generator of precariousness in employment and business and quality of life of population.
- Challenging the processes of good governance in social and economic affairs.
- Control approaches of informal activities often lead to dilemmas in which security and social issues are intertwined,
which freeze public interventions.
The analysis conducted in this study could be further developed if we had a larger sample that focused on different
activity sectors and regions of Morocco to highlight the effect of regional economic development dynamics. These
results can also be developed by adopting a panel analysis, which integrates the temporal dimension to capture
microenterprise behavioural evolution over time.

Abstract 
The surge of COVID-19 in the middle of 2021 in Indonesia, made the Indonesian Government decided to implement 
the Emergency Public Activity Restriction (PPKM Darurat). This study aims to understand the impact of the 
Indonesian Government’s communication strategy during the implementation of Emergency Public Activity 
Restriction (PPKM Darurat) on the compliance of the East Java people towards health protocols. By using the 
assumption of the governmental communication theory (with Behavior Change Communication approach),, this study 
focused on the impact of communication in the aspect of cognitive, affective, and behavior of the people of East Java. 
Done with a quantitative method with a case study of the people of Surabaya and Malang city, the result of this study 
shown that there is a significant impact on the compliance of the East Java people towards health protocols caused by 
the Indonesian Government’s communication strategy during the Emergency Public Activity Restriction (PPKM 
Darurat). According to the survey results, the communication strategy implemented by the Indonesian Government is 
impactful to influence the behavior of the people to comply the health protocols in attempt to control the COVID-19 
pandemic situation.

1. Introductions
First detected in India, The Delta Variant (B.1,617.2) is a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. 
In May 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the Delta variant has been categorized as a variant of 
concern (VoC) (Chow 2021) because it has been shown to have a higher risk of transmission, has more severe side 
effects (Chow 2021) with increasing number of hospitalization cases or deaths, and reducing the effectiveness of 
naturalization of the virus by antibodies formed from previous infections, vaccinations, to medical treatment (Centres 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2021). In addition to WHO, in the United States the Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) has also categorized the Delta Variant as a variant of concern on June 15, 2021 (Chow 
2021). 
In Indonesia itself, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia (Kemenkes RI) had confirmed that there were 
3 variants of the Corona Virus from abroad that had entered Indonesia on May 3, 2021, where the Delta variant is one 
of them which was found in 2 positive cases of COVID-19 in Jakarta (Velarosdela 2021). On the same month, 
Indonesia also saw a significant surge in COVID-19 case, on June 24, 2021 based on data obtained from the COVID-
19 Task Force (Covid-19 Task Force), the number of active cases managed to reach 20,000. The surge of active cases 
in Indonesia was also accompanied by the soaring Bed Occupancy Rate (BOR) of the referred COVID-19 which 
reached more than 70% (Farisa 2021). 
With the significant surge of COVID-19 case accompanied by the increasing hospitalization case that made the BOR 
getting closer to its maximum capacity, The Indonesian Government represented by Joko Widodo (President of

The last aspect is the behavioural aspect shown by the community in response to the Indonesian Government 
Communications to handle the COVID-19 pandemic with the implementation of Emergency PPKM. Based on a 
survey that has been distributed to 411 respondents, as many as 83.2% of respondents claimed to have implemented 
or implemented the rules, policies, or Emergency PPKM protocols well. Meanwhile, as many as 77.9% of respondents 
are willing to invite people around them to carry out the health rules, policies, or protocols that apply during 
Emergency PPKM properly. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of the survey distributed to respondents, with the average level of respondent agreement on the 
performance indicators of the directive pattern reaching 71.6%, this pattern is said to be the most influential pattern, 
which is then followed by the non-directive pattern at level 65. %, and the last is the pattern of public communication 
at the level of 64.9%. 
Meanwhile, the cognitive aspect is the aspect that is most influenced by the Indonesian Government's communication 
strategy during the Emergency PPKM period with the average respondent's approval of the indicator being at the level 
of 83.6%, then followed by the behavioural aspect at the level of 80.55%, and the last is the affective aspect at the 
level of 73.9%. These results are in line with the assumption of stubborn audience theory which states that each 
individual will filter, select, and internally process all messages he receives, where despite the respondent's 
understanding and knowledge of what Emergency PPKM is, what rules are applied, and the reasons why Emergency 
PPKM is implemented, it does not necessarily affect the respondent's behaviour to carry out or implement things that 
they understand and know. 
Based on the tests that have been carried out previously, the effect of the independent or independent variable (the 
Indonesian Government's communication strategy during the Emergency PPKM period) on the dependent variable 
(East Java population compliance with health protocols) is 50.8%, meanwhile, the rest is influenced by other variables 
not discussed in the study. The Government of Indonesia needs to increase the efforts of the communication strategy 
with a non-directive pattern, by increasing dialogue or interaction with the community because based on the results of 
a survey of respondents, only 50.8% of respondents felt that the Government of Indonesia responded to the aspirations 
of the community related to PPKM Emergency and COVID -19 well. In addition, the Government also needs to further 
enhance the efforts of public communication patterns by better communicating the rules and policies established 
during the Emergency PPKM period and their implementation or implementation which must be carried out better as 
well. 
Future studies can examine the effect of the Indonesian Government's communication strategy during the Emergency 
PPKM period on the compliance of residents of other provinces in complying with health protocols and other factors 
that affect the compliance of the population of East Java province or other provinces in complying with health 
protocols.

Abstract 
This study estimates the size of the non-observed economy (NOE) in Morocco and analyzes its evolution over the 
period 1977 - 2019. We estimate a currency demand function following Tanzi’s (1980; 1983) Currency Demand 
Method, and put emphasis not only on the classical variables of the equation but also on other variables that are specific 
to the Moroccan economy’s context. Therefore, we introduce a dummy variable that captures the impact of banking 
regulations, net remittances, consumer price index, the part of government’s final public consumption in the Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) and the part of public investment in GDP. Our econometric analysis shows that remittances 
have a negative effect on currency demand. The weight of taxation, reforms, rising living costs, the part of wages in 
the national revenue, the consumer price index as well as the parts of public consumption and investment in GDP have 
a positive impact on the quantity of currency circulating in the economy. The results also show that the size of the 
NOE averaged 42% over the entire period under study and reached 67% by 2019. 
From a methodological point of view, we took into consideration the difference in money velocities between the 
formal and informal sectors using the Ahumada et al.’s (2006) correction. We also adopted the fully modified least 
squares (FM-OLS) in order to tackle the series’ cointegration and to circumvent the serial autocorrelation issues.  
Keywords 
Non-observed economy, tax burden, fiscal evasion, money velocity, currency demand method. 
1. Introduction
Informal activities are present in all economies but predominant in developing ones. The size of the informal economy 
in these countries was estimated at 35.1% of official GDP in 2006, compared to 33.7% and 16.6% respectively in 
transition and OECD countries (Schneider & al., 2010). In 2000, the informal sector accounted for 37.7% of GDP in 
North Africa (United Nations (2008)). 
In Morocco, the informal sector contributed to up to 40.8% of employment in 2007. The latest data produced by the 
country’s official statistics organization (Haut-Commissariat au Plan, HCP) through its survey showed that in 2013 
this percentage reached 36%. During the same year, the informal sector contributed to 12.6% of the country’s value 
added. This percentage excludes informal jobs and value created by the agricultural sector as well as the public and 
local government. It also omits revenues that evade taxes or are generated through illegal activities. The latest report 
on “the national survey on the informal sector” produced by the HCP provides data on the economic characteristics 
of informal production units (IPUs). The survey is limited to non-agricultural activities, but takes into account artisanal

Abstract 
Time is of the essence in disaster relief operation. The casualties might be huge if disaster relief operation can’t be 
done quickly. The broken infrastructure and post-disaster environment make it difficult to search for survivors. To 
solve this, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is deployed since UAV can survey the location easily from the air. One 
downside of UAV is its limited energy capacity. UAV needs to be deployed with a Ground Vehicle (GV) who charges 
or swaps UAV battery during the operation. As such, the coordination between UAV and GV becomes an important 
part in the operation. This research focuses on constructing a route for the UAV – GV to find survivors using Ant 
Colony Optimization (ACO). The studied case is the 2010 Merapi eruption, which is one of the volcano eruptions in 
Indonesia. The result of this research will be compared with the result from previous research that used Depth-First 
Search (DFS). The route from ACO needs 90.48 minutes to complete whereas the route from previous research needs 
95.48 minutes, implying that the route evaluated using ACO results in 5 minutes faster than that constructed using 
DFS.

1. Introduction
According to the Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB), a National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure 
in Indonesia, a disaster is an event or series of events that threatens and disrupts people's lives and livelihoods caused 
by both natural and/or non-natural factors as well as human factors, resulting in human casualties, environmental 
damage, property losses, and psychological impacts. Disasters can also cause residents to evacuate because their 
homes have been damaged due to the disaster. Indonesia is a country prone to disasters. According to BNPB, in the 
period from January 1 to January 18, 2021, there have been 154 natural disasters in Indonesia, mostly floods, 
hurricanes and landslides. Natural disasters that occurred resulted in damaged infrastructure so that the disaster 
management process took a long time. One way that can be used to reduce the time is to use an Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle (UAV). 
The UAV is able to complete tasks 50.4% faster or more than half of the conventional methods required according to 
a survey by Volkmann in 2017. This proves that the UAV is suitable for tasks with limited time. This applies to post-
disaster activities, such as searching for survivors and damaged infrastructure. UAVs also have some drawbacks. One

The UAV on the ACS route finished serving Bakalan and Ngepringan in 5.48 minutes while on the Larasati route it 
finished serving Bakalan and Ngepringan in 7.24 minutes. There is time loss of 1.76 minutes. time loss may come 
from the same thing where the Larasati route can't do a shortcut but because of the limitations of DFS in determining 
the route. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research has succeeded in making models and programs for determining UAV routes and coordinating between 
UAVs and GVs using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The type of ACO used is the Ant Colony System which is a 
development of the Ant System that aims to solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).  
 
This study succeeded in finding the optimal route in the 2010 Merapi Case. This case consisted of 13 nodes target 
nodes optionalThe routes that have been generated are as follows: SMP Watuadeg – Balai Desa Wukirsari (P) – 
Bakalan – Ngepringan – Manggang – Kopeng – Petung (P) – Jambu (P) – Kaliadem – Srunen – Kalitengah Kidul – 
Kalitengah Lor – Kalitengah Kidul (P) – Srunen (P) – Kaliadem (P) – Palemsari (P) – Pangukrejo (P) – Barak 
Plosokerep (R) – Pangukrejo – Palemsari – Jambu – Petung – Batur – Barak Plosokerep (P) – Balai Desa 
Hargobinangum.  
 
These results indicate that all targets have been visited and from log the duration of the UAV has not exceeded the 
time limit. GV only visited the Plosokerep Barracks to recharge the UAV's energy. The duration of the route generated 
by 90.48 minutes; this route is 5 minutes faster than the route generated by the Depth-First Search by Larasati research 
(2019). This difference is mostly caused by the DFS method which cannot find from one node to shortcuts another, 
so it takes longer.

Abstract 
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion; accelerating an object from all positions to a specific velocity takes energy, 
and the object maintains the energy if the speed remains constant (The Global Wind Council, 2016). When the object 
decelerates, that energy from its motion can be moved in different ways; this energy is another form of generating 
electricity. The wind is a perfect, free, and promptly accessible renewable energy source. Every day, around the globe, 
wind turbines are catching the wind's capacity and changing over it to electricity. This source of intensity assumes an 
undeniably significant part in the manner in which we control our world. A wind turbine is a gadget that converts 
kinetic energy from the wind into electricity and the sharp edges of a wind turbine turn somewhere in the range of 13 
and 20 cycles for every minute, contingent upon their innovation, at a consistent or variable velocity, where the 
velocity of the rotor fluctuates in connection to the velocity of the wind to achieve a greater efficiency (Chang et al, 
2022). The article plans to analyze the significance of one renewable source of energy, which is wind energy. 
Investigation regarding what wind energy is about, how wind is generated, how it functions and what are the capacities 
incorporated into it will be outlined into detail. This will give a superior comprehension into the use of wind and how 
might it be utilized as a source of energy. As a result, this renewable energy contains advantages as well as 
disadvantages that might need to be evaluated by the implementer beforehand.

Abstract 
This research aims to study users’ acceptance in tele counseling via mobile app during global pandemic COVID-19. 
The research model adopts Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model with 
modifications including adding Perceived Risk variable and omitting Experience moderating variable. Structural 
Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to predict the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Partial 
Least Square (PLS) was used in statistical analysis. The result found that Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Condition, 
Social Influence and Hedonic Motivation doesn’t have significant effect on Reuse Intention. This model explains 
63.5% (R2 = 0.635) of variability of Reuse Intention and 55.3% (R2 = 0.553) of variability of Reuse Behavior. This 
research also analyses how gender and age moderates the independent and dependent variables. It is found that age 
only moderates Price Value towards Reuse Intention and Reuse Intention towards Reuse Behavior while gender 
doesn’t have moderating effect at all. This study provides new insight on factors affecting users’ acceptance especially 
in the context of mobile tele counseling app.

1. Introduction
The outburst of COVID-19 two years ago put the world in a sudden state of change. Many activities were disturbed 
and even put into halt. Lockdowns lasted for weeks, even months in some countries. This put people in shock and 
cause the rise of mental health disruption. The pandemic disrupted mental health service in 93% countries around the

technology. Study by Salgado et al. (2020) also found that EE does not significantly affect behavioral intention in 
mobile health acceptance. 
FC was found to be insignificant on RI. Like EE, respondents do not consider resources as an issue. This might be 
related to the increasing access in smartphone and internet. Survey by We Are Social (2021) shows 73.7% of total 
Indonesian population are connected to internet, and 98.2% of Indonesian aged 16-64 have smartphone (Kemp 2021). 
Study by Salgado et al. (2020) does not find FC to have significant effect on behavioral intention. Salgado et al. (2020) 
also suggest that the increasing access to mobile phone and internet affect samples’ evaluation towards FC. 
HM also has no significant effect on RI. Although contrary to traditional theory, this finding aligns with study by 
Tavares et al. (2016) found that HM has no significant impact on behavioral intention. Tavares et al. (2016) presume 
the health portal does not promote enjoyment as samples might associate it with disease or health problem. HM is 
defined as enjoyment or satisfaction of the use of technology. Respondents in this study might not perceive using Riliv 
as ‘fun’ or ‘entertaining’ as this app is used to help users who are feeling not well mentally. 
SI was also found to be insignificant on RI. The UTAUT model suggests that social influence plays a significant role 
in individual’s intention to use technology. However, this study does not support it. But this aligns with previous study 
by Yuan et al. (2015) on health and fitness app. The study presume that the use of the app might depend on what an 
individual perceives, and not influenced by their peer. Riliv itself is a mental health app. Mental health treatment or 
services can be very personal and not a one-size-fits-all. What works for one might not for others. Therefore, 
respondents might not consider others’ opinion to use the app.  
5.3 Moderating Effect 
Group comparison approach was used to examine age and gender’s moderating effect. Previous variables with no 
significant effect (EE, FC, HM, and SI) are excluded in this analysis. After dividing data into groups based on age and 
gender, each of the group data is examined by their path coefficient and compared. Result can be seen on Table 7.

T-value for each variable with age as moderating effect shows no significant difference except for relationship between
PV and RI. This indicates only hypotheses 7a are supported, meaning age has a significant role in PV affecting RI.
Meanwhile, t-value for each variable with gender as moderating effect shows no significant difference at all.
Therefore, hypotheses 1a, 6a, 7a, and 8a are not supported. This study found that gender does not have a significant
role in PE, PR, PV, and H affecting RI.
5.4 Proposed Improvements 
The model used in this research was adapted from previous UTAUT2 model by Venkatesh et al. (2012). Results from 
this study were able to explain factors influencing the technology acceptance which includes performance expectancy, 
effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, price value, habit, and perceived risk 
and their effects on reuse intention and reuse behavior. This study also analyzes age and gender as moderating effects 
between the factors and users’ intention to reuse. However, this study has several limitations. 
Samples from this study are aged ranging from 18-31. This is due to questionnaire distribution among people of 
mentioned age range. However, current author does not have the overall app user data which does not rule out the 
possibility of users above mentioned age range. Thus, further study is advised to have larger age range that includes 
all age of app user.

Samples from this study are also more saturated on women rather than men. Although this aligns with survey by 
PDSKJI (2020) mentioned before where respondents are primarily women, this still leave a room for improvement. 
Future study may use stratified sampling based on overall app used data. This way, samples can be more proportionally 
distributed. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In studying a mental health app, a modified UTAUT model was used to examine factors affecting users’ intention and 
behavior in reusing the app. Result shows that performance expectancy, price value, and habit significantly influence 
users’ reuse intention. The additional variable perceived risk also found to be significantly influencing reuse intention. 
The result indicates habit as the strongest predictor of reuse intention. Gender was found to not have significant effect 
in moderating independent variables with reuse intention. Age was found to have significant effect only in moderating 
price value with reuse intention. The overall model has a good explanatory ability, and is statistically better than 
models from preceding studies on health app. 
 
Result from this study show variables that are significant to users’ intention and behavior in reusing the app. In order 
to increase the usage rate of the application, it is recommended that service providers focus on their app performance 
and service pricing to compete with other providers. They should also keep in mind to not put their users’ data and 
privacy at risk. Age was found to have a significant role in moderating PV towards RI. However, this study has yet to 
conclude the reason from each age group. Further research should study factors influencing users’ evaluation on price 
value on different age groups. This can help mental health app providers set their pricing strategy for different segment 
of users.

Abstract 
This research intends to investigate the influence of eWOM on purchase intention via the mediation of brand image 
and customer attractiveness on the TikTok social media platform for the food and beverage industry in the Jakarta and 
Tangerang areas. This is a descriptive study that seeks to characterize the used variables. This study uses non-
probability sampling with judgment as its sampling method and collects data from 200 respondents using 
questionnaires. The questionnaires were distributed in Indonesian and were obtained from social media platform 
TikTok users who have an interest in food and beverage content. The data was analyzed using statistical application 
software, with the variables measured using a Likert scale. This study uses the smartPLS application to process and 
analyze data using the SEM model approach. The results showed that there was a significant effect of eWOM on 
purchase intention, eWOM on brand image, eWOM on customer attraction, and customer attraction on purchase 
intention. However, the brand image variable shows no significant effect on purchase intention.

1. Introduction
Digital technology is highly integrated with our lifestyle. Along with the development in technology, it is easier for 
everyone to disseminate information and communication. In the digital sphere, technology can connect people directly 
and indirectly (Bischoff et al., 2019). Technology use has grown significantly in recent years. This is a result of the 
lockdown policy based on the government's regulation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the regulation required 
people to stay at home. This then impacts the intensity of time spent by the community (Ni et al., 2020). This change 
brings an indirect impact on the community's consumption patterns. This is related to the use of technology in

industry. Although the industries studied are different, the results still show that there is a relationship between the 
two variables. 
According to the findings, CA has a significant impact on PI. It is known from the results that good content can attract 
consumers to buy F&B products. Brand should get consumers’ attention from the content quality displayed through 
social media so that consumers can decide to buy the product. This research's findings parallel those of a prior study, 
which concluded that CA had a significant impact on PI (Warasanti and Rustiadi, 2021). The previous study was 
conducted in the scope of the property industry, while this study is limited to an F & B industry. Although the industries 
studied are different, the results still show a relationship between the two variables. 
6. Conclusion & Future Research
This research intends to investigate the eWOM effect on PI via the mediation of BI and CA on TikTok for the F&B 
business in the Jakarta and Tangerang areas. From five hypotheses, four hypotheses accepted are that eWOM has a 
significant effect on PI; eWOM has a significant effect on BI; eWOM has a significant effect on CA; and CA has a 
significant effect on PI. In general, eWOM has a significant effect on PI because respondents see that video content 
significantly affects their lifestyle. Respondents also follow and have the same opinion regarding the information 
obtained from the video content. eWOM also affects BI because the average respondent collects information from 
video content to find out about the views, characteristics, and quality differentiation of F&B products from other users. 
eWOM affects CA by increasing the activity and quality of video content on the social media platform TikTok. The 
increase aims to create customer desire, which will decide to buy a product. However, in contrast to the hypothesis in 
this study, it shows an insignificant effect of BI on PI. The main reasons are based on assumptions, namely the limited 
number of samples, differences in respondent characteristics, and differences in the scope of the research industry. In 
addition, other factors that are more relevant need to be explored further. For future researchers, we suggest collecting 
more respondents for an accurate result. We also suggest adding more variables related to the topic and/or conducting 
the research in a different industry.

Abstract 
This study develops a procedure to prioritize delay factors of industrial projects. The concept of delay factors, and 
other related concerns have been examined in previous studies on construction projects. However, the delay factors 
of industrial projects are less examined. Furthermore, this problem is poorly linked with novel Multiple-Criteria 
Decision Making (MCDM) models such as Best-Worst Method (BWM). In this regard, to fill the gap of previous 
literature, two linked phases have been addressed to obtain different objectives of this research. The initial phase of 
this study investigates different delay factors of industrial projects. To do so, a literature review is conducted to 
develop numerous factors which cause delays in industrial projects. Next, the second phase of this research applies a 
BWM to investigate and prioritize these factors. According to the obtained results, contractors, consultants, climate, 
customers, shortages of raw materials, financial issues and poor manpower are the most important delay factors of 
industrial projects, respectively. Finally, a conclusion and some future research directions are provided in the final 
section of this research.

1. Introduction
The final output of an idea is directly related to a proper decision making (Hashemzahi et al., 2020). In this regard, it 
is critical to investigate different aspects of a decision considering their short, medium- and long-term effects 
(Hemmati et al., 2018:2019). As an important instance, there are many decisions which are necessary to complete 
industrial projects. In other words, many issues should be seen to complete an industrial project before the due time. 
More specifically, on-time completion of industrial projects is directly affected by numerous factors which cause 
delays and prevent managers to finish the task before the due date (Sweis et al., 2018). In this regard, it is necessary 
to recognize and prioritize them. There are many quantitative and qualitative Multiple-Criteria Decision Making 
(MCDM) tools to be applied in this problem (Tavassolirizi et al., 2020). 
With the progress of industrial revolutions, there are many industrial projects which should be completed. In other 
words, industrial projects play an important role in progressing the economic condition of countries, especially in 
developing countries. Furthermore, different industrial projects need numerous obligations such as technical issues, 
quality considerations, safety, manpower, and many others. However, among these different necessities, on time

6. Conclusion 
This research proposed a step by step methodology to rank different delay factors of industrial projects. As discussed, 
potential delay factors of projects, and their related tools and techniques have been vastly investigated in previous 
literature on construction industry. However, it was necessary to focus on different delay factors of industrial projects 
as they are less examined in recent literature. Additionally, the problem is not properly and adequately linked with 
recent MCDM techniques such as BWM. Therefore, with regard to these motivations, this research was completed in 
two linked phases as follows. The first phase of this study investigated numerous delay factors of industrial projects. 
To do so, a literature survey was completed to develop different delay factors of industrial projects. Following, a 
BWM was applied to investigate and prioritize different delay factors of industrial projects. The obtained results 
showed that contractors, consultants, climate, customers, shortages of raw materials, financial issues and poor 
manpower are the most important delay factors of industrial projects, respectively. As a direction for future research,

Abstract 
Programming problem solving ability is one of the basic skills of Software Engineering Vocational High School 
students. As a prospective programmer or software developer, vocational high school students must be able to 
understand problems, make plans and implement them in computer programs. However, research that tries to explore 
the level of problem solving ability in programming, especially for vocational high school students is still few or even 
non-existent. The purposes of this research are 1) to know how good problem-solving skill of vocational high school 
students, 2) to explore problems of programming teaching and learning especially in the pandemic era, 3) to analyze 
which problems influenced student’s programming problem solving skill according to relevant theory. This research 
is a mix method research with sequential explanatory model. The result of the study showed that programming 
problem solving ability is low. From 83 respondents, the average problem-solving score was 33.37 out of 100. Based 
on the data from questionnaires interviews and learning documents we identify some problems occurred in 
programming class. By analyzing them with relevant theories, we found several problems in programming class which 
indicated influencing programming problem solving skill. Those are:  lack of motivation and self-confidence, lack of

6) lack of learning experience in solving problems using programming. It can be seen from the modules, job sheets,
and lesson plans, which are only syntax-based with no problems to be solved.
7) the wrong perception of problem-based learning of the teacher
As explained earlier, Park and Jang (2010) stated that the factors that influence problem solving abilities are divided 
into 5: from the students themselves, the learning environment, the role of teachers and tutors, the interaction of fellow 
students, and the characteristics of the problem. 
Factors that come from students include cognitive, metacognitive, self-confidence and ICT literacy. From the results 
of document analysis, learning plan documents are not settled in improving cognitive and metacognitive abilities. 
Learning plan still emphasizes at cognitive skills levels 2-3 (C2, C3), which are remembering and applying. We need 
some efforts to improve students' high order thinking skill, which are reflected in the definition of goals, activity steps, 
and evaluation. In this case problem-based learning can be applied. Problem-based learning encourages students to be 
able to think analytically (C4) in identifying problems and formulating solutions to evaluating solutions (C5). Based 
on previous research, problem-based learning also can improve motivation (Nuutila, Törmä, and Malmi 2005) and 
enhance the quality of students' learning and problem solving (Looi and Seyal 2014). On the other hand, low self-
confidence and ICT literacy skills were also identified as the cause of low problem-solving abilities. The lack of 
facilities causes some students afraid to try coding. 
The next factor that affects problem solving ability is the learning environment, the role of teachers and tutors, 
interactions among students, and the characteristics of the problem. Related to these factors, we can identify learning 
problems affecting problem solving skill. The learning environment acts as a support system that provides the 
necessary resources and tools to guide problem solving. One of the problems is the lack of appropriate learning 
resources in suitable language which also support problem solving skills. Modules are still in syntax-based rather than 
problem-based. The environment also has not accommodated for mentoring the students who has difficulty in learning. 
Based on the document analysis, interaction between students already exists, reflected in the designed learning 
strategies. The teacher involves students in group work. However, the existing documents do not show any variations 
of problems to be solved. So that students are not familiar with various kinds of problems and they will have difficulty 
in solving new problems. 
6. CONCLUSION
The result of the study showed that programming problem solving ability is low. From 83 respondents, the average 
problem-solving score was 33.37 out of 100. Based on the data from questionnaires interviews and learning documents 
we identify some problems occurred in programming class, which are: lack of appropriate learning resources, low 
student motivation and self-confidence, lack of facilities, especially laptops or computers to practice programming at 
home, ack of feedback and direction for students who has difficulty in learning, lack of students' understanding of the 
problem solving steps in programming, where some students directly type program code without make any plan,  lack 
of learning experience in solving problems using programming, and the wrong perception of problem-based learning 
of the teacher. By analyzing them with relevant theories, we found several problems in programming class which 
indicated influencing programming problem solving skill, which are:  lack of motivation and self-confidence, lack of 
learning resources, low ICT literation, programming learning which is still based on syntax only, and the lack of 
variety of problems to be solve in learning programming. The solution that can be offered to overcome this problem 
is to apply appropriate learning models such as problem-based learning. Programming learning is not only based on 
syntax but also provides a lot of experience for students to apply it to various problems. However, learning must also 
be interesting and fun so that students are motivated and engaged during learning. Further research as an effort to 
improve problem solving skills in programming is very much needed using appropriate learning strategies.

Abstract 
The environmental degradation caused by industries has triggered consumers to shift their consumption of 
conventional products to green products. Despite the government's efforts to promote green products, the consumption 
of green products is still scarce due to the low level of awareness of the healthy environment and green concept among 
consumers in Malaysia. Considering limited studies regarding green purchase intention in Malaysia, this study 
specifically focuses on investigating the influence of perceived determinants (attitude, subjective norms, perceived 
environmental concern, perceived environmental knowledge, perceived consumer effectiveness and government green 
initiatives) on consumers’ intentions to purchase green products and the moderating effect of price sensitivity. The 
study outcomes will benefit manufacturers, marketers, policymakers, and academicians.

1. Introduction
One of the world's leading issues nowadays is the environmental degradation caused by industries; thus, consumers 
have shifted from conventional products to green products (Chen & Chai, 2010). As a developing country, Malaysia 
is marching towards becoming a developed and sustainable nation, and much emphasis has been placed on the 
conservation of the environment (EPU, 2020). Hence, the Malaysian government, together with the other 192 world 
leaders, adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda) at the United Nations General 
Assembly in New York on September 25, 2015 (EPU, 2020). In addition, the Malaysian government has launched 
several green initiatives, including the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology, and Water (KeTHA), MyHIJAU, and 
the National eco-labelling scheme, to promote and encourage the public use of green technology and the consumption 
of green products. (Myhijau, 2018). In addition, the Malaysian government also signed on with ISO 14001 for 
environmental sustainability in Malaysia. ISO 14001 is an international standard focused on environmental 
management systems for organizations (Shaharudin et al., 2015). As per statistics from MyHIJAU (2021), the number 
of registered green products and services increased from 2041 in 2019 to 2315 in 2020. In addition, the target number 
of green products and services in 2020 was 5000, and the actual number was 7498, showing an increased number of 
registered green products and services. 
Despite government efforts, consumer purchasing of green products remains low in Malaysia (Rahman, 2018). In a 
recent report, Nielsen Global Survey (2021) stated that among developing countries, only China, India, Saudi Arabia, 
Thailand, South Korea, and Vietnam are listed where consumers have high purchasing behaviors toward green 
products. As a developing country, Malaysia is not on the list due to low awareness of the healthy environment and 
green concept (Yii, Shein & Ming, 2020). Therefore, this paper attempts to investigate consumers’ perceptions of 
green products and government green initiatives toward environmental sustainability in Malaysia from the consumers' 
perspective. Despite this fact, literature providing an understanding of the perceived determinants influencing

Abstract 
The increasing demand for electricity is not matched by an increase in the use of renewable electricity sources, causing 
climate change due to the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity. In addition, there are areas with remote and deepest 
access that do not yet enjoy electricity for their daily activities. This research uses the morphological chart method 
and the Pugh matrix, so that a portable and modular hydroelectric power plant can be produced to help people in 
remote areas enjoy electricity. From the results of the design and manufacture of a hydroelectric power plant, an output 
power is generated that can be used for home lighting. The power released from the power plant reaches 30W with 
the resulting efficiency reaching 2.382%. By utilizing river currents with a larger discharge and directing the river 
flow to the equipment, greater electrical energy can be generated. The electrical energy produced can be directly used 
or accommodated in an electrical reservoir such as a battery with a voltage of 12V DC.

1. Introduction
The use of fossil fuels such as coal brings many problems such as the impact on the environment, economy,
health, and unstable prices in the market. There is a strong relationship between energy consumption, air
pollution, water resources, and natural resource costs(Martins et al., 2019). The process of producing electrical
energy is believed to have an impact on climate change and the use of fuel in motor vehicles and machinery in
factories also has a negative impact on the environment.(Lott et al., 2017). The geography of Indonesia which is
an archipelagic country, contours that have various low and highlands, and regular hydrological cycles with
various springs in Indonesia make the potential for renewable energy from water in Indonesia more and more.
Around 75,000 MW of energy that is still available as potential comes from water and only about 9% is
utilized(Kholiq, 2015). The conversion of kinetic energy into electricity will be converted using an electric
generator. An electric generator will convert kinetic energy into electricity by utilizing the electromagnetic force
from the rotor and stator on the dynamo. Picco and micro scale generators can be an alternative in areas that have
less electricity infrastructure such as in remote areas and leading, underdeveloped, and remote areas because of
their compact size and the electricity generated is sufficient to power household electricity needs.(Fortaleza et
al., 2018). Morphological map is a table that contains alternatives of a function that can be arranged to become
several alternative solutions in the design stage of an item(Smith, 2007)
1.1 Research purposes 
The purpose of doing research by applying this morphological map is as follows: 
1. To design PLTPH by applying a morphological map before designing PLTPH
2. To make a prototype of PLTPH as a result of the design
3. Knowing the output power of the PLTPH made
4. Making PLTPH with a portable design so that it can be used in hard-to-reach areas

In the application of morphological maps, it is known that there are 5 sub-functions that need to be considered 
in designing the tool to be made. Of the 5 sub-functions, there are alternatives for each sub-function available in 
the market. From each sub-function and alternative, 6 concepts were compiled with concept 2 being selected 
from the basic concept, namely concept 1 as a comparison in the concept selection process using the Pugh matrix. 
From the selected concept, a tool specification design can be generated and drawn on the Solidworks application 
With the design that has been drawn on Solidworks, a prototype is made according to the chosen concept for 
testing and data collection. 
Based on data retrieval from the prototype concept that has been designed, the resulting power is still relatively 
small, namely <100W. This power can be used for lighting lamps and can be accommodated in a larger container 
so that the power that can be used can be greater. 
Making tools using morphological maps and Pugh matrices can help researchers in determining a more conical 
concept from the many alternative sub-functions that exist. From the chosen concept, the PLTPH design can be 
made and tools can be built to help people who still cannot enjoy electricity. This research resulted in a tool that 
can convert kinetic energy in water into electrical energy, but with low efficiency and the power generated is still 
small. The power generated is sufficient for lighting and can be accommodated for emergencies without paying 
for electricity.

Abstract 
This study develops a model that examines the relationship between safety leadership, safety knowledge, and safety 
culture on safety performance by moderating the personality traits of workers. This model is further evaluated to 
determine whether the latent variables of leadership attitudes about safety, the knowledge they have of safety by 
workers, the formed safety culture and personality as defined in the safety theory and personality traits theory, can 
significantly influence safety performance. The research model was empirically tested using data collected from 70 
workers. To know the relationship between latent variables and interactions with moderation variables, this study uses 
the structural equation model (SEM) method. The results show that all variables have a significant relationship to 
safety performance, but personality traits cannot moderate the relationship between all independent variables on safety 
performance.

1. Introduction
An accident is a phenomenon that threatens the health of the workforce which has been expanded by technological 
advances and caused financial losses for social communities (Barkhordari et el. 2019). The cause of work accidents 
is the presence of unsafe actions and unsafe behavior (Guglielmi et al. 2022). Unsafe behavior factors cause 76% of 
accidents in various industries in the USA (Wang et al. 2019). One of the causes of unsafe behavior and unsafe 
conditions is poor safety leadership. Without effective safety leadership, a person will not have good safety 
performance (Moosa and Oriet 2022). One of the roles of safety leadership is to coordinate workers to participate in 
discussions by providing input and information related to activities in the workplace so that leaders can find out about 
faulty work system problems and determine strategies to solve these problems. In the process of forming a strategy, 
knowledge about the safety of workers is needed. Safety knowledge is an understanding of theoretical safety by 
applying it to creating safety behaviors at work (Ghasemi et al. 2022). Good safety knowledge will result in a healthy 
work environment and workers who prioritize work safety. The work environment reflects how the safety culture in 
the industry is formed. No matter how good a company provides protection or builds a safe work environment, does 
not always result in better safety performance without an increase in safety culture (Mohammadi et al. 2018). 
Psychological aspects are not only part of organizational culture but can also determine an individual's safety

5.3 Personality Traits Moderation 
An assessment of personality traits is important to see how the respondent's behavior tends to be. Personality traits are 
divided into five factors which consist of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and 
Neuroticism. The assessment is done by calculating the norm categorization. (Figure 4) 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Personality traits category of research participant 
 
Based on the results of the hypothesis (H7, H8, and H9), show that the interaction between personality traits and 
independent variables does not have a significant relationship with safety performance. The results of this test do not 
support previous research. Based on the results of processing the t-value value on the interaction variable has a positive 
value, which means that there is a unidirectional relationship or positive effect even though it is not significant. This 
can be caused by several reasons, such as the dominant trait of agreeableness owned by workers. someone with a high 
level of agreeableness also has a negative side, which is likely to have shortcomings when facing a conflict, namely a 
decrease in their self-esteem where the level of confidence in their ability to resolve conflicts is reduced so they need 
help from others in problem-solving and become independent and dependent on people. other. This will interfere with 
the application or application of safety values. The second reason is the dominant trait of conscientiousness possessed 
by workers. On the other hand, a person with high conscientiousness traits will tend to be a perfectionist, compulsive 
and workaholic. So it is inflexible and rigid and has difficulty in discussing, exchanging ideas, or accepting opinions 
from other people, while a compulsive person will tend to be anxious and interfere with functioning. it can distract 
workers from implementing or applying safety norms that require discussion. The last reason is the lack of workers 
with strong trait openness. Someone with a strong openness trait will tend to focus and be easy to tolerate and absorb 
information and have broad thinking, love to learn, and will find it easier to find solutions. This trait can increase the 
significance because workers can contribute by applying safety norms through a process of understanding and 
learning. So, it takes someone with a character of high curiosity, likes to learn, adds information to resolve a conflict 
or safety problem, and improve safety performance. Although the hypothesis related to personality traits interaction 
as a moderating variable is not significant, personality can be said to be a predictor of moderation because it has a 
significant relationship to the independent variables in the modeling. So that although in this study personality traits 
cannot be moderate, it can also be concluded that personality traits can be moderating variables because they have 
significant values with independent variables and individually have significance as predictors of the dependent 
variable. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research was conducted to develop a model of the effect of the relationship between the variables of leadership, 
safety knowledge and safety culture on safety performance and see how personality traits moderate the influence. 
From the research results, it is known that all variables have a significant value on safety performance while the 
interaction of personality traits as a moderating variable with an independent variable produces insignificant values

on safety performance so that it can be said in this study personality traits cannot moderate the relationship between 
safety leadership, safety knowledge and safety culture to safety performance. Even so, the personality traits variable 
can be considered a predictor of moderation because it has significance to all independent variables. To get a more 
comprehensive result on construction safety performance, further research is suggested to use a larger population and 
come from several other types of industries such as construction, oil and gas or manufacturing, which are among the 
industries with the highest accident rates. In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the use of safety leadership 
variables and safety culture variables in one model because there are other references which state that safety leadership 
is part of safety culture, which is reflected in the management commitment, so this needs to be considered to avoid 
redundancy.

Abstract 
Material procurement is mainly considered the critical path for industrial project. Monitoring its progress in an 
effective manner is key to a project success. Delays in material procurement are one of the major identified causes of 
delay in projects.  The aim of this paper is to introduce a heuristic method to measure material procurement progress 
and implement that method in a case study.  
A survey was conducted to explore the effectiveness of the current procurement methods and identify the factors 
influencing material requisitions. Based on a survey finding, 61% of 75 respondents in the field believe that current 
methods of measuring material procurement progress are inefficient. In addition, three major factors were identified 
to consider when calculating weights of material requisitions: material lead time, fabrication complexity, and material 
monetary value. A heuristic method was proposed to properly report material procurement progress after collecting 
project data and feedback from practitioners. The method was developed and tested in a real case study project. The 
results proved the effectiveness of the proposed method, which detected delays two months earlier than the method in 
use for the same project. In addition, the proposed method calculated the achieved progress 20% less than the current 
method at some points through project life cycle. The proposed method helps decision makers to take corrective 
actions by providing a more accurate for material procurement. Thus, the heuristic method helps to reduce the reducing 
risks of overpaying contractors, ensures delivery of material in a timely manner, and save costs that may occur due to 
delays.

1. Introduction
Material Procurement is a crucial process that directly affects the success of any project. Industrial projects depend 
heavily on material availability, which smoothens the execution and assures achieving project targets. A project 
schedule is built based on expected delivery dates of the material. Material-related delays are identified as one of the 
major causes of delays in construction projects (Fashina et al. 2021). Hence, having an effective way of monitoring 
and controlling material procurement progress is vital to avoid delays during project construction. 
There are several phases each procured material undergoes during the material procurement cycle. The progress of 
these procurement phases is monitored by the project management team to ensure achieving delivery dates. If the used 
metrics to calculate material procurement progress cannot detect delays at the right time, the project management team 
cannot perform effective corrective actions. As modularization is now practiced in many industries, the delivered 
components are planned to be installed as delivered, which minimizes chances of workarounds in the case of 
unavailability.

Abstract 
Public phenomena that are easy to see and argue for something that attracts attention can be utilized for the creative 
industry through viral marketing. This marketing method is considered capable of achieving an exponential level of 
sales. It is rooted in previous research that viral marketing that drives sales simultaneously can immediately decline, 
which is a gap that stems from future research studies (Leskovec et al. 2007). The decrease was caused by products 
that were not following customer wishes. Thus, viral marketing to achieve success requires the support of innovation 
inherent in processes, products, and services. The presence of innovation needs to be provided through dynamic 
capabilities. This study offers dynamic capability variables and innovation performance to build a model in viral 
marketing based on the Theory of Planned Behavior which is empirically tested. The sample was 81 respondents who 
were creative industry managers in Central Java. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is the analytical tool used with 
Smart-PLS software. The results of this study prove the significant role of knowledge sharing, dynamic capabilities, 
and innovation performance in driving viral marketing success. Dynamic ability is dominant in encouraging 
knowledge sharing on viral marketing (β = 0.233).

19 pandemic, offline stores must be closed indefinitely due to physical distancing policies. The creative industries can 
encourage employees to apply knowledge sharing within the creative industry in learning new skills such as using 
social media or online shops. Through social media as an instrument to capture knowledge, creative industries can 
develop their product marketing with exciting content that can bind customers emotionally. In turn, customers will 
become promoters of the creative industry's products by utilizing social media features to share product content with 
their network. 
 
This study is included in cross-sectional research so that further research can also be carried out longitudinal research 
with the same variables to test the model in fields other than the creative industry. In addition, further studies can 
develop models by revealing antecedent variables in viral marketing.

Abstract 
Youth awareness regarding the importance of continuing their education in higher institutions is very low. It has been discovered that the biggest factor responsible 
for this is very expensive price of higher institutions. To overcome this problem, Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS) offers scholarships to individuals who meet the 
criteria. Currently, the implementation of scholarship selection in UNS is still performed manually and this often leads to a long selection procedure and has been 
considered inaccurate. Therefore, a Decision Support System (DSS) is needed to aid the scholarship selection process. The system can compute the criteria score 
and generate a ranking based on the criteria weight. The results showed that using the AHP algorithm on DSS at school in East Java yielded an accuracy score of 
90%, while the PROMETHEE utilization on a system of determining the food aid recipients showed 85% accuracy. This study aims to determine the difference 
between the accuracies of AHP and PROMETHE in the development of the scholarship system (SIBEA) at UNS. This study showed the SIBEA prototype and the 
analysis of the comparison algorithm as well as the one that is better to use at UNS.

1. Introduction
Youth awareness concerning the importance of furthering their education in higher institutions is very low (Yunus et al., 2021). The study by (Lestari & Zakso, 
2020) discovered the internal factor responsible for this as a lack of motivation to continue the education, while the external factor was the high cost of learning in 
universities.  
As a higher institution, Universitas Sebelas Maret (UNS) offers several scholarships to students who meet certain criteria. Meanwhile, the selection process is 
conducted manually, especially for non-government scholarships managed by universities, thereby causing a delay and the results are often considered less accurate. 
Consequently, a Decision Support System (DSS) is required to computerize scores and rank automatically based on the given criteria.  
According to the literature reviews, the algorithms that are often used in the DSS scholarship system are the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference 
Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE). AHP works by breaking down complex problems into a hierarchical system that is 
used to select the best alternative. The study by (Puspitasari et al., 2018) showed that the use of AHP as a Decision Support System on scholarship selection in East 
Java High School has an accuracy of 90%. Other studies showed that the PROMETHEE algorithm has a more precise ranking because it relies on data and decision-
making considerations when determining the preference function for each criterion (Istiqomah & Windarni, 2019). In (Maulachela et al., 2019), using the 
PROMETHEE as DSS in the food aid reception system showed an accuracy of 85%. It has been observed that the AHP and PROMETHEE methods are MCDM 
that have been widely utilized due to their high accuracy level in determining the alternative rankings based on weights and criteria (Istiqomah & Windarni, 2019). 
1.1. Objective 
This study aims to determine the accuracy of the AHP and PROMETHEE algorithms in making scholarship acceptance decisions at Universitas Sebelas Maret. 
The result is the algorithm that best suits the conditions of scholarship selection. 
2. Literature Review
2.1. Scholarship 
Scholarships (Sugiyarti et al., 2018) are financial assistance for individuals, which are often used as required tuition fees and are divided into two based on the 
source of the provider: government and non-government scholarships. Furthermore, they are categorized into 3 based on the terms and criteria requested, which 
include Underprivileged, Merit, and General scholarships. Underprivileged scholarships are for those who want to continue their education but have economic 
limitations. Merit scholarships are for those who excel regardless of economic conditions, while that of general are scholarships whose criteria are not based on 
economic conditions or merit. It is important to note that in UNS, scholarships are divided into 3 based on the selection of the organizers, which include government 
scholarships such as KIP and Bidikmisi, non-government scholarships managed by the university, and those that are not managed by the university. The case study 
here is scholarships for the underprivileged that are administered by non-government universities. All the above scholarships generally have the same selection 
stages as follows. 
1)
Offering stage, entails providing scholarship offer information to students.
2)
The registration stage involves students applying for scholarships. In this phase, there are several sub-stages including filling out personal information,
uploading the required files, finalizing, and printing the proof of registration.
3)
In the verification stage, biodata is verified by the selection organizer.
4)
The nomination stage involves computing the criteria score and determining who is entitled to receive the scholarship. Furthermore, a decision letter is also
made for scholarship recipients.
5)
The announcement stage deals with providing information to students about the results of the scholarship selection.
6)
The disbursement stage involves distributing scholarships to the recipients.
7)
The evaluation stage is always after the scholarship has been awarded and it is performed every semester or annually.
2.2. Decision Support System 
A Decision Support System (DSS) is a system used in the decision-making process to help the individuals involved (Sibyan, 2020). This concept was first introduced 
in the 1970s by Michael S. Scot Morton with the name Management Decision System (MSS), featuring a computer-based interactive system that has the ability to 
make decisions by utilizing data and models to solve unstructured problems (Limbong et al., 2020). It is important to note that DSS is not intended to completely 
automate decision making, but allows individuals to conduct analysis using available models and data (Saragih, 2013), (Limbong et al., 2020).  
2.3. Multi-Criteria Decision Making 
Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is a decision-making method of determining the best alternative from several ones given based on predetermined criteria 
and weights. Furthermore, MCDM consists of 5 components including goals, decision-making preferences, alternatives, criteria, and results (Wang et al., 2009).

5. Conclusion 
The accuracy calculation of the AHP and PROMETHEE algorithms in the SIBEA application has been conducted using a confusion matrix. It involves representing 
the actual scholarship recipient data with True and False as well as the scholarship recipients’ predicted data as Positive and Negative. This helps in performing 
the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, and F-score calculations. 
 
The comparison results of the algorithm with the confusion matrix in this aspect are based on 2 things, namely the number of adjacent FP and FN to obtain the best 
algorithm from the highest Accuracy value. In this case, the AHP with 93.33% accuracy was better than PROMETHEE which obtained 33.33%. Second, it was 
determined from the highest precision value because TP was more desirable than TN. The result showed that the AHP algorithm was better as it has a precision 
value of 95% compared to the PROMETHEE with 50%. Therefore, in the case of receiving a scholarship at Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, the use of the 
AHP is better than the PROMETHEE algorithm.

Abstract 
The study of furniture exports in Central Java is a particular concern, especially during the pandemic. The furniture 
industry in Central Java experienced a slump at the beginning due to strict pandemic regulations. In the second quarter 
of 2021, the furniture industry received new opportunities for imports and exports with increasing demand. However, 
at the end of the third quarter of 2022, another challenge emerged with the soaring logistics costs of sending export 
products to destination countries, resulting in increased export operations. Adjusting the selling price of the product 
is necessary but becomes counter-productive because it has implications for the price that becomes uncompetitive. 
Thus, this study builds a supply chain management model for increasing export performance. This study offers 
Organizational Culture to encourage the role of Technology Resources in Supply Chain Management, a gap problem 
still inconclusive. The sample of this study was 182 MSMEs exporting furniture in Central Java. The analytical 
instrument is Structural Equation Modelling with the results of Technology Resources not significantly affecting 
Supply Chain Management. The use of Organizational Culture (β = 0.265) to mediate Technology Resources to Export 
Performance is more significant than Knowledge Sharing (β = 0.071), and Supply Chain Management significantly 
affects Export Performance by 0.738. So empirically, it is proven that Organizational Culture has a role in fully 
mediating the influence of Technology Resources on Supply Chain Management and its impact on Export 
Performance.

5. Conclusion
Knowledge creation theory can describe an organizational and leadership process that represents knowledge creation 
in an organizational environment, regardless of the organization’s type, size, or location. Organizational culture has 
encouraged the awakening of knowledge from the concept of knowledge creation theory. In the perspective of 
knowledge creation theory, the need for knowledge is an essential material in organizations that are attached to work 
culture, especially in supporting them to build innovations in the production process in the furniture industry as part 
of the manufacturing process. Knowledge creation theory will bind to the need for technological support as a 
knowledge infrastructure. While organizational culture will facilitate resources such as technology, it takes a more 
critical role in building its influence on the existence of supply chain management. Furthermore, the knowledge built 
will encourage the resolution of many problems in the industry, such as organizing strategies for building supply chain 
management support. 
The limitation of the study is the unevenness of the data collection. Furniture export MSMEs who were respondents 
in this study were mainly in Jepara City. Nevertheless, the city of Jepara is a national furniture center, so it still 
represents the population. Refers to the importance of resource capabilities that drive export performance facilitated 
through the role of work culture. The upcoming research agenda is recommended to build supply chain management 
mediated by organizational culture with antecedents in the form of information technology capability and 
organizational structure.

Abstract 
The concept of supply chain management (SCM) is an alternative in facing recent business competition. The 
competition in question leads to the magnitude of price sell products affected by SCM. Able entrepreneurs build SCM 
and could minimize supply chain costs then will have superiority compete. In creating a supply chain, a capable 
entrepreneur must dig information about the market to get an outlook on opportunities, trends, knowledge, and new 
information to increase his abilities. The phenomenon that becomes an opportunity in SCM is the development of 
company service logistics to support supply chain processes. Direction studies uncover the influence of 
Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO), Organizational Culture (OC), and Technology Resources (TR) on SCM. 
Respondent studies 162 UMKM furniture in Central Java using the purposive sampling technique. Data collection 
uses the nonself-assessment method through a questionnaire distribution. The effect of EO on SCM has a significant 
value (β=0.006, p<0.05). On the other hand, OC significantly impacts SCM (β=0.000, p<0.001). TR does not directly 
affect SCM (β=0.960, p>0.05). The perspective of this study is supply chain management theory which has been 
empirically proven that EO, OC, and TR simultaneously have a significant positive effect on SCM.

1. Introduction
Recent business industry development cannot neglect entrepreneurs' role in controlling chain supply products in a 
business (supply chain management). This perspective is addressed the concept of entrepreneurial orientation (EO). 
The action steps of entrepreneurs must be proactive, innovative, and take risks to manage their business (Hermawan 
and Sari 2020). Entrepreneurs develop a strategy to optimize business processes, including planning, control, and 
process flow production, especially in the supply chain (Silva et al. 2021). Entrepreneurs determine supply chain 
management strategies which adjusted to the current organizational culture (OC). OC includes building knowledge 
through inherent learning to create an effective supply chain strategy acceleration (Cao et al. 2015). Another factor 
affecting SCM is Technology resources (TR). It can minimize communication barriers in SCM and improve 
productivity through Business to Business (Di Vaio and Varriale 2020). Then, entrepreneurs must focus on 
entrepreneurial orientation, organizational culture, and technology resources in optimizing SCM. SCM is related to 
the effectiveness and efficiency of the production flow process (Agrawal and Narain 2018), which will impact the

The results of the t-test with a significance value of each construct less than 0.05 were declared to meet the threshold. 
Three hypotheses were formulated, two hypotheses were accepted, and one was rejected. (Table 6) The research 
equation can be formulated as follows: 
SCM=16.586+ 0.305EO+ 0.475OC+ -0.003TR 
The results of the multiple linear regression test showed that hypothesis 1 was accepted with (β=0.006, p<0.05), 
hypothesis 2 was received with (β=0.000, p<0.001), but hypothesis 3 was rejected because of the significance value 
was (β=0.960, p>0.05). Hypothesis 1 is accepted. EO has a significant effect on SCM. It is harmonized with research 
(Cortes et al. 2021) that EO positively influences SCM. Proactive entrepreneurs conducting market observations will 
have suppliers who can provide raw materials at relatively affordable prices. Then entrepreneurs who dare to try to 
implement new strategies in SCM will have the opportunity to develop. Hypothesis 2 is accepted, so OC has a 
significant effect on SCM. This statement is true. The existence of a supporting OC can improve SCM. OC has the 
most important influence, with a beta value of 0.632. It is in line with research (Arshad Ali et al. 2020) that companies 
with good OC can adapt to other corporate cultures to support supply chain management in establishing relationships 
with other parties. Entrepreneurial culture provides opportunities for employees to give opinions and share knowledge 
to create superior and competent employees to encourage entrepreneurs and employees to establish good relationships 
with consumers, suppliers, or distributors. The built good relationship makes it easier for entrepreneurs to manage the 
supply chain. Hypothesis 3 is rejected. TR has no significant effect on SCM. It contradicts research (Sung et al. 2019) 
which says that Technology Resources positively affect supply chain management. However, the results of this study 
are in line with (Singhry 2015), which revealed that TR does not directly affect SCM. Financial resources are still 
needed in applying technology that supports SCM to get the technology that suits your needs (Singhry 2015). the cost 
of acquiring and maintaining technology such as machines requires a significant investment, and not all entrepreneurs 
can do this, so TR does not directly affect this study. 
6. Conclusion
This study found that SCM at this time, EO, and OC have a significant influence on supporting SCM in 
entrepreneurship. EO can obtain information for strategic planning, such as supplier options and excellent logistics 
services to support SCM. Then OC creates competent entrepreneurs and employees to establish good relations with 
other parties who drive SCM. While this study empirically proves that TR has no significant effect on SCM. It is 
because TR requires a relatively substantial investment of financial resources. Concerning the current SCM, the 
phenomenon of logistics services growth will facilitate the supply chain process. The number of available logistics 
services gives entrepreneurs opportunities to achieve SCM more optimally. Enclosed, entrepreneurs in carrying out 
business processes can reduce the cost of materials delivery and product shipping. It impacts the acquisition of a 
lower-cost production to create a competitive product selling price that can be superior. Theoretically, this research 
has contributed to the body of knowledge by describing SCM through the Supply Management theory perspective.

There is a rejected hypothesis that TR does not significantly affect SCM. The following research recommendation is 
to add mediating variables for TR and SCM to get more precise research model results.

Abstract 
Assuring product quality has been always a main concern of a production process. PT IGP Internasional Sleman is a 
company that produces Printed Tissue Paper. This company's defect tolerance limit is 2%. Based on early 
observations, the defect rate reaches 5.2%. The Eight Disciplines (8D) method was used to solve the problem. First, 
the team was built to engage all related divisions in the project. Then, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) 
was carried out to sort the problems. Root Cause Analysis using Fishbone diagram was also used to find the causes. 
Proposed improvements to reduce defects have been implemented. There are adding Rotogravure machine 
operators, conducting supervision/inspection by production leader, and providing socialization related to the 
importance of product quality and production. The implementation has successfully reduced the defects to fulfill the 
company’s standard.

6. Conclusion 
There are some causes of defects. First problem is lack of concern for rotogravure machine operators, sheeters and 
pond-handles. In addition, the rotogravure machine also lacks operators and existing operators also lack sufficient 
expertise. Sheeter operators are often found communicating with each other about outside work. The product failed 
because the stack was not neat in the counting and sorting process, the cause was the operator being careless in the 
process. To solve the problem, this research recommended adding operators accompanied by intensive training for 
more optimal workmanship and also conducting socialization about the importance of product quality in production 
process according to standard operating procedure. Implementation has been carried out and the percentage of 
defects has decreased comply the company’s standard (less than 2%).

Abstract 
It necessitates the implementation of a monitoring and forecasting system for solar projects which often requires data 
on solar irradiance - GHI (for both short-term forecasting and long-term forecasting). However, there is a serious lack 
of data for GHI preventing researchers from estimating precisely the development potential of solar power in certain 
areas and also exploring modern forecasting technologies. The industrial solar irradiance monitoring devices (often 
called pyranometer) have already been utilized in the SCADA system of solar farms for many years. Nevertheless, 
this standard supervising system is rather expensive to afford, leading to the low applicability in term of urban scale 
(residential roof-top systems). Realizing this practical problem, we come up with the solution of building a low-cost 
solar irradiance monitoring system for collecting, storing data for further interpreting such as GHI forecasting 
methods. Instead of using a standard pyranometer, the low-cost illuminance sensor is used as an indirect measurement 
of GHI. The main objectives of the research are: (i) Develop an electronic board to collect the data and transfer the 
data to the server through Wi-Fi connection to the internet; (ii) Using information tools (Python and Javascript 
Programming Language) and algorithms to estimate the GHI level from measurement the illuminance; (iii) Build a 
prototype of the monitoring system. This paper establishes a theoretical and laboratory measurement guide for the 
conversion between solar irradiance and illuminance. This approach concept is expected not only to solve the financial 
problem stated above but also to provide materials for educational purposes.

Abstract 
 
The growth of coffee drinkers has an impact on increasing the number of coffee shops in Indonesia. These conditions 
lead to competition between coffee shops to attract consumer interest. Coffee shop strategies determine pricing 
policies, build good product quality, and attractive promotions for research. This study aims to determine the effect of 
product quality, price, and promotion on consumer purchasing decisions for coffee at a coffee shop in the city of 
Indonesia. This study uses a quantitative method with a cross-sectional survey model. The sampling technique used 
is probability sampling, with a population of 38,000 residents of Indonesia from the age of 17 to 35 years and a total 
sample of 100 respondents. The data analysis technique is used in SPSS software. This research concludes that product 
quality, price, and promotion have a simultaneous and significant effect on purchasing decisions.

1. Introduction 
Purchasing decisions have a very important role in the survival of the company because they will have a direct or 
indirect impact on the business that is being involved so it requires company management to be more careful in 
determining competitive strategies that can create customer decisions in buying a product for the products offered by 
the company. Kotler & Keller, (2016:54) explain that the purchase decision is the final decision issued by the buyer 
to buy an item or service by these considerations. In making decisions on a product, consumers usually consider 
choosing the product by describing a problem. In this study, the purchasing decision variable is used as the focus 
variable for the problem because the decision variable is worth examining considering the number of products in 
circulation, resulting in consumers needing to consider it choosing a product (Hutapea & Wiradinata, 2019). 
 
Purchase decisions are made when consumers need the product to be used. One of the businesses that consumers need 
to consider in choosing a product is the beverage sector. Currently, the beverage business faces several challenges in 
meeting the needs, wants, and demands of modern consumers (Karthikeyan et al., 2019). The challenge faced in the 
business world is competition between the same businesses so every business requires innovation in winning the 
competition(Putra & Vipraprastha, 2022). For this reason, research needs to examine the coffee beverage business 
that consumers consider in choosing a variant of coffee-like drinks. Consuming coffee is one of the habits of 
Indonesian people that has been done since ancient times. This is because Indonesia is one of the best coffee bean 
producers in the world (Aditya et al., 2016). Some areas that are famous for their coffee bean production are Aceh, 
Bali, Lampung, Sulawesi, and Java (Mawardi et al., 2019). In Indonesia, coffee is enjoyed by all groups from the 
young to the elderly, because for them coffee is a drink that is consumed daily in addition to staple food (Katemba & 
Djoh, 2017). In the past, coffee was only sold on the streets and seemed very simple, but now many coffees already 
have a classy and more attractive appearance (Sinsawasdi et al., 2022).

Abstract 
The business world continues to grow and the retail companies are required to survive and fulfill the customer desires. 
One of the important factors in business is the service quality. To survive in the competition, the company must 
improve the quality of customer service. The Super Dazzle store in Kaliurang Yogyakarta branch is a retail business 
that sells various kinds of gadget accessories. Based on observations and interviews data from some customers in July 
2021-January 2022, several complaints were found stating that the quality of service received was not good. Some of 
the complaints obtained are the number of cashiers was inadequate, employees paid less attention to product quality, 
some product arrangements were messy, the existing product stock was incomplete, service to customers was bad, 
and several other services were unsatisfactory. This study aims to determine the level of customer satisfaction with 
the quality of service provided. The steps are to determine the service quality attributes, to measure the level of 
satisfaction using the servqual method, then to recommend improvements using the six sigma - DMAIC method. The 
results showed that most of the customers were not satisfied, this was evidenced by the servqual results with a negative 
gap value. So, it is necessary to improve the attributes using six sigma - DMAIC. From the results of six sigma -
DMAIC processing, the priority of store service improvements is obtained. The priority attributes are uncomfortable 
parking area (T5), employees are less willing to help customers (RE4), the shop environment is not clean (T2), slow 
cashier service speed (R5), poor arrangement of goods (T1), employees are lacking in paying attention to consumers 
(E4), lack of product completeness (T7), unskilled employees (RE5), products have not been fully maintained such as 
cleanliness and seal (R3). Then the suggestions for improvement can be given based on these attributes. The priorities 
of improvements recommendations are providing the regular monitoring, enlarge the parking facility, making posters 
of customer satisfaction, adding customer facilities, maintain the cleanliness of the store and products, selecting quality 
human resources for employee, providing the employee training, increasing the number of cashiers and adding the 
variety of products and availability.

1. Introduction
Changes in the business world occur very quickly and dynamically, so companies are required to be able to make 
changes in order to continue to grow and survive based on the influence of loyal customers (Anggraini & Deni, 2019). 
Companies are not only required to fulfill customer desires, but also can provide added value, one of the main factors 
is service quality. Good service can provide added value and benefits for customers (Hartono, 2018). If the customer 
is dissatisfied, it means that the quality of service is ineffective and inefficient (Wisnubroto & Anggoro, 2012). Most 
service quality is inversely related to consumer perceived expectations and service performance. Therefore, evaluating 
or improving the quality of service is the most important thing to be applied in outline if the service provider wants to 
remain superior, different from others, and exist in the eyes of the users. Among the many service businesses, 
researchers focus on the retail business, which is a field that sells products in the form of services. One of the retail 
stores that will be the research material is a cellphone accessory store or commonly called Super Dazzle. This store

6. Conclusion
Based on the results of processing and analysis that has been done, it can be concluded as follows: 
1. Based on the servqual calculation, it is known that there is a gap between reality and expectations. From all attribute 
values, there is a gap that has a negative value, so it can be concluded that the customers are not satisfied with the
current services provided by the store.
2. Based on data processing with six sigma at the analyze stage using a pareto diagram, the order of attributes as
priority for improvement are T5, RE4, T2, R5, T1, E4, T7, RE5, and R3.
3. The improvement recommendation to increase the service quality and customer satisfaction are as follows: Enlarge
the parking facility, conduct the employee training to improve hospitality and responsiveness to customers, select
the quality human resources for employee, create posters of customer satisfaction, increase the cleaning frequency,
increase the number of cashiers, tidy up the placement of goods according to the classification of product, add the
customer facilities, add the variety of products and availability, provide the regular monitoring and maintain the
cleanliness of the store and products.

Abstract 
Human resources are important assets in company business activities. Human resources are grouped into generations 
according to their age. Generation Z, who was born in 1997-2010, dominates the number of generations in Indonesia 
with a figure of 27.94% or around 75.49 million people out of a total of 270 million people in Indonesia. Gen Z is a 
new generation entering the workforce and very literate with technology and the internet because it was born in an 
era where technology is developing very rapidly. At work, there are many things that affect job performance, 
include non-physical work environment and work stress. By providing facts about the non-physical work 
environment and work stress, this research is expected to be able to provide the influence of the non-physical work 
environment and work stress on job performance of Gen Z using an online valid and reliable questionnaire survey 
with 150 respondents who were selected by purposive sampling. The target population is Gen Z who work in the 
technology field in DKI Jakarta, and then will be analyzed using the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method.

1. Introduction
Indonesia has a total of 139.81 million working age human resources (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2021). Human 
Resource Development (HR) is one part of the goals and processes carried out by the government in Indonesia's 
national development efforts. Indonesia's national development can be encouraged with a stronger awareness of 
every human resource to develop themselves and others in the world of work. The quality of human resources in a 
company is one of the factors that determine the quality of a company. Human resources are an important asset in 
the activities carried out by the company. In addition to the quality of existing human resources, human resource 
management is also an element that is no less important. This is often a factor in the existence of the company.  
Generation Z dominates the population in Indonesia with a figure of 27.94% or around 75.49 million people from a 
total of 270.20 million people and the millennial generation is in second place with a total of 25.87% of Indonesia's 
population. This data shows that Generation Z dominates the population census in Indonesia, followed by the 
millennial generation. Generation Z was born in 1997 – 2010, while the millennial generation in 1981 – 1996. 
Generation Z is the youngest in the world of work or has just entered the workforce. Each generation has a different 
behavior in work, as well as the aspirations, expectations, and values of each generation. These differences in

Figure 8. F Table for Probability = 0.05 
From Figure 8, it can be concluded that F count (1653,206) > F table (3.91). This proves that simultaneously, non-
physical work environment variables and work stress have an influence on employee performance variables. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the calculations described in point 2, the conclusions that can be drawn from this research are as follows: 
1.
Non-Physical Work Environment Variables have a positive and significant effect on Employee
Performance Variables on Generation Z respondents who work in the IT sector in DKI Jakarta. So that
it can be said that the more the non-physical work environment is improved in a company, the
employee performance will also increase in Generation Z who work in the IT field in DKI Jakarta.
The results of these conclusions are supported by partial testing, where the results of the t-value test are 6,890. The 
result of the calculated T value is greater when compared to the t table, which is 1.65529. So, it can be concluded 
that the non-physical work environment variable influences employee performance in the Z generation respondents 
who work in the IT sector in DKI Jakarta. The results of this hypothesis test are in line with the results of 
Ramadhani's research (2022) which examines the influence of the non-physical work environment on the 
performance of employees of the Batam Free Trade Area and Port Concession Agency. 
Thus, the hypothesis H2 about the non-physical work environment affecting job performance is partially 
accepted. 
Work Stress Variable has a positive and significant effect on Employee Performance Variables in Generation Z 
respondents who work in the IT sector in DKI Jakarta. So, it can be said that a high level of work stress will affect 
and reduce the level of performance of employees. So that the management of work stress in a company needs to be 
managed and considered properly to improve employee performance at the company. The results of these 
conclusions are supported by partial testing, where the test results for the t-count value are 6,797. The result of the 
calculated t value is greater than the t table, which is 1.65529. So, it can be concluded that the work stress variable 
has an effect on employee performance in generation Z respondents who work in the IT sector in DKI Jakarta. The 
results of this hypothesis test are in line with the results obtained from Wartono's research (2017) which examines 
the effect of work stress on employee performance.

Thus, the hypothesis H3 about work stress affects job performance is partially accepted. 
 
2. Non-Physical Work Environment Variables and work stress simultaneously affect employee 
performance in the Z generation respondents who work in the IT sector in DKI Jakarta. For this reason, 
it is necessary to manage a good non-physical work environment, and good work stress management 
will have a significant effect on employee performance. The better the non-physical work environment 
and the lower the work stress, it will improve job performance. Vice versa, the lower the non-physical  
3. work environment and the high work stress, the employee's performance will decrease. 
The results of these conclusions are supported by simultaneous testing, where the test results for the 
calculated f value get the number 1653,206. The result of the calculated f value is greater than the f 
table, which is 3.91. So it can be concluded that the non-physical work environment variables and 
work stress simultaneously affect job performance in the Z generation respondents who work in the IT 
sector in DKI Jakarta. The results of this hypothesis test are in line with the research conducted by 
Pangestuti (2020). 
 
Thus, the hypothesis H1 about the non-physical work environment and work stress affect job performance 
simultaneously is accepted.

Recently, Instagram is not only use for entertainment, but also act as a platform used for medium business, such 
as promotion and buying products. Roughneck 1991 is one of the brand fashions from Indonesia that use Instagram 
to promote their product to market through brand image which is Roughneck show up on their Instagram account. 
In this study, researchers used quantitative methods to analyze data obtained from Roughneck 1991 buyers using 
176 respondents. To test the hypotheses, this research using PLS-SEM as a statistical tool. From the results of the 
analysis, the researchers found that brand image as an intervening variable positively can helps Instagram content 
in influencing purchasing decisions.

1. Introduction
Internet become an important part of life for every people in the world, also in Indonesia.  Until 2021, there are 
170 million users of social media in Indonesia. One of the popular social media in Indonesia is Instagram, and 
based on Napoleon Cat's data, until fourth quarter of 2021, there are 92.53 million users of Instagram. Compared 
to previous quarter, this amount increased from 3.9 million or up to 4.37% from 88.65 million user. Nowadays, 
Instagram is not only used for socializing, but is widely used by many users as a business medium, such as buying 
and selling businesses. By using Instagram social media, business actors can reach a wider number of consumers. 
There are many features that can be used by users to promote their products, such as reels, instastory, and feeds. 
Marketers can also utilise feature boost post on this application for reach more target consumers.  
Content marketing is a process direct or indirect in promote product or service through content text, video, audio, 
to find a value added of a product both through online and offline (Meiliana, 2018). Through Instagram, users can 
load many interesting content and product information, so consumer realize the brand that built through a brand 
image that created by its producers. Consumers will evaluate the image of a brand after consumers try to 
understand what the brand has and how they feel about the product.  
According to Fianto et al. (2014), brand image is the understanding that consumers identify the brand or the 
consumer's total understanding of the brand obtained. This becomes important since it can provide an 
understanding of what the producer has to offer regarding the product and explained through the marketing 
process. For this reason, producer need to know the tastes and attractiveness of consumers so that consumers' 
views of the brand are said to be good. Therefore, the use of content on Instagram as a means of building a brand 
image is a very crucial step, where marketers must think carefully about the strategies that will be used to attract 
the attention of consumers. A positive brand image will affect consumer ratings. The better consumer's evaluate 
brand, the stronger the influence of brand image embedded in the minds of consumers on purchasing decisions. 
Purchase decision is a form of selection and interest to buy the most preferred brand among several different 
brands (Kotler and Keller, 2016). Kotler and Armstrong (2012) also mentioned that consumers will go through 
five stages in making purchasing decisions, consist of recognition of needs, information search, evaluation 
alternatives, purchase decisions, post-purchase behavior. Instagram is a social media platform for consumers to 
decide on product purchases. The purchase decision process is also based on the brand image factor created on 
the Instagram page which is the material for consumer evaluation before making a purchase decision in meeting 
their needs.

In addition, the Table 3 above shows the mediation effect of attitude, it shows the indirect influence of 
IC→BI→PD obtained the value of the significance of the study was t-value of 7.709>1.96, the significance level 
of 0.00<0.05, and the value of path coefficients was positive at 0.547 which indicates Instagram content against 
purchase decision through brand image is positive and significant. This demonstrates that the effect of mediation 
on brand image influences purchase decision. Then, researchers evaluate variance scores on dependent variables, 
described by all independent variables, with reference to R2 values. Based on Table 4, the R2 values of Brand 
Image (BI), and Purchase Decision (PD) are 0.678 and 0.727, respectively.

6. Conclusion
As a conclusion, found that brand image as an intervening variable has an important role between Instagram 
content and purchase decision for Roughneck 1991 product. The owner of Roughneck 1991 used social media, 
especially Instagram as a place for their consumers to search information about the Roughneck 1991 products. 
While purchase decision itself influenced by Instagram content of this brand. Therefore, it can be concluded, that 
especially for online trading, producers need to make promotion and information about their product continually 
to their consumers. Furthermore, at the end it can be a good strategy to increase the purchase decision. Researchers 
believe that in the future, this study can be conduct in other brand to get the deeper information about the purchase 
decision factors. Also, there are many possibilities in the next research to include other variables.

research can increase threefold or reach around 1,950 outlets from 2016 which was only around 1000 (Sugianto, 
detikFinance, 2019). The pandemic that occurred around the world, changed people's habits to stay at home & work from 
home (WFH), with the current economic condition’s consumers tend to spend their money on primary needs compared to 
non-primary needs, this has also changed people's habits of enjoying coffee in a shop or cafe. there is a shift in consumer 
coffee consumption from high-class cafes to simpler places such as roadside coffee shops with open spaces"" (Katadata, 
2021). Starbucks as an upscale coffee shop must find a way to keep customers satisfied and loyal to Starbucks, by 
providing take-out services. away and delivery in collaboration with online motorcycle taxi providers. The method used in 
this research is descriptive quantitative method. Sampling uses the probability sampling method of random sampling with 
100 respondents. Data processing is carried out by SEM-PLS and using path analysis. The results of the analysis show 
that the relationship between variables does not all show a positive and significant relationship, only the relationship 
between brand awareness and customer satisfaction, brand image and customer satisfaction, perceived quality and 
customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction with an customer loyalty which shows a positive and significant 
relationship.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 had a significant impact on Starbucks. The government has implemented a Large-
Scale Social Restriction (PSBB) policy that prohibits people from doing activities that are crowding in nature. This makes 
Starbucks have to keep customers satisfied and loyal to Starbucks, with take away and delivery order services. The 
number of complaints experienced by Starbucks customers in the city of Bandung (Google review, 2021) and the decline 
in brand awareness of Starbucks due to the COVID-19 pandemic (Putra, 2021), the researchers are interested in making 
Starbucks in Bandung the object of research. 
Researchers chose Starbucks in Bandung because Bandung residents have a high level of consumerism (Bandung People's 
Welfare Statistics, 2019) and the number of coffee shops in Bandung is increasing very quickly (katadata.co.id, 2021), but 
Starbucks remains the top brand in Indonesia. for the international brand category. Based on the explanation of the 
background described above, this study will discuss ""The Effect of Brand Awareness, Brand Image, and Perceived 
Quality on Customer Loyalty through Starbucks Customer Satisfaction in Bandung"".

positive and insignificant effect on Customer Loyalty. 
According to (Durianto et al, 2001: 95) says that Perceived Quality will form a good or bad impression in the eyes of 
consumers. The overall perceived quality of the customer towards the product or service will determine the good or bad 
value of a product or service which will have a direct effect on the brand to customer loyalty and purchasing decisions. 
However, the research that has been done has results that are different from the existing theory, the results of the study 
say that Perceived Quality does not have a significant influence on Customer Loyalty. 
So that the better the level of customer satisfaction, the customer loyalty at Starbucks Bandung will be higher. These 
results indicate that customers who are satisfied with the services and products provided by Starbucks Bandung will make 
repeat purchases and become loyal consumers to Starbucks Bandung. 
Perceived Quality also has a positive and insignificant effect on Customer Loyalty through Customer Satisfaction with a 
path coefficient value of 0.150 and a T-Statistics value of 1.625. So that if the value of Brand Awareness, Brand Image, 
and Perceived Quality decreases or increases, then there is no significant effect on Customer Loyalty and Customer 
Satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Based on the digital marketing research institute, E-marketers in Indonesia until the end of 2019 reached 92 million 
smartphone users. The E-marketer research institute predicts that by 2025, there will be 167 million smartphone users 
in Indonesia or 89% of the total population. According to DBS Group Research (2014) shows that the use of digital 
technology in the business world is increasingly significant and important. The large number of people's interest in 
owning a smartphone causes high demand for smartphones in the market. The increasing demand for gadgets will 
certainly have an impact on the increasing demand for gadget accessories. According to Heryanto (2015) the 
competition to get customer potential and retaining customers is a challenge faced by companies to promote products.

4.2 Proposed Improvements 
The suggestions given by researchers to the management of Dazzle Yogyakarta are as follows: 
a.
With no significant effect of product quality when viewed from the t test (partial) on the decision to
purchase gadget accessories at Dazzle Yogyakarta, the company can make new innovations and improve
the quality of the products offered to consumers so that they can compete with competing products that
have been circulating. on the market.
b.
For the price variable, the company first adjusts the prices circulating in the market and provides new
innovations for gadget accessories products so that consumers prefer to buy gadget accessories at Dazzle
Yogyakarta compared to other places.
c.
For service quality variables, it is better to improve the comfort, cleanliness, neatness of the employees or
the shop so that customers feel at home and will buy gadget accessories at Dazzle Yogyakarta compared
to other places.
d.
For social media promotion variables, it is better to improve the quality of posts and the truth of the contents 
of the posts, if there are no promos, it is better to delete the posts so as not to confuse readers or customers
who will make purchases at Dazzle Yogyakarta.
e.
The management must pay more attention and consider the voices of consumers who state that prices and
promotions of social media greatly affect consumer purchasing decisions, therefore the management
further enhances better social media promotions, increases promos, and provides appropriate prices so that
can compete with other companies so as to attract consumers while still paying attention to the quality of
service and product quality.
5. Conclusion
Based on the results and discussion, it can be concluded that: 
1.
Partially, product quality has a positive but not significant effect on purchasing decisions, while price, service
quality, and social media promotions have a positive and significant effect on purchasing decisions for gadget
accessories at Dazzle Yogyakarta. Simultaneously (together) product quality, price, service quality, and social
media promotion together have a positive effect on purchasing decisions for gadget accessories at Dazzle
Yogyakarta.
2.
From the result of perceptions analysis, the order of the level of importance of the variables that influence the
decision to purchase gadget accessories at Dazzle Yogyakarta is as follows:
Based on consumer perceptions, it is stated that the order of importance that influences the decision to purchase
gadget accessories at Dazzle Yogyakarta is:

Abstract 
The first case of the Covid-19 Pandemic in March 2020 in Indonesia had an impact on changes in the education sector. 
Various adaptations have been made by the government to reduce the spread of the pandemic, one of which is by 
implementing “Work from Home” (WFH). The working method of the lecturers becomes online by using social 
media. Information and communications that enter social media are no longer only social matters or things outside of 
work, but also work matters. The use of social media becomes overload and has the potential to cause social media 
exhaustion which has an impact on the performance of the lecturers. 
Several studies have examined the relationship between information overload, communication overload, social media 
exhaustion, and performance. However, these studies are not conclusive. During this condition, the trust of lecturers 
for organizational support related to technology and their capabilities related to technology is also expected to be a 
determining factor in the relationship between social media exhaustion and lecturers' performance. 
This study is a quantitative study that aims to examine the effect of information overload, communication overload, 
and social media exhaustion experienced by lecturers with perceived organizational support related to technology and 
technology self-efficacy as moderating variables. The sample used is 129 respondents with the profession of lecturers 
who work in universities in Indonesia. Data was collected by distributing questionnaires with snowball techniques 
online using five Likert scales. Statistical testing in this study uses Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the 
SmartPLS program. 
The results of this study indicate that information overload and communication overload have a positive effect on 
social media exhaustion, social media exhaustion has a negative effect on performance, perceived organizational 
support related to technology moderates the negative effect of social media exhaustion on performance, and 
technology self-efficacy does not moderate the negative effect of social media exhaustion on performance.

After 3 years of changing working methods to online, the lecturers have had enough time to have excellent abilities 
and skills in working using social media. This causes the challenges and obstacles in using social media to be reduced 
so that technology self-efficacy no longer has an influence. Then if indeed the challenges and obstacles still exist, this 
change in work methods is addressed with the demands of readiness, perhaps not only related to technology, but also 
other pedagogical support aspects such as materials, interaction, and communication.

Abstract 
The continuing increase of urban population will cause the increase of the pressure on the city environment. Some 
environmental problems faced in cities indicate that urban carrying capacity has exceeded. The condition of the 
environment will degrade if the load pressure on the environment affected by human activities has exceeded the 
environment carrying capacity. To achieve the sustainable city, it is urgency to develop city plan based on it carrying 
capacity. In this study, environmental threshold method has been designed to indicate final ecological limits for 
sustainable development. Ultimate Environmental Thresholds (UETs) method applies the thresholds concept to the 
definition of carrying capacity. The analysis methods used to achieve the purpose of model development is the 
description analysis, the quantitative analysis, the scoring analysis, and the spatial analysis. The analysis of the 
research indicates these thresholds considered as the final boundary to possible location of development, or the final 
limit of what natural environment can take without irreversible damage. The result being the planning contribution 
towards defining carrying capacity which indicate what preferred and dominant function should be promoted and 
where is ecologically safe would become especially relevant. In summary, an overall adaptation of Ultimate 
Environmental Thresholds provides a simple approach that can be useful tool in defining city’s carrying capacity.

1. Introduction
The continuous increases of urban population will cause the increase pressures of the city ‘environment. The increase 
of the urban population will cause the increase the demand on the other resources such as clean water, food, fresh air 
and any other resources. Meanwhile, it will generate more waste disposed to the environment. Some environmental 
problems faced in the city indicate that urban carrying capacity has exceeded. The condition of the environment will 
degrade if the load pressure on the environment affected by human activities has exceeded the environment carrying 
capacity. To the strategy for sustainable of living, carrying capacity has also defined as  “….improving the quality of 
human life while living within the carrying capacity supporting ecosystem” (IUCN, UNEP, WWF 1991). The latter 
then the concept directly related with the final limit of the Earth ecosystem to the impacts they can withstand without 
irreversible damage.   Sustainable development strongly implies that recognition of final development limits, derived 
from the requirements of the natural environment, is the main step to be urgently taken. It is the same in planning; 
there will be no use in dealing with the problem in a more detail and sophisticated way before these limits are identified 
in the early stage of any planning. The concept of limits is well implicated in the field ecological studies. (Watanabe

be considered available for development and it indicates that very little additional area expansion of development. The 
areas (14%) was indicated as first thresholds within solution space with low transformation and intermediate 
thresholds with medium transformation will become area for expansion urban development. The calculated area on

5. Conclusion 
The application of the UET analysis on the Northern Region of Mie indicates that a spatial analysis of the 
interrelationship between natural resources and development is necessary, if decision about the location of the future 
is to be based on ecological criteria. This study does not present a solution to the problems facing Northern Region of 
Mie; however, it does provide a s useful framework for addressing the major issues, points to some shortcomings in 
the present approach and how the can be reduced. The spatial dimension dealt with current research may be seen as 
the initial phase of more comprehensive analyses that addresses the problems of carrying capacity (quantitative UET) 
and seasonal constraint (temporal UET). 
 
This research is to ensure the continued viability of significant elements of the environment. The combination of 
uniqueness, resilience and transformation of forest resulted in environmental territorial thresholds map. This map 
provided a base model to determine an ecologically solution space for development activities on the Northern Region 
of Mie. A solution space should primarily be determined by these constraints, which can be considered as having final 
(boundary, ultimate) character that indicate where and which kind of development should take place, so that a rational 
use of natural resources can be secured. This research demonstrated that an ecologically solution space that was 
produced in the Northern region of Mie provides a firm basis upon which developers can exercise their flexibility in 
sitting specific development proposal in their area on what and where is to be generated and contained. The result 
being the planning contribution towards defining carrying capacity which indicate what preferred and dominant 
function should be promoted and where is ecologically safe would become especially relevant. From the viewpoint of 
establishing tolerance to development activities, ecological carrying capacity forms an important concept. Talking the 
point, carrying capacity is the amount of activity or use that can be handled by system before it begins to deteriorate, 
another way to describe carrying capacity is determining how much use a given setting can absorb before unacceptable 
impact occur.

In summary, an overall adaptation of Environmental Thresholds approach provides a simple approach that can be 
useful tool in defining city’s carrying capacity. Finally, we recommend that (1) The extensions of the UET method 
appear to be viable and necessary (2) UETs must be further develop as a basis to formulate policy guidelines for 
implementing Carrying Capacity all over Indonesia areas.

Abstract 
A car dealership is a car sales business that sells cars and services, which is the benchmark for prospective buyers. 
Increasing sales within the company are needed in developing business through building loyalty and trust between 
buyers and businesses. Companies can thrive on innovating and being sustainable when sales are in good shape. This 
research was conducted to find the correlation between employee engagement and sales. It is focused on making good 
business decisions to increase sales. This study focuses on determining the driving factors for employee engagement 
that have a significant effect on sales, the magnitude of its influence on sales, and suggestions for increasing sales 
from employee engagement. This research was conducted through Multiple Linear Regression modeling with Cross-
Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology. All independent variables in all models, 
namely NPBT Sales, NPBT Service, Unit Sales, and Unit Entry, each have a level of determination coefficient of 
0.6889, 0.4962, 0.6795, and 0.4968. All models can be explained by 68.89%, 49.62%, 67.95%, and 49.68%, 
respectively, by the independent variables of each model. Suggestions were also obtained as a framework for 
maximizing sales based on Project Cycle Management.

1. Introduction
A car dealership is a form of car sales business that offers the sale of the car unit itself. A car dealership is operated 
by selling its products through salespeople in promoting car units to potential customers. This business also offers 
after-sales services such as maintenance, sales of spare parts, car modifications, and warranty claims. The service 
quality of a car dealership is a benchmark for prospective buyers in considering their decision to buy products and

5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the t-test on Model 1 NPBT Sales, it is known that the Supervision, Image, EVP, Values, 
Empowerment, Performance Management, Communication, Work Structure Resources, and Working Climate 
variables have a partially significant effect on the NPBT Sales variable because they have more p-values. Smaller than 
0.05. Therefore, these variables can affect the rise and fall of NPBT Sales. All independent variables in Model 1 NPBT 
Sales have a coefficient of determination of 0.6889. NPBT Sales can be explained as much as 68.89% by the 
independent variables contained in the final model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Supervision, Image, EVP, 
Values, Empowerment, Performance Management, Communication, Work Structure Resources, and Working Climate 
variables significantly influence the determination coefficient of 68.89%. 
 
Based on the results of the t-test on Model 2 NPBT Service, it is known that the EVP and Values variables have a 
partially significant effect on the NPBT Service variable because they have a p-value smaller than 0.05. Therefore, 
these variables can affect the ups and downs of NPBT Service. All independent variables in Model 2 NPBT Service 
have a coefficient of determination of 0.4962. NPBT Service can be explained as much as 49.62% by the independent 
3377","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

variables contained in the final model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the EVP and Values variables significantly 
influence the level of the coefficient of determination of 49.62%. 
 
Based on the results of the t-test on Model 3 Unit Sales, it is known that the Supervision, Senior Leadership, Image, 
EVP, Career Advancement, Learning Opportunities, Performance Management, Communication, and Work Structure 
Resources variables have a partially significant effect on the Unit Sales variable because they have a p-value. Value 
is less than 0.05. Therefore, these variables can affect the ups and downs of Unit Sales. All independent variables in 
Model 3 Unit Sales have a coefficient of determination of 0.6795. Unit Sales can be explained as much as 67.95% by 
the independent variables contained in the final model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the variables Supervision, 
Senior Leadership, Image, EVP, Career Advancement, Learning Opportunities, Performance Management, 
Communication, and Work Structure Resources have a significant effect with a coefficient of determination of 
67.95%. 
 
Based on the results of the t-test on Model 4 Unit Entry, it is known that the Image, EVP, Work Structure Resources, 
and Working Climate variables have a partially significant effect on the Unit Entry variable because they have a p-
value smaller than 0.05. Therefore, these variables are variables that can affect the ups and downs of Unit Entry. All 
independent variables in Model 4 Unit Entry have a coefficient of 0.4968. Unit entry can be explained as much as 
49.68% by the independent variables contained in the final model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the variables 
Image, EVP, Work Structure Resources, and Working Climate have a significant influence, with a coefficient of 
determination level of 49.68%. 
 
Research can be carried out within a certain period. The current study was only conducted for one month. This causes 
a lack of material that can be researched in order to improve the accuracy of the modeling results obtained from this 
study. Data sets can be developed further. This development can be done through the identification of new independent 
variables. Identifying this new independent variable has a function in further exploring the factors that influence sales 
variables. 
Further research should also be aligned according to the organization under study. Every organization has its own 
culture and system. This stage is critical in producing research that can describe the organization well.

Abstract 
This study was conducted in wholesaler that was located in Jakarta and the purpose of this study was to find out the 
impact of organizational socialization toward organizational commitment with psychological empowerment as 
mediating variable. The data was collected by doing interview and also distributing questionnaire to 100 wholesaler 
employees as respondents with simple random technique as a sampling technique. Further, the data collected was 
analyzed by using structural equation model (SEM) with the basis of theory and concept, from the package of Partial 
Least Square (PLS) program as data analysis technique. In this study, exogenous variable is organizational 
socialization, endogen variable is organizational commitment and psychological empowerment as intervening 
variable. This study found that organizational socialization has significant effect on organizational commitment and 
psychological empowerment. Psychological empowerment also has significant impact on organizational commitment. 
This study results stated that psychological empowerment proven to mediate organizational socialization toward 
organizational commitment.

1. Introduction
Employees are important company assets that are highly valued by the company. Skilled employees who have good 
knowledge and superior abilities have high economic value for the company. A more important aspect is that skilled 
and qualified employees are in line with company goals, strive to achieve company goals and generate profits for the 
company. The organizational socialization process plays an important role in meeting this goal; therefore, the company 
must develop several socialization plans such as strengthening the bond between leaders and their subordinates and 
appointing employees who have experience guiding new employees, thereby improving physical and mental health 
resulting in better performance and production value. Building company relationships with employees is an important 
step to stimulate high performance results, therefore the company's obligation is to trigger employee commitment to 
the company or organizational commitment. 
Organizational commitment is employee loyalty to the company. It is the condition of employees in line with 
organizational goals (Mustafa et al., 2021). High commitment makes employees more loyal and work hard to achieve 
company goals and progress (Berberoglu, 2018). Organizational commitment is the emotional attachment, 
identification and involvement of individuals with the organization and the desire to remain a member of the 
organization (Miedaner et al., 2018). The process of building commitment can be achieved by employees' emotional 
ties to the company in terms of company goals and objectives, where with this perception the feeling of desire to work 
is stimulated and realized with satisfactory performance results. The emotional bond between the worker and the 
company can be realized by the existence of healthy and well-maintained reciprocal activities between the two parties, 
the reward or the effort made by the employee with the award that will be given by the company. Organizational 
commitment relationships that are built and maintained on an ongoing basis can produce good results, but on the other

The results showed that organizational socialization had a significant effect on Organizational Commitment with a t 
value of 2,985 in line with (Purnomo et al., 2022), showing the same results between these relationships in a positive 
and significant way, with all dimensions of Organizational Socialization showing a positive relationship to 
Organizational Commitment. Organizations that create commitment through the process of adopting an understanding 
and experience of organizational values will facilitate employee adaptation and increase organizational commitment 
(Kowtha, 2018). Affective, normative, and continuous organizational socialization is positively related to 
organizational commitment (Nishanthi & Kailasapathy, 2018). Organizational Socialization of Psychological 
Empowerment with the largest t value of 28,535. In line with research (Saidah & Muhid, 2021), the empowerment 
process is manifested in meaning, competence, self-determination and impact. With psychological empowerment can 
increase task initiation and employee persistence so that better decision making, higher quality, more innovation and 
higher job satisfaction. Psychological Empowerment on Organizational Commitment with a t value of 7325. Research 
from Jomah (2017) shows the influence between these variables where the dimensions of impact and self-
determination have a positive and significant effect on organizational commitment, but the dimensions of competence 
and meaning do not have a positive effect on organizational commitment. The role of psychological empowerment on 
employee trust is very important. Employees who have confidence in their colleagues and leaders will feel compelled 
to do their jobs better (Abbasi et al., 2021). Employees who feel their work has an effective impact on the company's 
business processes will significantly trigger feelings of employee loyalty to the company. Psychological empowerment 
has an important role in increasing the proactive behaviour of employees in the form of asking for feedback from 
colleagues or superiors, engaging in creative and innovative activities (J. Huang, 2017) and feeling confident that he 
has the ability to overcome all problems that arise, perform work more optimally, act more independently, and get a 
higher commitment so as to encourage them to behave proactively at work. Organizational Socialization to 
Organizational Commitment where Psychological Empowerment is a mediator variable with a t value of 6.610. In line 
with (Aldabbas et al., 2021), the results show that the role of Psychological Empowerment as an intervening on 
Organizational Commitment. Employees who have a high commitment are company assets, can be increased by 
providing satisfaction to employees (Hakim & Hidayat, 2018). Companies that socialize with employees will gain the 
knowledge needed to participate and function effectively, encourage employees to be happier doing tasks, generate 
positive emotions, and evaluate work positively (Shah et al., 2019). Leaders always positively support the activities 
of their employees as long as they are useful for the organization and employee self-development. Employees feel 
valued and accepted in the organization. 
5. Conclusion
 Based on the discussion that has been described, some conclusions and recommendations can be expressed as follows: 
1) Organizational socialization has a significant influence on organizational commitment; 2)  Organizational
socialization has a significant influence on psychological empowerment; 3) Psychological empowerment has a
significant influence on organizational commitment and 4) Organizational socialization has a significant influence on
organizational commitment with psychological empowerment as variable intervening.
To be able to improve organizational socialization, companies must increase future expectation by offering an 
interesting career path for employees, have a reward system every month such as employee of the month, etc. To 
increase psychological empowerment, companies must controlling reviews on good positive opinions, improve 
coordination and communication between superiors and subordinates, so that both parties can discuss authority in the 
work environment and compromise in the work process so that employees feel mentally empowered to carry out their 
obligations in the company, followed by an employee performance appraisal system .Recommendations for further 
researchers 1) Increase the number of respondents in order to get more accurate results. 2) Expanding the scope of 
observations because in this study the sample was limited to wholesaler employees.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to expand on existing co-creation knowledge by exploring brand value co-creation in 
health care from the patient’s perspective. In addition, a conceptual framework is proposed that can be empirically 
validated. A systematic literature review, concept analysis and synthesis from previous study were conducted to 
develop a conceptual framework. Therefore, customer brand co-creation theory is adapted to develop patient brand 
value co-creation conceptual framework. There are two key constructs as antecedents to brand value co-creation in 
the context of the patient-provider relationship, namely patient empowerment, and relationship quality. Two 
propositions and a patient brand value co-creation concept framework were constructed and proposed from patient 
empowerment and relationship quality to enrich research in the brand value co-creation domain. Health care service 
providers could benefit from this research since the proposed conceptual framework indicated the importance of 
supporting or empowering patients as well as maintaining good relationship quality to facilitate brand value co-
creation. This study contributes to the brand value co-creation literature, especially in health care services. 
Keywords 
Value co-creation, Brand value co-creation, Patient brand co-creation, Patient empowerment, Relationship quality 
1. Introduction
Marketing view has shifted from goods-dominant (G-D) logic to service-dominant (S-D) logic in which value is co-
created between a firm as a good or service provider and its stakeholders (Vargo and Lusch 2004). Thus, value co-
creation acknowledges the contribution of customers as participative actors. In the co-creation ecosystems, value is 
created in a shared relationship among brands, customers and stakeholders (Payne et al. 2009). Merz, He and Vargo 
(2009) argued that the discussion on value co-creation has expanded to branding. Brand value co-creation can be 
viewed from the perspective of the provider or customer. Only a few researchers have conducted research brand value 
co-creation since the concept of brand value co-creation is not easily understood (Merz et al. 2018). In addition, value 
co-creation has also expanded in health care, but it is not clear which factor influences patients as customers to 
contribute or help to co-create brand value.  Therefore, research in brand value co-creation in a specific context such 
as health care from the customers or patients’ views will enhance the understanding of the brand value co-creation 
domain.  
1.1 Objectives 
To fill the research gap and provide with a better understanding of patients’ contributions to a hospital or clinic’s 
brand value creation, therefore the objective of this study is to explore brand value co-creation in health care that 
contributed by chronically ill patients. Additionally, a conceptual framework which incorporates several key 
propositions is developed and proposed. Further, the conceptual framework can be empirically validated. 
3389","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
Additionally, relationship quality between patients and their health care professionals also influences patients to 
contribute to patient brand value co-creation. Satisfaction with the relationship and patients’ comfort with health care 
professionals leads to brand value co-creation behavior.   
 
First, the current conceptual framework and proposition provide a theoretical contribution because they are two 
possible antecedents that may lead to brand value co-creation in health care (patient empowerment and relationship 
quality). Second, the conceptual framework of patient brand value co-creation is the extension of previous studies that 
emphasized input from the customer’s viewpoint. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Our propositions and conceptual framework provide valuable insight for health care professionals or health care 
providers. To maximize the health care outcomes or maintain quality of life, health care professionals cannot do this 
by themselves. They must consider the abilities, knowledge, and skill of patients. Health care professionals should 
provide facilities for the patient’s ability and willingness to co-create value.  The Patient Brand Co-Creation conceptual 
framework is groundwork for brand value co-creation in health care. Future research is necessary in which patients 
with chronic illness are suggested to be the main participants or respondents to assess the propositions and the 
conceptual framework.

Abstract 
The world is moving towards sustainability through environmentally friendly practices. Green marketing practices 
also contribute toward sustainability by controlling and managing green products. The present study aims to provide 
an assessment of furniture brands in marketing 4.0 for successful green supply chain management (GSCM). Three 
famous furniture brands are evaluated by considering the various green marketing criteria. The Analytic hierarchy 
process-Group decision-making (AHP-GDM) is employed to evaluate and assess the criteria and furniture brand. The

1. Introduction
Marketing 4.0, is a novel marketing approach updated from marketing 3.0 involving internet-based technology which 
may be used in product brand assessment. Marketing 4.0 also encourages internet-based green production and 
consumption. Further, more and more businesses are more inclined in adopting “green” as a marketing strategy. The 
adoption of such a strategy not only helps in sustainability but also enhances loyalty and satisfaction. The organization 
adopting the strategies of practicing green, clean, and sustainable production and consumption are in a position to 
capture more market share. Apart from many businesses, the furniture industries are also keen on practicing “green” 
for the most required sustainability. The “green” practices in the business of furniture production and consumption 
have helped in reducing carbon emissions which ultimately helped in a sustainable environment by preventing serious 
effects. The importance of implementing green marketing techniques has increased for businesses seeking triple-
bottom-line performance evaluation. The involvement of People, Planet and Profit helps in accomplishing the most 
needed sustainability which is shown in Figure 1.

6. Conclusion  
In the present study, the performance evaluation of a furniture brand is carried out using the multi-criteria decision-
making-based approaches of AHP-GDM for GSCM. Eight performance evaluation criteria that are compatible with 
industry 4.0 and marketing 4.0 are selected for the evaluation of three popular furniture brands X, Y, and Z (disguised). 
It is found that brand performance evaluation criteria of product pricing (C6), product value (C7), and product quality 
(C5) are the three most important criteria. Further, the brands X, Y, and Z are ranked 1, 3, and 2. The furniture 
industries may use these performance evaluation criteria for ranking their product brands and regularly assessing their 
products for their performance evaluation concerning the triple-bottom-line.

responsibility or CSR does not provide significant social benefits but is merely an attempt by the companies to attract the 
attention of new potential customers. 
 
The companies publish CSR activities carried out with the aim of a marketing approach (greenwashing), where the CSR 
activities are not actually carried out. In addition, 15 companies that do not have the characteristics of social banks do not 
focus on the targets and values that these companies want to achieve. The companies will make the publication of CSR 
activities as an accessory to improve company marketing.  
 
Meanwhile, 24 other banking companies meet the criteria of social banks or have main business activities in the form of 
maximizing savings collection and distributing credit to bank customers. The companies will be ready to operate with a 
small profit margin with added value to the environment and society with the aim of sustainability development. This is 
because the companies do not only focus on company profits but also seek to maximize social benefits by contributing 
through their business activities. The companies will refuse to contribute to the capital market, invest in financial products, 
etc. Thus, it can be concluded that most banking companies as a sample of companies carry out sustainable development or 
carry out real social responsibility. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis results, it can be concluded that all banking companies included in the research sample publish CSR 
activities. Banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2015-2020 that become most of the research 
samples do not only maximize company profits but carry out real CSR activities with the aim of sustainability reporting. 
There are 24 banking companies that fulfill the characteristics of social banks by maximizing savings collection and 
distributing credit to customers as well as maximizing social benefits. Meanwhile, not all banking companies publish CSR 
activities according to actual events. There are 15 companies that do not meet the characteristics of social banks or in other 
words, companies publish CSR activities with the aim of (greenwashing) marketing approach to get more attention from 
potential new customers. 
 
Based on the research results, the limitation of the study is an assessment of the measurement of banking companies that 
carry out CSR activities cannot measure the extent to which CSR activities are oriented towards sustainability reporting. 
The statement of financial position cannot measure the actual contribution made by the company. Further research is 
expected to be able to analyze the accounts in the statement of financial position by using the characteristics of the social 
bank approach based on corporate external dimensions and internal dimensions. Thus, it can be proven that the real CSR 
activities carried out by the companies are just accessories to increase customer attention or increase social benefits with the 
goal of sustainable development

Abstract 
Strategic management process generally starts from the strategic initiation stage. Several previous researchers have 
used several different terminology and unique concepts. But does the difference between these concepts contain a 
completely unique element, or is it just a mere pleonasm? This has not been widely researched and known. Starting 
from these phenomena, theoretical research will be carried out by analyzing several previous studies. The qualitative 
method with the study literature was carried out on this study with purposive sampling technique, then will be 
summarized and synthesized to obtain similarities and differences between these researchers. Thus, it is hoped that 
the results will be able to describe the concept of strategic initiation more comprehensively and be able to answer 
whether the developments that occur are merely pleonasms or are really relevant to the development of the current 
situation.

1. Introduction
The development and discussion about the concept of strategic initiation has been discussed in many literature and 
previous research. Some people might even argue that the discussion is actually causing confusion, or maybe it’s 
just a pleonasm. Pleonasm here is intended as something that might be quite clear, but packaged in different terms so 
that it appears as something new. 
Some previous researchers such as Mintzberg (1994) revealed two differences in the context of the strategy-making 
process. First in the form of ""strategic thinking"" and the second in the form of ""strategic planning"". Both of these are 
expressed as two different approaches and cannot be equated, as well as the synthesis process with the analysis 
process. As if confirming what was stated by Mintzberg, Raimond (1996), Heracleous (1998) and Graetz (2002) 
regarding strategy management discussed many differences about strategic thinking and strategic planning. 
In another study, Parnell & Lester (2003) used the term ""strategy approach"" as one of five critical dilemma or five 
critical factors that often become dilemmas in choosing a strategy. They review the debate between strategic artist 
and scientist here. In comparison, they compared the two orientation of strategy approach here in the context of 
systematic analysis of environment, environmental predictability, perception of environment, planning steps, and 
key intellectual influence. 
Other researchers revealed the term ""strategic renewal"" start from intuitive approaches and interpreting approaches 
(Crossan & Berdrow, 2003). While De Wit & Meyer (2010) uses the term ""strategy tension"" which can often be 
seen as a puzzle, dilemma, trade-off or paradox to describe the debates and controversies that arise. Furthermore, 
they classify strategic thinking here into two different schools, namely creative orientation and logical orientation. 
Then Pisapua et al. (2005) viewed that strategic thinking consist of systems thinking, reframing thinking and 
reflecting thinking, which complement each other.  
The parameters that distinguish between the two orientations are explained in more detail, in cased the more 
dominant main emphasis, the more dominant cognitive style, systematic thinking, the nature of thinking, the way to 
recognize a problem, how to solve problems, how to place values applicable values, assumptions and

[2] Combination Perpective
Combination perspective here can be explain s “two become one”, which is two orientation complementary each
other in every step and can’t be seperate. For example, Parnell & Lester (2003) used the term ""strategy approach""
and divides into two different approaches namely art and science. In his research, Parnell stated that in a strategy
there must be elements of art and also scientific elements, although evidence that shows the existence of a balance or
combination of these two approaches is still fairly weak (Parnell, 2005). Then Pisapia et al. (2005) viewed that
strategic thinking consist of systems thinking, reframing thinking and reflecting thinking, which complement each
other and can’t be seperate. Three orienation of strategic thinking skill here are compementary each others as key
driver to success. In contrast to the ""group"" of researchers before, this statement affirms that these two elements are
things that always exist in each stage of strategic preparation that are complementary and are not sequentially
separated.
6. Conclusion
Base on exploration from many literature review above, it can be synthesis into some similiarity and difference 
between previous researchers. Given the similarities and differences between the researchers above, it can be seen 
that research conducted in different terms is not a pleonasm. But, this research is still limited in looking for 
similarities and differences in concepts between researchers, so it still needs to be completed with further research. 
For example, it can be analyzed the relationship between concepts to find under what conditions the differences 
found can be more suitable to be applied to achieve better performance results.

1. Introduction
The capital market's investment operations are among the most in-demand economic activity among the general 
populace. Cash market investing is the allocation of sources of capital to generate future profits.(Aleskerova & 
Fedoryshyna, 2018). One of the several forms of securities offered on the capital market is shares. Due to their 
susceptibility to external and internal influences, stocks are categorized as high-risk investments. These adjustments 
may favor or negatively affect the capital market's share values. Two fundamental and technical methodologies may 
be used to analyze these changes: the basic and technical approaches.(Lui & Mole, 1998). 
Real estate is one of the essential industries in Indonesia. The real estate market is a crucial indicator of a nation's 
economic health. The real estate business is the first indicator of a country's economic growth or decline. The 
Indonesian government's support for the real estate sector was beneficial in raising issuers' sales in the first quarter of 
2021. During the first three months of 2021, the pre-sale revenue or marketing sales of numerous public corporations 
in the real estate industry increased by double digits. (Tari, 2021). 
The weakening of the Covid-19 case boosted consumer confidence in the purchase of real estate products and 
complemented several government incentives, including the 0% LTV deduction for the down payment on the purchase 
of a property, which acted as a motivator for issuers in this sector. In the country's third quarter of 2021, many real 
estate developers have begun to exhibit good conduct. (Fernando, 2021). 
1.1 Objectives 
This research evaluates the assets' expected  return and standard deviation of five real estate companies: PT Pollux 
Property Indonesia Tbk. (POLL), Metropolitan Kentjana Tbk. (MKPI), PT Bumi Serpong Damai Tbk (BSDE), PT 
Pakuwon Jati Tbk (PWON), and PT Ciputra Development Tbk (CTRA)

5.2 Proposed Improvements 
The following are possible recommendations: Although a significant standard deviation indicates volatility, not all 
investors choose a low standard deviation. The investor's willingness to take on much risk with his investment depends 
on the investor. There are discrepancies in the portfolio of investments. An investor must be able to assess his or her 
volatility tolerance and overall investing goals. Contrary to aggressive investors, who are more comfortable with high 
volatility value investments owing to the possibility for more significant profits, conservative investors seek a minimal 
standard deviation. 
6. Conclusion
Examining PT Pollux Property Indonesia Tbk shares allows us to draw the following conclusions. (POLL), 
Metropolitan Kentjana Tbk. (MKPI), PT Bumi Serpong Damai Tbk (BSDE), PT Pakuwon Jati Tbk (PWON), and PT 
Ciputra Development Tbk (CTRA): a) PT Ciputra Development Tbk (CTRA) has the most significant standard 
deviation at 0.5035, while PT Bumi Serpong Damai Tbk (BSDE) has the lowest standard deviation at 0.0940. The 
larger the standard deviation, the higher the risk, profit potential, and return volatility. b) Of these five real estate 
stocks, PT Eastparc Hotel Tbk (EAST) has the highest expected return at 3.2%, while PT Pollux Property Indonesia 
Tbk shares have the lowest expected return at 1.6%. (POLL's lowest score is -3.05 percent.

Abstract 
Various efforts have been carried out to achieve national electrification targets in Indonesia. However, electrification 
in remote areas encounters several obstacles related to the high investment costs, lack of infrastructure and demand 
volatility. The local stakeholders are actively conducting energy projects through the energy community. This paper 
gathers the latest articles regarding energy community innovation and resource utilization in Indonesia. The review 
process is focused on the study that highlighted the rural and the remote area. We mapped out the research and 
innovation carried out by the energy community. We review the report and latest articles indexed by Scopus and 
SINTA. Based on our review, the energy community in Indonesia optimizes local resources and utilizes waste. Energy 
innovations are not only related to electrification but also to food storage and processing. The energy Community also 
actively making continuous improvement to solve local problems.

1. Introduction
Global energy demand is heading a growth due to economic and population growth (IEA, 2021). Energy becomes a 
commodity to satisfy human needs, welfare, and economic development (Owusu & Asumadu-Sarkodie, 2016). The 
high demand for energy causes the potential for energy scarcity. The impact of energy scarcity in the world is also 
spreading to Indonesia. Researchers have conducted modelling of energy demand in Indonesia. Lefaan and Dalimi 
(2018) modelled a significant increase in the household electricity demand of Papua Province Indonesia in 2050 using 
a system-dynamic approach. Developing regions have higher energy needs to catch up with regions that have good 
infrastructure. For instance, the condition is related to the need for electrification. Various efforts have been carried 
out to achieve national electrification targets in Indonesia. On average, the Electrification Ratio in Indonesia is around 
99.20%  in 2020 (Direktorat Jenderal Ketenagalistrikan, 2021). However, several areas have not received 
electrification coverage, especially in the remote area. There is an imbalance in the electrification ratio in remote areas 
such as the provinces of Papua and Maluku which is still below 95%. Even the islands of East Nusa Tenggara only 
reached 87.62%. The data shows a fairly wide disparity between several regions. Geographical conditions are the main

through Global Solar Atlas (https://globalsolaratlas.info/). Through this data, the irradiation time can be simulated to 
obtain optimal solar energy. 
 
7. Limitation 
More publications are obtained from researchers who review the real work of existing work from the energy 
community that has made improvements. 
 
8. Conclusion 
Indonesia is an archipelago country; the outer island is difficult to transmit electricity through the on-grid. Small 
islands must be able to supply their own energy needs independently through the off-grid decentralized concept. We 
followed a literature review methodology aimed at answering a series of questions that helped us understand how the 
main aspects of the study were addressed to contribute to best practice literature of energy community innovation and 
local resources utilization in a decentralized off-grid system. 
 
Based on the results of the study, there are four energy communities that have electrical energy fulfillment programs 
in Indonesia. Electrical energy is fulfilled using micro hydroelectric power plants, biogas dissemination program and 
wind energy. For further research, it is necessary to add suplementary research on the solar energy community. From 
our finding, research related to solar energy is still at the survey and initiation stage with the main focus on developing 
solar-powered fishery cold storage. 
 
Various efforts were made to meet the electricity demand. We found that the selection of the energy program was 
based on the existing potential in the region. So, it is important to carry out the initial mapping and survey stages 
before starting the program. For the smooth running of the program, it is necessary to hold deliberations and 
specifically involve the community and regional leaders. Understanding the leadership structure also important. On 
the technical aspect, training in operations management and financial management needs to be carried out for program 
sustainability. Most of the energy communities are grant projects that only cover surveys, initial investment, and 
operational costs for a limited period of time. Then maintenance and procurement training is also important, thus the 
energy community can independently solve the technical problem and optimize the energy production.

Abstract 
This study uses the Monte Carlo simulation method to calculate a stock portfolio's Value at Risk (VaR). Value at risk 
(VaR) is a standard method for evaluating the risk of loss in a portfolio of financial assets. The research findings 
predict the maximum loss that portfolio participants may incur. This study experimented 500 times to characterize the 
risk associated with invested assets. The hotel stocks portfolio on the Indonesian Stock Exchange consists of PT. 
Eastparc Hotel Tbk (EAST), PT Hotel Sahid Jaya International Tbk (SHID), and PT Dafam Property Indonesia Tbk 
(DFAM).. The VaR calculation assumes a 200,000,000 IDR capital investment in each share. According to the 
analysis, the results are unfavorable; thus, investors who purchase the three stocks would lose money. The VaR for 
EAST is -0.1886 with a maximum loss of IDR 371,242.76, the VaR for SHID is -0.5144 with a maximum loss of IDR 
1,028,735.06, and the VaR for DFAM is -0.5339 with a maximum loss of IDR 1,077,704.16.

1. Introduction
Risk is an essential characteristic of financial activity. Risk is the potential for the actual return or rate to vary from 
anticipated (the actual return is different from the expected return). Almost all investments in the business sector 
include uncertainty or risk (Ganzach, 2000). Investors cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of their investments. 
Investors will also encounter additional challenges. When making financial choices, investors examine both 
prospective gains and potential hazards. 
The value at risk is a standard method for assessing value at risk (VaR). The Value at Risk (VaR) is the highest 
estimated loss realized over a particular time under normal market circumstances and within a specified confidence 
range. VaR can be calculated using the parametric method (also known as the variance-covariance method), the Monte 
Carlo simulation method, or the historical simulation method (Suhobokov, 2007) 
The capital market's investment operations are among the most in-demand economic activity among the general 
populace. Cash market investing is the allocation of sources of capital to generate future profits.(Aleskerova & 
Fedoryshyna, 2018). One of the several forms of securities offered on the capital market is shares. Due to their 
susceptibility to external and internal influences, stocks are categorized as high-risk investments. These adjustments 
may favor or negatively affect the capital market's share values. The fundamental and technical methodologies may 
be used to analyze these changes: the fundamental and technical approaches (Lui & Mole, 1998). 
A series of government-implemented reforms left hospitality issuers with a positive attitude. Initially, there was a 
decline in PPKM. Second, antigen or PCR test results are no longer required for domestic travel for those who have 
had two vaccine doses and a booster. The Hotel PT Eastparc (EAST) This policy positively impacts EAST. Small and 
medium-sized meeting venues and events have excellent occupancy rates. Current hotel occupancy rates range from 
75 to 85 percent. This year, EAST hopes to achieve an average hotel occupancy rate between 75% and 85%. Eastparc 
predicts a revenue range of IDR 55 billion to IDR 65 billion, with a net profit range of IDR 15 billion to IDR 25 
billion. EAST included extra family-friendly vacation features, such as mini-trains and wave pools to satisfy 
performance goals. This issuer is also refurbishing existing facilities to boost hotel occupancy and room revenues, 
especially for direct-booking consumers  (Puspitasari, 2022).

5.2 Proposed Improvements  
The following are possible recommendations: 
 
a. 
When advising prospective investors who want to invest in the three companies, it is recommended that they 
observe the hotel industry's recovery and wait for the optimal time. 
b. Additionally, investors might monitor hotel news to buy sooner at lower average prices. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The following conclusions may be taken from the discussion on PT's value-at-risk (VaR) assessment. Eastparc Hotel 
Tbk (EAST), PT Dafam Property Indonesia Tbk (DFAM), and PT Hotel Sahid Jaya International Tbk (SHID) daily 
equity portfolios using the simulation approach from Monte Carlo: 
 
a. 
The prior three hotel acts produced a negative value at risk. 
b. Investors are willing to assume risk while investing 200,000,000 IDR in shares. The VaR for EAST is -0.1886 
with a maximum loss of IDR 371,242.76, the VaR for SHID is -0.5144 with a maximum loss of IDR 1,028,735.06, 
and the VaR for DFAM is -0.5339 with a maximum loss of IDR 1,077,704.16.

Abstract 
The increasingly fierce global competition, dynamic changes in customer demand, and rapid technological advances 
are the dominant factors in environmental changes, making it difficult for companies to achieve and maintain their 
competitive advantage. These changes create environmental uncertainty for the company. Environmental uncertainty 
puts pressure on company performance due to the large investment costs incurred to overcome increasing uncertainty. 
Management seeks to create strategies to minimize the impact of environmental uncertainty on company performance, 
one of the strategies that can be used is innovation. Innovation encourages companies to produce quality products or 
services at low costs, improvise products with new attributes, and produce products that are different from before. 
Efficiency is an important concept in innovation because innovation requires large funding. We examine the 
relationship between environmental uncertainty and firm performance, as well as the moderating effect of innovation 
efficiency on this relationship. We tested manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2013 
to 2019 with 564 total observations. We find evidence that environmental uncertainty has a negative effect on firm 
performance, and innovation efficiency can reduce this negative effect. The evidence shows that environmental 
uncertainty as a contingency problem is an opportunity for companies to improve their performance, by being more 
active in carrying out innovation projects. When environmental uncertainty increases, policymakers within the 
company must ensure that the innovation projects carried out can run efficiently, thus providing great benefits for 
improving company performance.

Abstract  
 
Supply chain 4.0 has become a growing issue for companies to survive and achieve better efficiency. Most of the 
existing Industrial 4.0 measurements focus on manufacturing technology applications. The current measurement tools 
of Industry 4.0 are lacking when considering the maturity level of the supply chain. The critical role of the supply 
chain is to ensure the flow of materials, products, and information to connect many actors in business processes within 
the company. The article aimed to compare the existing Industry 4.0 measuring tools, such as INDI 4.0, IMPULS, 
SIRI, and PwC, in the supply chain scope. This study used the qualitative method to compare the Industrial 4.0 
measurement tools related to the supply chain 4.0 criteria. The supply chain is measured by six dimensions of Industry 
4.0, such as instrumented, interconnected, intelligent, automated, integrated, and innovative. The result shows that the 
supply chain measurement in SIRI, and PwC has a higher score index than INDI and IMPULS. The score describes 
the level of the supply chain involved in the Industrial 4.0 assessment. All existing Industrial 4.0 tools did not consider 
innovative criteria in supply chain measurement.

Figure 3 illustrates the development of the supply chain framework in Industry 4.0 adoption. The measurement 
stages start from the instrumentation stage to the innovative stage. The supply chain measurement begins with 
instrumented criteria, namely the availability of digital devices in supply chain activities. The second criterion 
indicated integration, such as horizontal integration. The instrumented measurement is based on digital technology 
used to support SC activities. The use of digital technology in the SC process for inbound and outbound logistics 
activities is a criterion that indicates the level of digitization. Integrated criteria measure all chain members from 
end to end as being integrated, and connected with the digital and physical supply chains. Interconnected discusses 
virtual and physical connections to generate real-time data in the supply chain process.

Figure 3. Framework development of supply chain 4.0 performance assessment 
The automation criteria are a hallmark of the use of technology 4.0. Automation defines the supply chain as the 
use of technology to carry out the physical flow and supply chain information without human intervention (fig.3). 
The automation referred to in the supply chain is characterized by the adoption of technology based on robotics 
and machine learning. Intelligent criteria measure the extent to which supply chain technology enables process 
optimization and prediction of future demand. The impact of using this technology is characterized by innovation. 
Innovativeness in the supply chain is characterized by value chain improvement, business model innovation, 
service innovation, and new value innovation.  
 
5. Conclusion  
The comparison of supply chain criteria on industrial measuring tools 4.0 has provided a review of the 
digitalization of measurement development in the supply chain. The supply chain assessment tools in Industry 4.0 
include instrumented, interconnected, intelligent, automated, integrated, and innovative criteria. The study 
concludes that there is a gap between existing tools for supply chain measurement and SC 4.0 criteria. The criterion 
unconsidered in the measuring tool is an innovation that arises due to the use of digital technology in the supply 
chain. This study measured the SC level by adopting Industry 4.0 criteria. In the INDI and IMPULS tools, the 
supply chain criteria are found in several different pillars. In SIRI and PwC, it is easy to identify because supply 
chain measurement becomes a separate sub-pillar. The assessment index showed that SIRI and PwC have the 
highest index for supply chain context in Industrial 4.0 tools. This study has limitations, but there are still many 
opportunities to categorize levels and develop assessment tool designs with the value of performance in mind. The 
supply chain 4.0 research has opportunities to design index measurements for each category in the supply chain 
framework. Future research in supply chain research on supply chain 4.0 is still very open for innovative 
measurement as the impact of Industry 4.0 applications.

Abstract 
The work presents a proposal to incorporate the use of engineering tools such as blockchain, BPM and a 
communication plan in the customs services company located in Callao-Peru. For this, a reference framework is 
proposed by several authors that contemplates a theoretical and conceptual framework of the issues to be addressed. 
Likewise, the processes of the customs regime, the strategic aspects, process map and the execution for the approach 
of the problem are indicated. The re-export area is chosen in the same state (Regime 20) where the critical processes 
will be analyzed, and an optimized improvement model will be proposed. For this work, software such as Bizagi, 
Arena Simulation and excel data (Datamart) are used. An indicator scheme is developed and the value of the KPIs is 
displayed. At the end, the conclusions are drawn.

1. Introduction
International Trade is defined as the important part of economic growth of each country, that is why it is sought that 
the customs agencies seek the way to optimize the processes and adapt them in such a way that it can contribute to 
international development and exchange. For the Peruvian legislation, the customs entity is qualified as an essential 
service that is intended to favor foreign trade, to contribute to national development and to ensure customs control 
and fiscal interest. In this world globalized, the responsibility of customs administrations is based on the control 
entry and exit of goods, not only for the purpose of collecting taxes, but also to safeguard national sovereignty, the 
protection of human life, plant and animal health, preservation of the environment and conservation of the artistic, 
historical, and cultural heritage. From this point on, it should be noted that trade is in a changing state with respect 
to time, taking as an example that the current use of the various means of transport, raw material and labor meant a 
limited resource years ago, but has evolved to root of globalization, you can make better use of technology and seek 
the optimization in the current scenario. That is why the importance of customs must be recognized as they are the 
oldest intermediary that has regularized the processes of economic integration across its borders. The problems 
identified, according to the review of the literature, revolve around the need to streamline all the procedures that 
facilitate this exchange, the security of international trade, the reduction of time and costs, as well as all the processes 
related to the foreign trade logistics chain. In this context, globally, customs processes have been affected by COVID-
19 in the last 2 years, in which air customs have been faced with the need to carry out a series of changes to your 
processes. Similarly, the emergence of criminal organizations linked to drug trafficking, money laundering, arms 
trafficking and terrorism jeopardize the control of goods. It is for this reason that customs must play an essential role 
in guaranteeing a balance between the protection of society and the simplification of international exchanges. These 
obstacles can be seen in other countries and regions of the world, forcing them to find new and better instruments to 
facilitate and recover their trade. A case study of success is in China, in which, through remote techniques and

6. Conclusions
As conclusions, we can observe that blockchain technology has been considered one of the most important 
technological tools of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. There are several public and private studies that agree on the 
multiple advantages of the tool due to its transparency, traceability, and security. It is for this reason that the 
blockchain, the BPM and the communication plan have been showing significant results in international trade for 
those who take on the challenge of implementing it in their processes. Finally, thanks to the Arena software, the 
proposed project managed to reduce the release time of goods by 131%.

Abstract 
Small and medium-sized companies in the textile sector have deficiencies in the production area. It happened because 
they do not have a standardized process and adequate machine maintenance management. For this reason, analyzing 
the initial diagnosis of an SME company dedicated to textile printing presented problems in design and printing. Based 
on this, this research developed a proposed model to reduce the return rate, improve work areas' organization, and 
optimize delivery times. The production model is developed based on the Lean BPM (Business Process Management) 
and TPM (Total Productive Management) tools through a 5s continuous improvement approach. The improvement 
proposal is validated in the Arena software, reducing the failure rate of the machines and the rate of returns from 
7.95% to 5.97%.

1. Introduction
In the current context, industrial textile companies are more competitive worldwide since they face a more demanding 
market that demands higher quality products.(Mireles & Estrada, 2017).This sector represents 9.7% of total non-
traditional exports, with the United States as the main consumer with a 53.3% share.(ComexPerú - Sociedad de 
Comercio Exterior Del Perú, n.d.). Therefore, the clothing textile sector is one of the most important sectors in the 
country and represents 10% of companies of the entire manufacturing industry and generates around 400,000 
jobs.(Gestión, 2019). In 2020, the textile and apparel sector fell by 32.1% due to the decline in the apparel subsector, 
with a drop of 35.9%, considering that the level of performance has been lower compared to previous years(Instituto 
de Estudios Económicos y Sociales, 2021). These results harm the growth of textile companies, preventing the 
improvement in the performance of garment manufacturing. This problem was identified in other investigations 
around the world, where the main causes were identified: stamping failures, customer disagreement, or lack of stock. 
Likewise, the company Baguer SAS registered 5.38% of returns to reduce the client's management time (Jessica 
Dayanna Carrillo Díaz, 2018). Another investigation carried out in Peru details a problem in the production process, 
which it identifies as the main cause of the inadequate maintenance and incorrect distribution of the machinery, 
registering a 5% return rate of products(GONZAGA, 2018). This shows, as mentioned above, how textile companies 
register a percentage of returns related to causes or deficiencies in the face of the problem. Due to this, it was essential 
to start from a company that shows these deficiencies in various internal areas to determine the main causes and 
possible solutions. For this reason, the diagnosis of the EYM textile company is evident that the % of returns is high. 
The KPIs of perfect order indicators are also analyzed to determine which factor we must focus on, thus identifying 
the causes of the problem: machine failure in the stamping area and lack of a standardized method in the clothing area. 
This research offers a new perspective of the Lean BPM methodology with TPM and standardization of work to reduce 
returns. However, no article evidence cases of resolving this problem in Latin America, which is based on the 
ignorance that other companies may have by not recognizing this deficiency in their internal areas. The investigation 
is divided into several points that explain the steps involved in the proposed investigation. Then, the research design 
is presented. Finally, the validation of this research design is shown with the conclusions of the study developed.

One of the important indicators is the attention time of order; by implementing the work standardization tools, 5s, 
TPM, and BPM in the design and stamping area, it was possible to reduce operation times and execute the tasks in a 
specific time to this meeting the delivery times to the client with a total reduction of 92.69 hours between the current 
situation and the proposal. Another indicator is the number of machine failures, three failures per year were reduced 
by implementing preventive and autonomous maintenance. The saturation percentage of ironing and stamping 
operators was decreased by 5.31% and 10.97%, respectively, by implementing work standardization, 5s, and Kanban. 
In addition, it was possible to increase the number of orders served per year from 210 to 226. Finally, the MTBF 
managed to raise 307. 2 hours per year, and the MTTR decreased to 28.8; these indicators are important because the 
difference is observed when preventive and autonomous maintenance is implemented. As a result, the company will 
reduce maintenance and reprocessing costs and increase customer satisfaction. 
6. Conclusions
Implementing the Lean BPM tools was fundamental for validating the project because they correctly intervened in the 
leading causes of the investigation. In this way, the project reduced the rate of returns by applying the improvement 
tools from 7.95% to 5.97% and the rate of failures by 40%. On the other hand, it is recommended to have planned and 
autonomous maintenance of the machines to reduce defective products.

Abstract 
In Peru there are different vulnerable groups, with approximately 10.3% of the Peruvian population belonging to the 
group of people with disabilities (PwD) presenting some physical and/or mental condition that may limit their 
performance and labor integration, so it is very It is important to carry out this research to know the factors that 
contribute to facilitating the labor integration of PwD in industrial SMEs in Peru. The study design is empirical and 
qualitative with a grounded theory approach. For its development, three industrial companies that had jobs occupied 
by people with disabilities were summoned, and the interview technique was applied in order to understand the 
position of the actors related to the problem; taking a sample of 9 people who participated freely and voluntarily prior 
invitation and information on the scope of the study, choosing these people regardless of their age or sex. The study 
made it possible to provide a model of knowledge of the relevant factors for the labor integration of PwD and the level 
of effort on the part of the organization: a) the type of work, with 33%; b) the adequacy of the work, with 33%; c) 
awareness of work, with 22%; d) the evaluation of the capacities and performance of workers with disabilities, with

1. Introduction
In Peru there are more than 3 million people with some condition and/or permanent limitation that prevents them from 
developing normally in their daily work activities; that is, almost 10.3% of the Peruvian population (Instituto Nacional 
de Estadística e Informática [INEI] 2021) and that according to information from the United Nations Population Fund, 
77% of PwDs do not participate in the labor market; that is, they face an unemployment rate three times higher than 
the unemployment rate of the population without disabilities (United Nations, 2019). 
The United Nations General Assembly adopted as Sustainable Development Goals to 2030, to achieve full and 
productive employment and ensure decent work for all men and women, including youth and persons with disabilities, 
and equal pay for work of equal value; and in that sense the state has made an important step by applying minimum 
quotas for hiring PwD in companies, according to the General Law of Persons with Disabilities requires that private 
companies with 50 or more workers must hire a minimum of 3% of workers with disabilities and in 5% for public 
sector companies (Law N. ° 29973 2012); however, aspects such as the training facilities required by PwD to perform 
in a job position; or the physical accessibility required to reach the work centers; or the adequacy that the employer 
must make in the facilities to provide facilities to the worker have not yet been resolved; or in a special case, the 
awareness that should be given to the company's workers in order to avoid situations of discrimination or abuse of 
PwDs; and in other cases, the adaptation of procedures and work methods that facilitate the fair integration of PwDs 
would be pending (Botha and Leah 2020). 
It is essential to promote and strengthen corporate social responsibility policies embodied in the mission, vision and 
values of the organization. According to Ngalula et al. (2020) one of the problems facing the world today is the 
improvement of the daily lives of people who have some kind of disability, as they are deprived of the political, social, 
economic and cultural sector. Therefore, it is important to raise awareness and inform society about the importance of 
providing greater employment opportunities for people with disabilities, as it is essential to break stereotypes and 
discriminatory barriers in order to improve employment rates of PwD (Diaz 2019, Friedman 2020).

The following factors, analyzed in terms of their impact to favor the integration of workers with disabilities, placing 
the following factors in order of priority and influence on the results: 
 
First: Type of job 
Its impact is fundamental to the extent that different disability conditions can be more easily adapted to a position that 
requires different skills and competencies; and at this point it is necessary for the organization to have a personnel 
selection area that can evaluate the correspondence between what the position requires and what people with different 
conditions can adapt to the profile of the position. This aspect is closely related to the criteria of remuneration and 
fees in a balanced way that responds to a fair homologation. 
 
Second: Adapt the job 
Which includes adapting and modifying the company's physical facilities for workers with disabilities, training 
workers, incorporating workers with disabilities into emergency and contingency response procedures, changes in 
communication and operation methods and procedures, among others.  
 
Third: Sensitize for work 
Explained in the physical conditions of the workplace, as well as the acceptance of workers with disabilities by the 
rest of the workers and bosses; which can basically be achieved by defining an integration policy for the entire 
company and which the highest authority endorses; implying adapting operational procedures in all areas. 
 
Fourth: Assessment of the skills and performance of workers 
Factor that should have less impact if the organization has correctly adapted the previous aspects, in work methods, 
performance rating systems, fair financial remuneration, evaluation of the workload for each position, as well as 
strengthening of the culture organization and care of the work environment. 
 
According to the article by Espinoza and Gallegos (2018), the authors mention that in order for there to be good 
inclusion, it is important to add technological tools, provide good treatment and cordial relationships at work. This is 
consistent with what was said by the people interviewed, since an important factor for them is having a good work 
environment in which their ideas are taken into account, benefits are offered, they are motivated and trained. Well, it 
is shown from their answers that there are still prejudices, stereotypes and a lack of opportunities. 
 
Unlike the article by Velarde et al. (2018) the present work focused on finding the factors that contribute to the 
integration of people with disabilities. However, they agree on an important point and that is that this article mentions 
that Peruvian law is not complied with when including people with disabilities, this is demonstrated in the previous 
points, since some interviewees mention that it is not counted with the appropriate facilities and environment when 
including them. 
 
6. Conclusion 
One of the factors that contribute favorably to the development and labor integration of PwD highlighted by the 
different people interviewed are the valuation and environment at work (their ideas are taken into account, benefits 
are offered, they are motivated and receive training), the type of job and the implementations that are made within the 
company according to the conditions of the people with disabilities hired. Although many companies have the 
incentive to hire disabled employees, some organizations in Peru still differ in terms of labor equity, many companies 
still do not have a clear concept about the inclusion of people with disabilities (PWD), when analyzing the interviews 
to bosses and coworkers, their perception is that people with some type of disability could delay the work, will not 
provide any benefit to the company and will be a high cost implementation, so many companies create additional 
positions (not important for the company). Therefore, it is important that the HR area has to be in constant training, 
and not just create a position that is not needed in the company to include them. On the other hand, it is highlighted 
that one of the biggest problems for people with disabilities when entering the companies were the inadequate 
facilities, which limits (makes it difficult) for them to develop in their work area, as well as the issue of the relationship 
with colleagues. Finally, the inclusion of people with disabilities in the workplace eliminates different stereotypes, 
generates a better work environment and changes workers' perceptions.

Abstract 
This research provides a step by step methodology to prioritize international business strategies. Although the concept 
of business strategy has been vastly investigated in previous literature, its prioritization is less examined in conjunction 
with Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches. In addition, the problem is not adequately investigated 
in developing countries. Furthermore, recent MCDM model such as Best-Worst Method (BWM) are more appropriate 
tools in comparison with older approaches such as Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as they need less judgments. In 
this regard, to address the gap of previous literature, this study has been arranged in two linked phases as follows. The 
first phase of this research examines different business strategies of previous literature. In this regard, a literature 
survey is completed to investigate different business strategies of previous studies. Following, the second phase 
applies a BWM to investigate and prioritize these strategies. The obtained results show that international business 
strategy, multi-country business strategy, transnational business strategy and global business strategy are the most 
important alternatives, respectively. Lastly, a summary and some directions for future research are suggested in the 
final section of study.

1. Introduction
An appropriate decision making process ends in a suitable outcome (Hashemzahi et al. 2020). Therefore the short, 
medium and long term effects of a decision is directly affected by different processes required to make that decision 
(Hemmati et al. 2018:2019). As an example, many organizations are involved in strategy related decisions. In addition, 
some organizations have to follow international rules as they are working with abroad companies. To be more specific, 
different strategies can be considered by companies with regard to their scope, size, products and many other issues 
(Herzog 2011). Hence, it is essential to recognize and prioritize these strategies, especially in international companies. 
Although there are many qualitative approaches to select a business strategy for a company, there are also many

5. Conclusion
This study proposed a step by step procedure to rank different international business strategies. According to the 
discussed literature review, business and international business strategy have been adequately investigated in previous 
studies. However, prioritization of these strategies is less examined in conjunction with MCDM approaches. 
Furthermore, the problem was not adequately examined in developing countries. Finally, recent MCDM models such 
as BWM are more appropriate tools in comparison with older approaches such as AHP as they need less judgments. 
In this regard, two linked phases were applied to address the objectives of research. The initial phase of this research 
examined numerous business strategies of previous studies. To do so, a literature review was completed to investigate 
business strategies of previous literature. Next, the second phase applied a BWM to investigate and prioritize these 
strategies. According to the obtained results, international business strategy, multi-country business strategy, 
transnational business strategy and global business strategy are the most important international business strategies, 
respectively. As a direction for future research, the developed methodology of this study can be repeated in similar 
strategy related research such as Lean Manufacturing (LM), Agile Manufacturing (AM) and sustainability.

Abstract 
Adi Sumarmo International Airport, abbreviated as BIAS, played a central role in the multimodal transportation 
system in Central Java Province, Indonesia. On this basis, this study investigated the service quality of multimodal 
transportation in BIAS using the importance-performance analysis (IPA). This study measured 13 variables of 
multimodal services based on the level of performance and importance. The results revealed that currently, there has 
been an effective multimodal transportation services in supporting passenger mobility in BIAS, with an average score 
of 3.43. Meanwhile, respondents' assessment on the level of importance of all variables showed an average score of 
4.36. From 13 variables of multimodal transportation services, the following three variables need to be prioritized to 
support efforts to increase service effectiveness: travel time, variety of transportation modes for other trips, and shelter 
facilities. This paper emphasizes the need to improve the existing multimodal transportation services in BIAS to meet 
user expectations.

1. Introduction
Airports are one of the transportation nodes connected with the air transportation service network, road and rail as 
integrated transportation systems. Accordingly, airports perform a vital service as part of the transportation system, as 
long as they provide excellent (Prentice and Kadan 2019; Bellizzi et al. 2020; Hong et al. 2020; Pamucar et al. 2021) 
To deliver service excellence, airports need some support from a multimodal transportation system that is safe, highly 
accessible, highly certain, and environmentally friendly. Multimodal transportation aims to produce one-stop service 
and seamless services (Hsu 2012; Raghunathan et al. 2018; Babić et al. 2022). The implementation of a multimodal 
transportation system in airports is indicated by integrating various modes of transportation and infrastructure 
networks (Guo et al. 2021; Teodorović and Janić, 2022). From an operational aspect, multimodal transportation offers 
real-time information on departure and arrival schedules and an integrated payment system (Ma and Chen 2019; 
Paulsen et al. 2021). Thus, the keywords of the multimodal system are integrated services of various transportation 
modes that are interconnected and seamless.

Abstract 
Knowledge is a very valuable asset for the company. The more knowledge the stakeholders of a company have, the 
more advanced the company will be. However, companies that have a lot of quality knowledge are not necessarily 
able to produce goods or services of the same quality. The difference in output will be influenced by several factors, 
one of which is the performance of the employees of the company. To realize employee performance in accordance 
with company expectations, it is necessary to have a culture that can facilitate knowledge sharing activities in the 
company. This research was conducted to determine the effect of knowledge sharing on employee performance 
through organizational culture as an intervening variable at the Center for Job Training Development (BBPLK) 
Bandung. To get the data, this research used probability sampling with simple random method with 142 employees as 
respondents. The data analysis technique used descriptive and causal analysis. To test the hypotheses, this study uses 
PLS-SEM statistical analysis using the SmartPLS 3.9.9 analysis tool. From the results of the analysis, researchers 
found that organizational culture as an intervening variable can positively assist knowledge sharing in influencing 
employee performance.

1. Introduction
Along with the increasingly complex needs of the company, it also has difficulty facing various problems that are 
difficult to predict. According to Nathania in Rabbani (2018) highly employee performance can be used as quality 
human resources for the company. In other words, high performance of human resources can provide satisfactory 
feedback for the company. In addition, knowledge is an asset that is no less valuable for the life of the company. The 
more knowledge that stakeholders and all environmental components of a company have, the more advanced the 
company will be.  
According to Andra and Syafitri (2018), the implementation of Knowledge Sharing in the corporate environment can 
be one of the causes of increasing employee performance. Knowledge sharing can be regarded as a mechanism where 
knowledge is transmitted from one party to another within a company or between companies. There are many benefits 
obtained by a company if knowledge sharing is properly implemented, including producing employees who have 
superior knowledge. So, they will be able to produce products and technologies that are not easily imitated, unique 
and have competitive advantages among other companies. 
To implement knowledge sharing to achieve employee performance that is in line with expectations, it is necessary to 
have a culture that serves as a bridge to facilitate knowledge sharing in a company. According to Rivai and Mulyadi 
(2012), organizational culture is a framework that guides daily behavior and makes decisions for employees and directs 
their actions to achieve organizational goals. The implementation of a good organizational culture will make the 
sharing of knowledge and experience between employees in a company run in an orderly manner in accordance with 
the directions and references owned by the company.

6. Conclusion
In conclusion, it was found that organizational culture as an intervention variable has an important role between 
knowledge sharing and employee performance for employees of the Bandung Work Training Development Center 
(BBPPLK). Sharing Knowledge at the Center for the Development of Job Training (BBPLK) Bandung has been 
considered very good, but the company can increase knowledge sharing activities in the company environment to 
maintain the company's intellectual assets in the future to achieve company goals. It is hoped that the results of this 
study can improve and maintain the values that have been researched in terms of knowledge sharing, employee 
performance and excellent organizational culture, creating healthy competition so that the Bandung Work Training 
Development Center (BBPLK) can continue to grow and excel in the future. 
Further research is recommended to find a scope with a different and wider population and more samples for more 
accurate research results. In addition, it is also expected that theories from different experts use the latest methods as 
well as research methods and different objects to see the differences and similarities between the research carried out 
so that they can see the treasures of science.

Abstract 
This paper aims to conceptually contribute to ideas about implementing Lean Supply Chain (LSC) approach in halal 
education industry as continuous improvement key for quality excellence to achieve sustainable competitive 
advantage. The method used for this conceptual paper is based from literature reviews from reputable journal articles. 
Halal education is literally a new concept in halal industry which defined as Islamic Education Service Provider (IESP) 
where in its supply chain consists of integrated business activities that giving services to the input (students) in order 
to have deliverable output (outcome, impact and benefits). Halal education takes Islamic value as the supreme and 
guiding tools in education processes. LSC operational model applied base on five lean principles in the supply chain: 
specifying value, identifying value stream, redesigning the process to eliminate waste, implementing and evaluating 
the updated processes and manage toward perfection. It was discovered that through the five principles of lean in 
supply chain, waste occurred in operational activities of IESP supply chain could be defined and eliminated. 7Ps 
chainpreneur, a new approach, consist of people, policy, performance, product, path, process and philosophy are linked 
and used as key quality excellence in halal education.  LSC operational model could be applied to IESP industry which 
willing to improve the service quality and sustain in the industry by strengthening its brand with halal or Islamic value.

1. Introduction
Halal industry is interpreted as activities of processing product (good and service) using facilities and equipment by 
Islamic sharia (Bank Indonesia, 2020). Following that definition, Islamic education as a service provider is included 
in the area of Islamic or halal service industry where in its supply chain consists of integrated halal or Islamic activities 
or business processes that giving services to the input (students) to generate  deliverable (output, outcome, benefits 
and impact) graduate students.. This opinion also supported by (Randeree, 2020), who stated that today, in stark 
contrast to these earlier practices, the Islamic economy and halal industry comprises a broadening range of identifiable 
sectors. According to him, Islamic economic sectors are Islamic finance; halal food; halal travel and tourism; halal 
pharmaceuticals; halal cosmetics (halal beauty); Islamic (or modest) fashion; Islamic media and recreation; health 
care; and education, with developing areas in the Islamic digital economy; sport; philanthropy and charity; and Islamic 
culture, arts, architecture and heritage 
As an industry, Islamic Education Service Provider (IESP) has a unique added value that differs from conventional 
education service provider. Most of the researchers in the area of brand management, agree that the brand is designed

Abstract 
This study discusses the violation of the code of work ethics by Foxconn against the rights of its workers under the 
protection of the Fair Labour Association (FLA) policy. This study aims to find out Foxconn supply companies in 
increasing Apple production through forced labour carried out by workers who work at Foxconn without any guarantee 
of welfare and health and safety empowerment for their workers as well as guarantees of survival and a decent basic 
salary. This problem has become a form of human rights violations and inequality in the welfare of workers at the 
Foxconn company which has led to demonstrations and protests for Foxconn workers to obtain human rights for 
workers. Although Foxconn's role as Apple's main supplier has helped Apple in achieving its strategy in today's digital 
era. But not for the welfare of Foxconn workers. This case study is strengthened by using the Global Production 
Network (GPN) theory, which relates to production networks across economic boundaries to the actors involved. 
Meanwhile, the role of the workforce is also involved in the GPN because as a supplier of labour it is not only involved 
in the interests of the company but is also involved in the state structure and global capital structure. There is also an 
approach used by researchers using a qualitative research approach. The data used by the researcher is secondary data 
obtained from journals, official websites, report data, and several articles that have been validated. The implication of 
this research is to improve workers' rights in a company under the protection of the Fair Labour Association. 
Companies are required to apply a Code of Work Ethics to their workers to improve the welfare of workers and build 
a better corporate image.

1. Introduction
Apple is the largest electronics company in the world with its collaboration with Foxconn as a Taiwan-owned 
electronics manufacturing service provider. Foxconn is the largest electronics company whose goal is to design and 
assemble multinational brand electronics globally. The continuous increase in production requires Apple to find and 
expand its supply chain in producing Apple products. Apple started partnering with Foxconn after ensuring that its 
contractual relationship with the Foxconn manufacturing company could run well without violating their intellectual 
property rights and made Foxconn the supply chain in the main assembly of Apple products (Nakamura, 2015). 
Apple's attachment to Foxconn assembly services originating from Taiwan, which is located in China, is able to 
increase Apple's competitiveness in the global market. By expanding its market, Foxconn can increase its investment 
in the China region through the opportunities provided by Foxconn.  
Apple began its alliance with Foxconn in the manufacture of its first production, namely the iPod product, which was 
made in 2006. Apple's collaboration with Foxconn became a great opportunity for Foxconn to increase enormous 
profits for Apple through the Foxconn design. But behind Apple's progress, the emergence of problems felt by workers 
who work at Foxconn against heavy manual labour productivity pressures without creating a guarantee of the 
feasibility of labour rights at Foxconn. This is a severe concern for China and Taiwan regarding the intellectual 
standardization of work for workers in these countries. There are many cases of suicide, which threaten the safety and 
security of workers in obtaining rights and welfare guarantees for employees who work hard every day. This is a big 
enough concern for Apple to see the case.

the problem, even though this case is a serious responsibility for Foxconn in improving working conditions (Lin, 
2021). 
6. Conclusion
As a company that acquires electronic products that continue to grow every day, Apple needs its supply chain to 
optimize the margins that Apple earns through its production. For this reason, Apple needs major suppliers to increase 
its production and meet customer demands continuously. To increase its competitiveness, Apple and Foxconn became 
the main suppliers of its production, which made Foxconn its main producer. Apple in meeting Foxconn's customer 
demands on its assembly production, so Foxconn has expanded branches in several regions in China located in three 
regions consisting of Guanlan, Longhua, and Chengdu. Foxconn is rapidly providing opportunities for the workforce 
as a working class in the digital age. However, behind the productivity of its workers lies inequality in poor working 
conditions. This is a severe concern for the FLA organization because it contributes to creating welfare for workers 
around the world through the principle of the ""Code of Work Ethics"" which aims to protect the rights of workers at 
Foxconn. In addition, the role of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) point 8 needs to be implemented into 
Foxconn's company policies by providing equal pay, providing health insurance, eradicating forced labour and 
continuous overtime work. Therefore, Foxconn is under heavy pressure from the Apple company through the FLA 
organization to protect workers' rights at Foxconn. Currently, Foxconn has followed the principles of the code of work 
ethics on basic labour rights ranging from working hours, equal pay, health & safety protection, obtaining 
compensation and social security insurance, as well as building industrial relations and worker integration.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to describe a comprehensive evaluation experiment of semi-immersive virtual reality 
(VR) applications from the heuristic side of application interface design to cognitive enhancement abilities, and 
increasing learning motivation when the application is used as a learning process. This study employs a descriptive 
qualitative method to comprehend the phenomena encountered by the research subjects, such as behavior, perception, 
motivation, and actions. Based on data analysis, the study's findings revealed that the use of Virtual Reality at the 
Museum was quite effective and efficient in the post-COVID19 pandemic for students. This study also discovered 
that virtual reality was able to increase the number of visits as well as increase interest in learning and understanding 
the Al-Quran Mushaf better. The conclusion is that, following the COVID-19 Pandemic, VR has become one of the 
educational media that is effective in helping students, so that they can present simulations like in the real world, 
where they can see the Istiqlal Mushaf comprehensively. The conclusion of this study was to compare knowledge 
retention after immersive and non-immersive skill training methods. Site visits and virtual visits can also be 
quantitatively and qualitatively compared to increase student engagement, motivate students, and provide interactive 
feedback to encourage learning.

1. Introduction
Dr. H. Tarmizi Taher was the originator of the initial idea of establishing Bayt Al-Qur'an in 1994 when he served as 
Minister of Religion of the Republic of Indonesia while accompanying President H.M. Suharto to receive a large 
Qur'an gift from the Al-Asy'ariyah Islamic Boarding School, Kalibeber, Wonosobo, Central Java. President Soeharto 
inaugurated the Istiqlal Mushaf, which had been under construction since 1991, on the 50th anniversary of Indonesia's 
independence in 1995. The Istiqlal Mushaf is a large manuscript written in beautiful khat and embellished with 
ornaments and decorative illuminations from all of Indonesia's provinces. At the time, the idea of establishing the Bayt 
Al-Qur'an, or ""House of the Qur'an,"" as a museum to collect, store, maintain, and exhibit Qur'anic manuscripts of 
various shapes and types which are scattered throughout the world. The Bayt Al-Qur'an and the Istiqlal Museum are 
intended to be two institutions with one unified whole, with their respective roles, throughout the archipelago. Both 
works together to increase love, understanding, and practice of the Qur'an, and they also serve as a forum for the study 
and development of knowledge about the Qur'an and Islamic culture. 
Students' knowledge of Quranic manuscripts is becoming less and less desirable nowadays. This is due to a lack of 
easily accessible socialization for the younger generation, as well as a less appealing method of socialization to learn 
more about the manuscript. Because technological development is so rapid, many museums, particularly in Indonesia, 
are keeping up by incorporating technological elements into their exhibits to increase their attractiveness. The Istiqlal 
Mushaf museum, which is located at TMII Jakarta, is one of them. 
Many innovations have resulted from technological advancements, such as Virtual Tour technology, which can place 
the user in the image and allows the user to increase situational awareness and significantly increase visibility, capture, 
and analysis power through virtual data. Most of us adapted to new habits regarding the learning system during the

According to the results of the review in the Table 1 and Table 2, the majority of students or children, both men and 
women, have never directly visited the Bayt Al-Quran Museum and the Istiqlal Museum. The purpose of visiting 
museums, particularly religious museums, is to gain insight into information. They stated that visiting the Museum 
was their choice with the teacher's recommendation as a school task, and that activities during the visit were expected 
to be comfortable and allow them to socialize with other people. The majority of students are aware of VR technology 
and have used it and its features during virtual visits. However, most people still use VR for entertainment and games, 
and students use it very little in school. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Based on the findings of research and data analysis in general, it is possible to conclude that the use of Education-
based Virtual Reality media can address these challenges by demonstrating virtually and completely how students can 
interact without physically being present at the location. Students and visitors can create a simulation sensation with

the Virtual Reality Tour media to add insight and understanding of the Al-Quran Mushaf in a new way. As a result of 
the COVID-19 Pandemic, VR has become one of the educational media, which is very helpful for students in 
particular, so that they can present simulations like in the real world, where they can see the Istiqlal Mushaf 
comprehensively through VR media, not only being able to provide a sensational experience and unique through the 
screen, but can also 'dive' and interact in three dimensions, simulating many senses, sight, hearing, and touch. 
Furthermore, the virtual experience can be widely shared via social media accounts. 
Further research can be based on learning media via Virtual Tours, in addition to museums, on other tourist objects in 
Indonesia. Using the AR-Augmented Reality platform, the content of objects can be in 3D. Can be done virtually 
online. VR Tour can help spread the word about the role of virtual reality in education in general in Indonesia, from 
elementary to upper secondary levels. While many aspects of its application and use are explored in the current 
literature, some important aspects, such as the impact of VR on its social experience, remain to be researched and 
studied. (Parker 2020) 
Moreover, because the museum in TMII has very special material as well as a wide variety of insights about Indonesia, 
this research can be developed and applied to other museums in TMII. Other than museums, it is possible that this VR 
technology will be adopted by places related to tourism and education.

1. Introduction
The difficulty of accessing capital financing through formal institutions such as banks is certainly caused by the 
processes and requirements as well as guarantees which are considered quite burdensome for MSME actors because 
they are considered quite complicated and difficult to fulfill. Most of the MSME actors also object to the existence of 
guarantees or collateral provided by formal financial institutions to MSME actors to make loans. They prefer to make 
loans to informal sources such as loan sharks where the terms and procedures are very easy, but the interest paid is 
very high. At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 virus began to emerge and disrupt human life until in March 2020, this 
virus began to enter Indonesia and changed aspects of people's lives and activities. The COVID-19 pandemic has 
caused changes in the actions, behavior, and attitudes of the Indonesian people. The Indonesian economy, which was 
reported to have declined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, also affected MSMEs in Jambi City. 
However, despite the impact of the pandemic, Jambi City has proven to have achieved consistent and proud 
achievements, namely for the third time since 2018 it has been awarded the 2020 Natamukti Award by the Central 
Government through the Indonesian Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, together with ICSB (International Council 
for Small Business). In 2020, namely, the City of Jambi successfully bought 3 categories at once at the ""Indonesia 
Tourism, Trade, Investment and Industry Awards 2020 Virtual"". Jambi City won the Silver Winner of Indonesia 
Tourism Award 2020, Silver Winner of Indonesia Trade Award, and Silver Winner of Indonesia Industry Award 
which were conducted virtually (online). At the event, Jambi City was the only region in Jambi Province that had won 
a national level award. Despite winning these various awards, MSMEs in Jambi City certainly face serious problems 
during the pandemic and are expected to be able to survive and survive by innovating and getting out of all the 
problems that are currently happening. Therefore, the existence of Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) is very beneficial

company so that with high employee participation, there will be a sense of responsibility towards the company and 
can have an impact on improving the company's financial performance even better. However, the control-oriented 
culture has no effect on financial performance because the control-oriented culture is a traditional culture that has been 
applied by the company for a long time and is not included in a rare culture so that this culture does not affect financial 
performance. ICT has no significant effect on return on assets at Rural Banks in Jambi City. These results provide 
strong evidence that the costs of adopting an application obtained from the Rural Bank in Jambi City outweigh the 
benefits. It appears that banks are investing heavily in new technologies to take advantage of new IT and digital 
solutions to make their operations more efficient, complying with regulators while at the same time enhancing 
interactions with customers to maintain competitiveness regardless of their financial performance. Therefore, banks 
are advised not to overestimate their investment in ICT. This means that an increase in total assets at Rural Banks in 
Jambi City during the Covid-19 pandemic can be positively and significantly influenced by EO and CC, but not by 
EV and ICT. 
6.1. Contributions 
Based on the results of research and literature review, there are several contributions in this study, including the 
contribution of concepts and context. The contributions in this research are: 
1.
This study describes a new concept of a model for strengthening the EO of financial performance at rural
banks where previously most studies in other countries on EO focused on micro, small and medium
enterprises only.
2.
This research complements the literature review, especially for rural banks.
3.
This study also examines the relationship between the variable value of entrepreneurship on financial
performance shown to leaders from middle managers, directors and commisioners of Rural Banks.
4.
This study also uses different variables from previous studies such as CC and ICT on financial performance.
6.2. Future Research 
1.
To collect data not only through questionnaires but also through interviews or group discussion forums to
obtain more in-depth information.
2.
The model in this study can be modified to use multidimensional EO instead of unidimensional EO.
3.
The model in this study can be extended to large public companies or look for data on Rural Banks throughout 
Indonesia.
4.
The model can be modified to include other variables such as corporate entrepreneurship, government rule
and others.

Abstract 
Songket is part of the intangible cultural heritage of Indonesia. Songket is one of the wastra of Indonesia. Wastra is 
derived from a Sanskrit word and means ‘fabric with cultural content’. The objective of the paper is to analyse songket 
Indonesia’s virtual exhibition as a form of digital cultural method to preserve the intangible culture of Indonesia. 
Digital culture is a popular topic in the world of cultural heritage preservation. The National Museum of Indonesia 
and the Ministry of Education and Culture held a virtual exhibition of Songket Indonesia on December 13, 2021, 
called ‘Songket Indonesia Connected the Universe’. The event launched the website of the Songket Indonesia 
museum. Indonesia has more than 1582 items of intangible cultural heritage. This exhibition featured forty songket 
wastra from all over Indonesia including Aceh, Padang, Palembang, and Bali. This paper takes the form and method 
of a case study. The analysis through in-depth historical reviews and analysis of variables, measures, relationships, 
and patterns that emerged throughout the study on fashion marketing mix theory, and the promotion mix methods by 
the fashion marketing digital funnel. The successes and failures of digital heritage campaigns in the form of a virtual 
songket exhibition were identified in the review of literature, and were analysed, adapted, and enumerated according 
to findings from the case study. The results are limited to the study of one virtual exhibition of songket Indonesia. The 
research was identified as digital heritage that could be used to study other virtual exhibitions and digital events for 
cultural preservation.

1. Introduction
‘Connecting the Universe’ was the tagline of an Indonesian songket virtual exhibition held by the Ministry of 
Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. The tagline represented the centuries of history of the culture heritage 
of wastra Indonesia. The past ‘universe’ came from the late Dong Son culture from 8 – 2 BC, in Vietnam where they 
made backstrap loom and warp-ikat (TFR/Thefineryreport.com, 2019). Dong Son culture arrived and influenced 
Indonesia. Because of the location of Indonesia as an archipelago located between two continents, Australia and Asia, 
Indonesia became the strategic place to have trade relations. India, Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries in 
Indochina traded relations and disseminated their religious beliefs. The trade relations with India since 2 AD meant 
Indonesian wastra was influenced by Indian traders.  
The traditional wastra of Indonesia appeared more than 1,300 years from the Sriwijaya kingdom to the Palembang 
sultanate (1821). Songket in Palembang, thought to be the Sriwijaya kingdom capital city, was influenced by India, 
China and Saudia Arabia. The golden thread made in China and Siam inspired the royalty of Sriwijaya kingdom to 
make wastra for themselves. With golden, shimmering fabrics they believed the king and the royal family would be

3. Methods  
This paper used a qualitative research method, with a case study of a virtual museum, and a content analysis of digital 
culture-related papers. The virtual exhibition was analyzed as the object of research. While the object was studied, the 
study literature study of seven papers about digital culture and digital fashion was conducted. The papers were studied 
and contributed knowledge and experience.  
 
This literature study was the first stage of the research. The second stage was the study using the fashion marketing 
digital funnel method (Digital Fashion Academy, 2022). The analysis of the virtual museum was connected with 
marketing mix, in the promotion phase. The virtual exhibition was part of promotion in the marketing activities. The 
method of fashion marketing digital funnel consists of segments, goals, strategy, and tools. The funnel was divided 
into three levels (lower, middle, and upper). The third stage was the conclusion of the analysis that led to the results 
and discussion.  
 
4. Results and Discussion  
The result of the research stated that: 1. The awareness for the media was quite good. However, the right target market, 
especially for the young generations (for example Generation Z) is low. 2. The content of the virtual museum needs 
to be improved to attract young visitors to come. 3. The virtual museum activity was well accepted to maintain the 
knowledge about traditional fabrics or wastra songket Indonesia. The more knowledge gained by visitors, both young 
and old, the more likely it is to preserve Indonesian culture.  
 
The Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology must take his next actions seriously to encourage 
participation in culture preservation. If possible, the ministry should ask the next generation’s key opinion leaders to 
participate in the evaluation process. Generation Z needs to participate in heritage preservation, since they are the ones 
who will be leaders in the future.  
 
The songket wastra although the original one contents of golden thread, has limitation. Someday the fabrics would be 
broken. Digital technology documentation could be one strategy to keep this heritage alive for the future generation. 
As the participants in the future, generation Z who familiar with digital technology should be learnt and developed the 
strategy in digital cultural preservation.  
 
4.1. Limitations of the study 
The findings of this study have to be seen in the light of some limitations. The primary limitation was the 
generalizability of these results was the depth of analysis on digital cultural preservation methods. Secondly would be 
the focus of the research itself; it is better to focus on which elements of this virtual exhibition would be central to the 
research, and thirdly would be time constraints.  
 
4.2 Opportunities for future research  
With the findings of the study mentioned above, this study has opportunities for future research. Future research could 
be about the methods to study digital culture preservation. One element could be chosen from this research. For 
example, a study about traditional fabrics such as wastra songket could be related to Generation Z interest and could 
be focused on one particular discipline such as fashion marketing communication as part of promoting wastra songket 
in Indonesia.  
 
5. Conclusion  
The Indonesian songket virtual exhibition as a form of digital culture to preserve the heritage of traditional wastra was 
a positive gesture from the government of Indonesia as an answer to challenging pandemic conditions. The method of 
the virtual exhibition was well accepted. The virtual exhibition needed to be evaluated to achieve the goals as cultural 
preservation and the heritage of songket wastra Indonesia.

been granted the powers of providing legal solutions at an early stage of the legal process. The Dutch Parliament 
introduced the Law on Prejudicial Questions whereas the Indonesian Supreme Court reinstated the chamber 
system.  Each year, pressing legal issues are discussed by the Supreme Court judges in the chambers and the legal 
solutions published in a circular (Surat Edaran Mahkamah Agung, SEMA) as guidelines to be followed by lower 
courts. In this paper we compare both ‘legal shortcuts’ and argue that, while the goal of legal unity is an urgent 
issue in Indonesia, to be able to properly function as legal guidelines for judges and lawyers SEMA require a more 
detailed description of the legal issue and legal reasoning behind the offered legal solutions.

1. Introduction
The digital age has brought significant changes to how people live, make contracts, conduct their business, buy 
their groceries, and work. Law and lawyers have the obligation to adapt to such new social and technological 
realities that have blurred the previously clear boundaries of legal concepts and legal categories (Brownsword 
2022). A judge cannot refuse a case when it concerns an issue that is new for the legal system and is not yet clearly 
regulated. Therefore, the judge will make a legal construction and pass a judgment based on his own interpretation 
of how the law should be applied to the facts of the case. In a situation of disruption caused by new technologies, 
combined with the absence of clear legal sources, it is well possible that different judges interpret the same issue 
differently (Walker-Munro 2020). In such a situation of novel legal development, legal unity (rechtseenheid, 
kesatuan hukum) is at risk. This inconsistency in judgments affects the principles legal certainty, equality before 
the law and ultimately the Rule of Law (rechtsstaat, negara hukum). 
In the new millennium, both in the Netherlands and in Indonesia the idea gained ground that the traditional law-
making mechanism of case law (Nl: Jurisprudentie, IND: yurisprudensi) by the Supreme Court sometimes 
develops too slow to provide lower courts guidance on how best to interpret novel pressing legal issues. It can 
take years before a problematic case at the first-instance level reaches the Supreme Court (Bakels 2015, Franx 
1994). Some cases do not reach the Supreme Court at all, as many litigants do not appeal a case they lost 
(Simanjuntak 2019). The court process can be a long and costly process, making litigants reluctant to appeal a 
case – especially when in the absence of clear regulations and in a situation of inconsistent judgments, there is no 
indication of the chances of success.  
At the same time digitalization of society has made it easier for litigants to look up cases on the internet or to 
interact with persons who experience similar grievances. When in similar cases different verdicts are passed by 
judges the sense of injustice will spread through these online communities and eventually reach the press. The 
inconsistency of judgments is exposed and will harm the trust of citizens in the legal system (Haltom and McCann 
2009).  
In the year 2012 the Dutch Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) and in 2011 the Indonesian Supreme Court (Mahkamah 
Agung) acquired the competence to provide legal guidance to lower courts at an earlier stage of a novel legal 
development. In the Netherlands this was done through introduction of the Law on Prejudical Questions, by 
granting the Supreme Court the competence to answer questions of law by lower courts that are handling a novel 
legal issue (prejudiciële vraag), on an issue that potentially has a large impact on future legal practice. In Indonesia 
the Supreme Court issued an internal regulation (Peraturan Mahkamah Agung), assigning the chambers of the

The similarities between the mechanisms of judicial questions and SEMA are in the objectives of creating 
consistency for pressing legal issues and the need for what we have called “a legal shortcut”.  It is a shortcut 
compared to the traditional law-making taking place at the Supreme Court level – through case law. The first main 
difference concerns the legal foundations of judicial questions and SEMA. Judicial questions are introduced by 
statute adopted by the Dutch Parliament, whereas SEMA are introduced through a Supreme Court Regulation. 
The latter is a continuation of the tendency observed by Sebastiaan Pompe (2005) of the Supreme Court to rely 
on its supervisory rather than judiciary powers. It also means that Parliament was not involved in this substantial 
reform, which can be interpreted as undemocratic. 
The second and third differences concern the selection of legal issues and the origins of these issues. In the 
Netherlands prejudicial questions are posed by first-instance or appellate courts that are adjudicating a complex 
case that involves a pressing legal issue. The SEMA are the result of a plenary chamber meeting of Supreme Court 
judges where pressing legal issues are discussed. The judicial question mechanism is bottom-up whereas the 
SEMA is top-down. As mentioned by Sebastiaan Pompe (2005) the Indonesian Supreme Court increasingly relies 
on its supervisory powers as Supreme Court judgments are not automatically considered case law by lower courts. 
The top-down approach is considered a more reliable option in view of the more limited role that case law plays 
in Indonesia’s legal system. 
Fourth, with regard to the format in which the legal solutions are published, the Dutch Supreme Court 
subsequently treats a prejudicial question as a normal case, describing the context of the legal issue, the legal 
question that needs to be answered, and subsequently providing a complete legal justification for the legal solution. 
In contrast, the SEMA only publishes the new legal norm. The legal question and its context and the legal 
reasoning of the Supreme Court judges are not included in the standard format. This means that judges and lawyers 
will not have much clarity on how to apply the legal solution to concrete cases. 
The fifth difference concerns the end product of the legal shortcut. In the Netherlands it has the status of a Supreme 
Court judgment, which means that it can be considered a new form of jurisprudentie. As mentioned, the end-
product of the legal shortcut in Indonesia is a SEMA – as there is scepticism within the Supreme Court itself that 
yurisprudensi can attain the role and status of case law in other countries. 
4. Conclusion
The comparison between the prejudicial questions in the Netherlands and the SEMA in Indonesia has made clear 
two similarities: (1) their objectives of creating legal consistency pertaining to pressing legal issues; and (2) the 
way this is done, namely by creating a shortcut for the Supreme Court to provide legal solutions at an early stage 
of the legal process. However, we have also found several significant differences between prejudicial questions 
and SEMA with regard to the legal foundations, selection procedure, origins, formats, legal status. The main 
problem we found regarding the legal solutions adopted in SEMA is that the published SEMA does not contain a 
legal background, a concrete legal question, or a legal reasoning behind the new legal norm. This makes the legal 
solutions offered vague and therefore subject to interpretations by lower courts – which may lead to inconsistency 
in judgments. I therefore would recommend that in the future a more detailed description of the legal problem and 
the legal reasoning behind this solution will be provided. In this age of rapid changes and digital disruption, judges 
and lawyers are looking for guidance – in the form of detailed legal solutions.

Abstract 
Sustainability and environmental issues are crucial to address because the present and future generations are dealing 
with long-term consequences. Thus, educational institutions need to reinforce environmental awareness and a 
sustainable mindset in young generations. The researchers applied green education in English for Business 
Presentations (EBP) classes in this study; students were entailed to think critically about specific issues in the 
environment and sustainability. The objective of this study was to instill and sustain students' sustainable mindset in 
Business English through environmental awareness. To answer the research question of whether green education 
successfully influences students' mindset and behavior toward environmental and sustainability awareness, the 
researchers employed a qualitative method to investigate students' perspectives on environmental awareness and 
sustainability before and after receiving green education. Three hundred undergraduate students participated in this 
study at BINUS University in Indonesia. The EBP instructors designed a lesson in which the goal was to present green 
business ideas. The class activities required the students to analyze challenges and yield innovative solutions for their 
environment. The findings indicate that green education influenced students’ sustainability mindset. This study 
revealed that green education in business English classes integrated ethics, entrepreneurship, environmental studies, 
systems thinking, self-awareness, and the dimensional contexts of critical thinking as knowledge, values, and 
competency. In conclusion, all students obtained exposure to environmental issues by instilling green education in 
business English classes; they are also expected to establish green and sustainable businesses.

1. Introduction
Sustainability has become one of the most discussed topics in various events. The UCLA Sustainability Committee 
(2022) defined the term as “the integration of environmental health, social equity and economic vitality in order to 
create thriving, healthy, diverse and resilient communities for this generation and generations to come. The practice 
of sustainability recognizes how these issues are interconnected and requires a systems approach as well as an

The last question was about students' efforts to persuade other people to practice environmentally friendly behavior. 
Students who responded that they had persuaded others were talking about their family or close friends; two said that 
they joined an organization campaigning green lifestyle when they were in high school (but they are no longer 
members after graduating). Most of the answers indicate that they still lack knowledge and feel 'unbefitting' to do the 
campaign on a larger scale through their social media; they think they have not been highly committed to the green 
lifestyle. Despite showing that this research has successfully improved students' knowledge and awareness of green 
concepts and sustainability, the last result has shown that teachers need to find creative ways to teach or instill the 
‘absolute’ green mindset to students. The expected result would be: after students are aware of the environment, they 
show daily green practices, and finally, they make efforts to persuade other people to do the same.  
6. Conclusion
This research aims at instilling environmental awareness and a sustainable mindset in Business English classes through 
green education and business presentation projects. The activities have encouraged students to analyze the challenges 
and generate innovative solutions for the environment. This study revealed that green education integrated ethics, 
entrepreneurship, environmental studies, systems thinking, self-awareness, and the dimensional contexts of critical 
thinking as knowledge, values, and competency. Moreover, all students responded to the latest environmental issues. 
The project focused on integrating environmental awareness (green business ideas) and educational technology. In the 
project, lecturers could direct students to establish green and sustainable businesses in the future.  
The limitation of this research is the lack of previously published studies in the same field, which is the impact of 
green education in business English class. It was quite a challenging process to lay a foundation to determine the scope 
of the research based on very limited existing studies. Due to the condition, the researchers encourage other interested 
parties to conduct research on the same topic to enrich the scopes of works in different universities and student 
demographics. Also, this study only examined the sustainable mindset in Business English Class through green 
education, while other aspects of learning outcomes such as future implementation and other achievements could be 
further studied. 
This research contributes to best practices and studies in developing green education and SDG (Sustainable 
Development Goals) in universities; the result of this study shows that even a language class can include green 
education in its practice, not only subjects/majors directly related to science or environmental studies. Moreover, the 
results provide both practical and theoretical implications: (1) the researchers affirmed that the project has successfully 
influenced students regarding environmental awareness and sustainable mindsets; thus, integrating green education in 
an English business class is highly applicable (2) the survey and interview results showed that educators and authorities 
need to do more efforts to promote green mindset to the future generations; the present practices can bring long 
consequences in the future, (3) the technology used as learning tool is formatted particularly for supporting material, 
(4) the university students involved in this research showed low motivation in efforts to persuade other people to live
a green life style; this result provides an opportunity to design and develop lesson that can boost students’ motivation,
(5) and lastly, for further research, other challenges in sustainable mindset through green education can be studied in
other educational contexts and settings.

Abstract 
The imposition and establishment of a new policy for new energy and renewable energy in Indonesia has become 
decisive. Indonesia has signed the Paris agreement and has ratified it into national law. Indonesia also has a 
commitment to fulfill the target of sustainable development goals 7. However, in its implementation there are still 
challenges and obstacles to increase new and renewable energy in the national energy mix. The research method 
used is normative juridical with literature study. The objective of this paper is that Indonesia has a new renewable 
energy policy to meet the achievement of SDGs and Paris Agreement. It will identify and collect laws and 
regulations related to new and renewable energy. Then map the problems and obstacles in the development of 
renewable energy in Indonesia. It is desirable for the existing problems and obstacles can be overcome by amending 
the energy law. Currently, the Indonesian government has outlined the arrangement of the draft of law convening 
new and renewable energy and is currently incorporated in the national legislative program 2022. Amendments to 
the new and renewable energy law are important instruments for policy changes to realize the SDGs that can provide 
legal certainty, strengthen institutions and governance for renewable energy development, create an investment 
climate and support funding. For this reason, the participation of all elements of the nation is to provide input on the 
draft law on renewable energy discussion in the House of Representative of Republic Indonesia.

1. Introduction
As the 4th largest population in the world, Indonesia is indivisible from the use of energy to meet its needs. The 
increase in energy use is in line with economic and population growth. Nonetheless, the use of fossil energy rises the 
fear of its extinction over time. In 2021, The Indonesia Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources stated that the 
deposit of petroleum will be available for the next 9.5 years, while Indonesia’s natural resources will remain for 19.9 
years. Such forecast relied upon the deposit data in 2020 and assumed none of new oil and gas reserves had been 
discovered. In 2018, the total primary energy production consisting of oil, gas, coal and renewable energy was 411.6 
Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (MTOE). Around 64% or 261.4 MTOE from the total production especially coal 
and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) was exported. Besides that, Indonesia also imported energy especially crude oil 
and petroleum products of 43.2 MTOE and small volume of high rank to meet industrial sector’s need (Suharyati et 
al. 2019). 
As the demand for fossil energy increases, the deposits of such are dwindling. Consequently, the transition from the 
use of fossil to new and renewable energy (Energi Baru dan Terbarukan/EBT) is necessary. EBT will spur the 
creation of long-term stable economic development and attain community welfare. New and renewable energy has 
become a world issue by implementing the Sustainable Development Agenda. In 2015, the UN General Assembly 
adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which 
include a dedicated and stand-alone goal on energy, SDG 7, calling to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, 
sustainable and modern energy for all”. Energy lies at the heart of both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and 
modern energy for all will open a new word of opportunities for billions of people through new economic 
opportunities and jobs, empowering women, children and youth, better education and health, more sustainable,

6. Conclusion 
New and Renewable energy is essential in sustaining energy preservation to support its growth. However, several 
problems with policy rules and regulations exist today that might affect the enhancement of renewable energy in 
Indonesia namely the barrier related to policy and regulations, disharmony regulation on energy, lack of funding, 
lack of government support in research and development, lack of consultation between decision maker in national 
and local government, the absence of comprehensive national law on energy. According to these legal problems, the 
House of Representative through Commission 7 (seven) has drafted a new law on new and renewable energy into 
the National Legislative Programs of 2021. This law is expected to answer problems and challenges in developing 
new and renewable energy in the future.  There is an urge to form this law to reduce emissions to zero. Throughout 
the issuance of the new draft of The Law, an assessment of the implementation of existing laws of new and 
renewable energy is required. Draft of New Law on EBT provides opportunities to accelerate the EBT potential in 
fulfilling national energy needs. Linkage or harmonization with other related laws. The House of Representative 
with the government shall have to administer a convalescent umbrella law to develop the new and renewable energy, 
and to provide the related derivative rules. The Government is obliged to sharpen its political commitment to surge 
the quality of rules, and assure the availability of investment and the funds to support the new and renewable energy 
development. The House of Reprsentative needs to provide the possible space to listen and get input from various 
stakeholders such as the public, academics, policymakers, entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations. It will 
make the draft Law of EBT meets expectations and can be implemented in the future.

Abstract 
As early as March 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic took over globally and soon the world as we used to know underwent 
abrupt changes, including education sector. The key motivation for this research is to understand how teaching and 
learning in the art and/or design discipline might be transformed in the long term, for both teachers and learners, as a 
reflection of teaching practices under the pandemic condition. Comparatively, this research aims to find out whether 
there is a shift in educators in art and/or design’s perception toward online class, by considering both technological 
and human aspects surrounding the subjects. This research uses mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. 
Quantitatively, this study analysed data from online questionnaires addressed to lecturers at Higher Education 
Institutions (HEI). To get a deeper understanding, this research also uses a qualitative approach, by investigating both 
lecturers and the students majoring in art and/or design. This research maintains that while the presence of technology 
and internet are vital in virtual class, but such classes can only be dubbed as successful providing there is an active 
role from both educators and students. Currently, the online classes that are taking place in a rather emergency manner 
are not yet running optimally, due to the lack of participation from the students. However, it is probable that in the 
future this situation may be changed, with the carefully planned curriculum, once our students are mentally prepared.

1. Introduction
Just like a science-fiction movie, the corona virus started spreading in 2019, and as early as 2020 the Covid-19 
pandemic took over globally. World Health Organization declared the infection as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, 
and soon the world as we used to know came to a standstill. The overall impact fuelled by this seismic event were 
simply phenomenal. It is safely to accept that many aspects of our lives inevitably will not return to its pre-pandemic 
original state – including education sector. On March 12, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – the 
United States’ federal agency dealing with public health, broadcasted revised regulation on handling Covid-19 for 
education institutions. Presently, the education system is a worldwide network, with the abrupt changes and the 
reactions upon it was a communal one. Many countries around the world have decided that the most effective and 
instant way to halt the spread of the virus to the students was to close the education establishments. Closing the 
school’s gate does not mean stopping the teaching and learning process. Regardless their own level of readiness, in a 
short period of time, educators were demanded to alter its teaching and learning activities, as well as experimenting 
and finding the right recipes to deliver the course modules remotely, in the form of online class. All of that is performed 
from the comfort of their homes – or lack thereof. Due to various limitations, compromises were made on how 
educators could carry on their duties smoothly. Two years passed, after more than 500 million confirmed cases (WHO 
2022) – and most importantly: three vaccinations later, we are well on our way back on track.  
The key motivation of this research is to understand how teaching and learning might be transformed in the long term, 
for both teachers and learners, as a reflection of teaching experiences under the pandemic condition. Time is a relative 
concept. Two years might actually be short in terms of time span; however, we have been through a lot during those 
seemingly fleeting moment. Even with the support of advance of technology, the first lockdown has made most of our 
world topsy-turvy. But as time passes, together with the second and third Covid waves, like it or not, we adapt to it. 
Humankind is once again proven to be species with determination. Educational institutions around the world have

to the lack of participation from their students. In a prolonged time, this lack of participation was feared to create a 
snowball effect – in which educators also became less enthusiastic in teaching since they did not receive expected 
feedback from their students. This situation creates tension, where both parties (educators and students) consider the 
experience in online classes to be less than satisfactory when compared to onsite classes.  
 
However, it is possible that in the future this situation may change, if our students are mentally prepared. Furthermore, 
it is vital to create a curriculum that is not materialized in the spirit of enforcement but is deliberately and consciously 
designed to be performed in this condition. This newly created curriculum must take into account students' grievances 
about their mental health during the application of ERT, so it is crucial to not only emphasize academic learning, but 
also knowledge that can nourish their soul, and nurture students to hone a better social skill set. This will be a whole 
different matter from the sudden and forced form of online classes that run suddenly and forcefully in an emergency 
situation like what has happening this past two years. We should not forget that no matter the form, online or face to 
face, a learning process should be fun and fulfilling.  
 
5.5 Validation 
After the elaboration of the research results in the previous section, in this section this research will highlight the 
importance of student engagement in virtual class. It is undeniable, the presence of technology and internet are vital 
currency in virtual class. However, online classes can only be dubbed as successful providing there is an active role 
from both educators and students. Lai (2002) infer what have been said by Krug, that the act of transforming a 
conventional class to a virtual one requires more than simply incorporating new technological tools. Lai’s own 
experience in online teaching taught her that it is vital for students to have a learning environment that enable open 
and genuine discussion without the distress of being judged in regard to physical façade and attributes. 
 
Nowadays, works in the art and/or design disciplines are not exclusive to fine art, but often have a measurable manner 
and rational goal in the form of applied art. However, in its creation process it is still rooted on one’s feelings, emotions 
and imbued with aesthetic elements that make it different from other disciplines such as science or mathematics. 
Succinctly, this sentiment is perhaps better explained by Phillips (2003), an art educator who affirmed that his success 
as an art educator should not be judged by how many artists his students remember, but by their growing appreciation 
of other human creations and the empathy of the care given into that oeuvres. That is exactly the reason why from the 
educators’ perspective, participation from the students is vital. Cooker et al. (2022) agreed that it would have been 
very challenging for educators to do a live broadcast without having audience feedback. Because even if they mentally 
convinced themselves that their students are there, in reality, the educators cannot feel the presence of their students 
without some concrete hints, no matter how small. Even if it's just a tiny box of video preview during the Zoom 
session, it can provide assurance that educators were not merely conducting monologues but having a live direct 
discussion with other human beings.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Logically, teaching at a Higher Education level supposedly demand less physical interaction than it does for younger 
apprentices. However, the act of ‘getting to know each other’ both from the perspective of educators and students are 
found to be indispensable. Physical presence gave an emotional yet human touch that will never been replaced by 
virtual experiences, no matter how superior the technology used – or at least as far as the advancement of technology 
that we have today. Even though it is not exclusive to the field of art & design, concrete dialogue between educators 
and students is a must in this field. Because at the end of the day, the expected output is somewhere between an 
artwork that can visually communicate to its audience and/or have the ability to connect one person to another; or vice 
versa, a study that can give meaning to an object, without which it would only be an inanimate entity. 
 
Of course, this research is not without limitations. First, albeit the educators’ responses were collected from 28 
different institutions in several different countries, it may not entirely represent all art and/or design institutions around 
the world. Secondly, the answers of this research’ questionnaires relied on participants' personal data and perspectives. 
Therefore, cautiousness is needed when deducing from these results. However, outcomes from this research are 
coherent with other scholarships alike. Thus, while some aspects might be differ depending on the place and 
conditions, we could assume that this result is still valid to some degrees. One thing that needs to be highlighted, the 
teaching and learning process is a two-way road. Both parties – the educators and the students are needs to be equally 
participate in the process, which is one of the best parts of learning experience.

Abstract 
This study examines how a financial education application can influence a person's decision to make a financial 
investment. This study also recommends that financial awareness education be implemented as soon as possible using 
financial education applications, formal education, or non-formal education, with full government support. The study 
goal is to give accurate information regarding how the existence of financial education applications affects investment 
decisions, as well as how financial knowledge can mediate the relationship between financial education applications 
and investment decisions. The data was acquired by making an online questionnaire and disseminating it to 152 
respondents who were willing to fill out the information and were qualified to do. It was concluded that financial 
education application was shown to have a significant positive relationship with financial investment decisions. 
Financial knowledge mediated the flow between financial education applications and financial investment decisions. 
Furthermore, it has shown that financial knowledge positively influences financial investing decisions. The 
implications of this study are to provide information about how financial applications can influence people's decisions 
to invest, to assist future developers in developing more well-rounded technology applications that can make the 
application more accessible and user friendly for all people, and to create more people who are aware of financial 
assets or investments.

1. Introduction
Today's technological advancements are accelerating. This is demonstrated by the availability of instructional 
technology that makes it easier for us as humans to learn knowledge, particularly around investment. According 
Nugraha and Rahadi (2021) Many Millennials and Generation Z have begun to learn about investing. However, the 
allocation of investment funds has been off-target, and there are several factors to consider before investing. 
Individuals today are more responsible than ever before for their finances. As life expectancy climbs, the pension and 
social security systems demand. In several countries, employer-sponsored defined benefit (DB) pension plans give 
way to private defined contribution (DC) plans, shifting responsibilities for pension saving and investing from 
employers to employees. Changes in labor markets have also had an impact on individuals. Skills are becoming 
increasingly valuable, resulting in wage inequalities between someone with a college education and higher and those 
with lower education (Lusardi 2019). 
Indonesia's financial literacy level remains at 29.7 percent, according to the SNLKI OJK (2016) publication. This 
indicates they have less understanding and confidence in financial institutions' services, financial products, or services, 
and they cannot use these financial products and services. According to empirical studies, financial literacy has a 
positive impact on an individual`s behavior and financial situation. Financial executives believed that while utilizing 
online technologies would be an informative future trend, face-to-face education would remain critical primarily for 
the millennial generation. Opportunities included completing social obligations, strengthening the company's image, 
marketing, and favorable legal consideration. Human and financial resource limitations, a lack of IT assistance, a lack 
of realistic evaluation, and how to incentivize online learning have all been challenges. Some leaders advocated for 
the use of gaming, incentives, and innovative apps (Lee 2019).

coefficients. Using Multiple Regression Analysis, we can calculate the amount of variance in the dependent variable 
that the variation can explain in each independent variable. This computation demonstrates the relative relevance of 
each independent variable in the relationship. Table 4. presents a multi regression analysis in which financial education 
application is used as an independent variable and financial knowledge is used as a mediating variable. 
The results of the Multi regression analysis for the research model are presented in Figure 1 and Table 4. The direct 
effect of the hypothesized positive relationship between financial education application and investment decision (H1, 
=.231, p <0.05) was shown in Table 4. As a result, these hypotheses were supported. This indicates that financial 
education application is positively related to the financial investment decision. This theory supported by Lee (2019) 
Advanced technology, such as edutainment, a combination of enjoyment and education to encourage education, is a 
breakthrough way for expanding financial education. People created an ecological model for financial literacy 
education program, with technology playing a critical supporting role. 
According to Lee (2019) Technological advancements in the digital age, the millennial generation is progressing into 
the twenty-first century, using e-learning technology to promote financial education and financial experts who have 
the passion and enthusiasm for serving societies to partner and enhance financial education for the benefit of the 
community. This idea demonstrates the importance of financial technology, such as financial education applications, 
in enhancing financial investment decisions. The results were consistent with the previous finding. The level of 
financial literacy is classified into three categories. High literacy (> 80%) is defined as a thorough knowledge and 
comprehension of financial management and planning. Medium literacy (60-80 percent) is sufficient to understand 
and plan for and manage one's finances. Low literacy (60 percent) is a state in which people do not know, comprehend, 
or have the skills to plan and manage their finances (Chen &Volpe, 1998). 
A positive relationship was also found between financial knowledge and financial investment decision (H3, β =.608, 
p < 0.05). As a result, these hypotheses are supported. This suggested that financial knowledge has positively related 
to making a financial investment decision. This study confirmed Frisancho (2019) Financial knowledge discoveries 
might also improve people's ability to analyze opportunity costs and marginal returns when making an investment 
decision, within and without the financial system. Financial literacy can have a long-term impact on human capital 
investment decisions from a young age since financially knowledgeable students are better judges of the benefits and 
drawbacks of investing in more years of education.  
According to (Huang et al. 2019) in addition to traditional risks associated with financial services, there are new 
concerns associated with the usage of digital financial services. Such hazards are more broad and challenging to detect 
than those related to traditional financial products and services, such as phishing, pharming, spyware, and SIM card 
swaps. Digital footprints may potentially pose a problem. This implies that greater financial understanding may also 
facilitate the usage of fintech products and services, but we are unaware of any studies on the subject. The literature 
has also revealed that an individual's behavioral features influence their financial decisions (Van Rooij et al., 2007). 
Furthermore, the hypothesized direct effect of financial knowledge mediating the relationship between financial 
education application and investment decision (H2, =.065, p <.05; =.608, p <.05) was accepted. As defined by Baron 
and Kenny (1986), Method is an analysis strategy for testing mediation hypotheses. There are two paths to the 
dependent variable in this mediation approach. The independent variable (financial education application) must predict 
the dependent variable (financial investment decision), and the mediator must be predicted by the independent variable 
(financial knowledge). As a result, financial knowledge will serve as a mediator between financial education 
applications and financial investment decisions. 
This theory also supported by Andarsari and Ningtyas (2019), finance behavior is influenced by financial knowledge. 
An individual's financial education has a significant impact on wealth equity. People who have high financial 
understanding are better able to make intelligent judgments, save more for retirement, manage investments prudently, 
and manage household finances. On the other hand, less literate people rarely make adequate choices, are more likely 
to incur debt, save less, and are more vulnerable to deception. 
6. Conclusions
This study investigates the effect of the existence of financial education on investment decisions with financial 
knowledge as the primary mediating factor. This study concludes a significant positive relationship between financial 
education application and investment decisions. According to Nan (2021), financial education is one of the triggers 
3616","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

for somebody to manage their finances correctly and try to improve the way their money is collected so that investors 
with a high level of financial efficacy will be more precise in making investment decisions based on their abilities and 
needs.  
The results of the study have several implications for promoting financial education and literacy in Indonesia, 
including the need for the application to incorporate more innovative and user-friendly features in order to help 
enhance Indonesia's financial understanding, particularly financial literacy and also information technology sector on 
developing some mobile application. People have tried to discover a reputable source of the best investment for their 
funds since COVID-19. Many financial education apps have emerged to help people in improving their financial 
literacy, or knowledge of finance. 
6.1 Recommendation 
Although this is considered to be the first study in Indonesia to use financial knowledge as a mediator between 
financial education application and investment decision making. This study, however, has numerous limitations. First, 
because this study was applied to Greater Jakarta, it is geographically restricted. Second, this study is still in its early 
stages because COVID-19 sparked the development of this financial education application. Future research is 
suggested to broaden the population sample. Following studies may conclude that additional characteristics, such as 
personality attributes, may influence personal investment decisions. It can also try to explore investment decisions on 
more precise financial instruments.

Abstract 
Globally, the film industry decreased significantly due to COVID-19, starting in March 2020. Physical distancing, 
lockdown protocols, and other restricted regulations were applied. Vaccines were just founded and were not massively 
distributed. At that time, no official health protocols nor standard operating procedures regarding film production and 
movie theaters were applied in the “New Normal.""The filmmaking businesses were threatened since film productions 
were restricted and movie theaters were closed down. The big dilemma occurred: which one was the priority: the 
safety of the crews and talents or the sustainability of national film industry? However, in 2021 there were some signs 
of progress. It started with Makmum 2 (December 2021), which obtained more than one million viewers. It is followed 
by Ku Kira Kau Rumah (February 2022) and KKN Desa Penari (April 2022), which reached 2,2 million and 3 million 
viewers, respectively. In prestigious film festivals, the movies such as Seperti Dendam, Rindu Harus Dibayar Tuntas, 
and Yuni won as the best pictures at Locarno Film Festival (August 2021) and Toronto Film Festival (September 
2021), respectively. Many films showed cases in Festival Film Indonesia (December 2021). These have shown that 
the Indonesian film industry is becoming better commercially and critically. The paper investigates how the 
Indonesian filmmakers tried to adjust to the New Normal era from both creative works and business strategy 
perspectives. In particular, the authors will do the mapping on the best practices of health protocols applied in film 
production.

1. Introduction
The emergence of COVID-19, starting in early March 2020 until recently, has challenged and shaped the usual routine 
of every aspect of life. The pandemic forced most cities globally to do lockdown and entered the ""New Normal"" era. 
In Indonesia, the film industry back in 2020, where vaccines were just founded and not massively distributed, the 
movie theatres were closed down, and film productions were stopped due to strict physical distancing and limited 
mobility protocols (PSBB – Pembatasan Sosial Berskala Besar). There were no standard operating procedures for 
conducting film shooting in pandemic situations.  
Based on a report from Filmindonesia.or.id (2020), it can be seen that all films released after the lockdown did not 
reach above 300 thousand viewers, as shown in numbers 11 to 15 (Film Indonesia, 2020). However, there were 
interesting facts about some new films in the following year. Makmum 2, released in December 2021, reached 1,7 
million viewers and became the first film with over one million viewers during the pandemic. It is followed by Nussa, 
a feature-length animated film released in October 2021, which reached almost 450 thousand spectators. Another film,

Rethink strategy should always be in place during the production of both films in order to create a safety and health 
condition for everyone on set. Creating the system for health protocols, such as cluster or ring system in Akherat: A 
love story), Yowis Ben 3 and Balada Si Roy, was an example of rethink and redesign process to create and ensure a 
comfortable atmosphere for all casts and crews. In particular, for the production of Yowis Ben 3 and Balada Si Roy, 
as the shooting of these films have been taken in different cities. The complexities of the problems require complexities 
of the protocols as well. 
The existence of COVID-19 task force on set, has been very crucial to ensure effective strategy can be maintained. 
The policies and strategies of setting up the health protocols should always be controlled by the task force. Clusters 
or Rings regulations were also part of the effective strategies to ensure that health protocols were in place and everyone 
complied and adopted the protocols.  
In the production of Akherat: A love story, the producer emphasized that preparation (pre-production) and good design 
of production should be in place. As making the health and safety to be the top priority, that they need to adjust and 
change some scenes or locations of the film, show the flexibility that should be maintained. It shows the ability of the 
leaders in those productions to achieve success without jeopardize the crews and casts of the movie. When someone 
got infected by the virus, the producers should come up with alternatives to improvise the best scenario for the 
production (which happened in all films production above). 
6. Conclusion
Many industries experience setbacks due to the pandemic, and the film industry is no exception. There are many forms 
of adaptations and changes made by business people in this industry. It ranges from the following changes in patterns 
in film consumption (from the big screen/theatrical to virtual screening), changes in movie sales and distribution 
(OTT) patterns, to how to keep producing films amidst the challenges of the spread of the Covid-19.  
The paper focuses on the discussion of the latter, which is on how the Indonesian filmmakers were trying to find the 
right patterns or protocols in producing the film and practicing business strategy. The best practices are needed so that 
production efficiency can be achieved (not over budget), minimize the spreading of the virus, and finish the movie 
promptly.  
During the pandemic situation, particularly in 2020, filmmakers were in a dilemma: to shoot or not to shoot. On the 
one hand, the situation was challenging during a lockdown: physical distancing was firmly applied, movie theaters 
were closed down, no SOP/health protocols were formulated, PCR tests were costly, and vaccines were not nationally 
circulated. On the other hand, the sustainability of the film industry should happen as production houses need to make 
films they already planned. Hence filmmakers need to formulate a film production atmosphere where all crews and 
talents feel safe and comfortable and focus on film production based on their respective roles. 
Both Harmayn and Nugross highlight the importance of designing and applying health protocols regarding film 
production during the pandemic. The health and safety of all crews and talents are the most important; therefore, 
filmmakers need to design good preparation and ensure the application. Moreover, maintaining the excellent mood of 
everybody is also crucial. The protocols have reflected the business strategies adopted which are rethink, effective 
policy and strategic flexibility to ensure the sustainable business in this industry.

Abstract 
COVID-19 has brought a substantial impact on women’s livelihood around the globe, including women in Asia. 
Countries are trying to mitigate this disruption by applying various gender-sensitive policies and regulations during 
the pandemic. Yet, little is known about how Asian countries are prioritising this strategy. The current paper aims to 
navigate how countries are responding to the spread of the virus whilst ensuring women’s welfare through gender-
sensitive policies, programs, and regulations. Using a dataset created by UNDP and UN Women, gender response 
policies are characterised into four main areas, namely Social Protection Measures, Labor Market Measures, Fiscal 
and Economic Measures, and Violence Against Women Measures. In addition, this paper aims to analyze the 
correlation of women's leadership in the COVID-19 national task force towards the policies that advocate women’s 
interests. The findings suggest that women’s low representation in the COVID-19 national task force is resulting in 
the lack of gender-sensitive policies.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on the decline of all aspects of human life, such as economic, 
social, and political (Song et al. 2020). All crises have a different impact on gender, including the crisis experienced 
during COVID-19. There is a difference between the impact experienced by women and men due to COVID-19, 
such as biological vulnerability to infection, loss of social and economic implications, the vulnerability in gender 
equality, lack of participation of women in various groups, including politics as well as various adverse impacts on 
women thereby increasing vulnerability towards women and girls (World Health Organization 2021). Moreover, the 
COVID-19 pandemic has amplified all gender inequalities (Wenham 2020). Economically, the COVID-19 crisis has 
caused a global economic downturn because of a decline in the economic activity of trading partners, a decline in 
commodity prices such as oil, and global supply chain disruptions (ILO 2020). Which will be most vulnerable to 
impact women who have less income, have jobs that are less secure or easily replaceable, do not have social 
protection, and cannot accept economic crises such as cuts and layoffs (UN Women 2021). 
Women's jobs and livelihoods are more vulnerable during COVID-19, where the rate of female job loss due to 
COVID-19 is about 1.8 times higher than the global rate of male job loss (Madgavkar 2020). There are still few 
women in politics influencing policy outcomes during COVID-19 that are not gender-friendly Abras (2021). As a 
result, gender inequality in politics will shape gender differences in policy preferences so that it must be overcome 
by empowering and increasing women to become resources, politicians, and policymakers (Kabeer 2003). Some 
experts state that female leaders are better at taking policies to deal with COVID-19 than male-led countries; 
wherein 2020, the death rate due to corona cases will be lower than in male-led countries (Garikipati and 
Kambhampati 2021). However, women's barriers to political contribution are caused by the roles, opportunities, and 
perceptions of empathy for women leaders and the amount of political Violence against women leaders (Fraser 
2020). On the other hand, the view is that tackling COVID-19 requires diverse and inclusive leaders to improve 
pandemic preparedness and response in conflict situations and reduce the impact on gender and produce gender-
friendly policies and health security (Meagher 2020).

6. Conclusion
COVID-19 has an impact on gender vulnerability, especially in women and children, such as biological vulnerability 
to infection, loss of social and economic implications, a vulnerability in gender equality, lack of women's 
participation in various groups, including politics as well as various adverse impacts on women thereby increasing 
vulnerability and inequality against women and girls. Therefore, to overcome the massive impact on women, the 
importance of a response or policy to COVID-19 is based on solid gender analysis or gender-sensitive policies and 
strong participation from the most affected groups, such as in decision making and implementing regulations. Based 
on an analysis of the low level of gender-sensitive policies in the Asian region in 4 policy categories with different 
fields in the Asian region, namely Social Protection Measures, Labor Market Measures, Fiscal and Economic 
Measures, and Violence Against Women Measures. Due to a lack of representation or the role of the Women's Share 
in the COVID-19 National Task Force in decision-making. There are significant impacts of the low gender-sensitive 
indicators in Asian regional policies.

Abstract 
Clearly, digital technologies have been developed rapidly, and it affects art form significantly. For instance, visual 
works, where were displayed and sold in the art galleries have shifted into the blockchain networks nowadays. As a 
result, it makes NFT (Non-Fungible Token) becoming extremely popular, mainly in Generation-Z. This study aims to 
discuss how visual communication design students as a part of Gen-Z are introduced to the world of NFT as a visual 
archiving solution through the art history learning method in Bina Nusantara University. In addition, this study sees 
to what extent art history could be implied in the NFT art in order to attract Gen-Z to learn history and gaining 
analytical and critical ability. In order to design a historical NFT art, first, students should be able to understand the 
cultural concepts that exist in each particular era, from the mindset, characteristics, to the main essence of that period. 
From the analysis of previous artefacts and any great relics that were exist, students are capable to express their 
thoughts about the certain culture and providing conclusions from each era they adopt. Through this process, a 
historical NFT art that emphasize the origin meaning in the past and executed through visuals that tailored to the needs 
of Gen-Z would be successfully achieved. To sum up, this study found that even digital assets could not be separated 
from enculturation and history.

1. Introduction
The digital world has been a daily consumption of Gen-Z’s life. A generation, which takes cellphones and the Internet 
as part of their lives; those who were born in the range of 1996 to 2015; as known as the instant generation, although 
not all instant things have a negative connotation. Numerous phenomena were discovered within this era. For instance, 
the Metaverse world introduced by Facebook, where everyone can make any transactions that are done in the real 
world, Bitcoin was found as the substitute for conventional currency in digital form, and the current method of buying 
and selling artwork through NFT (Non-Fungible Token). In Indonesia, this phenomenon becomes more viral by the 
appearance of a man named Ghozali, who is not a professional artist or designer, selling his selfie collection ‘Ghozali 
Everyday’ as an NFT art, and have been sold from 0,001 ETH or IDR 45K to the highest value of 11 ETH or IDR 47 
billion. Consequently, NFT is believed to be one of the safest ways of buying and selling tools, where the sold artworks 
would be the full rights of the buyer (Noor 2021).  
Through several advantages of NFT in disseminating art works (Wang, et al 2021), the authors tried to use NFT art 
as a medium to attract Gen-Z to seek deep understanding of art history. This was done due to the significant decreasing 
of young generation’s interest in learning history. As can be seen from the previous study, the Internet consumption 
has increased remarkably by 15,5% during the Covid-19 pandemic, with 93,5% of the usage was for entertaining

Through this NFT art, the student admitted that Mona Lisa is a timeless historical icon. Therefore, the icon was chosen 
to be intertextual zed with contemporary art. Given the fact that it has a contemporary aspect, the student was able to 
develop creative ideas freely, and executed into a new visual form. As illustrated by the semiotic explanation in table 
4.3, understandably, historical content could be transformed into a modern form and has great values as well as other 
contemporary art. Although it has a historical perspective, the “Hipster Lisa” is still relevant to the Gen-Z behavior. 
These following points explaining more about the artwork through the semiotic analysis: 
 
1. Meaning/content:  
The mindset that occurred during the Renaissance was illustrated through the Mona Lisa painting, as a symbol 
of freedom that provides novelties at that time.  In the Renaissance era, numerous things were made after the 
previous rules were withdrawn, from the Dark Ages era.  
2. Form:  
Mona Lisa painting represents the freedom of the era, which inspired the student to create the “Hispter Lisa”. 
Hipster concept was illustrated through cigars, sunglasses, and a “bucket hat”. All the design elements were 
arranged to create a contemporary feelings.  
3. Context:  
Mona Lisa painting, which is considered elegant and respectable, could be closer to Gen-Z through this art. 
It aims to deliver historical content from the past, which is rare to Gen-Z life. The “Hispter Lisa” has proved 
that historical content can compete with other contemporary art or digital art form, with a touch of current 
art technique and renewable applications, traditional works could be transformed and become modern works. 
  
Through the combination between artifact analysis and creativity, NFT art would depict individual characteristic. With 
regard to the learning process, it is important for lecturers to allow students to develop creative ideas without any 
boundaries. Consequently, students are able to design an artwork in intertextuality form, combining past, present, and 
modern perception (future). Intertextuality is defined as a process of connecting texts from the past with texts that 
exist in the present. Intertextuality does not only see a text through its emergence from social texts, but also its 
continuation in society and history (Kuswarini 2016). If the work wants to deliver messages from the past, then 
intertextuality is considered capable of attaching itself to present-day delivery. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Historical learning method for undergraduate students is often associated with memorization, at the beginning of 
learning. Meanwhile, most of the students found it difficult to understanding the concept of particular era through 
memorization technique. The aim of this study is to link artifacts with the spirit of the times and the mindset at that

an icon of today. 
 
Element 
Color: Bright colors on the

supporting objects, and 
geometric on the main object. 
Pattern: Geometric from digital 
effect on objects. 
 
Combining the main object with 
the present object denotatively 
through the use of hats, glasses, 
and cigars. Merging each 
element also gives a connotative 
effect in the form of ""cool Mona

The artwork above was inspired by the famous painting, Mona Lisa, which represents the Rennaisance, the era of a 
well-known artist Leonardo da Vinci. His famous wood panel oil painting was created between 1503 and 1506 in 
Florence, Italy. However, The Mona Lisa painting is remains an admiration and debate issue nowadays. Monalisa’s 
smile is considered to be a mystery that causes many speculations. This is what inspired the creator to create a new 
form as an NFT art. The creator transformed the Mona Lisa painting into a NFT art, combined with a contemporary 
urban style. Contemporary style was chosen to illustrate the present era, which was intertextualized at the same time 
as the Renaissance. 
 
5. Result and Discussion 
After going through the process in the research stage, the result titled “Hipster Lisa” was assessed as an impressive 
artwork. The student was successfully combining his personal experience and historical knowledge, then transforming 
into a recent art form that represents individual characteristic. The element of intertextuality was also depicted through 
the visual work. Figure 3 illustrates the initial process (brainstorming), which became the main idea of the “Hipster 
Lisa”.

Abstract 
PT XYZ is one of the cement producing companies in Indonesia. To produce cement, it is necessary to pay attention 
to the amount of raw material supply that must be provided. This is due to variable demand, the amount of inventory 
is not excessive, cost savings, and adjustment of the amount of inventory to the capacity of the warehouse. Currently 
PT XYZ has not been able to meet all consumer demands. This is because there is no method of controlling the 
inventory of raw materials that is not appropriate. This study aims to determine a good inventory model used in 
determining the order quantity, ordering time and safety stock taking into account the minimum total cost. Based on 
the analysis and calculation results, in this case, the use of the MRP method with the lot-sizing Least Unit Cost (LUC) 
technique will produce the lowest cost compared to the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method and wagner within 
algorithm. By using Least Unit Cost, the cost of ordering and storing raw materials will save Rp 1.096.019 with a 
percentage of 18% of the total costs incurred by the company.

1. Introduction
Every company has many goals that they want to achieve, for example, to get as much profit as possible and maintain 
smooth operation. In companies that produce products in the form of goods, efforts to earn profits are carried out by 
processing raw materials into finished goods or semi-finished goods (Handoko, 2015). This means that the 
procurement of raw materials is very important to achieve these goals for the smooth running of the production 
process. The smoothness of the production process itself is influenced by various factors. One of the important factors 
is the procurement and inventory control of raw materials to be processed in the production process. This production 
factor is often referred to as raw material inventory (Maharani, 2015). 
Inventory is stock of materials used to fulfill customer demand or to support the production of goods or services. 
Inventory planning and control is an important concern for managers in a company. Inventory that is too large 
(overstock) can reduce profitability, because it will increase ordering and storage costs. Too little inventory can affect 
sales, because it will cause inventory voids that disrupt the production process and can damage customer trust. Based 
on these 3 things, managers need to think about how to manage inventory effectively within the company (Krajewski, 
et al. 2015). 
PT. XYZ is one of the cement producing companies in Indonesia. The cement products produced are very diverse. 
One of them is OPC cement. OPC cement is a new innovation for PT XYZ which was introduced in 2019. OPC 
cement was born to increase consumers' choice of quality cement at a more affordable price, which is around Rp.

6. Conclusion
The best forecasting method in this study is linear regression with MAD of 80756.31 and tracking signal of 0.00. After 
calculating the lot sizing using Least Unit Cost (LUC), Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and wagner within 
techniques. then recapitulate the results of the calculation of the entire cost of raw material inventory. The total 
inventory cost of the Least Unit Cost (LUC) method is Rp. 4.924.26, Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method is Rp. 
7.585.537 and wagner within method is Rp 5.645.417 while the actual costs incurred by the company are Rp. 
5.141.508 with savings of Rp. 1.096.019 or 18%.

Abstract 
Interior design department required experience-based learning through a bank of material samples. The material 
samples in the physical material library come in various categories and different types. The situation of covid-19 
pandemic has enforced rapid growth of transformation on digital technology. Digital material libraries came up 
as a solution for such a situation. Digital samples of interior materials also can be stored and accessed easily with 
an internet connection. Otherwise, there are things to be considered due to crucial points in relation to senses 
experiences such as tactility and smell senses in which students need touch and feel the texture of the materials to 
explore and understand them better. A qualitative method with a comparative study approach is conducted in this 
research to investigate which elements of image taking could bring a close impression to the real object. By using 
this approach an in-depth comparison study will be done in the Interior Design department laboratory of BINUS 
University to reveal the advantages and disadvantages of images taken by two types of equipment: 2D flat scanner 
and digital camera. Mosaic Tiles, Carpet Flooring, Upholstery Fabric, Weaving, and Wallcovering. Result of this 
research will elaborate a glimpse of recommendation of digitization on interior materials to enrich sustainability 
on distance learning.

1. Introduction
In this digital age, information can be disseminated through varieties of media, not only through hardcopy books, 
journals or in this study, through physical materials. Following the rapid growth of information technology and 
the impact of the pandemic situation in the past years the technology transformation grows even faster. People 
were asked to stay home, reduced their mobility, and access to public places, including campuses and other 
learning facilities such as laboratories, libraries and drawing studios are restricted. Instead of face-to-face learning, 
virtual class, virtual meetings, digital learnings are conducted. Of course, this situation has influenced and even 
changed ways of teaching and learning. Like other areas of studies, in the interior design department, there is a 
lot of experience-based learning, both in the studio and laboratory that cannot be replaced with online activities. 
One of them is interior material exploration activities. This learning activity is related to students’ interior material 
knowledge and very important in supporting various projects in interior design courses as well as students’ final 
projects, where students must make material concepts related to their interior projects and analyze various types 
of materials that are suitable for their projects. The situation becomes difficult because during the pandemic they 
do not have access to visit the material laboratory. One of the solutions to this problem is through a digital material 
bank or digital material library which can be accessed online by multi-campus students anywhere and anytime. 
Thus, the learning process and material exploration can continue even though access to the physical material 
laboratory is limited.

In comparison, pictures taken by digital cameras have become a solution for the lighting control issue. It can 
provide a variety of photo angles to enrich image data about the materials with the proper lighting intensity. These 
advantages are bringing noise-free images and provide the deepened view of bumpy materials such as bubble 
mosaic, carpet, weaving rattan, and images that shows flexibility (eg. fabric and leather). This result has the 
potential to deliver appropriate information to the students, where they can easily recognize visual appearance of 
material. However, issues related to lighting control, camera placing and unstable photo taking should be carefully 
identified. Due to the variety of texture, while documenting with camera, the lighting settings, especially the white 
balance need to be adjusted with the lighting in location thus the color of the material will not be contaminated 
with light that has color tone (such as tungsten light with yellow effect or neon light with green effect). When the 
same object photographed with different light sources can determine the differences in the highlight, that is 
obvious, the highlight is the area with illuminated effect at the object (Hunter, et.al, 2007), as well as the effect 
on the material to be digitized. To maximize the appearance of different shapes and texture, the use of cameras 
needs to be supported with a variety of lighting settings in accordance with the material surface characteristics 
(Figure 12). With the appropriate lighting settings, the character of 3 dimensional objects can be emphasized to 
bring out the feel of the actual material. If one failed to identify these issues, the result of this technique could also 
become low due to incompetency of camera operations. Besides considering the lighting effects on the 
objects/material surface, in digital photography, the post-production process becomes a necessity and reasonable 
step (Freeman, 2007), depending on the goals to be achieved in a photo. In this case of interior material 
digitalization, certain materials may require a longer post-production or editing process for the color quality to 
match as closely as possible to the original materials. However, this post-production or editing process sometimes 
also needed to maximize the digitalization results from a scanner, which still more practical than digital 
photography.

6. Conclusion
Amid the unprecedented time of covid-19 pandemic, long-distance learning has become an answer to ensure 
continuity of teaching- learning process. Digitalization of the material library in the Interior Design Department 
of BINUS University supports the needs of material access while physical attendance in the laboratory is not 
allowed. In realization, digital transformation from physical objects to digital images requires a consideration in 
material experiences (due to lack of tactility and aromatic sensing in digital form).  
From this study, can be point out that image capture becomes a factor in the digitalization process, especially its 
requirement whether using a scanner of digital camera. It is agreeable that different types of material require 
different equipment and when selecting materials for digitizing, technical questions should be addressed include 
type of materials, surface of material, its color and other critical features that want to be shown digitally. Thus, 
suitable equipment can be selected and used. From the comparative study of material documentation, we can 
conclude that both equipment, the scanner and digital camera has their own strengths and weaknesses. However, 
when using digital camera, there are important factors to be considered:  
1.
Provide proper lighting to reduce noise and illustrate a real material surface (especially glossy materials).
The images shown in the digital library are required to be seen clearly along with the real color tone
(neutral lighting is recommended). Lighting also can build a bumpy effect that shows texture and surface
depth.
2.
Variety of camera angles are helpful for making the real image perception, as it builds the material
dimension by showing the thickness, width, and length/ diameter of the materials. Also, images show
material along with the vernier callipers can add more information needed.

Through this study, hopefully, the students can use the digital collection to understand the material, gain 
appropriate perception of materials characteristics, ready-to-use material collection to support design presentation, 
and have an experience to interact with the materials close to as it is in the real life. Lack of references related to 
digital photography techniques is one of the limitations of this study, besides lack of equipment for digitalization. 
Further studies on providing user experiences are highly required in the future to support distance teaching-
learning activities and interactions withing digital material libraries. Not only how the material samples are 
digitized, the establishment of data repository is also crucial. Moreover, the data formats must be defined in a 
standardized manner to be easily accessible to its users (Kimmig et al., 2021). With the growth of digital 
technology in every aspect including interior design, currently some of the common digital technology uses in 
interior design process are 2 and 3-dimensional drawing and modelling programs on a computer, artificial 
intelligence products, virtual reality (VR) and so on. Within the interior architecture itself, there are numerous 
design products generated via digital technology and there is a gradually increasing demand for such applications 
(Demirarslan & Demirarslan, 2020), this has opened an opportunity for further research. Not only to digitalize the 
material samples and establish a digital material repository, but also to study on how these digital material sample 
can be applied directly in 2 or 3-dimensional drawing and modelling.

Abstract 
The study aims to maximise the usage of the fabric and minimise the pre-production waste through the sustainable 
practice of zero waste pattern making and cutting technique. The entire process of designing and production of 
garments are now being challenged as the industry has been contributing as one of the most polluting industries, where 
the whole production loop needs to be looked at, from the design, manufacture, usage, to disposal stage. This research 
applied an exploratory research method by having exploration on pattern making technique on pre-production stage 
of garment making. Trials and errors using geometric pattern arrangement were conducted in the zero-waste approach 
while considering seam allowances and finishing technique in minimising the fabric waste. Paper folding technique 
was also implemented to support the design visualisation and further to ensure the garment fit. A fashion collection 
was made in response to introducing zero waste cutting as an alternative practice to create creative patternmaking with 
fabric efficiency considerations. Overall, this study offers economic and ecological benefit that helps in utilising the 
fabric on garment production, at the same time adding value to leftover fabric. The study also sees the potential 
improvement in doing more zero waste pattern cutting as part of the design process in the future.

1. Introduction
Sustainable lifestyle or what we called ‘being green’ is widely popular with many fashion brands joining the 
bandwagon of being sustainable and environmentally responsible. In Indonesia, it is also not something new, both 
brands and consumers are getting aware of this environmental issue and trying to find what can be done from their 
sides. Taking an opportunity over the growing ‘green’ demands, international and local brands have started voicing 
out ‘sustainable’ or ‘eco-friendly’ as part of their marketing strategy. By doing so, they manage to grab customers’ 
attention. But on the downside, this leads to greenwashing practice that might affect consumers’ brand trust in the 
long run. 
Fashion industry itself has long been known as one of the most polluting industries, especially with clothing industry 
ends up wasting fabrics during the production. As a result, fashion brands need to find sustainable alternatives that 
they can do to avoid the marketing spin of greenwashing yet stay environmentally responsible. Additionally, to achieve 
sustainability in fashion, they must consider the life cycle beyond solving the waste problem. The production loop that 
a product went through has to be looked at, all stages from design, manufacturing, use, to disposal. By doing so 
essentially natural resources can be utilised sustainably. 
One of the approaches is to do zero waste pattern cutting as to limit the inefficiency in garment production. Here, 
designer as the key player needs to be creative in maximising the use of a single fabric for a garment. They need to 
utilise the aesthetics, production, and cost while thinking about the impact to the environment. Additionally, the art of 
paper folding aligns with the creative zero waste pattern cutting. The implementation of folding introduces a new kind 
of aesthetics that could enhance the visual appeal of a garment that also maximises the use of a one big piece of fabric. 
Creases and corners as the result of the paper folding technique truly resemble the flat pattern of a zero waste pattern 
cutting. It inspires the pinching and folding of the fabric to fall nicely on body.

Figure 14. Proposed zero waste pre-production process 
As of current, the study of zero waste pattern cutting is still limited, and this research contributes to the exploration 
and possibility of using the technique as a sustainable alternative in fashion. The overall exploration might benefit 
from applying zero waste technique to different garment style and fabric types to further test the idea of utilising fabric 
sustainably. 
6. Conclusion
As the sustainable issue rises, more people are becoming more aware of environmental issues. The buzzword of eco-
friendly and save the earth is widely seen everywhere. The same thing happens in fashion industry, sustainable fashion 
is increasingly available with brands claiming to be environmentally responsible. However, this leads to the increased 
greenwashing practices as part of the company’s marketing strategy in promoting their products, in which in the long 
run it will impact brand trust. Therefore, it is highly suggested that customers need to be more mindful and selective 
during the pre-purchase stage. 
A collection was made in response to the greenwashing practice and as a sustainable alternative in minimising textile 
waste that is believed to have been highly polluting. Further, this study aims to raise the awareness of being transparent 
to the consumers about the sustainable practice in building the positive public image as opposed to the greenwashing 
practice. In this study, zero waste pattern cutting was chosen to be the approach in achieving sustainability in fashion. 
Although zero waste pattern cutting has not been a common thing in the industry especially in Indonesia, but it is 
believed that the approach might work well in utilising resources sustainably and in minimising the inefficiency in 
production. The approach was then combined with the idea of paper folding. Paper folding technique was added to 
help in visualising the design with a combination of pleats, folds, and darts. At the same time, these fabric 
manipulations would help ensuring the fit and fall of the fabric on body curves. 
Overall, zero waste pattern approach proves to offer economic and ecological benefit as compared to conventional 
approach that it helps in utilising the fabric during and after the production that it minimises the fabric consumption 
and at the same time adding value to existing leftover textiles. Instead of doing the greenwashing, this study might be 
beneficial for the creation of competitive advantage in the midst of tight competition in fashion industry. Further, this 
study sees the potential in doing more zero waste pattern cutting as part of design process in the future.

Abstract 
One of the problems with the growth of batik industrial clusters in Indonesia is the interest of business owners to 
consistently develop new ideas and creativity through product and process innovation. This problem causes most of 
the SMEs in Batik in the industrial cluster to experience a decline in turnover and difficulty meeting customer needs 
and desires. This study focuses on the function of knowledge management as a mediator and tries to develop a 
conceptual model that describes the impact of entrepreneurial orientation, industrial cluster, and knowledge 
management on the innovation performance of the batik industry cluster. This study uses the SEM PLS method to test 
the effect of these variables. The test results show that entrepreneurial orientation and industrial clusters significantly 
affect innovation performance, and knowledge management is a mediator of this influence. The study's findings might 
be consulted when developing a plan to boost the effectiveness of innovations in the batik industrial cluster.

1. Introduction
Indonesian batik, the whole technique, technology, and development of related motifs and cultures, has been
recognized by the United Nations of Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a Masterpiece
of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity since October 2, 2009. Since the recognition of Batik by UNESCO,
the batik industry has become one of the creative industries in Indonesia that have developed rapidly and has enormous 
potential to develop markets both at national and international levels (Ismail, 2015). Based on the 2016 creative
economy survey results, the value of batik exports in 2015 was USD 156 million or equivalent to Rp 2.1 trillion, up
10 percent from 2014. In 2016, the value of batik cloth exports and batik products reached USD 149,9 million. The
main markets are Japan, the United States, and Europe.
Very few batik products in Indonesia are produced by large-scale industries. Most of the batik is produced by small 
and medium industries (SMEs). However, as a business entity, SMEs also face several problems, both internally and 
externally. Some internal problems include capital issues, financial administration, regeneration, and single 
management. The external problems include business climate problems and limited infrastructure owned by SMEs 
(Lestari, 2005). Based on research conducted by Marijan (2005) and Lestari (2010), the formation of industrial clusters 
can be a solution to the problems faced by SMEs and increase their competitiveness of SMEs. 
An industrial cluster is several companies and institutions that are concentrated in an area, as well as interconnected 
in special fields and support competition (Lestari, 2010). Cluster is one of the solutions to the problem of the 
Indonesian economy, for example, the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). The industrial cluster also plays a role

Abstract 
Disaster readiness management is the main thing that the government must pay attention to in order to obtain methods 
as material for evaluating regional disaster management and management. The Regional Disaster Management 
Agency, hereinafter referred to as BPBD is one of the stakeholders who play an active role and is fully responsible 
for disaster preparedness in the region, so the Sleman BPBD readiness is crucial in handling and managing the eruption 
of Mount Merapi. So far, no assessment regarding this readiness has been carried out. This study aims to measure and 
map BPBD Sleman's readiness to handle and manage Mount Merapi's eruption in Yogyakarta Province. The variables 
used in this study are variables from the Sendai Framework and the National Disaster Management Plan. This study 
uses the Nominal Group Technique method for variable validation and the Analytic Hierarchy Process for variable 
weighting. It then changes the scale from ordinal to interval using the Method of Successive Interval. The next step is 
to calculate the readiness index by multiplying the results of the indicator assessment by weight. Data processing is 
carried out using 11 main criteria and 43 indicators. The results of the calculation of the readiness index show that the 
readiness index value of the Sleman BPBD is 55.362. Based on the index categorization and readiness status, the 
readiness of Sleman BPBD is in the ready category. Recommendations for improvement are made to indicators with 
assessment results that have low scores or indexes.

preparations were needed to deal with the number of evacuated residents due to the eruption.  If residents have a good 
understanding of disaster preparedness, this will likely not happen. 
 
The indicators H1 and H4 encourage the collection, management, and access to risk information; and improve risk 
understanding in the community.  However, BPBD Sleman in this implementation is still lacking due to the limited 
resources concerning information systems, making it difficult to develop management and access to risk information. 
In Indicators J2, J3, and J4, namely improving critical infrastructure; increasing business resilience, both from 
community livelihoods and businesses from various parties; and protecting and supporting the preservation of cultural 
institutions and collected objects and other historical, cultural, and religious heritage sites.  The critical infrastructure 
of the Sleman BPBD is still lacking; this is related to the limited existing facilities and infrastructure.  There are quite 
several protected areas and cultural heritage along with objects of cultural heritage in Sleman Regency.  However, 
quite a few are still implementing their maintenance, so protection and protection are needed preservation and 
improvement of the preparedness in disaster management in protected areas and cultural heritage.  The value of the 
protected area's function and cultural heritage's historical value cannot be calculated when a disaster damages it. 
 
In the K2 indicators, it is namely increasing community resilience and infrastructure services.  This result is because 
BPBD Sleman has implemented several disaster mitigations programs, but many people still lack an understanding of 
disaster risk.  Therefore, improvement efforts are always launched by BPBD Sleman related to disaster risk mitigation 
to increase the community's resilience. 
 
6. Conclusion 
There are eleven main criteria for assessing the readiness of BPBD Sleman in the context of the disaster management 
efforts of Mount Merapi. There are also indicators in each of these main criteria, whereas in this study, there are 43 
indicators. The main criteria and indicators used are frameworks derived from the Sendai Framework and the 2015-
2019 National Disaster Management Plan. 
 
Based on calculations using the AHP method on the main criteria and indicators in the framework for assessing the 
readiness of the Sleman BPBD in disaster management for Mount Merapi, it was found that the essential priorities 
carried out by the Sleman BPBD on the main criteria are increasing the effectiveness of disaster prevention and 
mitigation with a weight of 16.3%, followed by increasing disaster emergency preparedness and handling with a 
weight of 15.1%, increasing disaster recovery capacity with a weight of 13.5%, understanding disaster risk with a 
weight of 11.8%, strengthening risk management with a weight of 9.2%, the fulfilment of good governance in the 
field of disaster management with a weight of 8.4%, DRR investment for resilience with a weight of 8.3%, improve 
risk management with a weight of 6.3%, an increase in and multi-stakeholder partnerships in disaster management 
with a weight of 5%, the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in development with a weight of  4%, and the last 
is strengthening the legal framework for disaster management with a weight of 2.2%.  The results of the calculation 
of the readiness index show that the readiness index value at BPBD Sleman is 55.362. The position is in the “ready” 
category based on index categorization and readiness status.  
 
Suggestions and recommended corrective steps are increasing the role of communities and communities, cross-city 
synchronization related to disaster risk studies, and strengthening the implementation of disaster curriculum in schools. 
In addition, integrating information dissemination systems (technology) with local wisdom, strengthening institutional 
regulatory systems, risk management socialization, and strengthening coordination with the tourism office.

Abstract 
Lean manufacturing has been widely applied in companies and proven to improve operational performance. Lean is 
mainly applied to the automotive industry. However, now it has been widely applied in other sectors by considering 
the characteristics of the application field, including the agro-food sector. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 
production process in SMEs, which is still done conventionally. The research begins by using value stream mapping 
to identify inefficiencies. The results of current-value stream mapping state that the efficiency of the production 
process is 71.34%. The failure mode effect analysis results state that the critical waste that occurs is overprocessing, 
waiting, and transportation time. Proposed improvements are made by applying the 5S concept, layout design of the 
production area, and mechanization of the boiling and filtering processes. Efficiency in future value stream mapping 
is estimated to increase by around 20%.

1. Introduction
Tofu is a soy-based food that provides protein requirements for humans. In addition to being a good source of bioactive 
compounds, including isoflavones and soy saponin, tofu is also a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats. 
Consuming tofu can lower the risk of several illnesses, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, 
arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, breast cancer, and other conditions (Q. Zhang et al. 2018). Tofu may reduce 
the risk of CHD in women (X. Zhang et al. 2003) and decreases lipogenesis in the liver via regulating gene expression, 
which could lower serum lipid levels (Takahashi and Konishi 2011). 
Besides the several benefits of consuming tofu, it also has a delicious taste and affordable price for all levels of society. 
It causes that tofu includes as a popular food in Indonesia. The average tofu consumption in Indonesia grew from 
7,956 kg per person in 2020 to 8,216 kg per person in 2021 (Badan Pusat Statistika 2021). Following the rise in tofu 
consumption, small tofu-producing businesses in Indonesia have emerged. One of the small and medium enterprises 
(SME) that produces tofu in Indonesia is Eko Budi’s home industry in the village of Sugihmanik, Tanggungharjo, 
Grobogan, East Java. 
Based on the preliminary observation in Eko Budi’s home industry, it was indicated that there was time wasted during 
the tofu production process. The researchers indicated that set-up time in several processes took a long time. The 
percentage between set-up time and total production time in the boiling and frying processes was 59% and 49%, 
respectively. Besides, there was often a waiting time in the filtering process of 3-4 minutes if the tofu porridge in the 
previous process had not been processed. In addition, tofu production ran conventionally. The filtering process is done 
manually by humans as much as 50-60 times a day. The waste during the tofu production process led to an inefficient 
process.

6. Conclusion
This study aims to apply the lean manufacturing approach to the tofu production in Eko Budi’s SME using VSM. 
Calculations using current state value stream mapping revealed that some waste occurred at UKM Tahu Eko Budi. 
Waste is identified based on time inefficiencies that have been measured. The efficiency of the boiling, filtering, and 
frying processes was discovered to be in the low category. To increase efficiency in the tofu production process, 
researchers recommend two strategies. First, implement the 5S concept in the manufacturing process and redesign the 
manufacturing floor layout to reduce transportation time. Second, shifting the production system from manual or 
human power to mechanical or machine assistance, particularly in the filtering process, to reduce cycle time in tofu 
production and worker workload, thereby reducing overprocessing waste. With several recommendation for 
improvement, an estimated time calculation for the future VSM design is performed and compared with the current 
VSM design. According to a comparison of the two designs, the efficiency of the VSM future has increased by an 
average of 20%.

Abstract 
The progress of the industry causes a lot of competition in various industrial circles, especially in construction services. 
There are many types of competition in the construction service industry, this requires construction service actors to 
make improvements. One of the strategies in competing in the industrial world is to maintain the best quality and 
provide innovation in increasing the procurement of raw materials. This study aims to analyze the criteria that are the 
company's priorities in choosing iron plate suppliers for fabrication needs. One of the methods used in this research is 
the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. The problem solved is multi-objective and multi-criteria based on 
the comparison of preferences of each element in the hierarchy. This research involves experts who are used as 
respondents to consider decisions. The results of the study show that the Price criteria is still the most important 
criterion with a weight of (0.352), followed by Quality criteria with a weight of (0.277), Service criteria with a weight 
of (0.143), Flexibility criteria with a weight of (0.114), and Delivery criteria with a weight of (0.113).

1. Introduction
The progress of the industry causes a lot of competition in various industrial circles, especially in construction services. 
Competition occurs because of the struggle for market share in Indonesia. The many types of competition in the 
construction service industry, this requires construction service actors to make improvements to win the competition. 
One of the strategies in competing in the industrial world is to maintain the best quality and provide innovation in the 
manufacture of a product that is desired and used by consumers (Russo & Camanho, 2015). One of the most important 
activities for construction service companies is inventory management. One of the activities in this inventory 
management is the procurement of raw materials. Raw materials are generally imported from suppliers. Suppliers are 
one of the important external parties for the existence and sustainability of a company. Supplier is a company or work 
partner that procures goods from manufacturers, agents, distributors, traders and contractors who have passed the pre-
qualification and have their domestic/foreign address (Juliana et al., 2017). The concept of the supply chain, suppliers 
are one part of the supply chain that is very important and affects the survival of a factory. The factory as a system 
that carries out production activities must require raw materials which of course are imported from suppliers (Yu & 
Liu, 2021). If the supplier is less responsible and does not respond to demand fulfillment, it will cause problems, 
including the occurrence of stockouts and the length of lead time. Therefore, companies that have many alternative 
suppliers must be selective in choosing suppliers. To get a selective supplier, a good and objective Supplier Evaluation 
and Selection System is needed (Razi et al., 2020). 
Industry SIKO is a contractor company that can carry out technical improvements, consulting services and 
environmental restoration with technology from Japan. The company was founded with the aim of developing high 
efficiency performance to achieve client's needs and satisfaction. The company which was founded in October 2007 
is actively involved in industrial development in Indonesia and to provide sustainable quality technology & customer 
satisfaction as well as to survive through the competition. The company's vision and mission is to be part of an active 
player in contributing to industrial development in Indonesia and around the world. The method of procuring plate

6. Conclusion
The conclusions in this study were obtained, among others, as many as 5 criteria and 15 sub-criteria have been 
validated that are relevant to construction companies, especially those related to the procurement of plate iron. Price 
criteria is still the most important criterion with a weight of (0.352), followed by Quality criteria with a weight of 
(0.277), Service criteria with a weight of (0.143), Flexibility criteria with a weight of (0.114), and Delivery criteria 
with a weight of (0.113). Meanwhile, the five most important sub-criteria are Product Price sub-criteria with a weight 
of (0.212), Consistency of quality (0.159), Guarantee and warranty (0.086), Term of payment (0.0826) and on time 
delivery (0.076). The limitation of this study is that it does not consider the uncertainty factor and the reliability of the 
information in the judgment of the experts. In future research can consider the uncertainty factor and for method 
validation can be compared with other multi-criteria decision-making methods.

Abstract 
Teachers must be able to improve the quality of their profession to meet the demands of industry 4.0. A quality 
profession will not be achieved if teachers do not have quality and prosperous human beings. By utilizing 
technological developments, teachers can monitor and diagnose the condition of their own welfare on an ongoing 
basis, to optimize the quality of work life. A Qualified Teacher's Work Life is very important for the teacher himself 
as an educator, institution and nation and state. Quality work life can be a measure of teacher growth vertically and 
horizontally along with the growth of the institution. Quality of work life refers to the level of satisfaction, motivation, 
involvement, and commitment experienced by teachers with respect to their lives at work. The interests of teachers as 
individuals are still fulfilled just as they fulfil their interests in their work. Encounter Education, psychological traits 
with Artificial Intelligence called Positive Education is the main goal of this research. One form is self-diagnostic 
which is able to diagnose psychological conditions to produce optimal quality. This study aims to dig deeper through 
various literature studies on teacher wellbeing whether it can improve the Quality of Work Life of teachers. The results 
of the study show that teacher wellbeing is one of the indicators that also determines the quality of work life of teachers.

Abstract 
Entrepreneurial Mindfulness is a concept that integrates the concept of psychology in the practice of entrepreneurship. 
Mindfulness is a psychological concept rooted in the Eastern tradition of contemplative meditation practice that 
emphasizes how the centre of one's consciousness impacts positive changes in oneself. Mindfulness has an impact on 
how a person can generate greater attention while realizing the importance of the present experience. The concept of 
Entrepreneurial Mindfulness has been developed in the form of a research instrument and built on an intelligence-
based website that can be accessed at www.entrepreneurialmindfullness.com. This study aims to develop a more 
responsive Entrepreneurial Mindfulness website based on input from User Experience results. The research method 
used is exploratory research as part of the Neuroresearch Research Methods stage through three stages, namely 
exploratory research, explanatory research, and confirmatory research. The exploration resulted in systematic 
literature reviews of the concepts of entrepreneurship and mindfulness. The results of the research are in the form of 
website development that has been adapted to user needs so that the website is more responsive. The website was 
developed to customize the content, adjust the device in accessing it without reducing and changing the appearance 
of the layout.

Abstract 
 The optimal performance of a repairable system where failure results in either an imperfect repair or replacement 
under exponential time between failures and repair times is discussed in this study. We develop a constrained stochastic 
nonlinear optimization model with capital, repair, and downtime costs constituting the three cost categories of the 
objective function. In this context, a closed expression for the optimal minimum cost is developed, along with analytical 
expressions for a variety of parameters, including repair and replacement rates.

1. Introduction
Currently, industrial organizations are confronted with several difficulties that risk their financial success. 
During production, manufacturing systems are subjected to a variety of disruptions, including deterioration, 
random failures, poor maintenance techniques, and quality decline, among others, all of which have a significant 
impact on the overall performance of such systems. As a result, appropriate production and maintenance 
techniques are essential for limiting the effects of such unpredictably disruptive events.  
In recent years, product quality has become a significant dimension that has steadily been incorporated into the 
field of production systems. Because effective quality methods are directly linked to production and 
maintenance, integrated models including the three core functions of production, quality, and maintenance have 
lately delivered better outcomes than traditional models that address these activities independently. Several 
other issues, such as degradation, have a negative impact on the system's performance. In real life, not only is 
performance important, but so is cost, and systems also behave in an unpredictable manner. 
During their operational life, Industrial systems are subject to repair actions when they fail during their 
operating life. The goal of a repair action is to decreases the system's failure rate and extend its useful life. The 
system's inherent age as well as the effectiveness of repair must be considered during the maintenance process. 
In most cases, repair efficiencies are assumed to be minimal, perfect, or imperfect. The system is returned to its 
operating state just before the failure in minimal maintenance. The goal of a perfect repair is to return the system 
to its original state which is as good as new. Meanwhile, these assumptions are not necessarily feasible for a 
repairable system because the system can be effectively repaired but not renewed. This is referred to as 
imperfect repair.  
In this paper, we aim to develop an optimization model for a repairable system with identical components that, 
upon failure, is either replaced or imperfectly repaired, but with varying probability. The expressions for the 
optimal values for many critical metrics such as repair and failure rates are determined. Furthermore, the 
expression for the minimum total cost is derived, noting that three cost components are incorporated including 
purchase cost, repair cost, and downtime cost total.  
2. Literature Review
Barlow (1965) used the Markov process to examine system availability and presented the principles of 
mathematical theory of reliability. To put it another way, maintenance is used to improve equipment reliability 
by preventing unexpected malfunctions, decreasing unscheduled downtimes, and lowering maintenance costs

4. Results and Discussion
The optimal parameters are obtained from equations (9–11) and are provided in equation (12). The stochastic 
repair and replacement model, which was the subject of the study, is a generic model from which alternative 
models with a similar structure can be deduced. According to this approach, the process is replaced if the 
probability of replacement is 1. following each failure 
The procedure becomes imperfect repair and replacement if we set the replacement probability value to 0. 
(Hajeeh, 2022). The model involves probabilistic repair and replacement for probability values between 0 and 1. 
The models with p = 1 and p = 0 are clearly the worst when comparing their performances; nevertheless, models 
where p is between 0 and 1 are better than the imperfect model and worse than the total replacement model 
(perfect repair). Even while performance is the key criterion for choosing a system, cost is just as significant. 
We are unable to distinguish between the various models in this regard and select the best one. In this study 
three categories are considered, namely purchase, repair, and down time costs.  
In general, we don't prefer to replace a broken component with a new one because that would cost a lot of 
money, and we also don't like to keep repairing broken components. Thus, imperfect repair systems are the most 
advantageous, followed by stochastic repair and replacement, and then the ideal model, if all characteristics, 
variables, and costs are the same. 
5. Conclusion and Future Directions
In this paper, a general optimal model for stochastic repair and replacement is developed, from which the 
performance of various systems can be produced. Engineers and decision makers should carefully examine all 
the parameters before choosing any system. It has been noted that the optimization model is more intricate, and 
careful research is required to identify the best options and parameters. Additionally, standby and parallel setups 
are more intricate and challenging to solve than series ones. 
Future studies should consider complicated systems, with different failure modes, and multiple components. The 
failure and repair rates of systems that follow different distributions, such as the Weibull and Beta Distributions, 
among others, must also be considered. Simulation needs to be considered for more complicated systems.

Abstract 
PT. Kharisma Rotan Mandiri is a rattan furniture manufacturer and exporter company established in 1998 that 
produces various of furniture models and home decorations made of rattan, wood, and iron alloys. Based on direct 
observations made by the author and discussions with the company, there is a buildup of unused materials for the 
Winston Rattan High back Armchair chair in the cutting building. Based on discussions that have been carried out by 
the author with the company, it was found that PT Kharisma Rattan Mandiri has not managed material inventory 
efficiently so that there is often a buildup of residual materials that hinder operator performance and harm the 
company's investment costs. The Winston Rattan High Back Armchair chair was chosen as the object of research 
because it is a product that is included in the push product (a product with high demand) so the company needs to 
maintain the availability of material stocks. Inventory control is needed in the management of materials Winston 
Rattan High back Armchair as an effort to maintain optimal availability of materials with the aim of stacking the 
remaining materials which harms the company's investment costs and hinders the work of production operators to be 
reduced. ABC analysis is one of the methods used in inventory planning and control. The focus of the ABC Analysis 
is to group inventory based on the cumulative amount of usage and investment value of each existing inventory. This 
grouping is carried out to determine control priorities and assist operators in facilitating the diversification of inventory 
records. The conclusion of this study is that the stock of Winston Rattan High back Armchair are medium moving 
because most of the the material for the Winston Rattan High back Armchair, categorized as B, namely eight items. 
Category A has the least number of materials, namely as many as 2 items. Through the analysis of the investment 
value, it is known that many material items in group C have low investment values. So that the purchase can be reduced 
or replaced with other materials and can reduce the risk of causing a high risk of accumulation of residual materials 
and large investment costs.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a country that has extraordinary potential with a wealth of abundant natural resources, both renewable 
resources and unrenewable resources. As a country that has the third largest natural tropical forest in the world, 
Indonesia is rich in biological natural resources (Trade Policy Assessment and Development Agency, 2016). One of 
the Non-Timber Forest Products (HBHK) which is a superior product and is a renewable natural resource is rattan. 
However, over the past five years Indonesia has experienced four times the deficit in the trade balance of rattan and 
rattan-based products. This is a yellow light that indicates the decline of the rattan processing industry in Indonesia

higher value, the purchase to order policy needs to be adopted if possible, or if there is only one customer, PT Kharisma 
Rotan Mandiri can hold inventory and be wiser in reordering. In this case, because category C items are low value 
items and have little or no movement, little monitoring is required with a simple system. The large number of items 
also means that category C materials should be ordered less frequently by the logistics company PT Kharisma Rotan 
Mandiri. 
 
The most effective inventory control system based on ABC analysis is to combine logical methods with the techniques. 
ABC analysis is the basis for inventory control which is also used as a basis for continuous inventory control where 
annual stocktaking needs to be avoided by routinely calculating inventory categories every week. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of classifying the Winston Rattan High back Armchair materials based on the use value, investment, and 
critical index. Based on the usage value for category A are F25/30 and screw 6*1.5. Category B are 8*2.5 screws, 
24/48 semi polished rattan, 9/10 polished rattan, and 18/20 semi polished rattan. Category Care SPT fabric seat pillow, 
SR-10 fabric back pillow, glue, single face, 200lbs L-shape packing-box, logo, sandpaper, and wood joints. Based on 
the investment value for category A are SPT fabric seat pillows, SR-10 fabric back pillows, and 200lbs L-shape 
packing-boxes. Category Bare 24/48 semi polished rattan, 9/10 pole polished rattan, and 18/20 semi polished rattan. 
Category Care glue, single face, logo, sandpaper, joint wood, 8*2.5 screws, F25/30 nails and 6*1.5 screws. Based on 
the critical index value for category A are 24/48 semi polished rattan and 18/20 semi polished rattan. Category B are 
9/10 polished stronghold, SPT fabric seat pillow, SR-10 fabric back pillow, 200lbs L-shape packing-box, wooden 
joints, 8*2.5 screws, F25/30 nails, and screws 6*1.5. The materials included in group C are glue, single face, logo, 
and sandpaper. 
 
Through the results of the value-in-use analysis, it is known that many of the materials for the Winston Rattan High 
back Armchair are medium moving, this is evidenced by the large percentage of materials belonging to group B, the 
recommendations that must be the company's top priority in handling inventory problems by considering the critical 
value. Inventory control of critical index C group materials such as glue, single face, logo, and sandpaper does not 
have to be in stock and can be replaced with other supplies. This will help the company in minimizing costs and 
reducing the risk of accumulation of residual materials. It is known that many material items in group C have low 
investment values. So that the purchase can be reduced or replaced with other materials. Materials that are included 
in the critical index group A such as semi polished rattan 24/48 and semi polished rattan 18/20 need to be checked 
regularly so that the company does not over-order, causing a high risk of accumulation of residual materials and large 
investment costs. And so that the company does not run out or lack of materials when there is a surge in orders.

Abstract 
The object of research is one of the companies engaged in aircraft catering using a variety of raw materials. Currently, 
the procurement department considers that all raw materials are routine raw materials, so the procurement process is 
carried out repeatedly by suppliers at the lowest prices without entering into contracts or cooperation (regular 
purchasing). In the absence of contract management, companies lose the opportunity to improve supplier compliance 
and negotiate price reductions. The decline in supplier performance is also a problem faced, but the procurement 
department has not assessed supplier performance. With these problems, it is necessary to evaluate the ongoing 
procurement strategy to improve the efficiency of the procurement process. This study aims to develop 
recommendations for procurement strategies that include relationships with suppliers and company internal policies. 
In this study, the preparation of procurement strategy recommendations was taken based on the results of Kraljic's 
Purchasing Portfolio Model (KPM) which was used to differentiate each raw material based on the level of supply 
risk and the effect of each raw material on company profits, and the results of the Purchasing Price Assessment–DEA 
(PPA-DEA) in the category of leveraged goods related to the level of efficiency in purchasing goods. KPM shows 
that: the group of ingredients for milk, eggs, jam, and chocolate is strategic; dyes, yeast, and coconut milk are classified 
as bottlenecks; flour and sugar are classified as leverage; oil, packaging, mineral water, utilities, and plastics are 
classified as non-critical.

Based on this, several strategies can be carried out by the company to improve the efficiency of the procurement 
process on the object of research (e.g., Table 5. Recapitulation of recommendations for procurement strategies that

5. Conclusions
Based on the results of data processing and analysis related to Kraljic's Purchasing Portfolio Model method, it is 
obtained the differentiation of interests for each group of raw materials by classification, namely for groups of raw 
materials milk, eggs, jam, and chocolate classified as strategic goods. The raw materials for dyes, yeast, and coconut 
milk are classified as bottleneck goods. The flour and sugar raw materials group is classified as leveraged goods. The 
raw materials for oil, packaging, mineral water, utilities, and plastics are classified as non-critical goods. 
Based on the results of data processing and analysis related to the Purchasing Price Assessment-DEA method, the 
efficiency level of purchasing raw materials in the leverage category is obtained, namely, for the flour raw material 
group, Medium Protein Flour and rice flour are included in the raw material category with a low level of supplier 
ability to can provide competitive price. All-purpose flour, glutinous rice flour, and High Protein Flour are classified 
as raw materials with an inefficient purchasing scale. For the sugar group, granulated sugar, corn sugar, and liquid 
sugar are classified as efficient raw materials. Jelly sugar and caster sugar belong to the raw material group with a

low level of supplier ability to be able to provide competitive prices. Palm sugar and caster sugar belong to the raw 
material group with an inefficient purchasing scale. 
 
Based on data processing and analysis, recommendations are obtained regarding strategies to improve the efficiency 
of the procurement process, namely, for non-critical goods focusing on increasing profit impact which can be executed 
by doing pool-purchasing, spot-purchasing, and forecasting demand using EOQ. Bottleneck items focus on 
minimizing supply risk and increasing profit impact which can be executed by establishing long-term relationships, 
conducting call-off contracts, in-depth supply market analysis, forecasting, and pool purchasing. Strategic goods 
focus on minimizing supply risk which can be executed by establishing long-term relationships, partnerships, 
collaborative negotiation, in-depth supply market analysis, and forecasting using the JIT or LFL method. Leveraged 
goods focus on exploiting buying power which can be executed by changing suppliers and grouping purchases.

Abstract 
Waxy crude oil deposition in production pipelines often causes flow assurance issues in production operation. 
The issue further deteriorates during restarting of the waxy crude oil pipeline after an emergency shut down or 
planned maintenance. This is due to the obstruction caused by the solid wax in the pipeline, which requires 
additional pressure to disintegrate the solid wax before achieving a steady flow. The conventional equation used 
to measure the minimum pressure required for pipeline restart is overestimated, since thermal shrinkage, gas 
voids formation, and compressibility are neglected. The present study describes the effect of water bath 
temperature on the cooling time of the waxy crude oil and the effect of gas injection duration on the restart 
pressure of the waxy crude oil pipeline. The experiment was carried out using a waxy crude oil flow loop rig. It 
was observed that as the water bath temperature decreases, the cooling time increases, and the cooling rate 
decreases. When different gas injection durations were injected, a longer duration yields to lower pipeline restart 
pressure. Longer gas injection duration implies more volume of gas; hence compressibility is increased, which 
provides more space for the movement of the gelled waxy crude oil and its disintegration within the pipeline 
during the restart process. Hence, the restart pressure of the pipeline can be greatly reduced. At water bath 
temperature of 20°C, the highest restart pressure reduction, 40.48% is achieved, whereas at water bath 
temperature of 32°C, the highest reduction in the restart pressure attained is 33.52%.

1. Introduction
Crude oil is an unrefined petroleum product with complex mixture of hydrocarbons which is comprised of 
components such as paraffins, asphaltenes, resins and aromatics. Substances that cause critical flow assurance 
problems are mostly paraffin wax and asphaltenes which experience thermodynamic instability (Alade, Hassan, 
Mahmoud, Al-Shehri, & Al-Majed, 2020). It is reported that as high as 50% of paraffin waxes could exist in 
waxy crude oil (Ajienka & Ikoku, 1991). Essentially, paraffin wax consists of normal paraffin content of 
approximately 80 to 90%, while the rest is comprised of branched paraffins (iso-paraffins) and cycloparaffins as 
mentioned by Rehan et al. (Rehan, Nizami, Taylan, Al-Sasi, & Demirbas, 2016). In transporting multiphase 
hydrocarbons from reservoirs to production surface facilities, the occurrence of waxy crude oil in offshore 
pipelines is known to be a challenge to the upstream oil and gas operators. It not only reduces the available area 
to flow but also contributes to production operation delay and requires higher pump capacity to break the wax

Abstract 
This paper develops a research methodology to rank Quality Management Systems (QMS). The QMS and its related 
tools and techniques are adequately investigated in current literature. However, determining the priority of adopting 
different QMS is less practiced along with Multiple-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies. Furthermore, 
this combination is not vastly examined in developing countries. Also, famous MCDM model such as Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be easily linked with this problem. Hence, to fill this gap, this research has been 
completed in three phases as follows. The first phase provides a review on previous literature. To do so, a literature 
survey is conducted to find the common criteria to prioritize different QMSs. Next, the most frequently applied QMSs 
of previous literature are determined in the second phase of this research. Following, the third phase determines the 
priority level of different QMSs to be applied by companies. To do so, the third phase applies an AHP to investigate 
and prioritize the most frequently applied QMSs of the second phase. According to the obtained results, ISO 9001, 
ISO 14001, and ISO 50001 are the most important QMSs to be applied by companies, respectively. Finally, the last 
section of this study includes a summary and some directions for future research.

1. Introduction
Decision making is an important process of any organization (Hashemzahi et al. 2020). In this regard, it can affect all 
processes which are directly and indirectly involved in final quality of products (Hemmati et al. 2018:2019). Therefore, 
adopting a proper Quality Management System (QMS) is important. In addition, there are numerous QMSs with 
different functions and obligations. To be more specific, different QMSs can be adopted by companies regarding their 
functions, obligations, results and many other features (Alawag et al. 2020). So, it is necessary to investigate and rank 
these QMSs, especially in developing countries as it affects the development of their performance. In addition to 
qualitative approaches to investigate and select QMSs, quantitative approaches such as Multiple-Criteria Decision 
Making (MCDM) tools are applicable to prioritize different QMSs (Lam et al. 2008).

5. Conclusion 
This study proposed a step-by-step procedure to rank different QMSs. The QMSS, their tools and techniques are 
properly examined in previous literature. However, the patriotization process of different QMS were less examined 
along with MCDM models. In addition, the problem was not adequately investigated in developing countries. 
Furthermore, well-known MCDM techniques such as AHP were less investigated to enrich the problem. Hence, this 
research applied following phases to fill the gap of previous literature. The initial phase reviewed previous literature 
to develop the initial idea. In this regard, a literature survey was conducted to develop the common criteria of 
prioritizing QMSs. Following, the most frequently applied QMSs of previous studies were determined in the second 
phase of this study. Finally, the third phase determined the priority of different QMSs to be used in companies. To be 
more specific, the third phase applied an AHP to develop and rank the most frequently applied QMSs of the second 
phase. The obtained results showed that ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 50001 are the highest ranked QMSs, 
respectively. As a direction for future research, the developed methodology of this research can be repeated in any 
study to prioritize different performance measurement frameworks.

Abstract 
The industrial situation has been faced with new challenges to be able to get out of a challenging situation to continue 
to serve customers by maintaining good performance during years of Covid-19 pandemic, even though this is a 
challenge to be able to learn to anticipate similar events in the future which will come. Objective achievement to 
analyze indicators performance of the technical division of the medical equipment distributor during the pandemic as 
an object to be able to find out what performance has decreased and needs to be improved to anticipate crisis conditions 
such as pandemic crisis conditions as happened before. This study concludes that the analysis that occurred due to the 
decrease in order completion targets during 2021 performance indicator that was fixed at the root of the problem made 
positive implications for other indicators, with a 99% increase in spare parts availability, 86% parts responsiveness, 
and 81% troubleshooting time, and 77% order completion time. The industrial implication of this research is that the 
conceptual method with a dynamic balanced scorecard strategy map can be well applied to anticipate a decline in 
performance in times of crisis.

1. Introduction
Lean approaches provide a more reliable, higher-quality product and reduce lead time and cost. Lean medical device 
distribution would employ root cause analysis to eliminate mistake causes instead of adding inspection stations. 
Customer satisfaction, fast delivery, and reducing delays are crucial given COVID-19's growing medical product 
needs (Trubetskaya et al., 2022). Framework for buyer selection in the unique circumstance presented by the COVID-
19 pandemic, during which the demand for goods and services associated to healthcare has significantly grown. 
(Mushtaq et al., 2021). There is a possibility that the regulatory framework for the medicinal product COVID-19 has 
been broken by the current outbreak. The COVID-19 outbreak pushed the issue to the forefront for high-income 
nations together with small as well as intermediate countries (Badnjević et al., 2020). Workers in the field of aerospace 
engineering consider that the average data at the first build, which measures workload, is of a medium nature. In 
general, respondents find that the pressures of their jobs are bothersome (Widodo et al., 2021). To reduce exposure 
among healthcare and non-healthcare employees, the present COVID-19 pandemic has adapted speed to the adoption 
of system intelligence and process improvement in healthcare (Gerke et al., 2020). Virtually everyone who does any 
kind of job from home is required to make use of digital improvement of technology. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, it 
is feasible to assert that company operations and business models have experienced some type of digital improvement 
and speed of transformation (Stalmachova et al., 2022). Professionals' ability to maintain a healthy work-life balance 
is the key to greater productivity; yet this balance was severely disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown 
owing to rapid unanticipated shifts (Pai et al., 2021). In early 2020, COVID-19 surfaced in Indonesia, prompting the 
government to proclaim a state of emergency. To combat COVID-19, it is necessary to acquire medical equipment 
via an emergency supply chain (Putra, 2021). Existing frameworks concentrate mostly on effort reduction, but other 
areas, such as consumer health and disease control, may also be enhanced during Covid-19 outbreak (Garzotto et al., 
2021). Risk identification is performed utilizing analytic instruments Using diagram analysis and scatter plot, the 
degree of significance of a crucial risk is determined, such that two high risks, namely the usage of Covid-19 and also

5. Discussion 
Based on the Balanced Scorecard analysis, the engineering division's performance shows that the area that needs to 
be improved is in the internal process perspective on the dimensions of improving stock management with spare parts 
availability indicators, and in the same perspective on the dimensions of increasing order control with order completion 
time indicators. Furthermore, two indicators that need to be addressed from the consumer viewpoint with the goal of 
boosting customer happiness are the delivery time of replacement parts and the time of issue addressing. Failure Mode 
Effect Analysis was used to successfully gather the reasons of the fall in performance indicators, and the performance 
items are now placed in order of importance. It is simpler to get an activity improvement plan from deteriorating 
performance indicators with causality between performance, which can be shown in its effect between positive and 
negative impacts, using the Dynamic Balanced Scorecard. 
 
5.1. Implication 
The contribution of this research is a description of suggestions for performance improvement with a very critical 
point in the analysis of the adequacy of spare parts as a fundamental factor that becomes an important component in 
the strategy where this research is conducted, and of course can be implemented in other places as a reference base 
for the company's strategic plan. The benefit of this research is anticipated to serve as a guide for medical device 
distribution companies, particularly the engineering division, in developing a performance improvement strategy 
during a crisis with the Dynamic Balanced Scorecard. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The performance assessment of the technical division of medical equipment distributors using the balanced scorecard 
viewpoint may be a reference for improvement for other businesses that are comparable, and the limitations of this 
study can be expanded in more research. It was not discovered in the prior literature that the Balanced Scorecard 
method combined with RCA and FMEA resulted in improvements in indicators of the technical division of medical 
equipment distributors. It is hoped that additional research will be carried out which might make the application of 
these techniques more effective. The DBSC model can easily shorten the time it takes to analyze performance 
improvement and can be used right away to adapt to the current situation. unpredictability resulting from elements 
that are present during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.

1. Introduction
Technological Advances created a new phenomenon in the buying and selling process in Indonesia (Octaviani and 
Arief, 2016). As a result of technological advances, many businesspeople including businessmen of courses made 
various innovations so that the products or services offered can be competed with other competitors and can be adapted 
to technological changes. 
Technological changes were used by businessmen of courses to promote their courses on social media. It was because 
the Indonesian population who was active in social media was 59% or 160 million people and spent an average of 3 
hours every day. According to Riyanto (2020), Facebook users in Indonesia in 2020 were 130 million people and 
Instagram users were 63 million people. Based on Haryanto (2019) The highest internet users were at the age of 15-
19, namely at the age of junior high and high school. The use of social media in promoting tutoring requires the right 
strategy so that it can be put to good use. 
In previous research analyzed by Mekawie & Hany ( 2019) that four factors influenced purchase intentions, namely 
attitudes towards social media advertising, celebrity endorsements, company reputation, and Electronic Word of 
Mouth (E-WOM). 
Based on the references above, it showed that the use of social media in the promotion courses was very appropriate. 
This can be seen from user data and user age in Indonesia, the highest was school age, but there were still many 
business people who did not know the factors of effective intention that needed to be considered in marketing their 
courses using social media advertisements.

The Effect of Celebrity Endorsement (X2) on Student Intentions (Y). The results of the above test, celebrity 
endorsement (X2) had a negative effect on student intentions (Y) with a t-value = 0.86. This meant that celebrity 
endorsements had no significant effect on studentts' intention to join courses. Celebrity endorsements did not have a 
positive effect because the factors that influence celebrity endorsements on intentions were not only attractiveness, 
expertise, credibility, and celebrity image in line with the advertised brand image, things that would affect celebrity 
endorsement on student intentions were the experience of advertising stars advertising products, and good knowledge 
of advertised products as well as sincerity and honesty in delivering product information. In addition, differences in 
objects and subjects studied can be also significantly influenced celebrity endorsement or not on students' intentions 
to enroll in courses. 
The Effect of Course Reputation (X3) on Students’ Intentions (Y). From the above test, it was known that the 
Reputation of courses (X3) did not have a positive effect on students' intentions (Y). this meant that the reputation of 
courses had no direct influence on students' intentions to take courses. The negative influence of reputation on 
students’ intentions was because apart from a good name, reputation compared to competitors, widely known, and 
easy to remember was not only factors that affected students' intention. Other reputation factors that would affect 
students' intention were good service, and if something happened so that was not by the wishes of students, the 
company would provide assistance to overcome the problems that occurred. 
Effect of E-WOM (X4) on Students’ Intentions (Y). Based on the test results using the Lisrel 8.80 program above, 
it showed that E-WOM (X4) had a positive influence on students' intentions (Y). This meant that the better the E-
WOM, so that would be the better the students' intention to take courses. This positive influence was by the reasoned 
action theory (TRA Theory) where opinions from other references would affect students' intentions to take courses. 
6. Conclusion  
Based on  the research resulted obtained the conclusions obtained from this study are as follows: From 100 respondents 
were 11-18 years old, 37% of respondents used social media for 1-3 hours/day, and the most widely used social media 
was Tiktok with 28% of users. Furthermore, all variables were valid and reliable, and the analysis model of this study 
met the statistical criteria for the goodness of fit (GOF), then the results of hypothesis testing showed that social media 
advertising and E-WOM had a positive effect on students’ intentions. also, Social media advertisements and E-WOM 
on TikTok were the right tools to increase students' intention joining courses. 
 
The celebrity endorsement variable in the study had a negative effect, so it was necessary to do research by adding an 
indicator of celebrity experience and delivering sincere and honest celebrity information. Moreover, the reputation of 
courses variable in the study had a negative effect so it must be added other indicators for the next research liked the 
best services and tutoring assistance on student problems. Also, this research only focused on courses in Palembang 
City, so it required further research for a wider scope and other research objects.

Abstract 
The term VUCA refers to a volatile, complex, and uncertain environment caused by the new normal. In responding to 
VUCA's volatile environmental conditions, the education sector must adapt to the conditions. Teachers as educators 
must do various ways to achieve teacher performance. Teachers must have innovations to prepare skills that are ready 
to face the changes in the educational sector. This research aims how the competency of teachers in dealing with 21st 
century education through digital competency, the leadership of a teacher towards themself through self-leadership, 
innovative behavior of a teacher through innovative work behavior and its effect on teacher performance with 
quantitative approach. The novelty in this research is the addition of the theory to its application on islamic educational 
sector. Structural equation model (SEM) is applied to assess the model fit and to test the research hypothesis and was 
processed using SmartPls 3. Based on the hypothesis testing, the findings of the study indicates that digital competency 
and innovative work behavior have a positive and significant influence on employee performance. However, self-
leadership does not have a positive and significant influence on employee performance. This is explained with

Abstract 
EMG signal strength measured using Bitalino on the flexor carpi radialis muscle showed that post-stroke patients have 
lower EMG signal strength levels than normal individuals. The time domain extraction feature provides information 
on the average strength of the flexor carpi radialis muscle EMG signal in post-stroke patients as follows, IEMG of 
8,678 microvolts, MAV of 4,338 microvolts, SSI of 16,465 microvolts, VAR of 82,327 microvolts, RMS of 8,515 
microvolts, WL of 592,203 microvolts. The frequency domain extraction features include MNF of 0.064 microvolts 
and MDF of 0.027 microvolts. A stronger grip strength tends to produce a more significant EMG signal. This study 
provides a mapping of a large gap between the EMG signal strength of post-stroke patients and normal individuals 
that can be used as a reference for therapists in providing rehabilitation for post-stroke patients. EMG signals store 
important information regarding muscle condition, so signal recording and processing are crucial. This study utilizes 
Bitalino, which records EMG activity in muscles reliably and precisely. Matlab software is very reliable used for 
filtering, rectification, and smoothing. Bandpass filters with cut-off frequencies below 50 Hz and above 600 Hz are 
used. Smoothing uses Savitz-Golay statistics to obtain a more precise signal.

1. Introduction
A stroke is a condition of a person who experiences disturbances in moving the body. A stroke occurs when brain 
cells die due to obstruction of blood flow to the brain. Blocked blood flow due to damage or blockage of blood vessels. 
Stroke patients find it difficult to do daily activities. Stroke patients can experience death or disability. Stroke leading 
disability and death in the elderly (Hussain and Park 2021). Stroke impacts decreased neurological function for 
millions of people, causes physical disability and dependent lives, and increases the risk of psychological disorders 
that lead to depression (Campbell et al. 2019). An unhealthy lifestyle is a major factor in stroke (Rahmatillah et al. 
2018). Stroke patients become post-stroke after a particular time. Post-stroke patients are dependent on others to 
support daily life and incur high costs in care and rehabilitation 
. 
Stroke patients are predicted to increase to 25-30 sufferers per mile in Indonesia, with a stroke disability rate of 65% 
(Rahmatillah et al. 2018) and an increasing number post-stroke. 50% of post-stroke patients have a unilateral motor 
deficit, which significantly reduces upper limb function (Franck et al. 2019). Functional damage to the limbs causes 
disability and decreases productivity (Karunia 2016).  Post-stroke rehabilitation is urgently needed, along with the 
increasing number of sufferers and disabilities caused by stroke. 
Conventional rehabilitation depends on the therapist's direction. It is assessed subjectively for post-stroke patients and 
requires a long time and high effort, affecting the patient's motivation to decrease (Cai et al. 2019). The therapist must 
be able to detect the post-stroke condition experienced by the patient to carry out rehabilitation appropriately. The

The time domain and frequency domain extraction features indicate the strength of the flexor carpi radialis muscle in 
gripping in post-stroke patients and normal individuals. The IEMG extraction feature shows the grip strength of the 
flexor carpi radialis muscle for post-stroke patients with an average EMG signal value of 8,678 microvolts with the 
strongest EMG signal strength not exceeding 10,703 microvolts. In contrast, the average EMG signal for normal 
individuals is 86,155 microvolts. Normal individual EMG signal strength is nine times stronger based on IEMG 
features. The same thing is shown by the MAV extraction feature, where the average grip strength of the flexor carpi 
radialis muscle in post-stroke patients with an average EMG signal of 4,338 microvolts, while for normal individuals, 
it is 43,056 microvolts, nine times stronger. Shifting to the SSI extraction feature, the flexor carpi radialis muscle hand 
strength for post-stroke patients with an average EMG signal of 16,465 microvolts and normal individuals of 529,701 
microvolts. The strength of the normal individual EMG signal is thirty-two times more. In the VAR feature extraction, 
the EMG signal strength of normal individuals is 32 times stronger than that of post-stroke patients. The RMS and 
WL extraction features showed the same thing, the EMG signal strength of normal individuals was significantly 
stronger than that of post-stroke patients. 
 
The frequency domain extraction feature shows something different: post-stroke patients have weak grip strength 
compared to normal individuals but have higher EMG signals. The EMG signal measured in the MNF extraction 
feature can be seen in post-stroke patients with an average of 0.064 microvolts, while normal individuals are 0.017 
microvolts. Post-stroke patients have four times stronger EMG signals than normal individuals. The MDF extraction 
feature showed a more significant difference, where the EMG signal strength of post-stroke patients averaged 0.027 
microvolts while normal individuals were 0.001 microvolts. Post-stroke patients had twenty-seven times stronger 
EMG signals. 
 
4. Conclusion  
This study shows the grip strength of post-stroke patients with normal individuals has a huge different, normal 
individuals tend to have a much stronger grip strength. Bitalino and Matlab can detect and process EMG signals 
reliably. The grip strength measured in the flexor carpi radialis muscle utilizing EMG signals showed that normal 
individuals tended to be stronger. The time domain feature extraction shows the strong EMG signal produced by the 
flexor carpi radialis muscle in normal individuals showing a stronger EMG signal than in post-stroke patients. 
However, feature extraction with the frequency domain shows the opposite, post-stroke patients tend to have stronger 
EMG signals than normal individuals. 
 
Considering the results of grip strength measurements with a dynamometer and EMG, the subjects with stronger grip 
strength had stronger EMG signals than normal individuals. In post-stroke patients, there are subjects who have more

grip strength but weaker EMG signals. This needs to be investigated further in future studies involving more post-
stroke patients and more rigid inclusion criteria.

Abstract 
The formulation of tourism sector policies is important in achieving the development goals of the tourism sector. This 
study aims to formulate appropriate policies for the development of the tourism sector in Padang, Indonesia. 
Respondents in the study were visitors to marine tourism destinations consisting of three islands in the city of Padang, 
namely Sirandah Island, Pasumpahan Island, and Sironjong Island. The data analysis method is Importance 
Performance Analysis (IPA). IPA is used to measure the level of tourist satisfaction with the performance of the 
tourism sector on Sirandah Island, Pasumpahan Island, and Sironjong Island on the Service Quality component. Based 
on the results of the study of the four quadrant matrix values, it was concluded that the component of tourism policy 
in quadrant IV or improvement priority is information on tourist visitors because the quality of information service 
performance is not satisfactory. However, based on the data in quadrant II, which is a policy that needs to be 
maintained, it was found that visitors to the tourist attraction were very satisfied. The government and related agencies 
and stakeholders must maintain the service quality attributes that are in this quadrant. So it can be recommended that 
the marine tourism development policy of the city of Padang is to make improvements in the form of tangibles 
instruments; adding rides and tourist facilities that attract tourists and maintain better peace and comfort. Reliability 
instruments that need to be improved are providing directions and providing marine tourism applications that contain 
supporting information.

Abstract 
This research is a type of descriptive research with a quantitative approach. The purpose of this study is to determine 
the user satisfaction of TIX ID application in terms of e-service quality which consists of seven dimensions, namely 
efficiency, fulfillment, system availability, privacy, responsiveness, compensation, and contact which will be seen 
based on the level of importance and level of performance that has been given. The data analysis method used in this 
study is Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA). This study was conducted with all Indonesian citizens with a 
minimum age of 18 years old that have used or using the TIX ID application, with a total sample of 413 respondents. 
Based on the Cartesian Diagram of Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA), the TIX ID application does not have 
attributes that are in the main improvement priority (Quadrant I), seven attributes that must be maintained (Quadrant 
II), seven attributes with low priority (Quadrant III), seven attributes with low priority (Quadrant III), and two 
attributes with a level of performance that exceeds the level of importance (Quadrant IV). The satisfaction level of 
users of the TIX ID application based on e-service quality is 95.26%. Based on the result of descriptive analysis, it is 
shown that the value of the user expectations (importance) is greater with 88.67% compared to the value of 
perceptions/reality (performance) with a percentage of 84.58%. There are seven attributes that have the highest gaps 
that are included in Quadrant III. In addition, all 16 attributes on the dimensions of the e-service quality variable in 
this study all have negative value gaps, so that all attributes still do not fully meet user expectations. 
Keywords:

1. Introduction
Apart from PCs, laptops, TVs, and others, the use of the internet is inseparable from the use of mobile (cellular). 
According to data from We Are Social, Hootsuite, cellular connections in Indonesia as of January 2021 have reached 
345.3 million. The use of mobile connection is inseparable from using a mobile application. According to the data, 
people in Indonesia use their cellular connections to use various mobile applications, one of which is the entertainment 
and video apps category which occupies the third position with an acquisition of 86.2% of the most used mobile apps 
every month in Indonesia as of January 2021. 
One of applications that is in the entertainment & video apps category is an application for booking cinema tickets

(with a gap of -0.15). Although the performances of these attributes need to be maintained, these attributes still do not 
fully meet user expectation & satisfaction because they still have negative values (gaps). 
And then the attributes that are in Quadrant III are SA1 item code (with a gap of -0.35), RES1 (with a gap of -0.29), 
RES2 (with a gap of -0.28), COM1 (with a gap of -0.19), COM2 (with a gap of -0.29), CON1 (with a gap of -0.28), 
and CON2 (with a gap of -0.26). Although they have low importance, these attributes also do not fully meet the 
expectations & satisfaction of users because they still have negative values (gaps) and have low performances. 
Then for Quadrant IV there are attributes with an item code of EFF1 (with a gap of -0.10) and SA2 item code (with a 
gap of -0.16). Although it has a higher performance compared to the level of importance, this can also be a supporting 
factor for the company (Hatta, H. & Rumahorbo, S. G. R., 2021). This indicates that the performance is above user 
expectations. There could be good reasons to continue the performance/maintain these attributes (Martilla, J. A. & 
James, J. C., 1977). Although they have high performance with a low level of importance, these two attributes also 
still do not meet user expectations & satisfaction because they still have negative values (gaps). 
6. Conclusion & Suggestions
6.1 Conclusion 
The average level of user importance/expectation falls into the ""very important"" category with a percentage of 88.67%. 
While the average level of performace/perception/reality falls in to the “very good” category with a percentage of 
84.58%. This shows that users already feel that the quality of electronic services on the TIX ID application is very 
good, but still has not met the level of user expectations. The user satisfaction rate of the TIX ID application is 95.26% 
(<100%).  All dimensions of the e-service quality variable have a Level of Conformity below 100%.  All 16 attributes 
in the dimensions of the e-service quality variable have negative values (<1). Thus, the work of the TIX ID application 
has not met the satisfaction and / expectations of users. However, it is indicated that there is no attribute that is in 
Quadrant I (top improvement priority). There are 7 attributes in Quadrant II, namely EFF2; EFF3; EFF4; FUL1; FUL2; 
PRI2; and PRI2. There are 7 attributes in Quadrant III, namely SA1; RES1; RES2; COM1; COM2; CON1; and CON2. 
Then in Quadrant IV there are 2 attributes, namely EFF1 and SA2.  
6.2 Suggestions 
Based on the results of the Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) diagram on the TIX ID application, according to 
Hatta, H. & Rumahorbo, S. G. R. (2021), if it does not have attribute that is in Quadrant I, then the author advises 
companies to make improvements to attribute that is in Quadrant III. After Quadrant I, Quadrant III is also a quadrant 
which is considered important for customers and requires improved performance so that customers feel satisfied 
(Hatta, H. & Rumahorbo, S. G. R., 2021). Therefore, TIX ID could do the following things to improve these attributes 
to increase user satisfaction: 
•
It is recommended that the TIX ID application improve the performance of its application so that it
does not error when it comes to making online booking, opening the e-ticket’s booking code, toping
up the e-money, and doing the transaction.
•
It is recommended that TIX ID increase the speed in responding to user complaints so that the user’s
time does not waste much in waiting for a response from TIX ID.
•
It is recommended that TIX ID improve the ability regarding a compensation to those who should
get their rights if something goes wrong from TIX ID.
•
It is recommended that TIX ID solve the problem more effectively and not responding to the same
answer repeatedly according to user complaints, so it does not waste time and the problem is
immediately resolved properly.
•
It is recommended that TIX ID application does not use bots (automatic messages) too often when
communicating with users. The bots could be used only to give greetings and ask for user
complaints.
•
It is recommended that TIX ID put the link of the official TIX ID website on TIX ID's Tiktok and
Instagram accounts (because TIX ID’s contact information such as telephone numbers, Help Center,
and Consumer Complaints Service are available on the website).

The author suggests to subsequent researchers to be able to collect more complete and specific data about the TIX ID 
application and develop the attributes of statements and replace or add research variables other than e-service quality 
to make it more diverse. In addition, the author also suggests in subsequent studies to be able to use other methods or 
add other methods besides Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) such as Quality Function Deployment (QFD), 
Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI), Kano, Delon & McLean Success Model, etc.

Abstract 
In today’s market issues, competitions between industries are highly inevitable. Strategic planning must really be 
considered and one of these is by improving the reliability of the products. It was also known that burn-in process has 
a great impact towards having this kind of plan. In this paper, the researchers will have to determine the burn-in period 
based on the reliability target for product failure rates under Weibull distribution. In doing this, the methodology has 
been designed by analysing the properties of the functions of reliability. Conditional reliability was used to know the 
time T0 which indicates as burn-in time that will best fit into the reliability target. The researchers incorporated the 
Weibull distribution to this computation to specify the kind of behavior of the failure rates. Moreover, numerical 
examples were also used to prove how this process works in a certain scenario.

1. Introduction
In an economy where the competition is high and every player wants to acquire as much market share as possible, 
satisfying the customer is an essential part. This is especially true in the technology industry. According to Deloitte 
Touche Tohmatsu organization (2013), technology companies around the world are confronted with growing 
competition from adjacent and overseas markets and the accelerating pace of various technologies.    
Moreover, one of the methods of approaching the question of customer satisfaction is through improvements of the 
reliability of the product. There are many ways to improve the reliability of a product or component; one of them is to 
undergo burn-in process. According to Kuo and Kim (1999), burn-in is an accelerated life test that subjects units to 
higher than usual levels of stress like voltage, temperature and loading to speed up the deterioration of materials to 
collect failure information more quickly.  
Although burn-in is effective in eliminating defective units before they reach the customers, it also constitutes costs. 
Over application of burn-in will cause higher reliability. Manufacturing companies must be able to determine the 
minimal burn-in period to also minimize the burn-in cost. This will not only cause them ample savings but keep them 
competitive in the market.

Furthermore, it can be seen in the Table 5 above that as the reliability target increases, the burn-in time or period gets 
longer. 
4. Conclusion 
Determining the required burn-in period is essential in improving the reliability if the outgoing product reliability 
cannot meet the reliability target. Not only it helps in achieving the reliability goal, it also minimizes the cost of burn-
in through limiting the burn-in period to the necessary time. 
 
In this study, the researchers first established the difference between the reliability and conditional reliability. 
Reliability is the probability that the product will perform its specific functions for a certain period of time after 
undergoing some predefined period of time and check operational and its functions. 
Moreover, the researchers were able to show when the predefined period of time i.e. burn-in time in this study will be 
beneficial or not by getting the derivative of the conditional probability. Since the derivative represented the slope or 
the change of reliability over time t after the burn-in period 𝑇𝑇0, its value should be positive, the failure rate must be a 
decreasing function with respect to time. 
For the constant and increasing failure rate function, the slope of the derivative of 𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡|𝑇𝑇0) is equal to zero and less 
than one respectively. Therefore, having a burn-in test for products that have constant or increasing failure rate will 
not improve reliability. The case is different for increasing failure rate because it will have a negative effect on the 
reliability. 
After this, the researchers provided a numerical example to determine the required burn-in time to achieve certain 
reliability targets. The Median Ranks method was used to estimate the proportion of failure to the population. These 
values were then transformed into a straight line by getting the double natural logarithmic of the equation. 
Furthermore, the Weibull shape and scale parameters were estimated. This was done using the ReliaSoft Weibull ++.  
These values were then substituted to the conditional probability equation to get the required burn-in period to achieve 
certain reliability targets. 
5. Recommendations 
To further improve this study, the researchers give the following recommendations: 
1. Use different methods in estimating the Weibull parameters and see if there are any significant 
differences. 
2. Use a bigger sample size or better yet apply this method to an actual case study. 
3. Determine the burn-in time for other distribution such as Log Normal. 
4. Consider censored data and adjust the data based on the censoring. 
5. Use of industrial burn-in data to track product failure rate before burn-in and to compare product field 
reliability with reliability target after burn-in test.

Abstract 
A coal-mining and trading company in Indonesia annually fulfills the demand for Domestic Market Obligations for 
the public interest power generation industry. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources policy for coal 
entrepreneurs in Indonesia mandates that Indonesian coal producers meet 25 percent of the annual production plan for 
the domestic market. This policy has set the selling price of coal for the power generation industry for public use at 
$70 per metric ton. Indonesian coal business owners must follow the policy if they do not want to be banned from 
export. Due to higher production costs than the set selling price, this policy is hazardous to the company's bottom line. 
Losses in the company can be reduced through actions taken by the company. Based on root cause analysis using the 
Current Reality Tree method, the planning of coal blending was found to be ineffective. Since the user still plans the 
coal blending using intuition and the user's limited knowledge of methods that can optimize these activities. As a 
result, companies can reduce production costs by optimizing these plans. The linear programming method is used to 
solve the problem because it can minimize production costs by allocating the amount of coal mixed from the nine coal 
types available at the company and considering the buyer's quality requirements. After implementing the linear 
programming method, the total production cost is optimize and meets all product specifications required by the buyer.

1. Introduction
Coal is one of the fossil fuels widely used for production processes such as the power generation industry, the cement 
industry, and other industries. Coal is in demand by businesspeople because of its affordable price, abundant 
availability, and high heat content. Based on data from BP's Statistical Review of World Energy 2021, the total world 
coal consumption globally reached 151.42 exajoules in 2020. Coal consumption continues to increase yearly, and the 
post-pandemic world economic recovery is also one of the causes of growing world coal demand. The high demand 
for coal has led to increased coal prices since 2021 because many countries are experiencing a coal supply crisis, so 
coal commodity prices have increased dramatically. The high cost of coal commodities benefits Indonesian coal 
mining companies that carry out export activities and take advantage of this momentum to increase their export sales. 
However, on the other hand, Indonesian coal companies must meet domestic coal needs, namely Domestic Market 
Obligations. Referring to the Decree of the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources of the Republic of Indonesia 
139.K.HK.02/MEM.B/2021 concerning the Fulfillment of Domestic Coal Needs, it is regulated that Indonesian coal
companies must first fulfill a Domestic Market Obligation (DMO) of 25% of the planned annual production (general

Table 3 shows the blending result if company using Linear Programming in optimized total production cost can meet 
the buyer's request with the desired quality specifications and low total production costs, which is $639,331.51. For 
example, buyer 1 wants coal as much as 48,000 MT with GAR specifications in the range of 4,350 cal/g to 4,450 cal/g 
and total sulfur in the field of 0.8% to 1% and the results of the blending show that the coal will have a calorific value 
of 4,450 cal/g and sulfur content of 0.8% are same with the contract that has been made. So, it can be said that with 
the new method, company still fulfill buyer demand based on contract with total production cost that has been 
optimized. 
6. Conclusion
In answering the research question to optimize production cost in meeting the demand for Domestic Market 
Obligations (DMO) coal, a root cause analysis has been carried out related to the business issue. Thus, this study has 
produced a production cost minimization model for coal allocation in the coal blending process to meet buyer demands 
by considering the desired quality specifications, namely the calorific value and sulfur content contained in the coal. 
From this research, it is obtained an optimization mathematical model that can be used by coal company in planning 
blending coal to minimize production costs to reduce company losses in meeting DMO requests. The proposed model 
has been verified and validated to minimize production costs while still meeting the buyer's desired quality 
specifications. So, it can be concluded is better to use the proposed model because the model that has been designed 
has been verified and validated to minimize the total production cost while still considering the needs of the buyer in 
accordance with the allocation and specifications of the desired coal quality. Companies must continue to prioritize 
customer satisfaction by providing quality coal according to buyer’s request and on time.

Abstract 
Coronavirus is a global disease triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS -COV-2). The virus has put 
the globe's public health in danger and affected the global economy since it first appeared in Wuhan, China in 
November 2019 and speedily spread to Europe and other parts of the universe. Confirmed cases of the pandemic 
infection according to WHO (2022) as of the 7th of August 2022 stood at 589,246,575 with about 6,436,274 reported 
cases of deaths. The world’s gross domestic product also experienced a decline of about 6.7 percent in 2020 due to 
the covid-19 pandemic outbreak. The global real estate sector was not left out as the industry also faces similar 
challenges in different ways, and despite the general optimism about curtailing the impact of the pandemic, it yet 
remains a risk to economic growth and stabilization of the real estate industry. This paper, hence, undertakes a serious 
analysis of the literature and presents the findings of various studies on the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the 
real estate industry, and suggests appropriate measures to adopt against similar emergency health challenges in the 
future that could endanger the industry’s survival. Documentary pieces of evidence were obtained from various 
secondary sources related to the issue and were reviewed accordingly. The findings of this study as obtained from the 
literature revealed that the covid-19 pandemic has had a significant detrimental effect on the real estate industry and 
remains a risk to the stabilization of the industry. The study, therefore, suggests that industry players should act fast 
in adopting various digital technologies appropriate to real estate practices as well as the need for business 
diversification to save the industry from a state of vulnerability in case of future emergencies or challenges.

1. Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome that causes coronavirus is a worldwide disease (SARS -COV-2). The global 
economy has been coping with the deadly epidemic since its initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and 
following the World Health Organization's (WHO) pronouncement of it as a Public Health Emergency International 
Concern on the 30th of January 2020 and thereafter as a pandemic on the 1st of March 2020 due to its rapid and 
widespread spread in Europe, the United States, and later to the rest of the world. According to WHO (2022), as of 
August 7th, there were 589,246,575 confirmed instances of the pandemic infection, with around 6,436,274 
documented cases of mortality. The epidemic severely had a distressing stimulus on people's lives and businesses 
across the universe, forcing a strict lockdown on numerous industries for several months and affecting a much bigger 
portion of the global population leading to about 7.7 million jobs lost in the US leisure and hospitality sector alone as 
at April 2020 submission of the US job reports (Fortmueller, 2021).  
The consequences of the COVID-19 contagions, according to Milcheva (2021), caused a foremost waning in the global 
gross domestic product (GDP) of around 4.16 percent in the year 2020. Similarly, based on an advance evaluation 
revelation made by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the second quarter of 2020, Ling, Wang, and Zhou (2020) 
found that the real gross domestic product has likewise decreased annually, at a pace of around 32.9 percent. According 
to pundits, the real estate industry was almost on the edge of impending instability and a condition of acute 
vulnerability because of the pandemic’s effects (Uchehara et al., 2020).

4. The Way Forward 
Even though the epidemic has had a detrimental impact on real estate companies' returns, it has been found that 
businesses with a larger worldwide footprint and more regionally diverse property allocations have done better 
throughout the pandemic period. The study therefore strongly endorsed business diversification strategies as a means 
of reducing not only the adverse stock market reactions brought on by the pandemic but also foreclosing any future 
unanticipated health emergencies that might influence the effectiveness of the real estate industry. 
 
Second, a paradigm shift is necessary in the way real estate business is done, especially considering the knowledge-
driven economy's current state of affairs and the emerging world's emphasis on technical innovation, complexity, and 
creativity in real estate practices. Players in the real estate business must be proactive in embracing innovative 
technological applications that are aligned with the real estate practice such as the application software, geographic 
information systems (GIS), drone technology, wireless sensor networks, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 
virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain technology, Internet of Things (IoT), among others, as a way 
of preventing covid-19 pandemics and future emergency health and related shocks and to as well raise the level of 
practice and ensure global competitiveness. 
 
When marketing real estate assets to clients for either rental or sale, the real estate practice must avoid face-to-face 
interactions. Industry participants, particularly those in emerging nations, should fully adapt to internet platforms 
including social media, 3-D virtual home tours, and the development of websites for marketing and conducting other 
company operations. Business clients and real estate brokers may now efficiently and successfully assess properties 
without physically visiting them thanks to the availability of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).  
 
The sector needs a post-Covid recovery plan as well so that it can easily stabilize the market and expand more quickly, 
responsibly, effectively, and sustainably. The actors in the industry need to think strategically, be adaptable and 
dynamic to changes that will improve the quality of practice and improve their efficiency by rarely relying on the 
conventional way of doing things but also by being willing to learn new and relevant skills that will add value to the 
practice and make them true professionals. 
As a final point, it is urgently necessary for real estate companies and their employees to undergo training and 
retraining to improve their professional knowledge and acquire the necessary skills in compliance with worldwide 
norms and best practices. 
 
5. Conclusion and Implication of the study 
The study has analyzed a significant amount of pertinent literature regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its 
consequences on the real estate market. It has also made recommendations for how to mitigate these negative effects. 
Results from the different studies we've evaluated have revealed that the pandemic has had a detrimental influence on 
the real estate sector, with very few studies revealing mixed findings. Most of the literature has shown how the 
pandemic has hurt sales of residential, commercial, and retail real estate. Numerous studies found that the lack of 
mobility for people and capital led to falling real estate values and a decline in investment. According to the reports, 
several residential complexes no longer had as much demand from prospective buyers. Renters and the real estate 
supply chain thus felt the effects of the pandemic. 
 
It has been shown that travel restrictions and bans have seriously harmed real estate deals, particularly those involving 
shops, offices, and hotels, in many different countries throughout the world while impeding tourism. Like this, many 
people in the business lost their jobs both temporarily and permanently, and a significant number of international real 
estate enterprises' profits and stock were reported to have similarly decreased in various countries. Project deadlines, 
costs, and market expansion were similarly affected by the epidemic, as reported in the literature. The review also 
shows that the epidemic has caused a significant shift in investors' preferences, with real estate development and 
construction investment possibilities shifting to better individual health and well-being. 
 
A review of the literature also showed that, in comparison to those in the US and other developed nations, the real 
estate markets in China and other Asian countries were less negatively impacted. This could be connected to the 
various response strategies employed by Asian businesses, which could differ from those in the US and other parts of 
the world. Despite all the bad headlines about the pandemic's effects on the real estate industry, a few studies found 
that the epidemic had a favorable effect on certain segments of the industry.

The study's findings will be helpful to practicing estate surveyors and valuers, real estate firms, and real estate 
researchers in addition to serving as a solid source of information for academics studying real estate management. In 
conclusion, the study has made a substantial contribution to the body of knowledge by presenting the results of many 
studies in regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the real estate business. There were also helpful 
recommendations that will aid the industry participants in creating a practical strategy that will shield the real estate 
sector from any sort of vulnerability should any unforeseen challenges arise in the future.  
The study's conclusion made a solid case for the real estate sectors' change and survival in light of the uncertainty. 
Therefore, in a knowledge-based, competitive economy, innovation is the main driving factor. A part of innovation is 
the development of new perspectives, strategies, and more efficient alternate methods of doing things.

Abstract 
The present study aims to determine whether there are differences in the preferences of the category groups on the 
packaging in the food industry. The data collection was conducted by distributing online questionnaires through social 
media to respondents who had profiles by those determined by their qualifications. The number of respondent data 
that has been collected is 148 respondents. The research method used is a comparative quantitative method with the 
Kruskal Wallis test. The results reveal several important insights. Female gender characteristics have different 
preferences in all packaging design assessments of packaging no 4. Income characteristics with a scale of IDR 
3,000,000-5,000,000 have different preferences in ratings 1 and 2 of packaging no 1. Age characteristics with a scale> 
35 years have different preferences in all packaging design ratings on packaging no 2. In the selection of suitable 
packaging colors, there is no significant difference between each group. Pastel orange is the color that respondents 
consider most suitable for the packaging. The research insight can be used as references for companies in the food 
industry and the theoretical findings in better understanding the consumers.

1. Introduction
The role of Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is undoubtedly influencing the sustainability of the economy in many 
countries, including Indonesia majorly. SMEs tried to provide innovative offerings to attract consumers in tight 
competition, such as technology, promos, and visual uniqueness (Susmonowati and Royani, 2020; Wallenburg et al, 
2021). One of the considerations is the packaging. Packaging is the physical form where the consumers will be exposed 
first to a product. The same kind of meal will have different popularity and average sales in the food industry because 
the company can attract consumers. Further, the packaging itself can be considered as the value proposition offered 
by the SMEs to differentiate with other competitors. Some companies even use unique packaging for each of their 
products. Previous studies reveal how the packaging will differentiate consumer preferences (Klaiman et al., 2016; 
Ogba and Johnson, 2010). In the packaging dimension, many aspects can be elaborated to improve the impression to 
consumers. Few of the highlighted are colors and shapes. Although many pieces of evidence study discuss the colors 
and shapes of packaging (Swasty et al., 2021; Vladić et al., 2015), scientists are still struggling to find the suitable 
composition to attract the consumers maximally. While few big companies can show their identities like Apple and 
Microsoft, the situation is different with SMEs. The present study reveals the consumers' preferences regarding colors 
and shapes for the food industry. By understanding the insight of colors and shapes, the SMEs food industry can 
improve its packaging to attract consumers more.
1.1 Objectives 
The research objective of this paper is to know the preferences of consumers in terms of colors and shapes. The result 
contributes to theoretical and practical aspects for engaging better with consumers' preferences. The result can also 
help the food industry prepare the packaging composition based on their value proposition in response to consumer 
preferences.

The packaging color research was carried out because packaging plays a crucial role in communicating with 
customers. The colors proposed as choices are pastel pink, pastel orange, pastel purple, pastel blue, and white. There 
are no significant differences in the five packaging colors chosen in this research for the three characteristics of the 
respondent's profile. Men and women on an age scale of 17 - >35 years with an income of IDR 1,000,000 -> 9,000,000 
have the same preference for the color of the packaging. The packaging color of pastel orange was the most chosen 
choice by the respondents, with a frequency of 56 people. As for the color that the respondents chose the least, it was 
white with a frequency of 7 people. Based on the analysis conducted by the researcher, respondents thought that the 
orange color was more suitable for sweet potato donuts, which described the color of the sweet potato itself. So most 
likely, researchers will develop product packaging by taking pastel orange as the primary color of the enterprise 
packaging. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
The researcher's data analysis shows that the packaging category 1 group with white color has the lowest ranking 
order. The fifth order with the frequency of respondents who choose in that order is 57 people. The first order is 
packaging design 5, a pastel orange color with the frequency of respondents choosing as many as 47 people in that 
order. Several groups have different preferences for the form of packaging design. The female gender category group 
has different preferences on packaging design 4, the income category group of IDR 3,000,000 5,000,000 has different 
preferences on packaging design 1, and the > 35-year-old category group has different preferences on packaging 
design 2. Several things affect the differences in preferences of each group of respondents, namely the ways of thinking 
of men and women are different, income that affects different living environments, and generations with different 
perspectives and tastes. 
 
Based on the research results that have been carried out, the enterprise made several decisions as follows: 1) the female 
gender category group prefers packaging design 4, which means the enterprise must develop a packaging design four 
because 60% of the enterprise's consumers are women. 2) the income category group on a scale of Rp.3,000,000-
5,000,000 has different preferences for packaging design 1. The income category group has a preference if the 
packaging design 1 is a packaging that seems expensive and classy and is suitable for sweet potato donut products. 
However, because the enterprise wants to develop packaging designs and colors that are more attractive to consumers, 
preferences from the income category of IDR 3,000,000 - 5,000,000 will be stored as a database of consumers satisfied 
with the current 80 enterprise packages. 3) the age category group >35 years has different preferences for packaging 
design two which is shaped like pizza packaging. The enterprise will include packaging design 2 as another option 
because the enterprise consumers with an age scale of >35 years are in the percentage of less than 20%. 4) pastel 
orange color will be taken as the following enterprise packaging design color because most of the respondents chose 
that color as a packaging color that matches the enterprise products. The first thing that can be followed up for the 
enterprise's development and growth regarding packaging design is to hold discussions with partners. The discussion 
is related to packaging design 4, which follows the preferences of the female gender category, whose percentage is 
more than half of the enterprise's consumers. Then after a joint decision is made, the packaging will be made. 4. After 
the packaging is made, it will be executed by conducting a market test, which will be used as product packaging based 
on the preorder made. From the market test, consumers will be given a questionnaire regarding the new enterprise 
packaging, and if from the questionnaire, the packaging does not meet consumer expectations, further research will 
be carried out on which parts are not suitable and which target segment feels the packaging not suitable. However, the 
researcher will not immediately decide to re-create the packaging from the research results but will focus on more 
detailed follow-up research on packaging design. With the packaging design research that has been carried out, it is 
hoped that the enterprise can develop product packaging that is suitable for Cilembu sweet potato donuts, which look 
expensive and classy and are able to attract consumer buying interest based on the characteristics of the target segment 
of the enterprise. The expected research is to be input that can support the growth of the enterprise's business in terms 
of packaging. Further, it will come following consumers' expectations in developing the enterprise's business. 
  
Recommendations that the author can give for similar businesses that are also engaged in the bakery sector are the 
first. As a businessman in the bakery sector, the packaging is an important thing that must be designed as attractively 
as possible to attract consumers' attention other than the product's function. Sometimes many businesspeople in the 
bakery sector think that plastic packaging and logo stamps are enough as long as the products they make are delicious. 
The color and the design of the packaging are essential to attract consumers. Second, segmentation must be clearly 
and precisely defined based on the research results conducted by researchers. Gender groups, income scales, and ages 
have different preferences for several packaging designs but have the same preference for the color of the packaging

Abstract 
Tourism to heritage locations is something that is often found in Indonesia. The trend of changing the function of old 
houses into various functions, including restaurants, is a thing that is rife in big cities in Indonesia. This adaptive reuse 
approach build harmonizes between human being and history, and also between past-present-and future. This study 
aims to explore the responses of visitors regarding the design of the function conversion of the old house of Rumah 
Macaroni Panggang, in Bogor city, Indonesia. Quantitative research design specifically in descriptive study was 
applied to this study with online survey technic for data collection. The participants were given nostalgic memory 
inducing via photos. The finding showed that visitors gave nostalgic memories responses to various building elements 
in this place. More than half of the visitors showed willingness to revisit this restaurant. The nostalgic response 
encourages them to do it which means it has an impact on economic value. This study gave implication on harmonize 
between human being and history, and past-present-and future through adaptive reuse building approach.

1. Introduction
Eating is an activity that humans do every day and require facilities to support it. Activities eat not only fulfil the needs 
of hunger, but there is a meaning value related to the human conditions prevailing in the society. The habit of eating 
together becomes a tradition that takes place in almost all cultures in the world, which takes place in the private area 
and public space. Food is not only a necessity, but also conveys a symbolic message. Thus, through the dining room 
as a public space can be revealed various things related to the social class of visitors (Fajarwati, Koesoemadinata, and 
Sondakh 2019). The times led to changes in the activities of eating in public space and not more activity only take 
place in the home. Humans getting busy so less time to cook, and also the distance between home and work are far 
apart, allowing a communal dining activity done outside the house. Warde and Martens (2000) reveal that the 
emergence of special places to eat out, especially places that offer food choices and not just a limited menu, is a 20th 
century innovation. The evolution of dining out as a spare time activity is a feature that was discovered in the last 
hundred years. Appearing later restaurants increasingly prevalent to meet human needs to eat together outside the

Based on Table. 5, the result showed that more than 50% of participants have intention to revisit Rumah Macaroni 
Panggang (from quite intent to revisit up to very high intent to revisit). The old design of the building which trigger 
nostalgia, could give economic value to this place. The intention to revisit this place means that the restaurant has 
economic raising potential. This finding has similar result with Lee (2015) and Chen et al. (2014). Food and ambience 
in this study could become good aspects for increasing nostalgia. Then the nostalgia motivate person to reorder for 
consume in this restaurant (Hwang and Hyun 2012). Obviously, it could give positive impact to the owner.  
 
The personal emotion cannot directly influence memorable experiences at reconstructed heritage sites, the site’s owner 
can provide authentic decoration and finishing interior to enhance the visitor’s nostalgia. The purpose of heritage 
sustainability could be facilitating by these strategies, that enhance memorable experiences amongst visitors and may 
increase the revisit intention (Lee 2015). Nostalgia experience is the emergence of a ""sense"" that is generated through 
various things around the individual, one of the triggers is the existence of interior elements in a space that can be 
captured by sensory input aspects consisting of visual, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Customer pleasure in the 
restaurants can be generated by utilizing the significant impact of personal nostalgia. Hiatus plays an important role 
in the relationship between nostalgia and pleasant customer responses. Nostalgia triggers a pleasant response at a 
higher level about their experience in the restaurant, over time after the restaurant visit (Hwang and Hyun 2013). 
Nostalgia has impacts on consumption intention and varies depending on the individual. The younger customers have 
considerations related to prices, so we need important considerations in utilizing nostalgia in marketing (Chen et al. 
2014). 
 
Promotion purpose can achieve with keep the old building design besides special menus or foods. The participants of 
this study were people with large range of age, from young generation to old generation. The mean of the age showed 
that majority of the participants was young people that give evidence old fashioned style building is relevant to them. 
The colonialism design was successful to trigger positive nostalgia amongst visitors. It is relevant with Hwang and 
Hyun (2013) that nostalgia could raise with perception of nostalgic experience (colonialism history), sensory inputs 
(food, aroma, exterior and interior design) and memorable events which is individualized experience. The authors did 
not measure life satisfaction which it could trigger by nostalgia (Ya, Ng, and Lam 2018). Nostalgia could give impact 
to elevate the present and future life satisfaction. People with low past life satisfaction, after triggering their nostalgia, 
they will have greater present and future life satisfaction. It becomes limitation of this study 
 
The adaptive reuse of the house into a restaurant resulted in changes to the interior design space suit current activity. 
Creativity required in processing the element interior parts that are retained or to be removed, in association with 
nostalgia and effective use of space. Interior elements  of the ancient restaurant area that were captured by visual 
sensory inputs became the most powerful trigger in causing nostalgia because in general there has not been much 
change since it was founded (Sasi et al. 2019). In an amount of important consumer behavioral responses, nostalgia 
with a suggested differing influence being recognized as different form with personal nostalgia. As nostalgia has 
potent advertising appeal, it is also used ordinarily. This also increases accuracy in forecasting customer feedback 
(Marchegiani and Phau 2013). The purpose of this restaurant interior processing is to attract visitors to be able to enjoy 
the ambience of a comfortable dining place and make them interested to come back to visit the restaurant again. 
Utilization of the function shift will eventually become a profitable sale. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The adaptive reuse building with old fashioned design, could trigger nostalgia amongst the visitors and give impact to 
intention revisit this old design-reuse building. As long as heritage buildings have building constructions that can still 
be explored and processed for new functions that can be economically and socially beneficial and do not harm the 
environment, adaptive reuse is the best option. Through adaptive reuse, managers can take advantage of the nostalgia 
value stored in buildings. Nostalgia raises motivation for people to reorder or consumption and this give positive side 
for economic value. Restaurant with its old design was proven attractive all generations, from young to old 
generations. Referring to this, reuse building with its old design could be a promotion tool for gaining visitors to come.  
For future research, it is suggested to measure the life satisfaction changing related to interior and exterior design of 
the building, as well as the stress level reduce after visiting the place (Sedikides and Wildschut 2020).

Abstract 
Supply chain management in food industry comprises stakeholders to achieve goals. Supplier performance need to be 
evaluated to control the supply chain product quality and performance. This study aims to evaluate supplier 
performance and provide recommendation to improve the performance. A data envelopment analysis (DEA) and 
Pearson correlation are adopted to analyze supplier performance and provided recommendation for further 
improvement. This study defined five supplier performance criteria, involving raw material price, customer care and 
responsiveness, raw material quality, perfect order fulfilment and on-time delivery performance to evaluate suppliers 
at the food industry in the last three months. From 216 data pairs of supplier criteria, it showed that 61.1% of the 
supplier had inefficient performance where the rest were efficient. Looking for the result, this study suggested to 
improve raw material price and perfect order fulfilment immediately to produce significant impact to supplier 
performance and food industry’s competitive advantages. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Supply chain management and operations comprises all stakeholders to achieve supply chain goals. Chopra and 
Meindl (2013) stated that supply chain operation is not only pay attention into factory, but also it must consider 
transportation, distribution, marketing, strategy even upstream and downstream parts. In the normal process, scholars 
agree that factory is the main actors or focal stakeholder of the supply chain (Asrol et al. 2020; Ganeshkumar et al. 
2017), moreover the upstream and downstream stakeholder are also need to provide services to enhance supply chain 
performance in the supply chain’s goal achievements. 
In the first business process in supporting supply chain operations, supplier holds an important role to delivers a high-
quality raw material. After that, the raw materials are processed at the factory using specific processing flow and 
standard. The processed raw materials are transformed into a value-added product to fulfill consumer demands. It is 
also confirmed that the importance of raw materials in performing high and value-added products. In this situation, a 
supplier holds an important role to ensure the quality of raw materials to performs high quality products with specific 
standards to process at the industry. Besides that, a routine supplier performance analysis and evaluation may minimize 
potential risk along supply chain and find risk mitigation activities, as proposed by Prahinski and Fan (2020) to provide 
supplier development programs and incentives for performance improvement. Despite the importance of supplier role 
in the supply chain, this research discusses the supplier selection and evaluation topics. 
Supplier selection and evaluation has been largely discussed in the literature, moreover this study offers a new 
approach to enhancing the impact to supply chain and firm performance. The number of methods in supplier selection 
and evaluations has grown extensively since the complexity of decision making and supplier analysis in industry (De 
Boer 2001). Generally, the supplier selection and evaluation method is divided into two parts, qualitative and 
quantitative (Banaeian et al. 2018). In the qualitative approach, scholars define indicators with theoretical testing using 
statistical approach, as found in Kim et al. (2020); Maestrini et al. (2018) and Salam (2019). In the quantitative 
approach, scholars applied various quantitative technique supported by secondary data, as found in Akyüz Tosun and 
Aka, (2018); Cavalcante et al., (2019); Tong et al., (2020); and Wahyudi, (2022). In the last two decades, methods in

4. Conclusion 
Supplier evaluation in food industry holds an important role to maintain supply chain performance. Previous research 
had explored supplier performance using qualitative and quantitative approach with various techniques and tools. This 
study found that the previous analysis is limited supplier performance measurement with no further explorations the 
impact of criteria to supply chain performance. To define supplier performance, it needs supplier criteria definition 
which was adopted from literature review. This study has explored five supplier criteria involving raw material price, 
customer care and responsiveness, raw material quality, perfect order fulfilment and on time delivery performance to 
evaluate supplier performance. A food supply chain that must ensure high quality product with food security standard 
is adopted for supplier performance analysis. Suppliers of food supply chain are evaluated during the last three months 
with 216 data pairs. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to evaluate supply chain performance. The result 
show that most of the supplier performance are inefficient and only 38.8% are efficient. Further, a statistical approach 
is provided to further improvement in supplier performance which is focused on supplier indicators. Based on 
statistical analysis this research recommends for food industry to control with raw material price and perfect order 
fulfilment score to improve supplier performance. 
 
For further research, study in supplier performance analysis needs experienced expert validation and cost benefit 
analysis to supply chain and firms’ performance.

Abstract 
Society 5.0 post-pandemic has an essential need in accordance with its existentialism as a human being, namely, to 
feel connected to each other. A valuable lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic shows that limiting interactions with 
other people doesn't stop people from staying connected. They use social media as a tool to connect themselves with 
others personally and widely. This study consists of two studies that aim to provide empirical evidence that the use of 
social media plays a role in predicting the psychological function of nostalgia (study 1), and the function of nostalgia 
plays a role in predicting social connectedness (study 2). The results showed that social media had a significant role 
in predicting the nostalgia function, and the nostalgia function was shown to play a significant role in predicting social 
connectedness. The findings of this study suggest that using social media as a form of social media memory can trigger 
nostalgic memories, allowing people to experience nostalgia and social connectedness in the current day.

1. Introduction
Three years of pandemic have brought several impacts to people such as, academic stress, loneliness which plagues 
youth in several countries (Groarke et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2020; Rinaldi 2021), and the need to accept the reality of 
shifting routines and way of life in establishing interpersonal relationships with friends or family (Smith et al. 2020). 
During this COVID-19 pandemic, humans are faced with a paradox that the more often interpersonal relationships 
occur, the higher the risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus. Throughout the time, this condition is being considered 
as a ‘normal’ condition that everybody will face. If this condition made by the paradox is not addressed carefully, 
psychological issues such as isolation or loneliness, as well as low well-being would become more prevalent. 
Despite the shifts caused by the pandemic, modernization will continue and the human need for relationships with 
each other will continue to exist as a form of self-existence (Fromm and Anderson 2002). Human-made technology is 
primarily designed to suit human needs in terms of interpersonal relationships. This fact is considered to help fulfill 
the need to establish interpersonal relationships, although there are those who think that the same technology can also 
worsen one's mental health. The use of technology is particularly relevant, including to promote social connectivity, 
based on the reality of modern society's needs, or so called Society 5.0, to always be connected with others and pay 
attention to mental health.

The findings in this study are consistent with those of several other research that show nostalgia, which is purposely 
created through nostalgic memories, can affect social connectedness (Cheung et al. 2016). Furthermore, the findings 
of this study corroborate the assertion that social connectedness is important in providing meaning in life through 
nostalgia (Sedikides and Wildschut 2018). Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that posting with 
others on social media can activate the nostalgia function, resulting in the sensation of being connected to others. 
 
The results of Study 2 prove the view of awareness of the importance of having close relationships with others and 
extends to a wider scope (Lee et al. 2001; Lee and Robbins 1995). This view is still considered relevant for Society 
5.0. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, where previously there was a perception of self-isolation due to 
restrictions on space to interact with others, has made modern society post-pandemic still need social connectedness. 
This is in line with the predictions of modern extensionist psychology experts who say that modernization will not 
deny the true existence of humans, namely their need to stay connected and establish interpersonal relationships with 
other people (Fromm and Anderson 2002). 
 
Posting on social media with other people creates a nostalgic memory, which is a positive function of social media 
memory. When a nostalgic memory evokes a pleasant emotion, it generates a sense of belonging to others, even if the 
individual is not physically there with the people in the post. This is in line with nostalgia's role of improving social 
relationships, attachment security, interpersonal skills, and social support (Wildschut et al. 2006). This study's 
empirical evidence will be a beneficial contribution to modern society. When circumstances prevent a person from 
making direct contact with others, memories recorded on social media allow that person to maintain a sense of social 
connectedness through nostalgia that arises in his thoughts and feelings.  
 
This study features a restricted control group, indicating that the participants genuinely share posts on social media 
with others. A limitation of this study is the pandemic situation, which limits laboratory research.  
  
6. Conclusion  
6.1 Conclusion Study 1 
Based on the findings of Study 1, it can be stated that using social media as a social media memory and obtaining the 
psychological function of nostalgia is natural for Society 5.0. The implication of this study 1 is that the nostalgic 
memory kept in one's social media is not anything private, but rather something public that others can enjoy. So that 
modern society can still benefit from the psychological function of nostalgia by using social media as a social media 
memory.

6.2 Conclusion Study 2 
Social connectedness is an essential need in Society 5.0. This can still be enjoyed by modern society through the 
positive function of social media memory which contains nostalgic memory in the form of posts with other people. 
Future obstacles will not prohibit a person from fulfilling his or her desire to connect with other people. As a 
conclusion, empirical data suggests that social connectedness exists, which can be sensed through the nostalgia 
function caused by posting with other individuals on social media.  
6.3 General Conclusion 
In general, it can be concluded that social media is very relevant for society 5.0. Its function is to keep people feeling 
connected to each other, which is proven in this study. The positive benefit of social media memory is that it gives 
people a pleasant nostalgic function for themselves and makes them feel personally connected and extended to others. 
Humans' need to keep linked to their fellow humans is still evident in the present era.

which has involved injecting fertilizer straight into the trunk. As a result, it did not pollute the soil as an indicator of 
the employment of green technologies. The research was conducted from April to August 2015 in Perkebunan 
Nusantara VIII, West Java, Indonesia. The nutrient solution in various concentrations was applied by infusion or 
injection at the rubber trunk. The nutrient solution contained N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, B, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Mo. The 
results showed that on lower 20 years old rubber increase of latex and dry rubber yield significantly in the trees that 
were given nutrient solution by injection without dilution of nutrient solution, and by infusion with the dilution of 
nutrient solution at 20 mL.L-1 and no applied nutrient solution. The heights of the infusion on the trunk at 50 cm from 
the ground with the dilution of nutrient solution at 10 mL.L-1 give the effect on the highest latex and dry rubber yield. 
Concentrate of 20 mL.L-1 nutrient solution in infusion application on the trunk of tapping panel dryness gives the 
effect on higher latex yield than normal rubber tree of the upper 20 years old

1. Introduction
Rubber plantations are the second largest commodity in Indonesia after oil palm plantations for superior agricultural 
products. Furthermore, for the past five years, Indonesia has been the world's second-largest producer of natural 
rubber, trailing only Thailand (Zuhdi, 2021). However, the productivity level per hectare of Indonesian rubber crop 
yields is low compared to other competitor countries in ASEAN, such as Vietnam and Malaysia, which have rubber 
productivity of 400 kg/ha higher. In contrast, Vietnam and Malaysia have fewer rubber plantations than Indonesia, 
with 1,080,212 hectares and 655,819 hectares, respectively (Harahap & Segoro, 2018; Direktorat Jenderal 
3910",,"Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022

nutrient requirements are inadequate to reach stem delivery, this technique is effective as a supplement. However, 
when combined with the application of fertilizer through the stem and simultaneously with the application of fertilizer 
through the soil, the effectiveness of nutrient utilization by rubber plants will be higher. The trunk injection approach 
is recommended to make it convenient and more practical to implement because it does not require an infusion 
installation.

Abstract 
Water management is crucial, especially in the rainy season. Over time, climate change causes an increase in rainfall 
which results in increased surface runoff. In addition, the increase in surface runoff is caused by the conversion of 
land functions from green land to watertight land such as roads, urban areas, buildings, and others. This chain event 
resulting flood. However, considering the condition of the land surface in the capital, which has fallen and is almost 
level with sea level, the usual solution cannot be utilized. By utilizing the polder system which is a closed system of 
water flow flowing with the help of a pump and the flow of water in the system can be monitored and regulated in and 
out, it is expected to be a solution to flood problems in the capital city. For this study, a case was taken in the KBN 2 
area which is one of the Sunter-Cakung Polder areas. The area of KBN2 itself, broadly and largely, is the largest 
contributory area of runoff in the Sunter-Cakung polder system. From the results of the analysis obtained, with the 
application of the polder system by making a storage pond as high as 5 meters and an area of about 5 Ha in the 
downstream of the river and the existing pump operation of 1 unit with 1 m3/s capacity, the area that was previously 
affected by the flood, was reduced quite widely.

1. Introduction
Water is a very important resource for the life of living things, especially humans. Water management is crucial, 
especially in the rainy season. In the rainy season, the amount of water is large and sometimes difficult to control. 
Over time, climate change results in an increase in rainfall which results in increased surface runoff. In addition, the 
increase in surface runoff is caused by the conversion of land functions from green land to impermeable lands such as 
roads, urban areas, buildings, and others. Due to the increase in surface runoff, the channels that were previously able 
to accommodate the surface runoff are no longer able to and resulting in the appearance of puddles. This event is often 
referred to as a flood condition. To overcome these problems, there are several solutions, either by normalizing rivers, 
building water reservoirs, or increasing river capacity, which are solutions that are often used in the capital. However, 
considering the condition of the land surface in the capital, which has fallen and is almost level with sea level, the 
usual solution cannot be used because the old solution of water still uses gravity as its driving force and if the drain is 
higher, the water cannot be made to the outside, resulting in inundation. Therefore, the Polder System is the answer 
to these problems. 
The Polder system itself is defined as a closed system of water flow flowing with the help of a pump and the flow of 
water in the system can be monitored and regulated in and out of the closed system. In its application, a simple polder 
system has been applied since ancient times such as in China for irrigation purposes where the water flow system is 
closed and can be regulated as well as to protect the irrigation area inside from water from outside the system (Tang 
et.al. 2019). In its development, the Polder system was used in the Netherlands to overcome the problem of flooding 
(Rusetski 2019). The use of polders in the Netherlands is caused by the sea level being higher than the land elevation 
of the Netherlands so that all wastewaters cannot be channeled into the sea and the influence of sea tides on the plains 
of the Netherlands. The existence of this problem makes Polder the solution (Baan and Klijin 2004; Hoes and Van De 
Giesen 2015). In its implementation the polder system has been applied in various locations in Indonesia in dealing

5. Conclusion
From this study we can conclude several things: 
•
From result of analysis Flood flow in KBN2 is around 26 m3/s which is result of 2 drainage channel of Gubug 
genteng and Progo Channel
•
From Figure 8, it can be seen with existing drainage system, there are several area of flood inundation with
happen mostly around the junction between 2 drainage channel of Gubug Genteng and Progo Channel
•
By implementing Polder system of building a reservoir with schematic shown in Figure 10 beside junction
of 2 drainage channel and 2 pump with capacity of 0.5 m3/s, flood inundation problem can be solved and by
implementing this new system there is reduction of flow to downstream from original amount of 26 m3/s to
around 14 m3/s.

1. Introduction
The use of information technology (IT) in an organization can increase work effectiveness and efficiency (Antoni, Fikari, 
Akbar, & Jie, 2018; Rahmawati, Antoni, & Kurniawan, 2021). This can be seen by the number of organizations using IT to 
integrate work both vertically and horizontally, helping organization in obtaining competitive information, presenting 
information in a useful form and to send information to other parties or to other locations. One example of the use of IT in a 
organization is to support the process of buying and selling online a product to the consumers. This online transaction is 
considered effective among the community, consumers without leaving the house, simply operating a gadget that can access 
various internet media (Fathimah, 2019). Then, impressed in choosing tastes, prices, and other kinds. Consumers only prepare 
money paid by a bank transfer system or Cash on Delivery.To improve the traditional and online buying and selling process 
requires one technique such as digital marketing that can reach entire level of customers. According to Chaffey and Ellis-
Chadwick (2019) digital marketing is defined as the process of applying digitalization to the market using innovations such as 
blogs, feeds, podcasts, and social networks, which contribute to a marketing and obtain profits and maintain the number of 
customers.  Digital marketing is marketing that has a wide scope related to online media, websites, email, and wireless media 
and carries out the processing of online customer information and can be used in conjunction with traditional media in

6. Conclusion 
The types of defects that most often occur during the invitation creation process are as follows: 
Untidy Invitation Folds: The position of the invitation folds is not precise with the existing reference lines on the 
invitation paper stamps, resulting in the invitation being tilted. 
 
Untidy Screen printing Results: The spilled ink print on the invitation letter makes the printed writing blurred and 
shaded, so the paper is not visible. 
 
Blurred Print Ink: The lack of thickness of the print on the invitation letter causes the writing to become blurred and 
striped so that the report is not visible. 
 
The level of process capability based on DPMO and Sigma values shows that the average sigma value is 3.95, with 
possible damage of 7,612,321 products for every one million productions, where the sigma level achieved is still far 
from the desired target of 6 sigma and 3.4 DPMO.

B. Fault Tree Analysis Explosion Boiler Tube 
The causative factor of the problem of the explosion of boiler tubes is due to human, technological and environmental 
factors. The causes of the human factor are workers not being careful when doing their work, lack of worker awareness 
level, and lack of supervision from the management. The engine factor is steam with high temperature and unstable 
pressure Furthermore, environmental factors can be influenced by the presence of fire in the working environment. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The type of danger risk caused is based on the Risk Matrix 18 potential dangers that say the High risk category, 8 
danger risks that say the Moderate risk category and there are 11 danger risks that say the Low risk category. 
Proposed occupational accident risk control at PT. X is: Perform a thorough inspection of all components of the 
machine before operating the machine. Make sure all components function properly, Clean the work environment 
regularly which is carried out every day, K3 Training is held every 2/4 month. , Require workers to use personal 
protective equipment, Supervise workers in the use of personal protective equipment. If the worker violates the rules 
such as not using personal protective equipment, sanctions can be given and reward the worker who uses it, Apples 
are held every morning before doing the work done by the supervisor/foreman with the aim of reminding the worker 
to work safely.

Abstract 
Work-life balance is essential in Strategic Human Resources Management. This study focused on the evaluation of work-
life balance factors: effect of job stress on employees’ well-being, effect of role overload on employee job satisfaction, 
effect of long working hours on employee morale and effect of work-family on job commitment. The study therefore 
proposed a statement of problem to look at and identify those irregularities that may come up as a result of poor balance 
between work and life. The scope of the study was restricted to Zimbabwe Institute of Engineers registered women 
engineers while the importance was given in line with the benefits to be anticipated by the stakeholders involved in the 
study. The study was based on the Work-Life Border Theory. The methodology adopted was an online Google Form 
questionnaire with a Likert 6 scale. A random sample with 92 women engineers was used for this study. Kruskal-
Wallis Chi-squared test at 95% confidence interval was adopted for the statistical data analysis. Statistically it was 
concluded that: job stress has an effect on women engineers’ well-being, role overload affects women engineers’ job 
satisfaction, as well as that work-life conflict affects job commitment for women engineers. However, long working hours 
do not influence women engineers’ morale as long as they are motivated and well resourced. The work-life balance of 
women engineers must be prioritized. 
Keywords: Strategic Human Resources Management, women engineers, work-life balance 
1. Introduction
Worldwide, less than 50% of working-age women are in the work market and less than 25% of these are women engineers 
(Manyuchi et al., 2021; Engineering UK, 2019). The character of working women has changed all over the world due to social 
demands and economic conditions. This has caused a development whereby working women have incredible burden to 
advance a career as strong as their male colleagues while supporting lively engagement in their personal lives (Desai et al., 
2011). The continually increasing work pressure is taking a toll on the working women leaving them with less time for 
themselves (Adisa et al., 2014). This affects the women’s physical, emotional and social well-being. Thus, achieving work-
life balance is a basic requirement for working women to have a good quality of life (Manyuchi et al., 2021). This research 
work explored the tough challenges faced by working women engineers in maintaining a work-balance between their 
personal and professional life. 
Work-life balance has more and more become an alarm to both employers and employees of most organizations (Sharma, 
2016). There has also been an increase in the consideration of the burdens that work has on family as well as life of 
employees. This has kindled research concentrating on work-life balance on women (Kelliher et al., 2019). In an 
environment where there is high level of competitive forces coming from efforts to deliver excellence service, the burden 
of this on women employees are massive (Kelliher et al., 2019). Work-life balance deals with an employee’s ability to 
properly prioritize between work and lifestyle, social life, well-being and family. Work is normally considered as a part of 
life. Although disconnected by certain physical, psychological and temporal boundaries, the two concepts are 
operationalized within the same background of time and space (Manyuchi et al., 2021). Where there is proper balance 
between work and life, employees tend to put in their best efforts at work, because their family is happy and they are also 
happy as individuals.

The results from this study show that long working hours and overtime in general do not lead to decreased satisfaction and 
employee morale of the women engineers’ morale. Although Sparks et al. (1997) specified that if people spend too many 
hours at work, it could lead to a deteriorating well-being on the side of the workers thereby affecting the delivery of work 
of the employee, which has a direct relationship with the performance of the organization. Somewhat, increasing working 
hours and overtime have positive effects on life and job satisfaction as this usually results in monetary compensation. 
Understanding work- family culture improves the psychological resource base for employees by increasing a sense of self- 
acceptance and flexibility which can help employees develop positive affect towards work (Baral and Bhargava, 2010). 
Also, if an employee can better manage their time in one area, the spillover of loads to another area is decreased, thus 
increasing entire efficiency (Porter and Alman, 2010). In addition, if the women engineers are motivated and have access 
to financial resource they can perform irrespective of the working hours as long as the job give them the flexibility to meet 
their work-family needs. 
3.3.4 Effect of Work-Family Conflict on Women Engineers’ Job Commitment (X4, Y4) 
3.3.4.1 Responses to Work-Family Conflict (X4) 
In the study, 31.5% of the women strongly agreed that their work-family demands collide. In addition, 39.1% of the women 
engineers strongly agreed that they divide their time between work and family. Furthermore, 37.0% of the women strongly 
agreed that their families understood that they have demanding jobs. Lastly, 14.1% of the women engineers strongly agreed 
that their organizations understand the importance of meeting family demands. 
3.3.4.2 Responses to Women Engineers ‘Job Commitment (Y2) 
The responses to women engineers’ job commitment are shown in Table 4-8. These are indicated in both the frequencies 
and total percentage (%) of the responses. In this study, 27.2% of the women engineers strongly agreed that they love 
telling people about their job. However, 13.0% strongly agreed that they will find it very difficult to leave their job. 
Moreover, 37.0% of the women strongly agreed that they are forever loyal to the work they do. Lastly, 66.3% of the women 
engineers indicated that they always give the best to the jobs they are given. 
3.3.4.3 Statistical Analysis on Effect of Long Working Hours on Women Engineers’ Morale 
Using the Kruskal Wallis test Chi-squared to test difference in means of X3 andY3 and 95% confidence interval: 
H 04: Medians are equal. 
H 14: Medians are not equal. 
Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test 
Data: List (x4, y4) 
Kruskal-Wallis Chi-squared = 1.76, df = 1, p-value = 0.1846 
The p-value is greater than 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis; there is not enough evidence that the medians are 
not equal. It is therefore concluded that: 
Work-family conflict affects job commitment for women engineers. 
3.3.4.4 Discussion of Key Findings: Effect of Work-Family Conflict on Women Engineers ’Job Commitment  
In this study; it was found that the life pressures and demands of work in practicing women engineers affect their job 
commitment. Anila and Krishnaveni (2019) revealed that job commitment is influenced through work-life balance in the 
nursing profession. Kelliner et al. (2019) indicated that a discrepancy is created among work and family life due 
to work-family interfering, such that work influences family life and family life deters outcomes of any 
organization and delays the commitment and satisfaction level of workers. Sullivan (2019) indicated that excessive 
work demands increase work- family conflict and negative family outcomes, while family stresses increase 
family-work conflict. Work-life imbalance has been linked to reduced organizational commitment, job dissatisfaction, 
life dissatisfaction and increased stress and turnover intentions (Porter and Alman, 2010). As a result of this study, it is 
important to note the important role of work-life balance in increasing women engineers’ emotional well-being and the 
influence of this psychological well-being on organizational performance improvement premised on the Work-Family 
Border Theory. 
4. Conclusion
From the key study objectives on selected work-life balance for women engineers, the study therefore concludes that: Job 
stress has an effect on women engineer’s well-being. This is alluded to the high demands of the profession which results 
in work-life imbalance. Role overload affects women engineers’ job satisfaction. Too much work which the women 
engineers are not in control of makes them lose job satisfaction. Long working hours do not influence women engineer’s 
morale as well. The presence of flexible working hours in an organization significantly influenced women engineer’s 
job performance by enabling a balance between personal commitments and responsibilities and organizational roles and 
their duties. Flexibility in working hours improved women engineer’s motivation and commitment to the organization. 
Work-life conflict affects job commitment for women engineers. For women engineers to perform optimally they also need 
a job that caters for their life demands.

Abstract 
Technological advances cause the business environment to experience rapid changes, especially in micro, small and 
medium enterprises (MSMEs). In the Indonesian economy, MSMEs are the largest business group and have proven 
to withstand the shocks of the economic crisis. This study aims to examine the role of system user training, personal 
technical skills, and organizational size in improving the performance of accounting information systems. The 
accounting information system in question is an application for managing the inventory of raw materials and 
calculating the cost of production based on a web developed by the researcher. MSME actors can use the application 
to manage inventory and determine the cost of production. This study uses a survey method with respondents of 34 
employees in the production sector from 12 MSMEs in the Production Sector in Labuhanbatu Regency, North Sumatra 
Province, in 2022. Based on respondents' responses, obtained information that system user training is very important, 
organizational size is very appropriate, and personal technical ability and system performance accounting information 
is very high. The results showed that system user training and personal technical skills improved the performance of 
accounting information systems. Different results indicate that the organization size does not affect the performance 
of accounting information systems.

1. Introduction
Technological advances in the information age and globalization have caused the business environment to undergo 
rapid changes with intense competition (Mahagrita 2020). The development of information technology has a 
significant impact on the accounting information system in a company. The accounting information system is one of 
the sources that can provide information, such as financial information within a company or organization, goods 
counting activities, etc. The information can be used by parties interested in one of the fields of Micro, Small, and 
Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) (Amina et al. 2021). 
Accounting information systems have a significant impact on those who implement them. One of the impacts of 
implementing an accounting information system is good decision-making for internal and external parties (Devi & 
Darma 2020). The digitization of accounting information systems must be structured to meet information needs 
effectively and efficiently. The application of a computerized system is expected to improve the performance of 
accounting information systems, which in turn will impact organizational performance (Unayah 2020). Assessment 
of the performance of the accounting information system is critical so that the accounting information system can 
provide maximum benefits for the company (Yasa et al. 2020).

5. Results and Discussion
Based on the results of the validity test, all questionnaire statement items are valid because of the r Count ≥ r Table. 
The value of Cronbach's Alpha Accounting Information System Performance (AISP) is 0.914, Personal Technical 
Ability (PTA) is 0.719, Organizational Size (OS) is 0.660, and System User Training (SUT) is 0.860. Cronbach's 
Alpha is greater than 0.60. The test results also show that the data are normally distributed, and pass the 
heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity tests.  
Table 2 shows the results of testing the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. The F-statistics 
results show a simultaneous influence of personal technical ability, organizational size, and system user training on 
the performance of accounting information systems. The coefficient of determination shows a value of 0.658, meaning 
that personal technical ability, organizational size, and system user training can explain the performance of accounting 
information systems by 65.8%, and other variables explain the rest.

Table 2 also shows the results of testing the three hypotheses. The results of testing the first hypothesis show that H1 
is supported. The results show that the ability of personal techniques positively affects accounting information system 
performance. These results indicate that the higher the knowledge possessed by users of accounting information 
systems, the higher the performance of accounting information systems. Good personal technical skills will encourage 
users to use accounting information systems so that the performance of accounting information systems will be higher. 
With these abilities, employees can operate information systems, express information needs, and express how the 
system should work. This study's results align with research conducted by Mahagrita (2020) and Tiara & Fuadi (2018). 
The results of testing the second hypothesis show that H2 is not supported. These results mean that the organization's 
size does not affect accounting information system performance. These results indicate that the size of the MSMEs 
does not affect the performance of the accounting information system. This finding is thought to be due to a lack of 
synergy between employees in the organization. If one employee has difficulty using the accounting information 
system, the other party cannot help. This study's results align with research conducted by Yasa et al. (2020) and 
Praptiningsih et al. (2019) that organizational size cannot affect the performance of accounting information systems. 
The results of testing the third hypothesis show that H3 is supported. The results show that the system user training 
positively affects accounting information system performance. These results indicate that the more often the system 
user training is held by the company, the more the performance of the accounting information system will be. With 
education and training programs organized, employees' ability can increase because, in education and training 
programs, the latest materials and regulations are usually provided so that employees can quickly accept frequently 
updated applications. This study's results align with research conducted by These results indicate that the more often 
the system user training is held by the company, the more the performance of the accounting information system will 
be. With education and training programs organized, employees' ability can increase because, in education and training

6. Conclusion
This study aims to determine the characteristics of MSME respondents in Labuhanbatu Regency. This study examines 
the effect of personal technical skills, organizational size, and system user training on accounting information system 
performance using Raw Material Inventory Management Applications and Web-Based Cost of Production 
3976","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

Calculations. Characteristics of respondents indicate that the majority of MSME employees are 23 years old, female, 
and have a bachelor's degree. Descriptive analysis shows that personal technical skills, organizational size, system 
user training, and accounting information system performance are included in the excellent category. The test results 
show that the ability of personal engineering and system user training positively affects accounting information 
systems performance. Different results indicate that the organization size does not affect accounting information 
systems performance. 
 
This study only limited respondents to MSMEs in Labuhanbatu Regency, North Sumatra province, Indonesia. Further 
researchers can replicate this research using the same application in Langkat Regency, Deli Serdang Regency, 
Mandailing Natal Regency, and others. Personal technical skills, organizational size, and system user training can 
explain the accounting information system performance by 65.8%, and other variables explain the rest. Therefore, 
further researchers are expected to add variables, such as user involvement in system development, user education, 
and user experience. This study has not proved the effect of organizational size on the performance of accounting 
information systems. Further research can use different indicators to measure the organization's size, such as the 
presence of employees who have fulfilled their job descriptions. 
 
MSMEs in the Production Sector in Labuhanbatu Regency are expected to provide continuous system user training 
so they can use the existing accounting information system optimally. MSME owners are expected to employ 
employees who can use accounting information systems. The Department of Cooperatives and MSMEs in 
Labuhanbatu Regency is expected to guide MSMEs to keep up with technological developments and digitize their 
business and financial management.

Abstract 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI) The Main Port Authority Office targets to achieve YOR of operational 
performance in a container terminal operator that handles loading unloading services for domestic and international 
containers in the amount of 60% for 2020-2024, but the realization is only achieved less than 40%. In line with the 
decline of throughput data from 2019 before the pandemic. This study aims to identify the internal and external 
factors, propose alternative strategies, and determine strategic priorities to improve the operational performance of 
loading unloading. The research method used is SWOT-ANP. The identification results obtained internal factors in 
the form of domestic and international container shipping services as the highest strength factor, then the highest 
weakness factor in the form of loading unloading equipment replacement. While external factors in the form of 
having good relationships with stakeholders, port unions, and local governments as the highest opportunity factor, 
then one of the highest threat factors is intense competition in container terminal services, especially with terminals 
at overseas ports. There are 6 alternative strategies proposed, with 2 strategic priorities that have the highest weight 
including expanding market share by adding new services and improving service quality through additional 
operational equipment capacity.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is the largest Archipelagic State in the world. Its strategic location between the Indian Ocean and the 
Pacific Ocean makes the maritime sector important. This can be seen from the volume of container cargo, which is 
increasing gradually at a rate of about 7.7%. (Syafaaruddin, 2015). Therefore, ports have a big role, namely as the 
main means of distributing goods by sea, both exports and imports. The port is also an economic gateway in the 
form of facilities as well as a determinant of trade activities between islands and countries. 
Ports have an important role in the growth of industry and trade which can contribute directly to national 
development. According to Arianto Patunru et.al (in Khusyairi & Hisyam, 2016) that world trade by sea reaches 
85%, while trade in Indonesia by sea is 90%. Based on the Regulation of the Minister of National Development 
Planning/Head of the National Development Planning Agency of the Republic of Indonesia Number 2 of 2021 in the 
Draft Government Work Plan for 2022, it provides an illustration that the volume of world trade is expected to 
increase 7.2% in 2021, after being estimated to decrease 9.2% in 2020. That certainly encourages Indonesia, which 
is a developing country as well as the origin of export goods traded in Europe, America, and East Asia, to develop 
port facilities with the best integrity to provide optimal container terminal services. But one of the major terminals in 
Indonesia had a declining throughput graph before the pandemic followed by YOR performance that was less than 
the standard. Therefore, this research was conducted, by formulating strategies to improve the operational 
performance of loading unloading containers so can optimize port facilities. 
However, before making decisions in developing and improving strategies and anticipating fluctuations of loading 
unloading volumes entering and leaving the terminal, it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive evaluation and 
analysis through research activities. And it is expected that container terminals have more ability to absorb cargo 
and gain a higher market share in improving performance at the world port level. Mulyadi (in Aswirah et al, 2013)

Based on Figure 3, there is a relationship between clusters and nodes in the ANP network model, this shows the 
interaction and dependencies between elements. After getting the network model framework from ANP, then 
weighted by 3 expert judgments, the data will be processed using Super Decision software provided that the 
consistency ratio must be less than 0.1, and the results will be obtained as in Figure 4. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The strategic priority order is obtained based on importance and weight, first is the SO1 strategy with a weight of 
0.332433, second is the WO1 strategy with a weight of 0.224781, after that the SO2 strategy with a weight of 
0.185185, fourth is the ST1 strategy with a weight of 0, 127949, then the WT1 strategy with a weight of 0.073051, 
and the last one is the SO3 strategy with a weight of 0.056600. The greater the weight indicates that the strategy has 
higher importance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on and discussion related to research, conclusions can be drawn: 
1. The identification results obtained internal factors in the form of domestic and international container shipping 
services as the highest strength factor, then the highest weakness factor in the form of loading unloading 
equipment replacement. While external factors in the form of having good relationships with stakeholders, port 
unions, and local governments as the highest opportunity factor, then one of the highest threat factors is intense 
competition in container terminal services, especially with terminals at overseas ports 
2. There are 6 alternative strategies proposed in the SWOT matrix, 3 SO (Strength-Opportunity) strategies, 1 WO 
(Weakness-Opportunity) strategy, 1 ST (Strength-Threat) strategy, and 1 WT (Weakness-Threat) strategy. 
3. Two strategic priorities were obtained with the highest weight. The first strategy is to expand market share by 
adding new services then the second strategy is to improve service quality through additional operational 
equipment capacity.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role that leaders play during organisational change caused by the Covid-
19 pandemic and digitalisation. This is a conceptual paper and research findings are based on information gathered 
from previously researched topics of varying sources. A qualitative approach was taken in this study which is 
compatible with the interpretivist paradigm. An exploratory research design was used to understand the general idea 
of past research on Covid-19, change management, digitalisation, and leadership. 313 articles were considered. The 
authors have reviewed relevant literature and the research findings identified four main variables that influence 
leadership which are the context of change, change processes, leadership intelligence, and leadership support. 
Furthermore, findings suggest that leadership is more than just the behaviour of an individual, it is also a function that 
is distributed across the entire organisation during change management implementations. Leaders need to act as 
change agents and consultants during times of continuous transformation, they need to create and develop a culture 
that is conducive to continuous learning, constant innovation, and ongoing change as well as be supportive of 
employees during major digital transformations. The prevalence of Covid-19 has increased the need for more 
knowledge on how to lead and build effective virtual teams. Understanding the digital landscape and its strategic 
positioning will help in achieving effective results. The value of this paper is related to improving the understanding 
of how to effectively lead and manage complexities brought by change during times of digitalisation and Covid-19.

1. Introduction
The Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) has forced organisations to adopt new strategies and procedures to stay afloat 
(Kinnunen & Georgescu, 2020). The impact of the pandemic may have long-term negative effects on the growth 
prospects of various industries and global economies (Apedo-Amah et al, 2020). Covid-19 demands that organisations 
adopt radical change measures such as innovation, decisiveness, and adaptability to address the challenges caused by 
the pandemic (Lateef et al., 2020). Change is inevitable; therefore, organisations must adopt a strategy to manage it. 
Leadership is becoming a highly complex managerial skill that requires extensive training and continuous 
improvement (Senior, 2002; Lautenbach et al., 2017; Al-Tahitah et al., 2018, Apedo-Amah et al., 2020), as new 
knowledge and technologies have significantly altered the way people work and live. This is evidenced by how 
digitalisation has affected society and businesses. The Digital revolution is expected to have a major impact on the 
way businesses operate globally and has been compared to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) on many accounts 
(Gous, 2021; International Trade Centre, 2020; Tihinen & Kääriäinen, 2016; Degryse, 2016; Schwab, 2015; Tihinen 
et al, 2016 & the Economist, 2012). In this study, the terms digitalisation and 4IR will be used. 
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, change has become more prevalent in our lives and the need for leaders to adopt a 
strong culture of flexibility and agility has become increasingly important. This may assist organisations in achieving 
effective change management (Hussain et al., 2016). The rapid emergence of digitalisation has intensified competition 
and organisations need to keep up with these changes to stay afloat (Velikova, 2019). According to Mansara (2019), 
leadership is perceived to be an integral component of successful organisational change. Given the challenges imposed 
by Covid-19 and the need for increased digitalisation in organisations, this claim needs to be revisited and requires a 
more comprehensive research approach.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the simultaneous and partial effect of the total asset turnover ratio, return on asset, and 
dividend policy on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS). Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) is a concept used to 
assess a company in the form of a combination of assets and investment options in the future. The population in this 
study are companies listed in the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 period. The method 
used in this research is the quantitative method and the sample selection method uses the purposive sampling 
technique. This study has 104 observational data obtained from 26 samples of companies. The data analysis used in 
this research is panel data regression analysis using EViews 12. The result shows that the total asset turnover ratio, 
return on assets, and dividend policy have a simultaneous effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS). Partially, 
the total asset turnover ratio has no effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS), return on asset and dividend policy 
have a positive effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS).

1. Introduction
The growth and development of the company is something that is expected and pursued by every company following 
the vision and mission that has been set by the company. A company expects its growth to have a positive impact so 
that it can increase investment opportunities in the company and can maximize the value of the company by increasing 
the welfare of investors. Currently, the valuation of a company cannot be seen only from the financial statements but 
can be seen from the value of the investment that will be issued in the future. The Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) 
is a component of company value that results in the choice to invest in the future (Afriadi, 2016). 
Investment Opportunity Set shows the investment options owned by a company. Therefore, IOS is very important in 
determining the growth of a company in the future. Investment Opportunity Set provides an overview of various 
investment opportunities for a company. Companies will experience higher expenditures compared to the loss of value 
of investment opportunities if a company does not take advantage of investment opportunities. In addition, in a certain 
period the presence of IOS in a company shows the ability of a company to maximize profits. Companies that develop 
are more in demand by investors to invest their capital than companies that are stable or experiencing setbacks because 
developing companies will get the returns expected by investors (Novianti & Simu, 2016). 
Capitalization value can describe the growth of a company. During 2017 – 2020, companies with the LQ45 index 
experienced fluctuations in the development of market capitalization. In the period 2017 and 2019 market 
capitalization experienced a high increase of 23.5% and 6.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, in 2018 and 2020 market 
capitalization decreased by 4.9% and 21.4%, respectively (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, 2020).

Opportunity Set (IOS) in the company. listed in the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 
period. 
Based on the results of the partial test using panel data regression analysis, the probability value for the total asset 
turnover ratio variable is 0.2714, which is greater than the 0.05 significance level. In addition, the total asset turnover 
ratio variable also obtained a negative coefficient value of -0.158934, indicating that the total asset turnover ratio 
variable has a negative relationship with the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS). This shows that the total asset turnover 
ratio variable has no negative effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) as measured by the market to book value 
of assets in companies listed in the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for 2017-2020 period. The higher 
or lower total asset turnover ratio of a company may not necessarily affect the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) in a 
company. The total asset turnover ratio in the form of sales does not affect increasing the company's return because 
many competitors have entered a large market share so that investors do not do the Investment Opportunity Set 
The probability value on the return on asset variable is 0.0000 which is smaller than the 0.05 significance level. In 
addition, the return on assets variable also obtained a positive coefficient value of 1.966558, indicating that the return 
on assets variable has a positive relationship with the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS). This shows that the return 
on assets variable has a positive effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) as measured by the market to book 
value of assets in companies listed in the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 period. 
High profitability gives a signal about the company's growth in the future, where part of the profitability will be 
invested again in the form of investment to increase company value. 
The probability value on the dividend policy variable is 0.0011 which is smaller than the 0.05 significance level. In 
addition, the dividend policy variable also obtained a positive coefficient value of 0.269432, indicating that the 
dividend policy variable has a positive relationship with the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS). This shows that the 
dividend policy variable has a positive effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) as measured by the market to 
book value of assets in companies listed in the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 period. 
It can be concluded that if the dividend policy given by the company is high, to investors, the investment opportunity 
in a banking company also gets bigger. This means that it is following the theory of dividend irrelevance. Where 
according to this theory, companies can distribute dividends, large or small, as long as it is possible to cover the lack 
of funds from external sources. So what is important is whether the available investment is expected to provide a 
positive net present value, no matter whether the funds used to finance come from within the company (retaining 
profits) or from outside the company (issuing new shares). The impact of the choice of decision is the same for the 
wealth of investors, or the dividend decision is irrelevant (Afriadi, 2016) . 
6. Conclusion
Simultaneously, the total asset turnover ratio, return on assets, and dividend policy has a significant effect of 0.000025 
on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) in companies listed on the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for 
2017-2020 period. Based on the results of the partial test, the following conclusions were obtained: 
1.
The total asset turnover ratio has no significant effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) in companies
listed in the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 period.
2.
Return on assets has a significant positive effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) in companies listed in
the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 period.
3.
Dividend policy has a significant positive effect on the Investment Opportunity Set (IOS) in companies listed on
the LQ45 index on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2017-2020 period.

Abstract 
Advances in technology have brought micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to market their products and 
sell them through various marketplaces. It is estimated that 32% of business actors in Indonesia use digital platforms 
to encourage product sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of 
work experience, user ability, and incentives on accounting information systems effectiveness. The accounting 
information system in question is a web-based income statement preparation application. This study analyzed the 
responses of 41 owners and employees of the finance department of 13 MSMEs in Cilacap Regency, Central Java 
Province. This study found that MSME actors in Cilacap Regency were very satisfied with the incentives received, 
had work experience, user skills, and very high effectiveness in accounting information systems. The test results found 
that work experience and user ability had a positive effect on the effectiveness of the accounting information system. 
In contrast, incentives did not affect the effectiveness of the accounting information system.

1. Introduction
This study aims to determine and analyze the characteristics of MSME respondents in Cilacap Regency who use a 
web-based income statement preparation application. This study examines the role of work experience, user 
capabilities, and incentives on the effectiveness of accounting information systems. Researchers developed their own 
web-based income statement preparation application to help trade MSMEs who had difficulty distributing 
merchandise inventory and calculating business profits.  
MSMEs in Cilacap Regency that can use accounting information systems effectively can certainly make better 
decisions, but the fact is that using accounting information systems is not easy and not effective yet. Based on the 
results of interviews with MSMEs that have used the marketplace, it was found that these MSMEs have difficulties in 
the form of recording financial statements, which are still done manually and inconsistently. MSMEs also have 
difficulty determining the amount of stock divided into each marketplace because monthly sales are uncertain between 
marketplaces. The distribution of the amount of stock is carried out evenly by the owner. Still, sometimes one 
marketplace experiences a shortage of inventory and accumulates in other marketplaces, or even products are no 
longer available in the warehouse. This condition can disappoint the customer, so they cancel the order. Lack of 
attention to stock taking is also a serious problem for MSMEs that use the marketplace due to lack of knowledge. 
Determining the selling price is sometimes confusing for MSMEs. Applying an accounting information system as a 
web-based income statement application aims to overcome these difficulties. Complete features to help record every 
transaction will increase sales and store ratings on every marketplace used by MSMEs in Cilacap Regency. MSME 
owners can access financial report data for decision-making and view sales and purchase data. Employees who work 
in the warehouse or stock department can view the amount of stock to adjust the amount in the warehouse and the 
application. Admin employees can enter sales and purchase data, view product sales and purchase data, also input and

5. Results and Discussion
A validity test was applied to 26 statement items. The test results show that all statement items on the questionnaire 
are declared valid and feasible to use. The reliability test was applied to all research variables. The Cronbach alpha 
value for the accounting information system effectiveness is 0.847, work experience is 0.838, user capability is 0.680, 
and incentives are 0.873. The test results show that the value of Cronbach's alpha is greater than 0.6, which means that 
the respondents' answers to each statement item in each research variable have been consistent and stable. This study 
also conducted a data normality test, heteroscedasticity, and multicollinearity test. The test results show that all results 
pass. Furthermore, this study conducted a hypothesis test with the results presented in Table 2.

This study's first objective was to examine work experience's effect on the effectiveness of accounting information 
systems. The test results show that H1 is supported, meaning that work experience positively affects accounting 
information systems effectiveness. These results indicate that the more experience in doing the task can complete the 
more work. The process of learning and developing potential can improve understanding in doing assignments. The 
longer a person operates a computer, the more proficient and skilled in accounting information systems will be so that 
the information produced will be of higher quality. These results support the research conducted by Sari et al. (2021) 
and Anjani et al. (2021). 
The second research objective is to examine the effect of user capability on the effectiveness of accounting information 
systems. The test results show that H2 is supported, meaning that user capability positively affects accounting 
information systems effectiveness. This finding indicates that the user's ability to complete tasks quickly and 
accurately can increase the effectiveness of accounting information systems. User capabilities are also needed to avoid 
errors in the information generated. The more proficient the user's ability to operate accounting information systems 
will be, the more effective the use of accounting information systems will be, and the information produced will be 
more reliable for making decisions. These results align with the research conducted by Wardani et al. (2020) and Putri 
et al. (2021). 
The third research objective is to examine the effect of incentives on the effectiveness of accounting information 
systems. The test results do not support H3, which means that incentives do not affect accounting information system 
effectiveness. These results indicate that the provision of material and non-material incentives has not motivated 
employees to maximize the use of accounting information systems. This finding is presumably because MSME owners 
provide incentives as an obligation, such as holiday allowances, not because of inovation, creativity, or achievement. 
The results of this study are not in line with research conducted by Raharjono and Dharmadiaksa (2021). 
6. Conclusion
This study identifies the characteristics of MSME respondents in Cilacap Regency, Central Java, Indonesia. Most 
respondents, 31 people (76%), have offline and online trading businesses, 22 people (54%) were women, and 11 
people (29%) were 25 years old. Respondents have a bachelor's level of education, as many as 24 people (59%). Most 
respondents have work experience of 1-5 years, 20 people (48%). Respondents suggest that work experience, user 
capabilities, incentives, and the effectiveness of accounting information systems at MSMEs in Cilacap Regency that 
use the income statement preparation application are excellent. This study investigates the effect of work experience, 
user capability, and incentives on accounting information systems effectiveness in MSMEs using an income statement 
preparation application. The results suggest that work experience and user capability positively affect accounting 
information systems effectiveness. On the contrary, incentives do not affect accounting information systems 
effectiveness.

This study has not found the effect of incentives on the effectiveness of accounting information systems. Further 
researchers can use other indicators such as the amount, type, and frequency of incentives. This study found that work 
experience, user capability, and incentives can explain accounting information systems effectiveness only 54.7%, the 
rest is explained by other variables that have not been studied. The next researcher can add other variables such as 
task complexity, user age, and education level. Based on the research results, which state that a web-based income 
statement preparation application is effectively used, MSMEs that utilize the marketplace is expected to continue to 
use the application and make improvements following the development of business needs. The Department of 
Cooperatives and MSMEs are expected to be able to guide by providing business and digital finance training to 
improve the user's ability to operate accounting information systems.

Abstract 
One of the uses of Business intelligence (BI) in organizations is a non-profit organization in Cianjur, where both 
organizations have implemented BI. It is hoped that BI can help support reporting and fact-based decision-making 
within the scope of the education sector organization, which ultimately leads to improved organizational performance. 
The purpose of this study is to find out what factors influence the implementation of BI in non-profit organizations. 
The research method used is quantitative, which includes the dissemination of questionnaires. The data collected 
through a questionnaire survey from a sample of 60 people in two non-profit organizations in Cianjur district were 
analyzed through Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results showed that data 
management, relative profits, and IT infrastructure support significantly influenced in implementation of BI in non-
profit organizations. This study provides an understanding of what influences the implementation of BI in non-profit 
organizations. The main limitation of this research is its focus on the non-profit sector. It is only carried out by two 
non-profit organizations in Cianjur alone, thus limiting its application and ability to be generalized. It is hoped that 
the findings presented will contribute to a greater understanding of the factors influencing the application of business 
intelligence for researchers and practitioners to encourage non-profit organizations to be better prepared to implement 
decision-making through business intelligence. This research also helped offer a dashboard design proposal for BI 
improvement following the model of the test results.

Abstract 
This study looks at the adaptation of digital platforms as part of the support for Mercy Corps Timor-Leste’s Covid-19 
Recovery for MSME Program' which targets MSMEs run by women to increase the ease of transactions, through 
collaboration with an e-wallet platform named MOSAN. This study aims to provide an overview of the technology 
used by empirically analyzing the factors that influence the user behavior of MSMEs as MOSAN users. This study 
uses a quantitative method with a simplified UTAUT2 model or theory according to the phenomenon under study. 
The result of this research empirically and descriptively shows the factors influencing MSME use behavior finally 
showing that price value and effort expectancy as independent variables which highly influenced the use behavior 
positively and significantly towards continuing use behavior of the MOSAN platform, including the moderate variable 
of income generated and digital business literacy. In contrast, other independent variables in this research model have 
not shown a significant effect on the user behavior variable to achieve continuing use behavior, but this research shows 
the improvement of digital business literacy in 150 MSMEs because of the intervention of the covid-19 recovery 
program for MSMEs that also influencing continuing use behavior of MSMEs. E-wallet is a new concept of digital 
platform in Timor-Leste that still needs system improvements and more development on all the factors that affect its 
use, such as good governance, infrastructure, capabilities of human resources including MSMEs themselves in 
adapting to the uncertain situation of the future business environment.

1. Introduction
Mercy Corps Timor-Leste through funding from the Visa Foundation provided immediate support to women-owned 
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (hereinafter referred to as MSMEs) most affected by the pandemic in Asia. 
This program seeks to achieve the goal of empowering MSMEs through various activities including digital training 
with face-to-face methods, workshops, mentoring, in-depth business consultations and more. Digital financial services 
in Timor-Leste are currently not inclusive enough for women and women-run businesses, so uptake and retention are 
low. The disruption caused by COVID-19 has left women-owned MSMEs facing difficulties in purchasing goods, 
accessing credit, and depositing cash, which in turn has had severe negative impacts at the household level and 
increased vulnerability through increased urbanization, reduced employment and income, and increased vulnerability 
(Timor-Leste Rapid Market Resilience Assessment Report, 2020). MSMEs, especially in developing countries, do 
not have a culture and risk management system or business continuity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact

From the dimensional variables that have been studied, the dimension variable that has the strongest influence is the 
Effort Expectancy variable on the Use Behavior variable, which has a t-statistic value of 3.098, with a contribution 
value of 0.002. While the variable of the lowest influencing dimension is the Performance Expectancy variable on the 
Use Behavior variable, which has a t-statistic value of 0.109, with an influence contribution value of 0.914. As for the 
indirect effect or through intervening, the dimension variable that has the strongest influence indirectly is the Income 
Generated variable on the Continuing Use Behavior variable through the Use Behavior variable which has a t-statistic 
value of 3.129, with a contribution value of 0.002. Meanwhile, the variable of the lowest dimension that influences 
indirectly is the Income Generated variable on the Use Behavior variable through the Social Influence variable which 
has a t-statistic value of 0.113, with an influence contribution value of 0.910. The situation above explains the 
contradiction with the results in the research conducted by (Liu, W. et al., 2020), which states that the Use Behavior 
variable has the greatest influence value, which is influenced by consumer satisfaction, and for several reasons as long 
as someone using technology, and research that has been done states that all dimensional variables have a positive 
influence on sustainable use. 
6. Conclusion
This study reveals that the majority of MSME users of MOSAN in both municipalities, namely Ainaro and Bobonaro 
(Maliana) use MOSAN after the intervention of the covid-19 recovery for MSME's program which was implemented 
by Mercy Corps as a form of empowering MSMEs during the covid-19 pandemic. Considered as supporting factors 
for the use of MOSAN itself which are expressed in UTAUT2 theory are quite relevant, as seen in the results of the 
analysis shown the effort expectancy and price value variables stronger indicator that influences MSMEs to 
continuingly using the MOSAN, as well as the two moderating variables studied (income generated and digital 
business literacy) that emerged. As an indicator seen from the covid-19 recovery for MSME's program, although the 
UTAUT2 indicator is not fully appropriate or influences the decision to use MOSAN considering the situations and 
conditions available for the MSMEs studied in Timor-Leste context. This study illustrates that the e-wallet or mobile 
money, which is a new concept or digital platform in the country of Timor-Leste, still really needs system 
improvements and more development on all the factors that affect its use, especially among businesspeople or MSMEs 
business environment themselves during the pandemic. Covid-19 which also significantly changed business behavior 
and consumer behavior itself, but the intervention of the covid-19 recovery for MSME's program provides its own 
benefits for MSME actors such as increasing digital business literacy, as reported in (Endline Report Covid-19 
Recovery for MSME's Program, 2022). However, this research supported by the results of the report from the final 
survey of the program which found that 95% of program participants or program beneficiaries said the training helped 
improve their digital skills and 100% of program participants reported that the training helped improve their financial 
skills and about 3 of the trainees (32%) made one digital transaction per month since they signed up for a MOSAN 
account during the training. Excluding frequency of use, approximately 65% of trainees have used MOSAN at least 
once since the date of their training, but this is slightly different from the transaction data shared by Telemor from the 
endline survey results, which show that 78% of trainees reported using MOSAN at least once since the training 
(Endline Report Covid-19 Recovery for MSME's Program, 2022). 
7. Proposed Improvements
Based on the results of research and analysis, as well as observations made, the researchers recommending to build
trust for concepts and technologies that are considered very new such as MOSAN, and expanding on MSMEs in other
areas or even the community about the importance of digital literacy and how people in the regions have basic
knowledge or digital business literacy so that they are able to adapt to developments and changes that continue to
occur in the business world. Meanwhile seeing the actual conditions experienced by MSMEs, Mercy Corps should
design a more realistic program to answer the needs of MSMEs in conducting transactions such as facilitating the
formation of a market or business relationship circle that facilitates their marketing and supply chain, also there is a
need for performance evaluation and improvement during program implementation, as well as preparation and
analysis of situations that are more contextualized for program implementation, such as conditions or infrastructure
that can facilitate MSMEs in using the digital platform. Digital services such as MOSAN, including the selection of
target beneficiaries needs to be increase their marketing skills with specific training for capacity building according
to the needs in the field for Telemor marketing staff and agents from MOSAN itself. Further, most important to build
a better supporting infrastructure (facilitating Conditions) to support the use of network services and MOSAN itself
and designing a better marketing strategy and increasing the number of MOSAN users in accordance with the situation

Abstract 
A stock is one of the assets sold by a company in the capital market. The capital market is one of the facilitators to 
distribute funds from the parties that have excess funds to the parties that need more funds. A rise that happened 
because of the number of stocks traded and the high volume of trading pushes the development of the capital market 
in Indonesia. Stock prices are formed when supply and demand happen in the capital market. The manipulation of 
financial statements, stock portfolios, and COVID-19 led to changes in the stock price of the insurance sector. This 
study aims to determine the variables that can affect the stock price. The variables used in this study are managerial 
ownership, sales growth, total assets turnover ratio, and premium growth ratio of insurance sub-sector companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018 – 2020. The sample for this study is selected by using the purposive 
sampling method. For the three-year observation, 45 data samples are used. After the outlier, the data samples are 
changed to 36. The research method for this study is panel data regression analysis. The results showed that managerial 
ownership, sales growth, total assets turnover ratio, and premium growth ratio affect the stock price. Managerial 
ownership and premium growth ratio positively affect the stock price, while sales growth and total assets turnover 
ratio do not affect the stock price.

1. Introduction
In investment activities, stock prices are essential to investors' consideration. A stock price is an applicable price per 
share in a capital market. Stock prices can reflect investors' assessments of the company's current performance and 
prospects (Bodie et al. 2018). When the market is more confident in the company's performance, the stock price will 
rise. Higher prices can make it easier for companies to increase capital and encourage investment activities. Thus, 
stock prices play an important role in capital allocation to the market economy (Bodie et al. 2018). 
In recent years, there have been cases of sub-insurance companies. The case of PT Asuransi Jiwasraya has been a 
public concern because of the alleged manipulation of financial information. Apart from Jiwasraya, PT Asuransi 
Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia (Asabri) is also suspected of manipulating stock prices and harming the 
country up to IDR 23.7 trillion. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic that hit in 2020 caused global economic 
uncertainty, resulting in investors being careful in investing to avoid possible losses. 
The impact caused by the cases that occurred was a loss of public and investor confidence. Jiwasraya's case caused 
the Joint Stock Price Index to decline and the number of transactions from investors shrank (Kusuma 2021). The case 
also led many investors to turn to bond investment because they felt stock investment was too risky (Fauzia 2020). In 
addition, the decline in stock prices is not necessarily due to poor performance as many insurance companies recorded 
positive performance in 2020.

company's premium can affect the stock price. When a company experiences positive premium growth, investors 
will assess its performance well, making investors decide to invest their capital. 
 
The result is consistent with the thought framework created and with the research by Mutia Krisnawati & Nurdin 
(2020)  and Irfan Anggun Widiyono et al. (2017), which states that the premium growth ratio has a positive effect on 
stock prices. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the research results and the discussions that have been made, the conclusions obtained are as follows: 
 
1. The results of the descriptive statistics analysis are as follows: 
 
a. 
The average stock price of insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018 – 2020 is -
0.0314, with a standard deviation of 0.2009. The maximum number is 0.6807, and the minimum number is 
-0.4333. 
b. The average managerial ownership of insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018 
– 2020 is 4,2770, with a standard deviation of 11,1449. The maximum number is 46,8611, and the 
minimum number is 0.0000. 
c. 
The average sales growth of insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018 – 2020 is 
-0.0783, with a standard deviation of 20,2508. The maximum number is 84.3856, and the minimum number 
is -36.2665. 
d. The average total assets turnover ratio of insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 
2018 – 2020 is 26,6880, with a standard deviation of 16,7682. The maximum number is 87,2460, and the 
minimum number is 8,2242. 
e. 
The average premium growth ratio of insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018 
– 2020 is 3,8780, with a standard deviation of 27,0404. The maximum number is 84,9282, and the 
minimum number is -37,6213. 
 
2. Based on the results of the simultaneous test, it can be inferred that the variables of Managerial Ownership, Sales 
Growth, Total Assets Turnover Ratio, and Premium Growth Ratio simultaneously affected the share price of 
insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2018 to 2020. 
 
3. Based on the partial test results are as follows: 
a. 
Managerial ownership positively affects the Stock Price of insurance companies listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange in 2018 - 2020. 
b. Sales growth does not affect stock prices in insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 
2018 - 2020. 
c. 
Total Assets Turnover Ratio does not affect Stock Price in insurance companies listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange in 2018 - 2020. 
d. Premium Growth Ratio positively affects Stock Price in insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange in 2018 - 2020.

Abstract 
A financial statement is a piece of information that contains a company's position and financial performance that can 
be used as material for decision-making for its users; the information in the financial statements must be presented 
relevantly and reliable; in other words, it needs to be integrity. However, cases of fraud in financial statements still 
occur frequently, indicating the poor integrity of financial statements in a company. This definition indicates that the 
company has not presented relevant and reliable financial statements. This study aims to determine the effect of 
managerial ownership, independent commissioner, auditor industry specialization, and profitability on the integrity of 
financial statements of insurance sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017 – 2020. The sample 
for this study is selected by using the purposive sampling method. For the four-year observation, 48 data samples are 
used. After the outlier, the data samples changed to 41. The research method for this study is panel data regression 
analysis. The result showed that managerial ownership, independent commissioner, auditor industry specialization, 
and profitability affect the integrity of financial statements. Partially, managerial ownership has a positive effect, 
profitability has a negative effect, while independent commissioner and auditor industry specialization do not affect 
the integrity of financial statements.

1. Introduction
According to PSAK No. 1 (2021), financial statements are the structured presentation of an entity's financial position 
and financial performance. From this statement, it can be seen that the financial statements contain important 
information about the financial conditions of a company for creditors, investors, and anyone interested in it. 
Information in financial statements that can be used for decision-making should meet two characteristics: relevant and 
relatable (Dewi and Putra 2016). An excellent financial statement is a financial statement that is not fabricated or, in 
other words, under actual conditions, if it has been fulfilled, means that the financial statements presented are of high 
integrity. The integrity of a financial statement shows that reported information is presented honestly, unbiased, and 
reasonably (Dewi and Putra 2016). Measuring the integrity of a financial statement can use the principle of 
conservatism. 
According to Himawan (2019), this principle of conservatism is the principle of caution regarding uncertainty to 
protect the rights of lenders and shareholders. The principle of conservatism can be used to lower the risk of 
manipulating frequent financial statements (Dwidinda et al. 2017). This principle of caution is expected to help to 
produce integrity financial statements. This measurement of conservatism was used using the formulas Ghivoly and 
Hayn 2000 as done in the study of (Dwidinda et al. 2017). Negative results indicate that the company does not apply 
accounting conservatism and the positive results indicate that it does not apply accounting conservatism.

5.6.3 The Influence Effects of Auditor Industry Specialization on the Integrity of Financial Statements 
The auditor's industry specialization is an auditor who understands the industry—management of accounting and work 
experience regarding client business to carry out audits of high quality. Based on the results of the tests conducted 
using the panel data, the probability value of the auditor industry specialization commissioner was 0.9323 > 0.05 with 
a negative coefficient of -3.91E-05, indicating that H02 was accepted and Ha2 was rejected, so it can be inferred that 
the auditor industry specialization does not affect the integrity of financial statements. The result indicates that or not 
an auditor who audits a company cannot affect the integrity of financial statements. 
The result does not support research from Fajaryani (2015) and Kartika and Nurhayati (2018) but is consistent with 
research by Ramadani and Triyanto (2020) that an auditor's industry specialization did not affect the integrity of 
financial statements. 
5.6.4 The Influence of Profitability on the Integrity of Financial Statements 
Profitability is the ratio to assess the ability of an individual. The company is generating its profits based on asset 
level. Based on the results of the tests conducted using panel data regression, the probability value of the profitability 
variable was 0.0006 < 0.05 with a negative coefficient of -0.011475, indicating that H01 was rejected and Ha1 was 
accepted, so it can be concluded that the profitability variable has a negative effect on this. The severity of the financial 
statements. The result shows that despite a decline in profitability, the integrity of financial statements tends to 
increase. It is because companies continue to improve the presentation of integrity financial statements despite 
declining profitability. Information in financial statements is urgently needed for their users as a guideline for decision-
making, so the information presented must be honest, relevant, and reliable. 
The results of this study do not support Vitolla et al. (2020) and Ni Putu Intan Permata Sari et al. (2022),  but are 
consistent with research by Himawan (2019) that profitability negatively affects the integrity of financial statements. 
6. Conclusion
1. Descriptive statistics analysis:
a. The mean managerial ownership of insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017 –
2020 is 1,5959 and standard deviation is 7,5170.

and standard deviation is 2,1506.
d. The mean integrity of financial statements of insurance companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in
2017 – 2020 is -0,0114 and standard deviation is 0,0472.
e. In the insurance sub-sector listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017 – 2020, there were 25 companies
audited by auditors who specialized in the insurance industry and 16 companies not audited by auditors. It has
a specialization in the insurance industry.
2. The result showed that simultaneously four independent variables in this study have an impact on the integrity of
financial statements. Partially, managerial ownership has an positive effect, profitability have an negative effect,
while independent commissioner and auditor industry specialization have no effect on integrity of financial
statements.

Abstract 
Firm value is aspects that investors can recognize in monetary terms on the firm's ability to utilize assets to be 
considered in making investment decisions. The better the value of the firm reflects its ability to manage its assets to 
improve company performance. This study aims to determine the effect of Capital Structure as proxied by Debt to 
Asset Ratio (DAR), Capital Expenditure, and Independent Commissioner on Firm Value in Manufacturing Companies 
in the Pharmaceutical Sub-Sector Listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for the 2016-2021 period. The firm 
value used in this study was measured using Tobin's Q. The population in this study is the Pharmaceutical Sub-Sector 
Manufacturing Companies Listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) for the 2016-2021 period. The sampling 
technique is using purposive sampling. Based on the predetermined sampling criteria, ten companies were obtained, 
so the observational data obtained amounted to 60 samples. After the outlier, the data samples changed to 48. The data 
collection method in this research is secondary data. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis and panel data 
regression analysis using Eviews version 12. The results showed that capital structure, capital expenditure, and 
independent commissioner simultaneously affect firm value. Partially, an independent commissioner has a negative 
effect on firm value, while the capital structure and capital expenditure do not affect firm value.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing companies that go public on the Indonesia Stock Exchange include the basic and chemical industries, 
the various industrial sectors, and the consumer goods industrial sector (IDX). Manufacturing companies themselves 
are defined as companies whose activities are managing raw materials so that goods are finished and then sold to 
consumers (Kayo, 2021). Based on Government Regulation (PP) No. 14 of 2015 as a derivative of Law (UU) No. 3 
of 2014 concerning Industry The pharmaceutical industry is designated as one of the ten priority industries in the 
National Industrial Development Master Plan (RIPIN) which is part of the National Long-Term Development Plan 
(RPJPN). There are 12 pharmaceutical companies listed on the IDX (Aksara, 2021). (Figure 1) 
Market capitalization is seen from 3 (three) pharmaceutical companies with the highest market capitalization of 7 
other pharmaceutical companies in terms of closing share prices and the number of shares outstanding in the 2016-
2020 period. Figure 1 Of the three companies with market capitalization in 2016, the highest was achieved by Kalbe 
at 71.015 and the lowest was Indofarma at 14.504, the highest was achieved by Kalbe at 79.218 and the lowest was 
Kimia Farma at 14.995, in 2018 the highest was achieved by Kalbe at 71.250 and the lowest by Kimia Farma at 
14.440, in 2019 the highest was achieved by Kalbe. Amounted to 75.937 and the lowest was Kimia Farma 6.942, in 
2020 the highest was achieved by Kalbe of 69.371 and the lowest was Indofarma 16,426, in 2021 the highest was 
achieved by Kalbe of 75.703 and the lowest was Indofarma 7.276, which means business growth at PT. Kalbe is higher 
than other similar companies.

Based on the research table, which examines the effect of capital structure, capital expenditure and independent 
commissioners on firm value, it can be concluded as follows: (Figure 9) 
 
Y = 5,599726 – 1,390412 (X1) – c (X2) – 5,491493 (X3) + e 
Description: 
Y = Firm value 
X1 = Capital structure 
X2 = Capital expenditure 
X3 = Independent Commissioner 
e= Error term 
 
The above equation can be described as follows: 
 
1. The constant value of 5,599726 can be interpreted as if the variables of capital structure, capital expenditure and 
independent commissioners are constant, then the firm value is 5,599726. 
2. The capital structure regression coefficient is 1,390412. 
3. Capital expenditure regression coefficient is 1,390412. 
4. The independent commissioner's regression coefficient is 5,491493. 
 
The Influence of Capital Structure on the Firm Value  
Based on the table above, the results of the t statistical test or partial test are obtained that the probability value of the 
capital structure is 0.1613. The probability value of capital structure in this study is greater than the significance value 
of 0.05 with a coefficient value of -1.390412, which reveals that H0 is accepted and rejected, with the keyword that 
the structure partially cannot affect a firm value. The result is not consistent with the hypothesis that has been built on 
the framework. Capital structure as an operational variable that uses the Debt to Assets Ratio (DAR) is a ratio to 
determine the effect of company debt on asset management. From the measurement results of the ratio measurement, 
if the DAR value is high, many investments use debt. A high DAR value will make it difficult for the company to 
obtain additional loans because it is considered unable to meet its debts with its assets. Meanwhile, if the DAR value 
is low, there are fewer companies to finance the company from debt. 
 
The Influence of Capital Expenditure on the Firm Value 
Based on the table above, the t statistical or partial test results are obtained that the probability capital expenditure 
value is 0.3757. The probability value of capital expenditure is greater than the significance value of 0.05 with a 
coefficient value of -1.650249, which reveals that H0 is accepted, and Ha is rejected. Thus, it can be concluded that 
capital expenditure partially does not affect firm value. The result is not consistent with the hypothesis that has been 
built on the framework. Capital expenditure as an operational variable is the ratio between total non-current or long-
term assets (property, plant, and equipment) and total current and non-current assets. From the results of the ratio 
measurement, if the value of capital expenditure is very high, it indicates good company performance in deciding on 
capital investments made by company managers. Meanwhile, if the value of capital expenditure is low, it indicates 
poor company performance in deciding on capital investment by company managers. 
 
The Influence of Independent Commissioner on the Firm Value 
Based on the table above, the results of the t statistical test or partial test show that the probability value of the 
independent commissioner is 0.0122. The probability value of the independent commissioner is smaller than the 
significance value of 0.05 with a coefficient value of -5.491593, which reveals that H0 is rejected, and Ha is accepted. 
Thus, it can be concluded that the independent commissioner partially has a negative effect on firm value. The result 
is consistent with the hypothesis built on the framework of thought. Independent commissioners as operational 
variables are the ratio between the number of independent commissioners and the total number of independent 
commissioners and commissioners. From the results of the ratio measurement, the size of the number of independent 
commissioners does not directly affect the company's value. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the findings of the research, three independent variables in this study have an impact on the firm value. Then 
partially, the independent commissioner significantly negatively affects the firm value. At the same time, the capital 
structure and expenditure have no significant impact on the timely submission of financial statements. It is 
recommended that further research for the development of further research is expected to increase the range of the

research period and the operationalization of the variables of each variable studied. So that the research results 
obtained are expected to be more detailed, and further researchers in measuring firm value can use other variables that 
have not been investigated in this study.

Abstract 
This study aims to examine the effect of Proper Rating, Industrial Type, and Gender Diversity on Carbon Emission 
Disclosure. The population used in this study is LQ45 companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange with a 
research period of 2019-2021. The method of sample selection is done by purposive sampling. Only 23 companies 
meet the criteria. The hypothesis in this study was tested using the F-test and t-test. The data analysis technique used 
in this study is the classic assumption test and multiple linear regression test. The results of the study showed that all 
variables were declared free of interference from existing classical assumptions. From the result of multiple linear 
regression tests, the results of the f test are obtained at 4.839184 with a significant value of 0,004 less than 0,05. This 
means that Proper Rating, Industrial Type and Gender Diversity on Carbon Emission Disclosure in LQ45 Companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2019-2021 have a significant simultaneous effect. Partial testing shows 
results Gender Diversity has a negative effect on Carbon Emission Disclosure, while Proper Rating and Industrial 
Type do not affect Carbon Emission Disclosure.

1. Introduction
Climate change is the result of the phenomenon of global warming which has a negative impact on people's life 
activities. The negative impacts of climate change include a rise in sea surface temperature, extreme weather intensity, 
changes in rainfall patterns and large waves (Nurhayati et al., 2020). Carbon pollution is one of the problems found in 
carbon accounting. Explained that the company's carbon accounting reporting can be combined with corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) reporting. Through carbon emission disclosure, stakeholders can assess a company's participation 
in reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) and as a sign of the company's concern for the surrounding environment. (Figure 
1). The phenomena related to the environment that are happening today are not only related to the company's 
responsibility to the surrounding environment. However, the global issue is climate change caused by the activities of 
companies that produce excessively emitted gases. Climate change makes it mandatory for companies to reduce the 
gas emissions produced by conducting carbon trading (emission trading). Companies must be able to maximize 
greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and be able to include accounting and management capabilities in the context of 
budgeting for the purchase or sale of emission loans in the future (Pratiwi, 2018)  
In 2021, Indonesia is the country with the fifth largest producer of carbon emissions in the world with an average 
number of emissions of 4.1% of the total of 2,500 billion tons from 1850 to 2021. So that Indonesia produced 102.5 
billion tons from 1850 to 2021 (Sari, 2022). One example of a decrease in environmental quality is the case of air 
pollution carried out by the company PT. Adaro Power is a subsidiary of PT. Adaro Energy in 2018. The company 
causes damage to the surrounding environment, from rare and even polluted clean water, mud polluting rice fields, 
and less productive agricultural areas to air pollution due to the dust of coal transportation traffic.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the impact and benefits of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program carried 
out by one of the extractive companies in Indonesia, namely PT. Pertamina Semarang Integrated Terminal. Since 
2017, PT. Pertamina Integrated Terminal Semarang has implemented a community empowerment program for the 
Mangrove Community. The coastal area conservation activities carried out by the CAMAR Group in the northern 
coastal area of Semarang City have had a significant impact on the carrying capacity of the northern coastal area of 
the island of Java. On the one hand, CSR activities have succeeded in creating environmental conservation and 
preservation efforts in coastal areas. On the other hand, they have also been able to improve the welfare of the 
mangrove community members. To measure the impact and benefits of the CSR program designed by PT. Pertamina, 
this research will use an evaluative analysis of Social Return on Investment (SROI), which was carried out 
retrospectively and based on our findings in the field from 2017 to 2021. The SROI analysis shows CSR ""CAMAR 
Mangrove Community"" by PT. Pertamina Integrated Terminal Semarang has started to provide benefits and 
empowerment for the Mangrove Community on the North Coast of Semarang City. The SROI ratio of this program 
is 1:1.94 at the end of the project.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the influence of dependent and independent variables simultaneously and partially. The 
variables in the study consisted of pressure (financial stability), opportunity (nature of industry), rationalization 
(accrual accounting), capability (change of directors), arrogance (frequency of appearance of CEO photos), and 
collusion (market performance) on financial statement fraud. The population used is manufacturing companies in the 
basic and chemical industry sub-sectors that are consistently listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2019-
2021. The sample selection technique uses the purposive sampling technique, which uses 147 sample data and is 
processed using SPSS 25 software and the analysis tool used in this study is logistic regression analysis. The test 
results show that the variables of independent pressure, opportunity, rationalization, capability, arrogance, and 
collusion simultaneously affect financial statement fraud. Meanwhile, partial testing shows that financial stability has 
a positive effect and changes in directors have a negative effect. Meanwhile, the nature of industry, accrual accounting, 
the frequency of the appearance of CEO photos, and market performance has no effect on financial statement fraud.

1. Introduction
The stock exchange owned by Indonesia, namely the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), is useful as a forum to become 
a means, facilitate, organize the sale and purchase of securities, and make rules for the sale and purchase of shares in 
the capital market. The Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) has one of sector, namely the manufacturing sector, which 
according to the Minister of Industry Mr. Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, during the 2nd quarter of 2020, the 
manufacturing sector still contributed the largest to the structure of the national gross domestic product (GDP) which 
reached 19.87 percent. Despite the pressure caused by the Covid-19 pandemic that entered Indonesia since the 
beginning of 2020 and while of contracting national economic conditions, a number of manufacturing subsectors 
continued to record positive performance in the 2nd quarter of 2020. (www.kemenperin.go.id)

committed financial statement fraud. In other words, the high concentration caused by the large market performance 
ratio does not cause fraud in the company's financial statements. 
5. Conclusion
This study aims to determine the effect of financial stability (ACHANGE), nature of industry (RECEIVABLE), 
accrual accounting (TATA), changes in directors (DCHANGE), CEO picture, and market performance (PBV) on 
financial statement fraud in manufacturing companies in the basic and chemical industry sectors that are consistently 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2019-2021 which includes 47 research samples. The test results show 
that the variables of independent pressure, opportunity, rationalization, capability, arrogance, and collusion 
simultaneously affect financial statement fraud. Meanwhile, for partial testing, it shows that financial stability has a 
positive effect and changes in directors have a negative effect. Meanwhile, the nature of industry, accrual accounting, 
the frequency of the appearance of CEO photos, and market performance have no effect on financial statement fraud. 
further research is recommended to be able to add longer years of research as well as newer years to obtain more 
accurate results. Further research is also expected to select other sectors contained in the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
(IDX). It is expected for company management to be more thorough and careful in presenting financial reports, in 
order to be able to present the right data so that users can make the right decisions. Then the company’s management 
is also expected to pay attention to the condition of the company's financial stability. This research suggests to potential 
investors that hexagon fraud can be one of the considerations and evaluation materials in investing. Then potential 
investors are also advised to know the company's financial stability to predict the state of the company in the future.

Abstract 
Disney characters always lead to gender development. Like a Disney princess who always depends on her 
prince to save her life. But now, the pattern is experiencing changes that occur in female characters. Women 
are no longer in a passive position, but they begin to develop to be strong, challenging, and independent. 
Through this paper, researchers will discuss several phases of the transition of female characters in Disney 
film production. By focusing on research questions, namely, how the nature of Disney women experiences a 
shift as a form of gender equality? To answer this question, researchers will use qualitative research methods 
that emphasize the depth of research and the results of the Disney film analysis.

1. Introduction
Disney comes with presenting many characters, ranging from the Princess character such as Aurora in 
Sleeping Beauty (1959), Giselle in Enchanted (2007), to Tiana in The Princess and the Frog (2009). Based 
on several examples from the Disney princess movies, Disney has remained consistent in presenting the 
prince figure needed to complete the presence of the Princess characters in the film. This must have happened 
for a reason. In a previous study by Sabrina Fischer (2010)1 regarding the depiction of gender in children's 
animated films, it was found that male characters occupy more major and minor characters than children's 
animated films. Male characters also have a higher diversity of images, characteristics and behaviours than 
female characters with the percentage of male characters 84% and female characters 16%. As seen in the 
graph below:

Figure 2. Nala leads a group of lionesses to attack King Scar and the Hyena army.  
(Source: The Lion King, 2019, Timecode: 23:49)  
 
This scene finally opened the eyes of the audience that if the figure of the female lion in the film was allowed 
to have a more vital role or lead, they could also be in that position, and defeat All Hyena's troops attacked. 
However, it is unfortunate from the beginning to the middle of the movie, the role of a female lion such as 
does not exist and is very minimal. The focus of the audience is only directed to the part of kings who 
exchange leadership and put aside the part of female lions, who should also get an important role. Although 
Nala and Sarabi are not the main female characters, they have begun to dare to voice their opinions and rebel 
to try to fight regulations that if they are detrimental to their groups. This is an excellent initial step for female 
supporting characters in Disney film that dreams of absolute equality. 
6. Conclusion 
After successfully answering research questions related to several transitional phases of the female Disney 
characters, the author can conclude that along with the times, the films produced by Disney have adapted the 
social values that exist in society. Disney seems to have developed to harmonize the various opinions and 
thoughts that exist on several types of social issues. Disney began to balance presenting a more accurate and 
relatable portrayal of gender. In addition, through the shift in roles, female viewers can trust their abilities 
more and are more confident that they can also have the same strengths and opportunities as other male roles 
that have always been showed to be strong and independent. Not only focusing on the part of the Disney 
princess who transformed into a leader and leading role in the film. However, now women's supporting roles 
have also begun to be given the same opportunity to express their opinions and take a stand. Some are 
rebelling against the leadership system which is always dominated by men's roles. Although the rebellion 
carried out by female characters tends to be minimal and requires more support, in general, this has progressed 
significantly for the development of female roles in the next Disney film. Thus, film media, which is 
considered more effective in gender development, can participate in voicing gender equality to a broader 
audience. 
With various findings that have been described in the literature review chapter and evidence in the analysis 
chapter, the author concludes that in producing its films, Disney always pours out a thought that adapts to the 
current era or generation. So, their loyal audience can grow together with Disney movies. The first generation 
seems to have room for nostalgia, while the next generation can perpetuate the values established by Disney.

Abstract 
This study examines the influence of financial literacy, risk aversion, mediating effect of persuasion on insurance 
demand in Indonesia. A survey questionnaire was conducted among 240 respondents in the productive age range, 
around 18 to 45 years old. The result of hypothesis testing was conducted by Smart PLS 3.0. The result shows that 
financial literacy and risk aversion were directly and significantly related to persuasion. Financial literacy and risk 
aversion have positive influence towards insurance demand. Persuasion significantly mediates the relationship 
between insurance demand, financial literacy, and risk aversion. Financial literacy is directly proportional to the 
increasing of insurance demand. People tend to buy insurance to avoid risk when they are prone to accidents, have 
health issues, or to protect their wealth. Since insurance provides non-direct benefit where people will get the benefit 
through some conditions, consumer is needed to be educated, convinced, motivated, and advised to enroll in an 
insurance policy. Further research can be explored in more factors such as different age groups like Gen X, Gen Y, 
Millennials to see the influence of age group on insurance demand. Since this research only focus on Indonesian 
people, respondents from other country or region may lead to other findings. Political situation, pandemics and 
geographic factors also can be used to provide more explanation on what factors that influence insurance demand 
completely.

1. Introduction
2020 is called a challenging year for some people. Since the COVID-19 case was first discovered in Indonesia in 
March 2020, it is estimated that around 22,138 people have died within one year due to this pandemic outbreak (CNN 
Indonesia, 2021). It is undeniable that the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed the wheels of the economy and changed 
the way we manage our finances and manage our daily needs. According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs by Abraham 
Maslow (1943), the need for security and safety is one of the needs needed for humans to survive (Djoni & Rahardjo, 
2021). On that basis, some people choose insurance to fulfill a sense of security. A series of surveys were conducted 
with the public in the UK, USA, and Spain between March and June 2020, and they found that 30% of respondents 
said COVID-19 had made them more likely to consider having insurance (Low et al 2021). 
Based on data from the Indonesian Life Insurance Association, in 2015, the percentage of life insurance owners was 
21.57% of the total life population in Indonesia, then 17.94% in 2016, 18.78% in 2017, 17.76% in 2018, 19.91% in 
2019, and 23.82% in 2020. Although the trend is increasing, this percentage is still tiny when compared to other 
countries in Asia, such as Singapore, Malaysia, India, and China. However, the potential for insurance development 
in Indonesia is still tremendous. 
According to Setiadie (2019), the insurance market in Indonesia is included in the perfect competition market, which 
is characterized by many insurance companies that compete and do not dominate in specific segments. Insurance in 
Indonesia has competitiveness at a medium level below Malaysia and Singapore. It has enormous domestic potential 
for increasing the competitiveness of the national insurance industry. According to Warta Ekonomi (2018), public 
awareness of insurance is still low, and industry penetration is below 3%. Unsaturated market growth, significant 
growth in the middle class, and public literacy on insurance and finance are the driving factors for progress in the 
insurance sector in Indonesia.

Table 6 presents the results of the indirect influence (mediation) contained in this research model. Financial Literacy 
has no direct effect on Insurance Demand (β = 0.164, t = 3.382, p<0.05). Risk Aversion also has no direct effect on 
Insurance Demand (β = 0.296, t = 4.367, p<0.05). 
 
Table 6. Summary of the In-Direct Effect 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
Based on the data analysis results and the formulated hypothesis, it can be concluded that Financial Literacy has a 
direct positive impact on Insurance Demand. It is in line with He (2020), which states that financial knowledge has a 
significant positive effect on increasing public demand for insurance. Increased financial knowledge drives higher 
insurance purchases and increases average annual premiums. Financial knowledge education is also needed to 
encourage public participation in buying insurance. 
 
Risk Aversion directly to Insurance Demand. In purchasing an insurance policy, consumers tend to choose a social 
insurance policy to avoid risk when there is a vulnerability. These findings are supported by the study of Wilfred 
(2020), which emphasizes that several individual risk attitudes towards purchasing insurance are (1) regarding their 
perception of financial risk as health risks, (2) related to exposure to safety and environmental risks, and (3) experience 
of these incidents. From some of these risks, people will make decisions to avoid risk by buying more insurance 
compared to people who are less risk averse. 
 
Persuasion as a direct mediating variable on Insurance Demand. Insurance is one type of business that is very 
dependent on persuasion. Prospective buyers of insurance policies will delay their decision to buy insurance without 
the intervention of insurance agents or influence from others. Insurance policies offer an intangible benefit to their 
sales. Hence, consumers need to be educated, persuaded, counseled, motivated, and persuaded to act. Low et al. 
(2021). 
 
Meanwhile, Financial Literacy mediates the indirect relationship between Insurance Demand, Risk Aversion, and 
Insurance Demand. Thus, persuasion will positively impact the relationship between Financial Literacy, Risk 
Aversion, and Insurance Demand. 
 
There are several significant findings from our study. The salient result is that Persuasion is the primary determinant 
of Insurance Demand. Thus, the influence or recommendations of the people around can increase the demand for 
insurance. Our results confirm that individuals' expectations of insurance benefits significantly influence insurance 
desirability or demand. 
 
The results obtained from the hypothesis prove that financial literacy, Risk Aversion, and Persuasion affect Insurance 
Demand. However, in this study, the hypothesis submitted is fulfilled, and each variable has a significant relationship. 
There are several inputs for improvement and further research. For example, changing the object of research from 
people of productive age to people in the age range of the millennial, Gen Z, Gen Y, and Baby Boomer categories to 
see the relationship between age groups and insurance demand. In addition, research on respondents in other areas 
will undoubtedly be more exciting and produce more varied results.  
 
Furthermore, further research is recommended to examine other factors that can affect insurance demand, such as 
internal factors (gender, educational background, income, age, and type of work) and external factors 
(macroeconomics, pandemics, politics, and geographical location). This will undoubtedly contribute a lot to 
businesspeople in the economic industry in sharpening analysis and strategies to create opportunities and attract as 
many new insurance owners as possible in Indonesia and globally.

Abstract 
Information about earnings has an important role for internal and external parties in the company's decision making. 
Profit that can describe the sustainability of earnings in the future is one of the characteristics of quality earnings. 
Investors should not only pay attention to high profits, but also pay attention to persistent earnings. This study aims 
to examine the factors that affect earnings persistence. The population in this study are food & beverage companies 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. The sample used purposive sampling and obtained 
a sample of 16 companies with a period of 5 years so that 80 samples were obtained. Earnings Persistence is proxied 
by Profit Before Tax ratiod to Average Total Assets. Sales Volatility is proxied by Sales in a ratio of Total Assets, 
and Operational Cash Flow Volatility is proxied by Total Operating Cash Flows ratioed to Total Assets. The results 
showed that sales volatility had a positive effect on earnings persistence and operating cash flow volatility had a 
positive effect on earnings persistence.  
Keywords 
 Earnings persistence, Sales Volatility, Operating Cash Flow Volatility. 
1. Introduction
One way to be able to see the company's performance can be seen from the annual profit that the company generates. 
If the company has a persistent profit, it can be said that the company's performance is good. Information about 
earnings has an important role for internal and external parties in the company's decision making. Profit that can 
describe the sustainability of earnings in the future is one of the characteristics of quality earnings. The purpose of 
the continuation of the profit is the ability of the profit to be able to survive in the future in a healthy condition. 
Therefore, investors must not only pay attention to high profits, but also must pay attention to persistent profits, which 
means that they are sustainable for the future. By looking at earnings persistence, stakeholders can evaluate events in 
previous, present, and future years. Earnings with a high level of persistence are very useful for predicting future 
earnings. 
Earnings persistence can be influenced by other internal factors, namely the volatility of operating cash flows. 
Operating cash flow figures will vary each period according to the company's needs, so the value will be difficult 
to predict. If the change in the value of operating cash flow volatility is very significant in a short time, it can be 
indicated that the operating cash flow value has an error recorded in the financial statements, so this will affect 
the company in maintaining its profits. The results of research by Kusuma & Sadjiarto (2014), stated that there 
was a significant correlation between the volatility of operating cash flows and earnings persistence. Meanwhile, 
research conducted by Sulastri (2014), states that there is no significant correlation between the volatility of 
operating cash flows and earnings persistence. 
Not only internal factors, but earnings persistence can also be influenced by external factors such as sales 
volatility. High sales volatility indicates that there is an estimation error in the value of sales so that profit 
persistence will be low. Profit can be obtained through sales so that sales are the main operating cycle for the 
company. High profit persistence will indicate low sales volatility, so the information has a good signal. This 
explanation is in line with the results of research by Kasiano & Fahrurrozie (2016) which states that sales volatility 
affects earnings persistence. Meanwhile, research conducted by Ariyanti, D., Ermaya, H. N. L., & Nugraheni, R. 
(2021) states that sales volatility does not affect earnings persistence.  
Based on the description of the background above, the formulation of the problem that can be put forward is 
whether sales volatility and operating cash flow volatility affect earnings persistence.

persistence. Meanwhile, research conducted by Sulastri (2014), states that there is no significant correlation between 
the volatility of operating cash flows and earnings persistence. 
6. Conclusion and Suggestions
Conclusions
This study examines the factors that affect profit persistence in Food & Beverage companies listed on the Indonesia
Stock Exchange in 2016-2020. The sample used purposive sampling and obtained a sample of 16 companies with a
period of 5 years so that 80 samples were obtained. The conclusions obtained from this study are as follows: (1) Sales
volatility has a positive effect on profit persistence. These conditions indicate that if sales volatility changes
significantly, it will affect profit persistence. (2) Operational cash flow volatility has a positive effect on profit
persistence. These conditions indicate that if the volatility of operating cash flows experiences a significant change, it
will affect the persistence of profit.
Suggestions 
Based on the conclusions above, some suggestions can be put forward as follows: (1) For further researchers, it is 
expected to add other independent variables that are indicated to influence profit persistence, such as funding cash 
flows and investment cash flows. (2) Future researchers are expected to take a longer period and more samples from 
this study to give good results. The time span used in this study is only 5 years, namely from the 2016-2020 period. 
The addition of a longer period is expected to provide a clearer picture of the relationship that affects profit 
persistence. (3) For potential investors to pay more attention to the persistent profit factor to predict the earnings 
quality of a company to avoid losses.

Abstract 
Fast-growing number of research of Innovation Studies especially innovation process, had been main concerns in 
many research funding organizations. Recent studies on innovation process during merger & acquisition (M&A) 
present information overload that may burden effective academic research and collaboration. Scientometric analysis 
has a possibility for an accurate quantitative analyze and visualize the database into extensive landmark of research 
trend using suitable software tools. This study adopted scientometric analysis on innovation process during M&A 
using VOS Viewer software. Bibliographic data was taken from Scopus database ranged from 2003 to 2022. There 
were 275 documents to be compared and analyzed. Scientometric evaluations described density and network of 
authors, contributing countries & affiliations, and keywords. Number of documents by type and by year were analyzed 
by using data tables and graphics. The results showed that innovation process during M&A was still wide open to be 
discussed in terms of public organizations. Innovation process during M&A was strongly linked to open innovation. 
Meanwhile, to achieve deeper understanding of innovation process, several aspects (such as market and managerial 
challeges) were needed to be discussed carefully. Finally, this study also suggested further research in terms of 
innovation process during M&A

Abstract 
This article investigated the impact of e-audit on the performance of public organizations in Oman as well as the 
relationships between e-audit and performance. This paper also looked at computer activities, e-audit, its advantages, 
related research, and how well it works to improve organizational performance. Additionally, this study used 
questionnaires and surveys to collect data before studying and analyzing the results. To explore the relationship 
between independent variables (E-Audit) and dependent factors (Performance) in research that was planned and 
evaluated using software that was analyzed as part of a theoretical framework, structural modelling was used. To 
examine the suppositional correlations, these results were analyzed using several data paths using SPSS and the Smart-
PLS technique. The results also showed a substantial and favorable relationship between E-Audit performance and 
that of Oman's public organizations.

1. Introduction
Recent years have seen an increase in global rivalry and economic growth in the form of rising foreign investment, 
innovation enterprises, industry production, improved operational efficiency, and software developers. Computer-
related activities are a major factor in developing nations and in enhancing human existence and meeting human needs. 
By utilizing information technology, opportunities are being created for advances in a variety of fields, including 
management systems, financial systems, business components, and the auditing field. If financial systems and 
management systems rely on information technology and computer-related dangers are on the rise, electronic auditing 
is urgently required to lower risks in financial and management system. 
Nonetheless, despite information technology advancements, fraud threats have recently escalated. The risk chance in 
information technology increased as information communication technology spread throughout the world. When a 
risk arises in an auditing environment, auditors can regulate and minimize the possibility of it happening. Additionally, 
the auditors anticipate that adopting computerized auditing activities will reduce the likelihood of fraud (Mubako, et 
4127","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022

make audit performance more efficient, and there are many benefits to doing so in both the public and commercial 
sectors. These conclusions and findings were given in the final section of the report after meeting all the requirements. 
Modernizing audit work sheets can help audit processes become more standardized and consistent, which could 
increase productivity and efficiency. This will make it easier to establish benchmarks for evaluating audit performance. 
Additionally, the use of automated work paper software can speed up audit information organization, decrease the 
time needed for audit file reviews, and enable audit work papers to be reviewed remotely. The investigation also 
advances public administration theory and practice. From a theoretical standpoint, it supports the relationship between 
organizational performance and technology utilization that has been found in earlier research. From a practical 
standpoint, the results imply that government internal auditors who seek to promote efficiency will profit from 
judicious use of information technology to combine their activities and improve execution of chosen measures. This 
requires addressing the restriction on the use of technology by government internal auditors.  The objectives

6.1 Recommendations  
Following the finding of this study, the following recommendations are made: 
 
- 
Oman's enterprises must make sure that audit firms with extensive experience and a large staff are employed        
to improve the company's performance. The quantity of employees in audit firms is a significant driver of the audit 
quality of the audit assignment completed by the auditors. 
- 
The management of most publicly traded companies should use the services of a sizable audit firm with 
technology resources and knowledgeable people in each sector to improve performance and the company's reputation. 
- 
To keep their staff up to date on the latest developments in IT use, ministries should periodically train their 
employees. 
- 
Ministries has to elaborate more about the functions of IT and other technical developments.

Abstract 
This research is a quantitative descriptive study undertaken at PT. In this study, research was conducted on the 
phenomena of users' attitudes in delivering replies, perceptions, and satisfaction, as well as how users were able to 
have an influence on growing the usage of the Finpay Money Application, which was developed by PT.Finnet 
Indonesia. This research's demographic and samples consist of active Finpay Money Application users belonging to 
the millennial generation. This study employs descriptive analysis and multivariate analytic methodologies, with 
data processing performed using SEM-PLS. In addition to the effect of E-WOM on repurchase intention and the 
influence of perceived quality on customer satisfaction, this study's findings indicate that brand image influences 
repurchase intent, customer satisfaction influences repurchase intention, and E-WOM influences brand image. The 
results had no substantial impact on the perceived quality of repurchase intention.

1. Introduction
Recent corporate advancements have resulted in the industrial revolution, which in turn has resulted in the 
digitalization of markets, which has altered the structure of human existence. Infrastructure and information 
technology networks, particularly the Internet, facilitate the expansion of the fourth industrial revolution. Massive 
Internet access enables human mobility that is no longer restricted by place or time. Beginning with the exchange of 
information, the internet can maintain consumer loyalty (brand loyalty), anticipate future needs (forecasting), 
respond to consumer concerns (customer care), and improve customer service (service recovery) in two directions, 
as well as solve problems more quickly and precisely (Lee et al. al., 2013). The internet has been successful in 
promoting the establishment of new enterprises, new hopes, and new business habits that contribute significantly to 
the company's continued existence.

Predictive Significance 
This analysis result demonstrates how well the model fits the observed data. Using the model, estimated figures are 
compared to the original data, and the difference is then measured. If the disparity is significant, it is claimed that the 
model does not correspond. A model that fits the observation data means that the model can be applied to the data 
and the ensuing conclusions can be justified. If Q2 is greater than zero, it is fit. (Table 9)

Abstract 
Over the past few decades, quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have attracted significant attention due to 
the quantum dots sensitiser's unique properties, including, its non-precious synthesis, size-tuneable bandgaps; 
excellent photostability, the ability to generate multiple excitons, and high absorption coefficient that led possible to 
increase power conversion efficiency (PCE) to more than 15% due to their higher molar extinction coefficient and 
tuneable photo-response. This review article outlines a comprehensive overview of the development of the 
performance of QDSSCs including their components fabrications and highlights the challenges and limitations of the 
QDSSCs’ components such as narrow absorption areas and the charge recombination happening at the 
photoanode/electrolyte interfaces and discusses the prospects for the development of highly efficient and stable 
QDSSCs.

1.0 Introduction 
Third-generation solar cells are inherently different from the previous two generations because they do not rely on the 
p-n junction design of the others.  Its concept is an increase in efficiency and the reduction of the production cost of 
the second generation (Kanemitsu, 2011). This new generation of solar cells is being made from a variety of new 
materials besides silicon, including nanomaterials, silicon wires, and solar inks using conventional printing press 
technologies, organic dyes, and conductive plastics. This generation exhibited due to the high costs of first-generation 
solar cells and toxicity and limited availability of materials for second-generation solar cells, a new generation of solar 
cells emerged. Three primary types of third-generation solar cells have been commercially developed: Dye-sensitized 
solar cells (DSSCs), Quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), and Perovskite solar cells. Initially, the material 
used to fabricate quantum dots sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) was researched similarly to that used to fabricate 
DSSCs which was proposed by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991 when they released their first publication on the 
principles of the new system introduced to photovoltaic (PV) conversion by dye-sensitized solar cells (Gopi, Venkata-
Haritha, Lee, & Kim, 2016; Hosseinpanahi, Abbaspour-Fard, Feizy, & Golzarian, 2017; Shitta, Ogedengbe, Familoni, 
& Ogundipe, 2021; Yusuf, Mustafar, Borines, Kusumawati, & Hashim, 2022) but the difference between them is 
replaced organic dyes with inorganic nanosized semiconductors quantum dots (QDs) having the same mechanism as 
that of the DSSC (Hosseinpanahi et al., 2017). 
 
In recent years, numerous researchers from various fields have attracted QDSSCs, including three fields, the first is 
the physical field which is developing novel types of materials for QDSSC fabrication, optimizing, and comprehending 
the photophysical mechanism of QDSSCs, and the second is the chemical field which is pioneering suitable light-
harvesting materials, and finally, engineering field which is constructing novel device architectures for QDSSCs 
(Abate & Chang, 2018; Bhambhani, 2018; Mora-Seró, 2020). The chemistry between these researchers may have a",,,asia 2022

Abstract 
Quickly shocking the heart with an automated external defibrillator (AED) can return a person’s heartbeat back to 
normal. This research explores attitudes and awareness about emergency medical services and AEDs among the 
public. The case study is Prachinburi Province, Thailand. The questionnaire explored information from emergency 
medical staffs and the public involved in the use of emergency medical services. According to the results, most of the 
most common problems with officers' duties include not being able to access residential areas because vehicles are 
inaccessible to individuals (28.75%), respondents know emergency medical services, but most respondents are 
unaware of AEDs (58.75%) and do not know the location of AEDs.

1. Introduction
In the minute of life, if there is only one AED in the place, and it is far from where the patient is unconscious. Help 
may not be timely, so in all locations, AED should be provided in an easy-to-spot spot. Automated External 
Defibrillator (AED) is an electrical device used to automatically diagnose life-threatening arrhythmias and can be 
treated with defibrillation using electricity. It causes the heart to regain its heart at the right moment. An important 
aspect of the resuscitation process is the timely within 4 minutes. If AEDs are installed in government and private 
companies, as well as public space, it increases the chances of survival for emergency patients. Especially, heart arrest, 
sudden cardiac arrest outside the hospital. The AED is useful to immediately assess the patient's situation and provide 
treatment in case of needing an electric current to stimulate the heart function, allowing blood to circulate to the brain 
and other parts of the body in time. Nowadays, Thailand has entered the aging society. The number of critical 
emergency cases in the country is likely to rise sharply. According to statistics (World Bank, 2022), as of 2016, 11% 
of the Thai population (about 7.5 million people) are 65 years or older, compared to 5% in 1995. And by 2040, it is 
projected that 17 million Thais will be 65 years or older – more than a quarter of the population. So, we now need to 
be prepared supported health system for the aging society. Especially for persons with severe diseases. According to

in this study were aware of community rescue calls (75%; n = 62/80), they had received EMS information from 
television with 65.00%. Experience in calling emergency medical services as bystanders 56.41%. Most places of 
emergency occur in public places, 51.28%. Most respondents were unaware of AEDs (58.75%n = 47/80), and have 
no skilled how to use AEDs (82.5%; n = 66/80). In addition, respondents who were able to use the AEDs were trained 
by healthcare officers (20.00%; n = 16/80). Most respondents don’t know where the nearest AED is (81.25%; n = 
65/80). (Table 3) 
5. Conclusion
In this study, respondents who were emergency medical staffs took within 5 minutes to receive an emergency 
notification; the highest number of diseases notified was acute myocardial infarction. The most common problem in 
getting out to help critically ill patients is accessing an emergency facility. For example, the place where the patient 
is located in an area where the vehicle is inaccessible. In part II, most of the non-medical respondents in the Prachinburi 
metropolitan area knew about emergency medical services through television, but most were unaware of AEDs, 
location, and how to use them. 20.00% of respondents knew how to use AEDs from healthcare officers. In general, 
emergency incidence was reported by bystanders, and EMS mostly arrived within 10- 15 minutes.

Abstract 
This research analyzed the productivity and profitability of the shipping services operations on a bulk carrier ship, 
owned by one shipping company in Surabaya called PPS. PPS confronts a problem that the ship was unable to load at 
full capacity due to a limitation on the port’s draft, this happened on PPS’s main route Adang Bay - Cilacap. 
Productivity analysis of the ship using the APC method showed the ship increased on 2 productivity indexes such as 
labor at 113% and other inputs at 106%. Based on profitability indexes the ship increased on 5 profitability such 
as labor 115%, capital 123%, energy 102%, other inputs 103%, and total 101%. During the measurement period, there 
were productivity fluctuations on the ship, caused by inefficiencies such as overtime and increased input. In these 
situations, strategies for the ship developed. The suitable strategy development on Grand Strategy Matrix for the ship 
was SO Strategies. The suitable strategy development on IE Matrix was Hold and Maintain. Finally, the value of this 
research provides whole analysis results in productivity measurement result of the shipping service, improvement to 
increase productivity, and strategies for the shipping service.

DWT. PPS confronts problems in their operation that the ship was unable to load at full capacity due to limitations on 
the port’s draft in Tanjung Intan Cilacap Port. This caused an inoptimal income from their service. Using American 
Productivity Center (APC) can provide productivity measurement results that show how effective existing inputs are 
used in creating income. APC method produces 3 forms of productivity measurement: productivity index, profitability 
index, and price recovery index. In productivity decrease cases, it is necessary to handle the root of the problem to 
create more efficiency in using inputs. Handling the root cause of productivity decrease using fishbone diagrams is 
done by involving brainstorming with experts. Then formulating strategies for PPS to improve its performance in 
providing shipping services.  
This research aims to analyze the ship’s productivity in each input used using the APC method. Stainer (1997) 
explained that productivity is efficient utilization of every input used, and productivity is a vital competitive advantage 
in business, this research analyzes the ship’s productivity in each related input used. Further aims of this research are 
to identify factors causing the productivity declining of the ship using Fishbone. Hristoski et al (2017) explained that 
the process to identify any factors reducing business competitiveness is important for practitioners and managers to 
develop a better business. The further aim is to develop business strategies for the ship. David (2016) explained that 
strategies are a form of plans and commitment to ensure better coordination and performance while avoiding 
inefficiency where the process required internal and external scope understandings of the business, where in this 
research the related internal external scope of shipping service of the ship identified using IFE-EFE matrix. And the 
last aim is to provide recommendations for the ship. Hristoski et al (2017) explained that a better business developed 
after any factors reducing business competitiveness are identified, also recommendations for improvement can be 
done after business competitiveness is analyzed using productivity analysis (Stainer 1997). This research is organized 
as follows. Section 2 presents literature that supports the objective of this research. Section 3 presents methods. Section 
4 presents the findings of the research. Finally, this research conclusion is presented in Section 5.

4.4 Final Recommendations 
The findings of the last objective are recommendations for PPS shipping operations. The first recommendation is 
to handle each root causes that support productivity decrease. These root causes handling recommendations are shown 
in Table 4 to Table 9. The second recommendation is to apply SO strategies and Hold and maintain strategies. These 
strategies were obtained from interviews and discussions with experts and shown in Table 12. 
 
Table 12. SO strategies and hold and maintain strategies recommendation 
 
SO strategies 
Hold and maintain strategies 
1. Operate the ship on the route 
that can perform full capacity 
loads 
so 
that 
the 
income/output can optimal 
2. Work for a new shipper with 
no draft limitation on its ports 
3. Work for a new shipper with 
another kind of bulk cargo 
4. Increase freight price on 
Adang Bay – Cilacap route 
along 
with 
maintaining 
service quality 
5. Increase freight price for 
shipping service in coal 
commodity 
6. Provide lower prices on new 
routes  
7. Prioritizing 
long-term 
shipping work with shippers  
Market penetration 
1. Develop a marketing or R&D team to obtain 
more shipping works. This recommendation 
is also able to create an ideal team and reduce 
the director’s multitasking   
2. Utilize brokers to carry out marketing efforts 
if developing a marketing team requires 
additional costs, takes a long time, or is not 
worth operating rapid flows. In this case, it 
can be realized by maintaining the quality of 
service 
to 
create 
a 
mutual 
working 
relationship with the broker. 
3. Working on new routes or other bulk cargo 
such 
as 
metal, 
minerals, 
etc. 
This 
recommendation is planned for the ship to get 
good price increasement opportunities for 
new commodities loaded. This effort is 
supported by the age of the ship (20 years old 
of usage, young) which can accommodate 
PPS to enter new routes and new shippers. 
Service development 
1. Invests in a new ship to serve Adang Bay – 
Cilacap route. With the new ship, PPS can 
perform full capacity loads or increase the 
operational capability of shipping services 
2. Increase freight price on Adang Bay – Cilacap 
route and freight price for coal cargo. This 
increased price is planned to be an alternative 
to improving income for each shipping service 
worked. This effort can be done by 
maintaining the service quality (no shrinking 
or lessening cargo) to create a mutual working 
relationship with the shipper. 
3. Maintain routes that can perform full capacity 
loads and increase freight prices for existing 
shippers and provide cheaper prices for new 
shippers. The routes that are able to perform 
full capacity loads are: (1) Bunati – Morowali 
44,500 tons, (2) Konawe – Manokwari 45,000 
tons, (3) Kaliorang - Cilacap 44,000 tons, and 
(5) Muara Djawa – Suralaya 45,000 tons. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Productivity of the ship based on APC measurement are: (1) Increased in 2 productivity index such as labor 113% and 
other inputs 106%, (2) Increased in 5 profitability index such as labor 115%, capital 123%, energy 102%, other inputs 
103%, and total 101%, (3) price recovery index indicates the ratio between profitability index and productivity index 
which is necessary for managers to analyze whether the price recovery index value is caused by an increase or decrease 
in productivity index and profitability index. From these results, PPS should provide an improvement on their shipping 
service to ensure each productivity is increased. Each type of productivity (labor, material, energy, capital, and other 
inputs) and total productivity has its decrease in certain periods which is presented in Table 3. These productivity 
decreases are caused by inefficiencies of inputs used such as extended sail time duration (overtime) made entire costs

increase, and inefficiencies of inputs used (fuel, inventory, etc) which are presented in Figure 2 to Figure 7. Strategy 
development using SWOT Analysis produced: SO strategies and hold and maintain strategies recommendations, these 
strategies recommendations shown in Table 12. PPS should apply these strategies to improve its shipping service 
business. The final recommendations for PPS are to prevent any productivity decrease of the ship by handling each 
productivity decrease root causes such as reducing any form of lateness or extended sail time by improving 
coordinations with agents and ports where each handling is shown in Table 4 to Table 9, also applies SO strategies 
and hold and maintain strategies. For further development in the future, the related research to this topic can be done 
by implementing the APC method to measure productivity in a whole company in which the costs are related not only 
in the operational units but also in whole units in a company to improve a whole productivity improvement in a 
company.

Abstract 
This company is experiencing a problem, where it is necessary to improve and adjust the service flow which causes 
customer complaints. The purpose of this study is to analyze the waste that occurs and optimize services by 
providing recommendations for improvement. This study used the concept of Lean Service which is supported by 
Analytical Network Process (ANP) methods and Value Stream Mapping (VSM). The results of this study are the 
identification of 5 waste criteria and 15 waste sub-criteria with a policy of prohibiting goods transporting vehicles 
for entering the office area as the dominant waste. Based on the identification of root causes, 13 root causes of 
dominant waste were obtained and 5 of them were chosen as priority root causes, including the absence of a 
systematic regulatory system related to customer procedures to enter the office, the limited number of workers, 
security guards only on the inside of the building, land use is not optimal, and lack of supervision. Then the 5 
priority root causes are given suggestions for improvement by implementing a new system that contributes to quality 
optimization in reducing non-value added activities and optimizing payment duration.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is a maritime country, where according to UU no. 32 of  2004, Indonesian waters cover two- thirds of the 
entire territory of Indonesia, which is explained in more detail in the Regulation of the Coordinating Minister for 
Maritime Affairs and Investment of the Republic of Indonesia Number 6 of 2020 concerning the Strategic Plan of 
the Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment for 2020-2024, that Indonesia's territorial waters are 
6,400,000 km2 or 77% of the total area of Indonesia, which is 8,300,000 km2. Based on PP no. 20 of 2010, 
transportation in the waters has a very important role in expediting the wheel of the economy. Water transportation 
has a strategic function, namely to support trade and economic activities (ship follows the trade) and stimulate 
economic and regional growth (ship promotes the trade), so that transportation in waters serves as a strategic 
infrastructure for Indonesia as an archipelagic country. The activities of transporting and/or moving goods using 
ships are closely related to shipping companies.  
This company provides goods shipping services. Goods are packed in bags and then shipped by ship. In goods 
delivery services, customer satisfaction needs to be maintained. However, this company is experiencing a problem, 
where it is necessary to improve and adjust the service flow which causes customer complaints because if this 
condition is not corrected immediately, it can result in a decrease in revenue and reputation's company. 
There have been many published studies that related to service quality improvement using lean service concept, but 
most lean methodologies refer to manufacturing industry, where a tangible product exists. Within service 
environments, although there is engagement with the principles of lean, many of the techniques used in the 
manufacturing context are not immediately applicable. Lean service emphasizes the active role of the customer, 
integrating the customer into the service creation. The customer participates in the production process. This presence 
of the customer in the service delivery system brings an element that is new for manufacturing operations because, 
in service activities, the value must be defined by the customer, which customer expectations and satisfaction are 
highly subjective, not measurable through indicators, in contrast to the manufacturing environment. (Andrés-López 
et al, 2015). In addition, no research that specifically analyzes waste from the flow of goods delivery services using

Abstract 
Going concern audit opinion is an audit opinion given by the auditor to a company whose business continuity is in 
uncertainty, caused by unsuitable conditions or the presence of several factors. This study aims to examine the effect 
of Debt Default, Activity Ratio, and Bankruptcy Prediction on Going Concern Audit Opinion. The population used in 
this study are Retail Trading Companies Listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) 2016-2020. The sample 
selection method is done by purposive sampling. Only 16 companies met the criteria. The hypothesis in this study was 
tested using the F test and T test. The data analysis technique used in this study was logistic regression processed by 
using IBM SPSS version 26. From the results of the logistic regression test, the f test results obtained a significance 
of 0.000 or <0.05. This means that Debt Default, Activity Ratio, and Bankruptcy Predictions on Going Concern Audit 
Opinions on Retail Trading Companies Listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2016-2020 have a significant 
simultaneous effect. Partial testing shows the results of debt default and activity ratio have no effect on going concern 
audit opinion, while bankruptcy prediction has a negative effect on going concern audit opinion.

1. Introduction
The purpose of operating a company is to achieve its goals, such as ensuring its prosperity through profit-making in 
order to keep developing, growing, and operating (maintaining its survival) over the long term. Every company 
competes to improve its shortcomings and increase its advantages to survive (going concern). A going concern audit 
opinion becomes a signal to predict the company's ability to continue its business in the future. Hence, this study is 
crucial for companies to assess whether their financial condition is stable to ensure business continuity and for 
investors, to be a consideration when making decisions evaluated from their prospects.

The explanation of the logistic regression equation is as follows: 
 
1) The constant value of 2.250 with a significance level of 0.359 greater than = 0.05 meant that the debt default, 
activity ratio, and prediction variables increased constant or equal to 0, then there was a change that results in a 
going concern audit opinion. 
2) The debt default regression coefficient was 2.040, meaning that if the debt default variable increased by a unit, 
the probability of receiving a going concern audit opinion would increase by 2.040. 
3) The activity ratio coefficient was -1.058, meaning that if the activity ratio variable increased by a unit, the 
probability of receiving a going concern audit opinion would decrease by 1.058. 
4) The bankruptcy prediction coefficient was -0.533, meaning that if the bankruptcy prediction variable increased 
by a unit, the probability of receiving a going concern audit opinion would decrease by 0.533. 
 
5.3 Discussion 
The Influence of Debt Default on Going Concern Audit Opinion 
Based on the partial test results in Table 8, the debt default variable had a significance value of 0.999 > 0.05. It 
indicated that the debt default variable did not partially affect a going concern audit opinion on companies in the retail 
trade sub-sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2020. This result contradicted the hypothesis 
that the debt default has a positive influence on a going concern audit opinion. In other words, the auditor to give a 
going concern audit opinion was not based on the company's failure to pay debt or interest due to its overdue but 
tended to look at the overall financial condition. This is because the company will negotiate a schedule for debt 
repayment to creditors before or after the debt default happens. The results of this study are in line with Astari & 
Latrini (2017) and Kusumawardani & Triyanto (2021), which revealed that debt default does not have an influence 
on a going concern audit opinion. 
 
The Influence of Activity Ratio on Going Concern Audit Opinion 
Based on the partial test results in Table 8, the activity ratio variable had a significance value of 0.069 > 0.05. It 
indicated that the activity ratio variable did not partially affect a going concern audit opinion on companies in the 
retail trade sub-sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2016 to 2020. This result contradicted the 
hypothesis that the ratio activity has a negative influence on a going concern audit opinion. In other words, the activity 
ratio does not affect a going concern audit opinion. Since the increase in inventory turnover does not cover the 
company's lack of costs in paying off its liabilities, the company still has negative equity and losses, so the auditor's 
going concern assumption is still attached to this company. The results of this study are in line Sari et al. (2020), which 
revealed that debt ratio activity does not have an influence on a going concern audit opinion. 
 
The Influence of Bankruptcy Prediction on Going Concern Audit Opinion 
Based on the partial test results, the bankruptcy prediction variable had a significance value of 0.026 < 0.05. It 
indicated that the bankruptcy prediction variable partially affects a going concern audit. The results implied that 
bankruptcy predictions that assess health conditions using the Altman Z-score ratio can predict future potential losses 
for the company. Since if the auditor sees a low bankruptcy prediction calculation value, the company's condition is 
poor for conducting business. Therefore, it affects the provision of a going concern audit opinion. The results of this 
study are in line with (Holiawati & Setiawan, 2016) and (Mubtadi, 2020), which revealed that bankruptcy prediction 
activity have an negative influence on a going concern audit opinion. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research obtained on companies in the retail trade sub-sector listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange from 2016 to 2020 with a sample of 80, the following conclusions are obtained:

Abstract 
Tax avoidance is a strategy or technique carried out by taxpayers for do the tax avoidance safely and legally with 
methods and techniques using grey area contained in the Taxation Law regulations with the aim of minimizing taxes 
paid by companies that can increase company’s income. Although tax avoidance is legal, it can harm the government 
because tax revenue will not be optimal. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of both the simultaneous 
and partial influence of the Executive Characters, Leverage, and Managerial Ownership on Tax Avoidance in 
manufacturing companies sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2020. The population used in this 
study are manufacturing companies sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2020. The sampling 
technique used is purposive sampling to obtain the number of samples used in the study as many as 20 companies 
therefore the total are 60 samples for three years. The data analysis method in this study uses panel data regression 
analysis techniques using software EViews 12. The results of this study indicate that executive characters, leverage, 
and managerial ownership simultaneously affect tax avoidance on manufacturing companies sector listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange 2018-2020. Partially, the executive characters have a positive influence on tax avoidance, 
while leverage and managerial ownership have no influence on tax avoidance on manufacturing companies sector 
listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 2018-2020.

1. Introduction
According to Law no. 16 of 2009, enforced in accordance with law, and taxes are mandatory contributions to the state 
that are owed by individuals and the state is not directly applied for needs of the state to prosper its people. Tax 
payments are a form of obligation as well as a form of participation of state taxpayers in following state tax obligations 
and state development. Based on the State Revenue and Expenditure Budget (APBN) the tax sector is the largest 
source of revenue, reaching 85.65%, the rest comes from non-tax revenues and grants. The role of taxes is very big 
for the state; therefore, the government is trying to increase revenue from the tax sector. However, there are problems 
in the management of tax revenues, one of which is tax avoidance activities carried out by individual or corporate 
taxpayers. Manufacturing companies are the largest contributor to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) so that if many 
manufacturing companies carry out tax avoidance activities, it will greatly affect the country's economic growth. Tax 
avoidance is a strategy or technique carried out by taxpayers to avoid tax safely and legally by using methods and

2. The X1 regression coefficient, namely executive character, is -0.607591 so that for every addition (one) unit of 
executive character with other variables valued at 0 and constant, the CETR value decreases by 0.607591, which 
means tax avoidance will increase by 0.607591. 
3. The X2 regression coefficient is leverage of -0.006651 so that every time there is an addition (one) unit of leverage 
with other variables valued at 0 and constant, the level of CETR value decreases by 0.006651 which means tax 
avoidance will increase by 0.006651. 
4. The X3 regression coefficient is managerial ownership of -0.086697 so that for every additional (one) unit of 
managerial ownership with other variables valued at 0 and constant, the level of CETR value decreases by 0.086697 
which means tax avoidance will increase by 0.086697. 
 
5.4 Discussion 
The Influence of Executive Characters on Tax Avoidance 
Based on the partial test results in table 3 which shows that the executive characters variable has a probability value 
of 0.0098 < from a significance level of 0.05. This shows that H01 is rejected, indicating that the executive characters 
variable has a partial effect on tax avoidance in manufacturing sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange for the 2018-2020 period. The results also show that the executive character has a negative regression 
coefficient value (-0.607591) which indicates that the higher the executive character, the higher the tax avoidance too 
and vice versa. This is in accordance with the researcher's hypothesis which assumes that the executive character has 
a positive effect on tax avoidance. The executive character can affect tax avoidance activities because the executive 
character is considered to be an agent of the company who has full responsibility to maximize the utility of 
stakeholders with decisions taken by going through several future risk considerations (Pitaloka and Merkusiawati.  
2019). The results of this study are in accordance with the results of previous studies by Saputra et al. (2015) and 
Oktamawati (2017) which revealed that executive character has a positive influence on tax avoidance. 
 
The Influence of Leverage on Tax Avoidance 
Based on the partial test results in table 3 which shows that the leverage variable has a probability value of 0.9402 > 
from a significance level of 0.05. This shows that H02 is accepted, indicating that the independent variable leverage 
has no partial effect on tax avoidance in manufacturing sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for 
the 2018-2020 period. This is contrary to the hypothesis of researchers who think that leverage (DAR) has a positive 
effect on tax avoidance. Leverage has no effect on tax avoidance because the company does not use debt to reduce 
the tax burden but is used for operational needs and company development. Then with the high debt ratio owned by 
the company, the company's management will be more careful to avoid using high debt to avoid tax with the aim that 
the company remains visible in the eyes of investors and creditors. Based on the results of descriptive statistical tests, 
companies that have leverage values both above and below the average have a CETR value above the rate and below 
the rate which proves that leverage does not affect the company's decision to do tax avoidance. The results of this 
study are in accordance with previous research by Yohan and Pradipta (2019) and Cahyono et al. (2016) which 
revealed that leverage has no influence on tax avoidance. 
 
The Influence of Managerial Ownership on Tax Avoidance 
Based on the partial test results in table 4.15 which shows that the managerial ownership variable has a probability 
value of 0.2553 > from a significance level of 0.05. This shows that H03 is accepted, indicating that the independent 
variable managerial ownership has no partial effect on tax avoidance in manufacturing sector companies listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2018-2020 period. This is contrary to the hypothesis of researchers who think that 
managerial ownership has a negative effect on tax avoidance. In this study, the proportion of share ownership owned 
by managerial parties is relatively small. The percentage of managerial ownership is still far below the average value 
of 0.179944, which is 65% of the total sample of companies. The results of this study are in accordance with previous 
research by Mahule et al. (2016) and Krisna (2019) which revealed that managerial ownership has no influence on tax 
avoidance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
1. This study aims to determine the effect of executive characters, leverage, and managerial ownership on Tax 
Avoidance with the object of this research being the manufacturing sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange for the 2018-2020 period, using 60 samples. Based on the results of research conducted by the author, the 
following conclusions are obtained:

Abstract 
Tax avoidance is an attempt to avoid tax by taking advantage of the gray area contained in the legislation to minimize 
the tax burden payable. However, tax avoidance in companies is detrimental to state revenues because the highest 
state revenues come from the taxation department. This study aims to show the effect of the fixed asset intensity, 
institutional ownership, and audit committee on tax avoidance in manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange (IDX) from 2016-2020. The analytical method of this research is a descriptive statistical test and 
panel data regression analysis using EViews 10 software. The sampling technique of this research is purposive 
sampling obtained by 29 companies with an observation period of 5 (five) years. However, in this study there were 5 
outliers, so the resulting data were 120 data. The results of this study prove that all variables are independent of the 
classical assumption test. The results of the panel data regression test with the common effect model were obtained 
from test results of 0.000215 which is smaller than the significance value of 0.05 or <0.05. The fixed assets intensity, 
institutional ownership, and the audit committee simultaneously have a significant effect on tax avoidance in 
manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2016-2020. Partial testing shows that the 
results of the intensity of the fixed asset have a positive effect on tax avoidance. Meanwhile, institutional ownership 
and the audit committee do not affect tax avoidance in manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange (IDX) from 2016-2020.

1. Introduction
According to Law Number 16 of 2009 concerning Amendments to Law Number 6 of 1983 concerning General 
Provisions and Tax Procedures, Article 1 (1) reads, that taxes are contributions that must be paid to the state, both 
taxpayers who are owed as individuals or entities, which are coercive according to the law, without receiving direct 
compensation and are used for the interests of the state and the greatest prosperity of the people. Tax revenue is the 
highest state revenue from state revenues other than taxes and grants. Tax revenues that reach hundreds of trillions of 
rupiah make the government aggressively collect taxes optimally for all citizens, both individuals, and entities. State 
revenues from the taxation sector have increased. However, the realization of tax revenue does not always reach the 
target. The non-achievement of the target is the cause of the tax revenue deficit. Therefore, the government expects 
large and sustainable tax revenues. While the company tries to minimize the tax burden to obtain maximum income. 
This difference is the biggest cause of companies taking tax avoidance actions.

It is supported by Table 6 that above-and below-average institutional ownership has almost the same results so below-
average or above-average institutional ownership does not dominate. Thus, the institutional ownership variable does 
not affect tax avoidance on manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016-2020. 
The results of this study are in accordance with research conducted by Antara & Uluputi (2016), Simorangkir & 
Rachmawati (2019) showed that ownership does not affect tax avoidance. 
3). Effect of the Audit Committee on Tax Avoidance 
The value of variable coefficient of the audit committee has a value of -0.019579 with a significant probability of 
0.0877 greater than 0.05. Thus, the Ha was rejected so it was said that the audit committee had no significant effect 
on tax avoidance. (Table 7)

The duties and powers of the audit committee are to assist the function of supervising the financial reporting process, 
risk management, audit implementation, and corporate governance implementation in the company. With the number 
of tasks performed by the audit committee, as well as the number of audit committees in table 7, three people are more 
dominant where this is only in compliance with the POJK provisions. So, the possibility of the audit committee is not 
too focused on minimizing the practice of tax avoidance. 
The results of this study showed that few or many members of the audit committee do not affect tax avoidance in the 
company. It is possible that the company's tendency to aggressive tax practices is not from the number of audit 
committees but rather from the role of the audit committee itself to analyse whether the company is doing tax 
avoidance or not. The results of this study in accordance with research conducted by Triyanti et al., (2020), Swinfly 
& Sukartha (2015) showed that the audit committee had no effect on tax avoidance. 
6. Conclusion
This study analyses the effect of the intensity of fixed assets, institutional ownership, and audit committee on tax 
avoidance in manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2016-2020. The results found 
in this study are the intensity of fixed assets, institutional ownership, and the audit committee simultaneously affect 
tax avoidance in companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016-2020, while partially institutional 
ownership and audit committees have no effect on tax avoidance. but asset intensity still influences tax avoidance. 
This research is expected to add to the existing literature. The author suggests further research to add samples of other 
companies that are not used in the study. Suggestions for the DGT government, the results of this study are expected 
to be taken into consideration in setting new policies to minimize tax avoidance. Suggestions for the company, this 
research is expected to help companies to maximize the tax burden that will be borne without having to take advantage 
of loopholes in tax regulations. For investors, this research is expected to be able to understand the practice of tax 
avoidance to make investment decisions.

Abstract 
Tax is an important instrument for state to fund the development and were a great source of state than non-tax 
revenues and grants with a total contribution up to 80%. However, it never changed for 2017-2020 even the tax 
revenues are more like decreased. The decreased of tax revenues indicated by tax avoidance that entities conducting 
and at last result in losses as much as 67,7 trillion rupiah.The purpose of this paper was to investigate the influence 
of profitabilty, leverage, and institutional ownership on tax avoidance practices by manufacturing companies during 
2017-2020. Manufacture companies be the object of this research because of their functional as backbone, give 
multiplier effect, and has large proportionated companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange. The study conducted 
samples were selecting using purposive sampling. Study samples that met acceptance criteria consisted of 39 firms. 
The unit of analysis in this study was 156, which was based on the 39 firms that met acceptance criteria multiplied 
by the the observation period of four years. The investigated technique by applying panel data regression 
analysis.The results of this research were determined in random effect model. The result from this study 
demonstrated that profitability, leverage, and instituional ownership on tax avoidance have a significant simultaneous 
effect. Partial testing shows there is a negative impact of profitability on tax avoidance whereas leverage and 
institutional ownership had no significant effect on the manufacturing companies.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry is a sector that contributes greatly to the Indonesia economy in terms of Gross Domestic 
Product. This means, it can be assumed that the manufacturing sector is considered as one of the sectors that 
contributes to taxation. The Minister of Industry also referred to the manufacturing industry as the backbone industry 
for other sectors (Kontan, 2020). Aside being the backbone of the economy, the manufacturing industry also has a 
multiplier effect (Kontan, 2018). The infrastructure and property sector requires the role of the basic industry and 
chemical sub-sector in the manufacturing industry and human activities require the chemical and consumer goods 
sub-sector in the manufacturing industry. If these primary needs are met, the economy will develop. The economy 
of a country grows if there is an increase in the activity of producing goods and services so that it can increase 
people's income. The manufacturing industry is a sector that has a major contribution to the Indonesia economy as 
measured by GDP. The following is the contribution of each industry to GDP:

The Effect of Leverage on Tax Avoidance 
Based on Table 6 if leverage has a coefficient value of -0.018 and a probability value of 0.897 greater than 0.05 
(significant value). This result in H0 being accepted, and H3 is rejected, this means that leverage has no significant 
and negative effect on tax avoidance in manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017-
2020. The act of involving debt on the company's capital can reduce tax payments because the company has an 
additional expense of paying debts. The involvement of debt in the source of capital is legal and it is difficult to detect 
whether it is the company's needs or intentional tax avoidance. However, with regression testing in this study, the 
amount of debt has a relationship with tax avoidance by manufacturing companies. The results in this study refute the 
research conducted by Triyanti et al. (2020) which states that leverage has a significant effect on tax avoidance where 
the presence of a tax expense can reduce taxable income. This study is in line with research by Assalam and Pratomo 
(2020) which states that leverage has no significant effect on tax avoidance. In terms of correlation, this study has 
different results with the research of Triyanti, et al. (2020) which states the results are positive. This result is evidenced 
by a descriptive analysis where the average debt level of companies indicated by tax avoidance less than 22% has a 
debt portion of 12.99%, then if the rate increases to more than 25%, the proportion of debt manufacturing companies 
becomes 19,14%, 
The Effect of Institutional Ownership on Tax Avoidance 
Based on Table 6, institutional ownership has a coefficient value of 0.0014 with a probability value of 0.517 more 
than 0.05 (significant value). This result in H0 being accepted, and H4 is rejected, which means that institutional 
ownership has no significant and positive effect on tax avoidance. Research conducted by Praditasari & Setiawan 
(2017) is refuted by this study which shows results where institutional ownership has no significant and positive effect 
on tax avoidance. Business entities or institutions generally have stronger finances than individuals. With stronger 
resources, the ability to control the activities of the company's management will also be better, including in asking 
management to report financial statements correctly so that they can give control to the company to comply with tax 
regulations and prevent company management from avoiding tax. This result is evidenced by a descriptive analysis 
where the average company with no indication of tax avoidance (> 22%) has an institutional ownership of 96.78%, 
while the average company with an indication of tax avoidance (< 22%) has an institutional ownership of 55, 03%. 
Because institutional ownership does not have a significant effect (although it has a role) it can be seen if the corporate 
income tax rate increases to 25%, where companies that are indicated to be tax compliant have institutional ownership 
of 73.75%, but institutional ownership in companies that do not comply (< 25%) of 78.06%. 
6. Conclusion
This study analyzes the effect of profitability, leverage, and institutional ownership on tax avoidance of manufacturing 
companies recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2017-2020. The results found in this study are that 
profitability, leverage and institutional ownership simultaneously have an impact on the tax avoidance of 
manufacturing companies recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2017-2020, while partially leverage 
and institutional ownership have no effect on tax avoidance, but profitability has a negative impact on tax avoidance. 
This research is anticipated to add to the existing literature. The authors suggest for further researchers who will use 
the dependent variable of tax avoidance, it is recommended to use other independent variables such as earnings 
management, managerial ownership, fixed asset intensity, sales growth, and others. Further researchers can increase 
the research period and use other industrial sectors. Through this research, it can be a reference for the Directorate 
General of Taxes where companies with higher profitability will have higher indications of tax avoidance. For the 
company, it is better not to take advantage of high profitability to avoid tax because it has the potential to get sanctions 
in the future which will cost the company. For investors, it is better to consider companies with large profits because 
companies with large profits will tend to avoid tax which can affect the potential sanctions that will be received by 
the company. In addition, it can be combined with considering companies with high institutional ownership because 
it can help monitor management performance.

Abstract 
The assessment of lean deployment in the health sector should be determined to evaluate the success and 
sustainability of the practice. The measurement shall be identified through the alignment of the Critical Success 
Factor (CSF) to the lean objective. This paper developed the preliminary framework for measuring lean healthcare 
sustainability through the CSF measure. 56 item measures were identified that linked to 11 basic CSF in assessing 
lean sustainability. In sequence, this paper established the importance of CSF measures through a quantitative 
method. The 30 participants whose has knowledge and experience in lean practice were identified in the local 
hospital in the southern region. The survey questionnaire was distributed to participants with 100 percent response 
rate. The data was analyzed by performing reliability and validity test to appraise the quality. The findings of this

The Table 5 above shows that item measures under CSF perspectives obtained the highest mean score by the 
respondent. The results present that these items are considered the most critical measures in the framework of lean 
healthcare sustainability performance. Most of the items belong to the top CSF perspective, leadership and 
management, employee involvement, lean healthcare practice, efficient infrastructure and education and training. 
  
5. Conclusion 
Lean healthcare practice has become important for the improvement of quality and efficiency of service delivery. 
Previous studies have identified critical factor for lean implementation. However, there is evidence that indicates 
a lack of linkage between CSF to sustainable lean performance in a holistic dimension. Due to this phenomenon, 
thus a comprehensive and priority factor of lean is urged for enhancement of lean adoption and sustainability.   
 
The study objective was to validate a survey instrument for the development of a preliminary framework of 
sustainable lean healthcare performance. A pilot study results present that all measures for the assessment of lean 
healthcare are important. Thus, all proposed 56 measures that have been categorized into 11 perspectives are 
suitable to be used for performance measurement of sustainable lean healthcare.  
 
In the next step of research, a full survey is recommended to validate the preliminary framework of sustainable 
lean healthcare performance that covers a different angle of dimensions (economy, environment, social aspect).

Abstract 
Human resources are influential in gaining competitive advantage and efficiency. The purpose of this study is to find 
out how the competence, population, and performance of the employees of the Ministry of Religion of Sragen Regency 
affect the performance of employees with demography as a moderating variable at the Office of the Ministry of 
Religion of Sragen Regency. The research methodology used is a quantitative method with a descriptive and 
verification approach. The population is the employees of the Ministry of Religion of Sragen Regency. By using a 
saturated sampling technique, the number of respondents was 123. Data collection techniques use secondary and 
primary data by distributing questionnaires that have been tested for validity and reliability. Data analysis using SEM 
(Structural Equation Model) and PLS-MGA (Multi Group Analysis) for demographic moderation analysis using Smart 
PLS 3 software. The results of hypothesis testing indicate that the competence variable has a positive and significant 
effect on employee performance. The demographic variables of age and tenure are significantly positive, moderating 
the effect of employee performance. Demographics based on education level had a significant negative effect on 
moderating the effect of competence on performance, and demographics based on gender did not significantly 
moderate the effect of competence on employee performance.

1. Introduction
Every organization needs resources to achieve its goals, be it natural, financial, techno-logical, and human resources. 
Among these resources, human resources are fundamental, thus. a company cannot deliver optimum results without 
the support of optimum human resources. In the last decade, various studies have found that human resources are 
influential in gaining competitive advantage and efficiency (Pasban, 2016). The government sector is a sector that 
plays an important role in public services and in carrying out duties of min-istries and state institutions. The 
administration of government is always under the spot-light, especially in terms of transparency, accountability, 
efficiency, and effectiveness. Hence, the implementation of good corporate governance is imperative. Public service 
by the government apparatus is the embodiment of the state apparatus’ function as a public servant, in addition to 
being a servant of the state. In this condition, the state apparatus is required to improve its performance to achieve

of competence on performance in terms of years of service. Based on table 11, the working period has a path coefficient 
of 0.221 and a p-value of 0.047, which is less than 0.05, which means that the tenure of service is significantly positive 
as a moderator for the influence of competence on performance. Based on the bootstrap path coefficient, it is known 
that the path coefficient value for the 6–10 year working group is 0.760, which is greater than the 11–15-year education 
group, which has a path coefficient value of 0.539. So, it can be concluded that the demographics at the Office of the 
Ministry of Religion of Sragen Regency based on years of service have a significant positive moderating role or 
strengthen the influence of competence on performance (H2 is accepted), and those who have a greater role are in the 
6–10 year working group. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion on the influence of competence on performance with demography as 
a moderating variable at the Office of the Ministry of Religion of Sragen Regency, the following conclusions can be 
drawn:  
 
1. The competence of the Ministry of Religion Office Employees of Sragen Regency is included in the good 
category. This is stated through the average response or opinion of respondents obtained from 10 statement 
items regarding competence, which is around 71%. In the competency variables, which include the 
dimensions of knowledge, skills/skills, and attitudes, all three are in the good category, for the highest score 
is on the attitude dimension and the lowest score is on the skill/skill dimension. 
2. Demographics of Employees the Ministry of Religion Office of Sragen Regency has employees who are 
dominated by male employees, employees aged 40-49 years and aged 50-59 years, employees with education 
levels of D4-S1 and S2, as well as employees with years of service. 5-6 years and 11–15 years. 
3. The performance of the Office of the Ministry of Religion of Sragen Regency is in the good category. This 
is stated through the average responses or opinions of respondents obtained from 11 statement items 
regarding performance, which is around 70.15%. The performance variables include the dimensions of 
quantity, quality, timeliness, effectiveness, independence, and commitment. Of all the dimensions of the 
performance variable, it is included in the good category, for the highest score is in quantity and quality, with 
the same score ranging from 71%. Then, for the lowest value of all the dimensions of performance is the 
dimension of timeliness. 
4. a) Based on the results of the analysis conducted using SEM-PLS, it is known that competition has a 
significant positive effect on the performance of the Office of the Ministry of Religion of Sragen Regency, 
where the path coefficient is 0.656, which indicates that the direction of the path is positive, so it can be 
interpreted that the better the competence, the better the employee performance.  
b). Based on the results of the analysis using PLS-MGA, it is known that the demographics of age and 
working period significantly positively moderate the influence of competence on the performance of the 
Ministry of Religion Office employees of Sragen Regency. Meanwhile, demographics based on education 
level significantly negatively moderated the effect of competence on performance. Then, for the demographic 
gender, competence is not significant as a moderator of the effect of competence on performance. So, it can 
be interpreted that the difference in gender between men and women does not have a role to play in 
moderating the influence of competence on the performance of the Ministry of Religion Office Employees 
of Sragen Regency.

Abstract 
Thermal modeling and simulation of IC engines have attracted considerable attention from the research community 
in the last three decades. An accurate understanding of the IC engine's heat gradient would help enhance the engine's 
efficiency. Researchers have used software developed by multiple vendors. Using the Using not only help in better 
understanding but will also aid in reducing the design time and research effort of engineers. The simulation would 
also aid engineers in studying engine performance without using expensive prototyping and physical testing. This will 
bring the cost of design and hence the total product cost. An effort has been made in this work (i) to study the various 
approaches proposed by researchers in studying engine performance by performing the thermal simulation (ii) to 
figure out research gaps and (iii) to provide future directions. The research contribution would help academicians, 
researchers, and practitioners pursue further research in the thermal simulation of IC Engines.

1. Introduction
The piston is a critical component of the reciprocating Internal combustion engine (IC Engine). The piston will be 
performing reciprocating motion continuously within the engine cylinder. The piston rings would help achieve an air-
tight condition and facilitate combustion (Balahari et al., 2017; Sathish et al., 2016; Ikpe et al., 2020).  The piston 
crown will carry the gas pressure during working. The piston would help transfer force from the expanding gases 
within the engine cylinder to the crankshaft with the help of a piston rod and connecting rod (Sonar et al., 2015, Prasad 
et al., 2016). Fuel will be converted into gases during the combustion process. The gases will impact the piston and 
cause it to execute the reciprocating motion, which is converted into the rotary motion of the crankshaft (Kumar et al., 
2017). The reciprocating piston will be subjected to its inertia forces due to reciprocation, friction forces generated by 
the continuous rubbing of the piston and the cylinder wall, and the forces of the gases generated during combustion 
(Gadde et al. 2017). Thus, the piston will be subjected to high temperatures (25000K) and high-pressure gradients 
during work and experience continuous fatigue and wear and tear (Reddy et al. 2013). The high-temperature gradients 
would also result in thermal stresses and an expansion of the piston material and cause the material to lose its valuable 
properties (Gupta et al. 2014). The forces and the torques acting on the piston were also formulated as a function of 
the angles of the crank and the connecting rod (Nigus 2015). 
Vishal et al. (2016) explored performing static stress analysis of pistons made of two aluminum alloys under different 
pressure load conditions. The investigation revealed that AL-GHY-1250 alloy fared better over 4032 for various 
pressures. Low deformation in A4032 was mainly due to higher yield strength and ultimate tensile strength. 
Manisaikamal (2017) studied thermal analysis of pistons having concave and convex shapes and concluded that both 
heat distribution and the deformations in the pistons having concave profiles were higher than in pistons with convex 
profiles. The low heat distribution in the pistons will increase the life of pistons and piston rings.

Abstract 
A dowel pin puller in simple word is a hand tool that is used to remove dowel pin that has been tapered from their 
insertion holes. Using the various head sizes, the tool threads into the extractable dowel pin and pulls it out using the 
slide hammer technique. Meanwhile, dowel pins are a type of industrial fastener that is used to connect two or more 
products. Therefore, in this project, a durable and affordable dowel pin puller that can reduce set up time during 
production is designed and fabricated. During the earlier stages of design, a PDS and DFMA guidelines is constructed 
based on the datum to set a range for the design. Then, after the conceptual design had been sketch, the approach of 
concept scoring matrix is used to select one of the best designs, where design A is selected. SOLIDWORKS software 
is then being used to detail out the design and for design analysis, FEM. As result, the safety factor for the parts that 
been simulated, is greater than 2, which is acceptable and safe. A survey also conducted during design analysis to get 
the feedback from expert, and user, where most than half of the respondents were chosen and satisfied with the design 
A, as in the selection of matrix. Thus, design A is fabricated. The dowel pin puller is made of main materials which is 
low carbon steel and costed RM95.80 for fabrication cost. In conclusion, the objective, and scope of the project is 
achieved, and the design is successfully fabricated within the period of time. For future works, more improvement can 
be made for the design in terms of feature, and safety to make it more attractive and functionality.

1. Introduction
The tool's extractor design varies by purpose. The tapered end of the extractor is tapped into the dowel's body to gently 
remove the pin (Encyclopedia of Alternative Energy Id_battery.Html, 2015). Dowel pin extractors remove dowel pins 
from insertion holes. Using different-sized heads, the tool threads into the extractable dowel pin and pulls it out (DPE

5.3 Fabrication of Prototype 
The dowel pin puller prototype is made of mild steel alloy. Mild steel is the main material because it has high strength, 
malleability, and durability, (What Is Mild Steel? An In-Depth Guide to Carbon Steel | Metals4U - Ideas & Advice | 
Metals4U, n.d.) which meet the PDS and design objectives. During fabrication, different tools and equipment were 
used to cut and drill the material. The main method in order to fabricate the dowel pin puller is the MIG welding, 
(Taylor et al., n.d.), which is important in order to shape the prototype into its design. The process of fabrication of 
puller used a total period of 8 weeks to complete from raw until the end product, where shown in Figure 6. The long 
shaft of the puller provide higher force could be generated, thus making the dowel pin to be pulled out easily.

this project to analyze the dowel pin puller before fabrication as part of the design process to ensure user safety. During 
the design analysis, an online survey is also conducted to get expert and user feedback. This survey aims to hear their 
thoughts on choosing a product and rating its design. As a result, more than half of the responses were satisfied with 
design A. So, A is being fabricated. The dowel pin puller is made of low-cost, high-strength, and durable mild steel. 
This dowel pin puller was successfully, which cost only RM95.80, from defining and identifying the problem to design 
and analysis to fabrication, where the result met the project's objective and scope. 
6.2 Recommendation 
In the road of designing, improving is the most important word that should practice by designer, and also engineer. 
Since the product seems like perfect but improving is to get the product become better to fulfil the needs of human, as 
well as advancing the technology. For the dowel pin of this project, although it had been successfully fabricated and 
safe to use, it also has many areas or parts that can be improved, and modified from the aspects of functionality, safety, 
and also design. From the survey, the usage experience is the major attention that need to be focused and improved in 
the future. For example, changing the mechanism of the puller into a more user-friendly mechanism, thus making new 
user to easily operate the hand tools. 
As today world, sustainable was a topic that always be discussed by the people in order to protect the environment. 
Therefore, a green material, or recycled material can be a practice in making the dowel pin puller. Besides that, 
designing a dowel pin puller that affordable that able to be use universally with dowel pin of other size should also be 
considered. In a short summary, although all of this improvement can bring convenience to human life, but the 
approach of DFMA, and also the safety analysis needs to be well considered in order to design a safe, durable, and 
quality dowel pin puller.

Abstract 
Work motivation is a condition that encourages someone to conduct their duties at work. Work motivation is 
important to improve performance because it could encourage employee productivity. Achieving high employee 
motivation requires support from company management so that there are factors that can increase employee 
motivation, such as compensation and organizational culture. Compensation is given both financial and non-
financial as a reward for the work that has been done. In addition, organizational culture is the values, traditions, and 
work procedures followed by members of the company. This study aims to determine how compensation, 
organizational culture, and work motivation of employees at Grand Mercure Bandung Setiabudi is, as well as to 
analyze the partial and simultaneous effect of compensation and organizational culture on employee motivation at 
Grand Mercure Bandung Setiabudi. The data in this study were analyzed using a descriptive quantitative method and 
verified using Structural Equation Model (SEM)-PLS analysis. The data were taken by distributing questionnaires to 
employees of the Grand Mercure Bandung Setiabudi. The results show that the compensation given by Grand 
Mercure Bandung Setiabudi to employees is included in the high category, the organizational culture shown by 
Grand Mercure Bandung Setiabudi is included in the good category, and the work motivation shown by the 
employees of Grand Mercure Bandung Hotel is included in the moderate category. tall. In addition, the results of the 
research partially and simultaneously show that compensation and organizational culture influence employee 
motivation.

1. Introduction
Work motivation is important to improve employee performance. Achieving high employee motivation requires 
support from company management. However, when the world encountered the COVID-19 pandemic, many 
companies temporarily suspend operational activities. This influenced the hotel industry such as the Grand Mercure 
Bandung Setiabudi. As a result of the pandemic, many employees have been laid off. The dismissal of some 
employees, however, does not dismiss their duties, thereby increasing the workload of the sustained employee. The 
drastic decrease in visitors makes the hotel’s income has also decreased so much that the compensation received by 
employees during the pandemic has been reduced. Some training must also be done online due to the pandemic even 
though the training should be done offline. Human Resources is defined as an integrated management strategy and

Based on Table 7 above, it shows that the organizational culture variable obtained information on the actual total 
score of 6841, the total value of the ideal score of 10500, the total percentage value of 65.15%, and the mean total 
score of 3.26 included in the high category.  This shows that the organizational culture shown by the Grand Mercure 
Bandung Setiabudi is included in the good category. The results showed that organizational culture influenced 
employee motivation. The results of this study are also supported by the previous discussion which shows that 
organizational culture is a shared value, a benefit system related to people in the organization, and a control system 
and organizational structure in producing behavioral norms (Tika, 2018). Organizational culture can provide an 
atmosphere that can support employees to be able to do a good job. The existence of an appropriate organizational 
culture will have an impact on the high work motivation of employees, so that employees will also contribute high 
work to the company and channel their potential in doing work (Solehidin and Yusuf, 2019).  The results of this 
study are in line with the results of previous studies conducted by Masitoh Solehudin and Yusuf (2019) and 
Janićijević (2021). The results of his research show that organizational culture influences employee motivation. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of research and discussion in the previous chapter, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
1.
The overall research results show that the compensation given by the Grand Mercure Bandung Setiabudi to
employees is included in the high category.
2.
The results of the research as a whole show that the organizational culture shown by the Grand Mercure
Bandung Setiabudi is included in the good category.
3.
The results of the research partially and simultaneously show that compensation and organizational culture
influence employee work motivation. The higher the compensation and organizational culture, the higher
the employee's work motivation.

Abstract 
Prudence is a prudent attitude in dealing with economic uncertainty conditions in the future. This principle is used to 
prevent overstatement or understatement in financial reporting so that financial statements are presented fairly and 
free from material misstatement. This study aims to examine the determinants of prudence, consisting of capital 
intensity, conflict of interest, litigation risk, and growth opportunity. By using purposive sampling criteria, the research 
sample obtained is 104 observation data or 32 companies in the Consumer Goods industry sector listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017-2020. Data analysis techniques used are descriptive statistical analysis and panel 
data regression. The results show that capital intensity is not a determinant of prudence. Conflict of interest and 
litigation risk are positive determinants of prudence, while growth opportunity is a negative determinant of prudence. 
Suggestions for further research are to reexamine this research in different industries, use different proxies for the 
capital intensity variable, or replace the capital intensity with another variable. For companies, this research can be 
used as consideration for implementing prudence in their financial reporting. For investors and creditors, this research 
is expected to be useful as additional information in making decisions. Empirically, the novelty of this research is that 
conflict of interest, litigation risk, and growth opportunity are determinants of prudence in the Consumer Goods 
industry sector.

1. Introduction
International Financial Reporting Standards (2018) state that users of financial statements need the entity's financial 
information that is relevant, reliable, free from material misstatement, accurate representation, neutral, and unbiased. 
Those considerations can support the neutrality of financial statements because they reflect an attitude of prudence in 
the face of economic uncertainty (Zuliyanto Susilo, 2021).
Prudence is a prudent principle in dealing with conditions of economic uncertainty in the future to prevent 
overestimating assets and income or underestimating liabilities and losses. In other words, assets, revenues, liabilities, 
or expenses are presented fairly. Implementing prudence in the recognition of assets or income and recognizing costs 
more quickly can prevent overstatement of earnings and the risk due to uncertainty in the company's operational 
activities (Hejranijamil et al., 2020; Putri & Herawaty, 2020). 
Manipulated financial statement information indicates that the company failed to fulfill the purpose of financial 
statements, namely, to provide information on the company's performance in actual conditions. If the financial 
statements are not presented properly, the information becomes biased and cannot be used for making decisions. The

5.2 Discussion 
Capital Intensity as a Determinant of Prudence 
The t-test shows the value of the regression coefficient (β1) of capital intensity is -0,148200 with a significance level 
of 0,0753 > α 0.05. The results of this test accept H0 and reject Ha. It means that capital intensity is not a determinant 
of prudence. Companies with high capital intensity will require high capital from external parties, namely investors. 
Thus, to attract investors, the company will present its financial statements optimistically in accordance with investors' 
expectations. The results of this study are not in line with the results of Zahro (2021) and Aurillya et al. (2021) which 
stated that capital intensity has a positive effect on prudence.  
 
Conflict of Interest as a Determinant of Prudence 
The t-test shows the value of the regression coefficient (β2) of conflict of interest is 0.479651 with a significance level 
of 0.0000 < α 0.05. The results of this test reject H0 and accept Ha. It means that conflict of interest is a positive 
determinant of prudence. The results of this study are in line with the results of Hidyah et al. (2020) and S. N. Sari & 
Agustina (2021) which stated that conflict of interest has a positive effect on prudence. The greater the company's 
debt, the more creditors' claims on company assets. This creates pressure for management to prioritize the interests of 
creditors compared to investors because of the company’s potential for default and creditors' concerns about the safety 
of their funds, thus triggering a conflict of interest between creditors and investors. Therefore, the application of 
prudence will increase. 
 
Litigation Risk as a Determinant of Prudence 
The t-test shows the value of the regression coefficient (β3) of litigation risk is 0.085174 with a significance level of 
0.0463 < α 0.05. The results of this test reject H0 and accept Ha. It means that litigation risk is a positive determinant 
of prudence. The results of this study are in line with the results of Sholikhah & Suryani (2020) and Murti & Yuniarta 
(2021) which stated that litigation risk has a positive effect on prudence. Managers will be encouraged to apply 
prudence to their financial reporting if the threat of litigation tends to be high. Rationally, managers are motivated to 
be more prudent reporting their financial statements to avoid costs and losses.  
 
Growth Opportunity as a Determinant of Prudence  
The t-test shows the value of the regression coefficient (β4) is -0.470974 with a significance level of 0.0000 < α 0.05. 
The results of this test reject H0 and accept Ha. It means that growth opportunity is a negative determinant of prudence. 
The greater a company's growth opportunities, the lower the application of prudence. Instead of applying prudence to 
fulfill the investment needs and growth of the company, management seeks external financing sources from investors. 
To gain investor trust, management presents financial statements optimistically. The results of this study are not in 
line with the results of El-Haq et al. (2019) dan Sari (2020) which stated that growth opportunity has a positive effect 
on prudence. 
  
6. Conclusion  
This research aims to examine the determinants of prudence consisting of capital intensity, conflict of interest, 
litigation risk, and growth opportunity in the Consumer Goods industry sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange 
in 2017-2020. The results of the hypothesis test indicate that capital intensity is not a determinant of prudence. Conflict 
of interest and litigation risk are the determinants of prudence. Meanwhile, growth opportunity is a negative 
determinant of prudence. 
 
7. Limitation and Suggestions  
The limitations of this study are in the elimination of outliers for the data to be normal. There are 32 data observations 
excluded because they interfere with the model, so that not all research samples can be used in this research. 
 
Suggestions for further research are to reexamine this research in different industries, use different proxies for the 
capital intensity variable, or replace the capital intensity with another variable. In addition, capital-intensive companies 
are expected to pay more attention to prudence in their financial statements. Also, for companies that are growing, it 
is necessary to pay more attention to implementing prudence in their financial reporting. Moreover, for investors and 
creditors, this research is expected to be useful as additional information in making decisions.

Abstract 
The number of studies on the circular economy continues to increase by researchers from various countries, including 
Indonesia. This study's objectives are to map the literature on the circular economy and make suggestions for industrial 
engineering-based circular economy research in Indonesia. A thorough analysis of the circular economy research 
publications in Indonesia was conducted to accomplish that. Research trends, authors who receive the most citations, 
research partner nations, papers that receive the most citations, mapping of research objects, journals that publish the 
most articles, and keywords used are among the findings. Researchers planning studies on the circular economy, 
particularly in Indonesia, should find this research beneficial.

1. Introduction
The Government of Indonesia is further strengthening its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals and 
targets for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions according to the Paris Agreement and efforts to tackle economic, 
social and environmental problems (Kementerian PPN/Bappenas 2021). The Ministry of Industry (Kemenperin) for 
example, continues to strive to optimize the industry which in its production process prioritizes efficiency and 
effectiveness in using resources in a sustainable manner (Rantung 2021). In addition, one of the efforts to fulfill this 
commitment is to carry out economic transformation towards a more “green” direction or often referred to as a circular 
economy (Limanseto 2021). Currently, there are 5 sectors that have been designated by the Government of Indonesia 
as priority sectors because they have great potential to adopt a circular approach, namely the food & beverage, textile, 
construction, wholesale & retail trade and electrical & electronic equipment sectors (Kementerian PPN/Bappenas 
2021). 
Previous research has found that the circular economy approach is theoretically effective for sustainably improving 
the economy in developing countries such as Indonesia (Rishanty and Suryahadi 2020). For example, the circular 
economy concept is useful in the recycling industry, including to meet the needs of raw materials for the manufacturing 
sector and suppress imports of raw materials (Kementerian Perindustrian Republik Indonesia 2021). The potential of 
the plastic recycling industry in Indonesia, for example, has a capacity of 1 million tons per year and absorbs a 
workforce of 20,000 people. For the potential of the steel recycling industry, currently there are 60 companies that use 
mostly imported raw materials (70-90%) recycled (scrap) with a capacity of 9 million tons per year. The current 
production utility is only 40 percent, so it requires 4 million tons of recycled raw materials per year. Besides being 
able to increase Indonesia's GDP growth, the application of the green/circular economy concept could also potentially 
generate 4.4 million additional jobs in 2030 (Limanseto 2021).

Abstract 
Truck accidents are often as a single accident. Drowsiness is one of the causes of a single accident. Drowsiness 
usually caused by working in long time, monotonous work, poor health conditions, or lack of sleep. This study 
aims to assess the drowsiness level of industrial truck driver and analyze drowsiness patterns seen from the 
relationship between decreasing of driver alertness to road density and time intervals from the start of the trip to 
the time of measurement. Drowsiness level assessed using Karolinska Sleepness Scale (KSS) questionaire. The 
level of driver drowsiness during the trip rises along the travel time. In the morning trip, decreasing of driver 
alertness have occurred after 120 minutes of travelling and in the afternoon trip the alertness decreasing occurred 
after 60 minutes travelling. The driver's drowsiness level at two trips shows significant differences using paired 
sample t-tests. In the morning trip the mean drowsiness level was 2.91 while in the afternoon trip, the mean 
drowsiness level was 3.56, p value on two tail was 0.0002. There is a low correlation between drowsiness and 
traffic density that assessed by truck speed, with R = 0.18. Traffic density hasn't affected on driver drowsiness for 
day trip.   
Keywords : Drowsiness, alertness, preparedness, trip duration, velocities.  
1. Introduction
Freight transportation takes place 24 hours a day. Industrial freight is mostly still using trucks for transportation, 
but on the other hand traffic accidents involving trucks are quite high. Road truck accidents are often in form of a 
single accident. A common form of incident is that the truck gets out of its lane and into the green lanes on the 
side of the road. Drowsiness is often be the caused of a single accident. Logistics trucks usually travel from 
medium to long distances. But for safety reasons the maximal truck speed  is usually limited, so it results on longer 
truck travel times. If the traffic density is high then the truck travel time will increase more longer. Length of 
travel time and frequency of task associated with critical incidents in drivers (Di Milia et al., 2011; Hanowski, 
2005). 
Drowsiness usually is caused by working around the day, monotonous work, poor health conditions, sleep 
deprivation, and sleep disturbances. In addition, drowsiness is also caused by lack of exercise, symptoms of a 
disease, and lifestyle. Sleepiness at work can be experienced by drivers. Sleepy and fatique were significantly 
associated with fatal accidents on commercial vehicles including truck industry in reseach by Bunn (2005). 
Drowsiness is a indication of fatigue. Stressful environments such as traffic jams put the drivers on risk getting 
fatigue. The National Transport Commission (2007) defines fatigue as a condition in which drivers feel drowsy, 
physically or mentally exhausted, or underpowered in driving. Fatigue can occur due to the intensity and duration 
of both physical and mental work. Drivers who experience fatigue while driving increase the risk of traffic

6. Conclusion 
The medium-range industrial truck trip (100 –150 km) is taken in around 2.5 until 5 hours. The level of driver 
drowsiness during driving rises along the travel time. In the morning trip, decreasing of driver alertness have 
occurred after 120 minutes of travelling and in the afternoon trip the alertness decreasing occurred after 60 minutes 
travelling. The traffic density assessed by the speed of the truck, has no effect on the level of driver drowsiness. 
Drivers who travel in the morning have difference in drowsiness level significantly than drivers who travel in the 
afternoon, t test got p=0,0002.

Abstract 
The study aims to investigate factors that influencing the use of mobile payments during the COVID-19 pandemic in 
Indonesia. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people’s lifestyle has been altered in various ways, including the payment 
method. Compared to prior years, the use of cashless payment methods has been increased exponentially during the 
pandemic. Therefore, this study tests several variables to examine the research problem. The tested variables include 
perceived health risk, government support, promotional benefits, and actual usage as the dependent variable. By 
applying a convenience sampling technique and PLS SEM approach, this study gathered up to 200 respondents who 
are active users of mobile payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the study show that perceived 
health risk, government support, facilitating conditions, and payment habits substantially affected behavioral intention, 
and behavioral intention significantly influenced actual usage. While using mobile payments, it was discovered that 
promotional benefits have no bearing on behavioral intention.

1. Introduction
The technological developments that occur cannot be separated from the community's continuous innovations by 
utilizing the sophistication of diverse technologies. According to Silvestre and Tirca (2019), innovation occurs through 
a dynamic process due to several factors that interact with each other, which then produce changes and develop over 
time. The growing technological innovation will make it easier for people to adapt to the conditions that occur. This 
includes the  outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been going on for over two years in 
Indonesia, where these conditions cause various changes and have an influence on people’s unpreparedness to face 
the harmful impacts. One of the activities that have experienced a significant change is making payment transactions. 
In the beginning, many people continued to make payments with cash, credit cards, or debit cards. However, those 
payment transactions are viewed as illustrations of media or objects contributing to viruses' spread. Therefore, as 
opposed to using other payment methods during this pandemic, people frequently use mobile payments to complete

Abstract 
Employee performance is important in an effort to realize the goals as well as the success and achievement of a 
company. Companies must pay attention to the level and performance of their employees, especially the millennial 
generation. The performance of the millennial generation is very influential on the achievement and success of a 
company in realizing its goals, considering that the company's leaders will soon be replaced by the millennial 
generation. One of the things that can affect the performance of the millennial generation is by providing training and 
paying attention to the needs of the Millennial generation's physical work environment. This study aims to examine 
and analyze the effect of training and physical work environment on the performance of Millennial generation 
employees. 
The population in this study were BPJS Employment employees at the Sumbagut Regional Office with all millennial 
generation employees as respondents. By using non-probability sampling, 183 respondents were selected by purposive 
sampling. The type of research used is descriptive quantitative. Data was collected by means of questionnaires and 
documentation studies. 
Data analysis with the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach based on Partial Least Square (PLS) was used 
to analyze the data to get clearer and more detailed results regarding the effect of career development and physical 
work environment on millennial generation job satisfaction at BPJS Employment at the Sumbagut Regional Office.

1. Introduction
According to Bukit et al. (2017) An organization/company will always try as much as possible to achieve its goals. 
One of the factors that influence success in an organization is the aspect of human resources. Human resources have 
an important and dominant role in all innovations that will be realized to realize the company's goals, so it is important 
to maintain and develop capabilities towards quality. Based on data on the percentage of Indonesian population from 
BPS by generation in 2020, the millennial generation born in 1981-1996 is the majority group in Indonesia's 
demographic structure where the millennial generation population amounts to 25.87% of the total population of 
Indonesia. From this data, it can be concluded that the millennial generation will later have an important role in an 
organization for the demographic bonus period in Indonesia in the period 2025-2030 (Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) 
2021). Even so, according to the IDN Research Institute report, only 1 in 10 millennials said they wanted to work 
more than 10 years in a company, and only 3 out of 10 millennials said they wanted to work 2-3 years in a company 
(IDN Research Institute 2021). 
Based on the IDN Research Institute report, 3 main causes of millennial junior employees (26-32 years old) leaving 
their jobs, namely: self-development, facilities and work environment. Meanwhile, the 3 main reasons for leaving 
millennial senior employees (33-41 years) from their jobs are caused by: self-development, facilities, and salary (IDN

6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the analysis and discussion that has been carried out, the conclusions obtained by the 
researchers are as follows: 
 
a) 
Based on the questionnaire, obtained a direct effect of job training variable (X1) on the performance variable (Y) 
which shows a p value (p-value) of 0.174 and the value is greater than alpha 0.05, so it can be concluded that 
there is no direct effect which is significant and negative between training (X1) on performance (Y) that is equal 
to 0.042. 
 
Thus, the hypothesis 𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎𝟏𝟏regarding the existence of a positive and significant effect of training on employee 
performance is not partially accepted. 
 
b) 
Based on the questionnaire, obtained a direct influence of the physical work environment variable (X2) on the 
performance variable (Y) which shows a p value (p-value) of 0.000 and the value is smaller than alpha 0.05, so 
it can be concluded that there is a positive and significant direct effect between the physical work environment 
(X2) on performance (Y) which is 0.890. 
 
Thus, the hypothesis 𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎𝟐𝟐that there is a positive and significant influence between the physical work 
environment and employee performance is partially accepted. 
 
c) 
Based on the questionnaire, it shows that the training variable (X1) and the physical work environment variable 
(X2 have no simultaneous effect on the performance variable (Y).  
 
Thus, the hypothesis 𝑯𝑯𝟎𝟎𝟑𝟑of the simultaneous influence of training and physical work environment on employee 
performance is rejected simultaneously. 
 
d) Simultaneous test is declared to have a significant effect if F count > F table. Based on the existing data, the 
calculated F value is 278.347 and F table 3.05. It can be concluded that the influence of job training and physical 
work environment on the performance of millennial employees of BPJS Employment at the Sumbagut Regional 
Office is 278,347.

Abstract 
Taxes are contributions that come from the people in the form of money collected under the law without any direct 
compensation from the state. As a good citizen, one of them is that corporate taxpayers are required to pay taxes to 
the state. On the company side, tax payments will reduce profits for the company, this encourages companies to do 
tax avoidance. Tax avoidance is an attempt by a company to use the gray area or weaknesses contained in the 
legislation. The purpose of this research is to find out the effect of sales growth, corporate social responsibility 
disclosure and transfer pricing on tax avoidance in the mining sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016-
2020. The analytical method used is descriptive testing and panel data regression using Eviews software version 12. 
This sampling technique is purposive sampling and obtained 10 companies with an observation period of 5 (five) 
years. The results of the research conducted indicate that sales growth, corporate social responsibility, and transfer 
pricing have a simultaneous effect on taxes in the mining sector listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016-2020. 
Partially, transfer pricing has a positive effect on tax avoidance. While sales growth, the performance of corporate 
social responsibility has no effect on tax avoidance in the mining sector which is listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange 2016-2020. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Figure 1 shows that tax revenue from the main sector experienced a drastic decline during 2020. The largest decline 
was from the mining sector to -43.73% on an annual basis. Taxes received from the processing industry as well as 
construction and real estate decreased in the range of -20%. Then, tax revenue from the trade sector fell by -18.94%. 
Revenue taxes from the transportation and warehousing sectors as well as financial services and insurance were also 
lower -15.41% and 14.31% compared to 2019 (Lidwina 2021). According to Sri Mulyani, this is because the 
contraction in import activity in the slowdown in domestic deliveries has put pressure on the manufacturing and trade 
sectors. Then, financial services were hit by a slowdown in credit and interest rates. The decline in commodity prices 
is still putting pressure on the mining sector. Then, the decline in construction activities and property sales suppressed 
the revenue sector, as well as the decline in transportation users and the construction of supporting facilities continued 
to decline in the transportation and warehousing sector (Kemenkeu 2020).

Based on Table 10 shows the number of transfer pricing companies above and below the average. There are 50 total 
samples having two categories, namely there is transfer pricing and there is no transfer pricing. There are 17 samples 
that have transfer pricing with a CETR value above the corporate tax rate, while as many as 8 samples have transfer 
pricing with a CETR below the corporate tax rate. Furthermore, companies that do not transfer pricing with a CETR 
value above the corporate tax rate are 18 samples, while companies that do not transfer pricing with a CETR value 
below the corporate tax rate are 7 samples. 
 
6. Conclusion  
1) Descriptively obtained the following results: 
 
a. 
The average sales growth in the mining sector is 6.13%. 
b. The average corporate social responsibility disclosure in the mining sector is 43.19% categorized as 
partially applied. 
c. 
Companies that do transfer pricing are 25% and those that don't do transfer pricing are 25%. 
d. The average tax avoidance proxied by the CETR indicated by tax avoidance was 15 samples and 35 
samples were not indicated. 
2) Based on simultaneous testing, it is known that sales growth, corporate social responsibility disclosure and 
transfer pricing simultaneously affect tax avoidance in mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange in 2016-2020. This situation is indicated by the prob value (F-statistic) of 0.046526 which is 
smaller than the significance value of 0.05 (5%). 
3) Partial test, sales growth, corporate social responsibility disclosure does not affect tax avoidance. Later, 
transfer pricing has a positive effect on tax avoidance in the mining sector listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange in 2016 to 2020 / regarding this, the probability number is 0.0068 which smaller than significant, 
namely 0.05, which means Hα is accepted. 
 
Suggestions for the mining sector, this research hopes to assist companies in maximizing transfer pricing to minimize 
the tax expense borne by companies while remaining cautious and complying with applicable transfer pricing rules. 
For investors, this research is expected to help investors make investment decisions, namely considering companies 
that carry out transfer pricing to minimize the company's tax burden so that the profit generated is maximized.

Abstract 
Village original income is a form of business by the village government which is used to assist the smooth management 
of the village government in the context of the implementation of village autonomy. Measuring village's original 
income is very important to assess and increase management funds and village development budgets. This study aims 
to analyze the effect of Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes), village funds, and the professionalism of village asset 
management simultaneously or partially on village original income in the village in Rembang Regency in 2022. The 
data used in this study were obtained from questionnaires given to the device village. This research uses a quantitative 
method with a descriptive research type. The sampling technique used was non-probability sampling and the sampling 
technique used was accidental sampling. The analysis model in this research is multiple regression analysis using IBM 
SPSS Statistic 26 software. The result of this study indicates that the variables of Village Owned Enterprises 
(BUMDes), village funds, and the professionalism of village asset management have a simultaneous effect on the 
village’s original income. Partially, Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) and the professionalism of village asset 
management have a significant effect on the village’s original income, and village fund variables do not affect the 
village’s original income. This research is expected to be used as further research literature, can add to the research 
sample not only in Rembang Regency but wider in scope, and can add other independent variables.

1. Introduction
The objective of this study is to examine how Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes), village funds, and the 
professionalism of village asset management affect village original income in villages in Rembang Regency in 2022. 
This question is important because the village’s original income is an important part of a smooth governance village 
when the village's original income can be increased, the village will receive management funds and village 
development financing (Juliarso & Hidayat, 2017). The case that occurred in 2021 was the Covid-19 pandemic which 
had an impact on national economic conditions such as economic growth. According to Rahayu et al. (2016), economic 
growth is a change in the level of the economy that causes goods and services to be produced in the community and 
increases people's welfare. The COVID-19 pandemic caused the rate of economic growth in Rembang Regency in 
2020 to decrease by 1.46% but in 2021 it increased by 3.8% (Lestari, 2022). Not only the rate of economic growth in

b. Dependent Variable: Village Original Income
Based on Table 7. explains that the results of the coefficient of determination test the Adjusted R Square value of 
0.474 or 47.4%. This shows that the variables of Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes), village funds, and the 
professionalism of village asset management influence village original income by 47.4% while 52.6% are influenced 
by other variables besides the variables in this study. 
5.7 Discussion 
The Influence of Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) on Village Original Income 
Based on the results of the partial test in table 5, the variable Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) obtained a 
regression coefficient value of 0.197 with a significant value of 0.000 where the value was less than 0.05, so it can be 
concluded that the Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) variable has a positive effect on the dependent variable of 
village original income in Rembang Regency in 2022. Village Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) as one of the village 
economic institutions can improve the welfare of rural communities by developing village economic enterprises and 
contributing to the village’s original income which can optimize village prosperity, so the greater the income of Village 
Owned Enterprises (BUMDes), the greater as well as contributions made to the village's original income 
The Influence of Village Funds on Village Original Income 
Based on the results of the partial test in table 5, shows the village fund variable has a regression coefficient value of 
0.037 with a significant value of 0.730 where the value is more than 0.05 so it can be concluded that the village fund 
variable does not affect the variable dependent on village original income in Rembang Regency in 2022. Even though 
the continuum line drawing of the village fund variable is in the very good category, the village fund variable does 
not affect the village's original income, because the use of village funds is prioritized for physical development and 
empowerment Public. 
The Effect of The Professionalism of Village Asset Management on Village Original Income  
Based on the partial test results in table 5, the variable of professionalism of village asset management has a regression 
coefficient value of 0.496 with a significant value of 0.000 where the value is less than 0.05, so it can be concluded 
that the variable of village asset management professionalism has a positive effect on the dependent variable village 
original income to the village in Rembang Regency in 2022. Professionalism is a behavior that in doing work requires 
expertise either through education or certain training carried out as work that can generate income (Natalia et al., 
2017). Professionalism in managing village assets can be seen in how village officials can carry out their duties, 
namely managing village assets properly, when village assets have been managed properly, their use can also be 
optimal so that they can increase the village's original income.

Abstract 
Undertaking film production during the Covid-19 pandemic made some crews feel afraid and uncomfortable while 
working because many crews still did not follow health protocols and social distancing. In this research, the authors 
try to apply a zoning system at the shooting location. According to research that the authors have done, there are still 
crews who do not understand what a zone-based system is, how it is implemented, and how many do not comply with 
the protocol. In this research, the authors want to try to improve the existing zoning system to be even better to prevent 
and break the chain of transmission of Covid-19 at the shooting location of the short film Budak Bidak.

1. Introduction
In March 2020, the Covid-19 or Coronavirus 2019 pandemic first entered Indonesia and implemented a continuous 
regional quarantine. In order to avoid the crowd, people had to work at home. Many industries are affected by the 
implementation of this regional quarantine. One of the industries affected is the film industry. In 2019, the average 
film production in Indonesia was around 140 titles per year, and the profit reached two trillion. However, as a result 
of this pandemic, as many as 30 films have had their production postponed (Dampak Pandemi terhadap Industri 
Perfilman dan Keberlangsungan Festival Film 2020).  
Most filmmakers have not dared to restart film production due to fear of virus transmission if filming involves many 
people. After months of stalling, the government began evaluating policies to revive the national film industry and 
allow film filming by applying strict health protocols. 
The head of DKI Disparekraf, Cucu Ahmad Kurnia, said that there are several COVID-19 prevention protocols that 
the entire production crew must follow. The crew must use masks or personal protective equipment (PPE), maintain 
distance and also routinely clean themselves (wash hands) (Wardani 2020). Preferably, the crew minimizes the use of 
work equipment done simultaneously or alternately. This equipment should be routinely cleaned before and after use 
alternately.
In addition, a zone-based system was created to break the chain of transmission of Covid-19 in the production process 
at the filming location. Where in this system, the filming location is divided into four zones, namely zone A, zone B, 
zone C, and zone D. Zone A is the most vulnerable and vital zone, where individuals such as actors can work without 
keeping a distance, and protective equipment personal protective equipment (PPE). Zona B is a set filled by the crew 
working around the filming set. Zone C is a zone for the production team that does not work on the filming location. 
Zone D is a zone for workers related to the production team. This zone is the limit of interaction between the outside 
world (Protokol Hollywood, Kru-Aktor Wajib Tes Covid sebelum Syuting 2020).
Based on interviews with fellow filmmakers, the authors found that in his work, some crews still do not obey the rules 
set because the crews do not get an in-depth explanation of what the zone system is and how to apply it. Some crews 
can still access zones that should not be accessible, and no one strictly monitors this zone system. They are unaware

enough that it becomes difficult if you have to go back and forth. The producer occasionally checks the location to 
see how the zoning is applied, but the crew already understands so that no one enters the other zone randomly. 
 
5.4 Give ID Card to the whole crew 
In addition to providing information with zone location maps and the names of the crew in each zone, the producer 
also made an ID Card containing the name, zone information, and job description. This ID Card provides personal 
information for each crew so that other crews can identify other crews. This ID Card is differentiated by color 
according to the zone of each crew.  
 
There are restrictions on the number of crews from majors and campuses, making several crews concurrently with 
departments. The existence of multiple departments often causes problems when applying the zone system at the 
filming location. The crew staying in Zone C should enter Zone B to carry out their duties. That way, the authors 
should rethink the appropriate way to apply the zone system at the time of the filming location.  
 
The implementation of the zone system at the Budak Bidak filming location went well. Although the producer often 
experienced obstacles in applying the zone system, the producer dealt with the problem well. Although it was well 
planned during the pre-production related to this zone system, the producer had to adapt to the conditions on location 
in its implementation. 
 
A comparison between the swab results in the first and last days of production has both swab reports showed negative 
results for all the crew of the short film Budak Bidak. From the swab reports, the use of the zone system at the filming 
location of the short film Budak Bidak was successfully carried out. 
 
6. Conclusion 
During the covid-19 pandemic, a regional quarantine was imposed that required everyone to stay at home. Many 
industries are affected, one of which is the film sector. Filming was delayed, and many were canceled. As time passed, 
the government began allowing filmmakers to film with strict health protocols and some other conditions. However, 
many crews still feel scared and uncomfortable when they are on location because they still do not follow strict health 
protocols and do not keep their distance from other crews.  
 
Implementing a zone-based system or zoning at the filming location is done to avoid crowding the crew. Usually, 
filming locations are divided into several zones. Zone A is the most extensive zone because its actors are required not 
to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and not to keep a distance. Zone B is a zone for the crew directly related 
to Zone A. Zone C is a zone for the production team that does not work on set. This zone serves as a base for all crews 
not directly related to the set and a basecamp for the entire department to store their respective tools. In its work, many 
still do not understand what a zone-based system is, how it is applied and many crews do not comply with it.  
 
Implementing the zone system at the Budak Bidak filming location went well and smoothly. Although the producer 
experienced several obstacles in applying this zone system, the producer dealt with the problem well. Although it was 
well planned during pre-production related to this zone system, in its implementation, the producer had to adapt to the 
conditions on location.  
 
In this research, the authors want to try to improve the existing zone-based system to be even better. The 
implementation of a zone-based system was then applied at the filming location of the short film Budak Bidak to 
prevent and break the chain of transmission of the Covid-19 virus at the location of the short film filming and also to 
answer the research questions of this research. The research question for this study is “How can the application of a 
zone-based system in the production of short films be made to create a safe shooting location during a pandemic?” 
 
After making a case study of the short film Budak Bidak, the authors can answer the research question. The 
implementation of a zone-based system can be done well if there is a more detailed explanation related to the zone 
system itself, making information about the zone system, the producer making a map of the location of the zone, and 
whoever is the crew in each zone, making zone writings such as zone A, zone B, and zone C are then attached to each 
zone, and control all crews on duty to comply with the zone system. After two days of applying the system, the 
4367","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022 
© IEOM Society International 
producer did an independent antigen test with negative results for the entire crew and actors to implement the system 
successfully.  
 
The obstacle encountered during this research process is that during the production process of the short film Budak 
Bidak, the producer cannot control the application of this zone at all times because the producer changes positions 
with one of the crews in zone C. The crew is considered more helpful to be in zone B. In addition, the location does 
not support the application of this zone system due to the large number of people passing by and watching the filming 
process. Some crews have two positions at once, which makes crews have to interact directly more often.  
 
So that when there are filmmakers who want to implement this zone system in the pre-production process, they must 
think carefully about the management of the crew and their role in the filming location so that no one changes 
positions. Location selection is also essential for the application of this zone system. The ideal location to apply this 
system is in the studio or a location where not many people can access the location to minimize contact with the 
outside environment.

Abstract 
The company's ability to communicate to their customers are very important to achieve the expected expectations of 
the quality of the products and services presented. This phenomenon encourages various companies to develop their 
services through various technological approaches in reaching customers from across regions. On the other hand, 
Pension funds management customers are retired and less familiar with the use of the internet and other technologies. 
Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the indicators of the quality of electronic services (e-service quality) 
in the form of efficiency, responsiveness, privacy, and reliability that can affect customer satisfaction, which then has 
an impact on customer behavioral intentions reinforced by technology readiness. Questionnaires were distributed to 
pension funds management customers in the Central Sulawesi, Indonesia with a minimum age of 50 years and have 
used various pension funds management digitization services with a total of 451 respondents who collected and met 
the requirements. The analytical method used is PLS-SEM to test the hypothesis, validity, and reliability. Based on 
the results of the analysis that has been carried out in this study, it is known that the variables that positively and 
significantly affect Customer Satisfaction are Efficiency, Responsiveness and Reliability. In the other hypotheses, it 
is known that Customer Satisfaction affects Behavioral Intention positively and significantly, while Technology 
Readiness is positively and significantly moderating Customer Satisfaction towards Behavioral Intention pension 
funds management company in Indonesia. 
Keywords 
Pension Funds, e-Service Quality, Customer Satisfaction, Technology Readiness, Behavioral Intention. 
1. Introduction
Significant developments in technology have shaped new ways for organizations to communicate with customers 
(Raza et al., 2020). The use of the internet is believed to be able to produce the best potential that can be achieved by 
the quality of electronic services in any business sector, including the insurance sector. However, with Indonesia 
demographic condition which consists of various islands and archipelagos, the use of the internet has become uneven. 
Based on a survey conducted by APJII (Association of Indonesian Internet Service Providers) regarding internet user 
penetration in 2018, it shows that the spread of internet usage is uneven throughout Indonesia. The largest contribution 
of internet users is on the island of Java with a percentage of 55.7% while the lowest area for the contribution of 
internet usage is in the islands of Sulawesi, Maluku & Papua, which combined only reaches 10.9%. This also has an 
impact on technological developments through e-services provided by the company to keep up with industry growth, 
including the pension fund insurance industry which has its own characteristics for its customers, most of whom are 
retirees who are not familiar with technology. Customer age and readiness for technology is a major factor indicator 
that causes a person to be willing or unwilling to use the technology. The results of the APJII survey in 2018 also 
provide an overview of the reasons why someone does not use technology both from the use of the internet and the e-
services provided. Based on the survey, only 0.9% of people in Indonesia do not use the internet due to the lack of an 
internet network. People do not use the internet mostly because they do not know how to use the technology.

Abstract 
Although electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) has long been recognized for its ability to impact customer decision-
making, the mechanism of e-WOM influence on customer purchase intention in the e-Marketplace is still unclear. An 
empirical model is used in this study to examine the factors that determine the credibility of e-WOM in e- 
Marketplaces. The proposed framework explains how customers use e-Marketplace as a platform for sharing 
information, as well as the impact it has on brand image creation and online purchasing intention through e-WOM 
credibility. The survey research with a six-point Likert scale online questionnaire using a purposive sampling method 
collects 237 respondents from five cities in Greater Jakarta. The study tests the hypotheses using SmartPLS, 
Cronbach's Alpha to determine the reliability, and AVE & factor loading to test the validity. The result shows that the 
message content, trust, and recommendation in the e-marketplace review section significantly influence e-WOM 
credibility. The credibility of e-WOM substantially affects customer purchase intention and brand image creation. 
Brand image creation partially mediates e-WOM credibility and purchase intention. EWOM credibility is becoming 
a substantial variable as not only it could influence customer purchase intention but also brand image creation. These 
inputs could be useful for managers and e-marketplace vendors to create design features and evaluation tools that 
assist consumers in identifying credible e-WOM messages. Those messages will then increase consumers' ""trust"" and 
""loyalty"" to e-marketplace vendors. 
Keywords 
EWOM, E-Marketplace, Trust, Purchase Intention, and Brand Image Creation. 
1. Introduction
As the Internet and information technology are getting advanced, electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) has become a 
crucial tool to convey product- or service-related information across industries. EWOM allows current, former, or 
potential consumers to make any positive or negative statements on products or services, which are seen by mass 
viewers on the Internet (Syahrivar and Ichlas 2018), including in e-commerce. There is an increase in e-commerce in 
Indonesia, and it is not slowing down. Additionally, with traffic being a continuous challenge in major cities in Java, 
Internet shopping serves as a solution (Jain et al. 2021). There are two major categories of online commerce sections: 
social commerce and e-marketplace. Tokopedia, Shopee, and Lazada are examples of e-marketplace in Indonesia (Das 
et al. 2022). E-Marketplace means selling and buying activities using the internet provided by multiple third parties 
(Svobodová and Rajchlová 2020). In Indonesia, the E-Marketplace is developing quickly. More than 30 million 
Indonesians transact online, generating a market worth at least $8 billion (Das et al. 2022). 
EWOM in shopping websites where online reviews occur between anonymous users is a crucial factor that influences 
a brand image and customers' purchase intention, which can be a prominent topic in academics (Consuegra et al. 2018; 
Siddiqui et al. 2021; Tien et al. 2019). There is a rise in the intention to purchase products/services when corporations 
give features that suit a consumer's demand. Moreover, purchase intention is an attitude variable that may be used to 
measure customers' future contributions to a brand and, in turn, lead to actual purchase behavior (Consuegra et al. 
2018).

Abstract 
Electronic Commerce (e-commerce) and Social Commerce (s-commerce) companies in Indonesia continue to build 
innovations by providing various exciting features to increase the number of visitors, one of which is live shopping. 
Live shopping is increasingly being found in e-commerce and s-commerce because it has become a new way of 
shopping online. There is a significant correlation between live shopping and impulse buying behavior. Impulse 
buying is a person’s decision that is not planned (or suddenly without consideration) when buying a product in large 
quantities. This scientific article was created using a systematic literature review (SLR) method using journals indexed 
in the Scopus database and the Web of Science (2013-2022). The keywords used to search and answer the research 
questions are (Live Streaming Shopping” AND “E-commerce” AND “S-commerce” AND “Impulsive Buying”). This 
research’s primary purpose is to analyze the effect of live shopping on e-commerce and s-commerce on impulse buying 
behavior in Indonesia. Besides that, it is also to identify people’s motives for making impulse purchases. The results 
of the SLR method found that there are 25 titles of papers are fulfilling the criteria. It found that two primary motives 
of Indonesian people in making impulse purchases, including (1) hedonic motives (2) and utilitarian motives.

5. Conclusion 
Based on the results and discussion answering RQ1, it can be concluded that live shopping on s-commerce is more 
influential or encourages Indonesian people to make impulse purchases. This is evidenced by the advantages that live 
shopping s-commerce offers are better and more satisfying. In addition, Indonesian people’s impulsive purchases on 
live shopping s-commerce are also supported by utilitarian and hedonic motives. And the self-characteristics that drive 
these motives are the social presence and attractiveness of the product or brand or live broadcast (trust). Meanwhile, 
answering RQ2, it can be found and identified two primary motives of consumers in making impulse purchases on 
live shopping e-commerce and s-commerce including: (1) hedonic motives, which play an important role in the 
impulsive buying behavior of Indonesian people, especially in live shopping s-commerce because it provides 
enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction, (2) utilitarian motives which also play an important role because the quality 
of the information provided regarding functional benefits and objective characteristics of a product is the attraction of 
live shopping channels in the hope of meeting their utilitarian needs.

1. Introduction
Talent is very important for any company; they need to develop and engage in a clear and healthy corporate 
environment. Companies have a challenging task to retain the best talent, companies need to identify the important 
factors that can be reasons for a talent to make a turnover. The phenomenon of turnover gets attention because it can 
affect the performance of a company, with the loss of a talent, it is certain that the company will lose one of its best 
legs or hands. Waterworth (2019) says that the company has a problem with employee retention. More than

Abstract 
With technological developments that are increasingly significant every year, many organizations or companies are 
led to change activities digitally without exception for student organizations that are required to do the same thing. 
Student organizations have the meaning of an organization that is formally and officially registered under the 
university. Other than that, it is not included in the context of student organizations. However, the implementation of 
digital transformation encountered many obstacles, such as a lack of prepared human resources, lack of support, and 
the reluctance to make significant changes. The method used in this research qualitatively uses a literature review 
method. The results of this research propose implementation steps that can be applied to student organizations, 
solutions to challenges during implementation, and a new factor in the digital organization, namely the digital mindset. 
Keywords 
The student organization, digital transformation, digital organization, digital mindset, organization agility. 
1. Introduction
The development of increasingly advanced technology demands more significant use of technology not only in large 
companies or organizations but has also begun to spread to student organizations in every university in Indonesia. One

Figure 6 above consists of two types of circles. The smaller process indicates the solution to a problem, while the large 
circle indicates one of the barriers to digital transformation in student organizations. Of course, these solutions can be 
used simultaneously, but the thing to remember is whether the student organization can use all of these solutions or not. 
In addition, each barrier connects with other walls because all obstacles are interrelated and connected. 
 
5.4 Digital Mindset 
The Figure 7 below explains the digital mindset that a digital organization must have. A digital perspective, in essence, 
is a significant part of digital student organizations. Without a digital perspective that is the connecting component and 
the main driver, it will not be easy to carry out digital transformation in student organizations. 
 
Figure 7. Digital Mindset 
Figure 7 above proposes that six factors are part of the digital mindset. Digital leadership, high awareness, digital 
strategy, digital processes, digital management, and innovative and adaptive are the six factors. Without a minimum of 
these six factors, a student organization can be declared not to have a digital mindset that is the core of digital 
transformation in student organizations. 
 
Figure 8. The New Digital Organization 
Figure 8 above proposes a new form of digital organization after the digital mindset. It can be seen that the digital 
mindset is the link and key to the factors that exist in student organizations. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The digital transformation carried out in student organizations is expected to significantly influence the organization, 
such as increasing effectiveness and efficiency and solving problems in student organizations that carry out operational 
activities manually. In addition, the steps proposed in this paper can accelerate the implementation of digital 
4432","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations

transformation in student organizations. The solutions proposed in this paper can also have a positive impact when 
implementing digital transformation encounters obstacles. Finally, the digital components of the organization can also 
be a reference in forming an ideal digital organization. 
Thus, the paper’s results are expected to be used as a reference and applied in the implementation of digital 
transformation in student organizations. 
 
7. Future Research 
Various companies or organizations are growing and implementing digital transformation to increase effectiveness and 
efficiency in operational activities. However, the implementation of digital transformation in student organizations is 
still being forgotten and sidelined. Therefore, further research and analysis are needed to implement digital change in 
student organizations. Further, digital transformation needs to be developed so that all organizations, without exception, 
take advantage of the implementation of digital transformation.

Abstract 
E-marketplaces are tangible manifestations of the development of technology and communication. Unlike in the
past when people tended to be skeptical of buying products online, nowadays some e-marketplace sites have
recorded dramatic numbers of visitors. The COVID-19 pandemic also encourages an increase in online purchase
activities. Today's online sellers also sell fresh food products such as fruit and vegetables in their online store on
the e-marketplace. This becomes interesting to study considering the commonly believed risk of getting not-so-
fresh products with the fact that fresh food’s quality might deteriorate while in transit. Based on the Theory of
Planned Behavior (TPB), this quantitative study with convenience sampling is to determine the impact of three
major predictors of the theory on the intention to purchase fresh food products at online stores on e-marketplaces.
Besides, online trust in store (OTIS) is used to mediate the two constructs of subjective norm (online review and
peer communication) on purchase intention. Through responses from 228 respondents from Indonesia, analyzed
using PLS-SEM, findings indicate that subjective norms and perceived behavioral control have no significant
influence on purchase intentions. It was also found that OTIS was successful in mediating the two constructs of
subjective norm on purchase intention.

1. Introduction
Contemporary globalization, according to Steger and James (2019) is an unprecedented period of interconnectivity. 
In recent years, the internet has emerged as a critical tool for activity mobilization and cross-border information 
transmission, and information and communication technology (ICT) has become a crucial tool for pushing 
globalization. Several researchers have emphasized the benefits of ICT and social media for cross-network 
synergy, including Moghadam (2020). In their study, Jehangir et al. (2011) discovered that ICT has a great impact 
on society, organizations, businesses, and buyers. Technology, particularly the internet, has revolutionized

Abstract 
Human capital is becoming an increasingly important factor in rural economic development. Economic research, 
however, has not provided clear empirical support for the relationship between human capital investment and 
economic growth. This paper applies to stock and flow concepts to human capital and suggests an operational 
approach for using stock and course concepts to analyse the impact of human capital investments through education 
on economic growth. This paper has two main goals. First, assess and measure gaps in human capital stock in this 
country. It shows how effectively the different regions improve human capital stock and how long it will take to 
bring developing countries up to date with current levels of human capital in industrialized countries. In contribution 
to the occupation of human capital economic growth, the proposed employment decomposition method growth is 
also affected by the development of human capital gross output per worker. The proposed method introduces job 
growth broken down by job growth elasticity. Assume employment growth increases with human capital elasticity 
will decrease, making the economy less labor-intensive, leading to higher economic growth. The proposed method 
emphasizes micro links between human capital and the labor market. This work aims to examine the relationship 
between human capital and economic development. The study analyzes datasets from previous works, reviews 
previous literature, and draws some conclusions on human capital and economic growth. The paper summarizes 
articles on human capital in terms of the theoretical framework of economic growth theory, the neo-classical growth 
model, the Solow growth production function, the new endogenous theory, and empirical evidence on the

On the one hand, the education system needs to be modernized so that people with new skills can be trained.  Public 
spending on education and R & D. The limitation of the research is that our research is based on quantitative 
indicators, but some authors argue that the quality of human capital needs to be comprehensively expressed by 
qualitative indicators as well.  Another limitation is that this type of research cannot reliably determine the impact of 
human capital quality on economic indicators. Therefore, the attention is rightfully focused on increasing the level 
of human capital, but also the development of digital skills within the population.  On one hand, education systems 
need to be updated and able to train people with new skills.  Of course, there is no need to increase the number of 
people with a university degree and to increase the share of public expenditure earmarked for education or research 
and development.  The crucial issue is which sectors are promising and soon there will be an increased demand for 
them in the labor market, as well as to which areas of research and development the increased expenditures should 
be oriented.

Abstract 
Nowadays, the internet is overgrowing with the presence of various social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, 
and YouTube. This creates creativity from all walks of life and ages to contribute to introducing themselves as brand 
ambassadors and influencers by creating various forms of content. One popular form of content is content with a bit 
of time or a short video. However, then, a brand also needs to analyze whether there is trust that can be generated by 
using short video content on specific social media platforms or not. This research uses a literature review as the 
research method. This article tries to answer the concerns of a brand in promoting its products or services by using 
short video content and someone to promote the brand. In addition, this research also aims to determine the level of 
awareness a brand can get if they upload content on specific social media platforms.

To which areas of research and development the increased expenditures should be oriented. 
5. Conclusion
The results of this study prove that a platform for uploading content can affect the engagement value of that content. 
In addition, the influence level of users' trust in a social media platform concludes that there is a mindset formed by 
these users regarding content that has been uploaded. Finally, there is an influence on potential buyers on the selection 
of brand ambassadors or influencers to promote a product or service; a brand needs to pay attention to its credibility 
so that it is by the quality and value of the brand's products and services. Unfortunately, this journal still has many 
shortcomings, one of which is the lack of data regarding YouTube Shorts as one of the popular social media for short 
videos, so it is hoped that future research can discuss YouTube Shorts and social media platforms are suitable for short 
videos.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic increasing e-HRM adoption for many companies, especially in Financial Institution. Job 
Tenure, Gender, and Corona Fear are possibly moderate the using of e-HRM. This study seeks what is the influential 
factors for e-HRM adoption and which moderating variables will moderate strongly for acceptance of DigiHC 
Technology adoption. 
This study was using quantitative method and the UTAUT-1 model that consisted of Performance Expectancy, Effort 
Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Condition, Behavioral Intention, and Use Behavior. Social Isolation was 
the extended variable because it was the innate variables of Corona Fear Variable. Job Tenure, Gender, and Corona 
Fear will be the moderating variables. The survey was conducted by 395 employees of a Financial Institution with 
Proportionate Stratified Random Sampling and analyzed by SmartPLS using SEM techniques. 
This study found the most influential factors was Social Influence to Behavioral Intention. Job Tenure moderates the 
relation of Effort Expectancy and Behavior Intention, Gender moderates the relation of Social Isolation, Corona Fear 
moderates the relation of Social Influence and Behavior Intention, as the moderating variables.  
Keywords

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic forces various sectors to adapt to digitalization both in terms of companies and individuals 
(Vahdat, 2022). This is evident from The World Economic Forum (2020) where 91.7% of companies implement a 
policy of Working From Home (WFH). This survey is also supported by Katadata (2021) where 58% stated that the 
main reason employees who did WFH is fear of the risk of being exposed to COVID-19 while traveling or in an office 
environment. Of course, this policy must be supported by the readiness of technology and digitalization. In the same 
survey, 75% of companies accelerate digitization in their work processes. The existence of increasingly massive digital 
developments makes business processes from upstream to begin downstream slowly to experience digitalization in 
every company. 
The Human Resource (HR) department is one of the most important departments in a company. Therefore, this 
department must do digitization, for example using e-HRM technology. E-HRM is one of the innovations in the field 
of Human Resources Management (HRM), which is a new wave of technology that has now begun to develop (Yusliza 
and Ramayah 2012). E-HRM technology is a way to implement HR strategies, both regulatory and practical, where 
this technology can connect managers, employees, and HR Professionals to extract data or change information data 
that is important for managing company HR through web-based or mobile technology. Financial and Insurance 
institution are the highest sectors that have used the Human Resource Management System (HRMS) to support their 
business needs (Statista 2022). This is because this sector has many workers. 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is present and always changing. This change causes the need for 
employee skills to increase. This also encourages a demand for workers with certain skills, and in some cases required 
to conduct training to support the improvement of these skills (Mello 2011). Kuusisto (2017) stated that the readiness 
of the HR Division to be involved in digital transformation needs to be prepared. However, adaptation to digital

5. Discussion 
In this study, without using moderating variables, all relationships between variables were found supported. This is in 
line with studies conducted by Casey and Wilson-Evered (2012); Dwivedi et al. (2011); Gupta et al. (2008); Šumak 
et al. (2011); Venkatesh et al. (2003); Zhou et al. (2010). This finding contradicts with Zwain (2019) which states that 
the relationship between Performance Expectancy and Effort Expectancy to Behavioral Intention is not significant. 
Facilitating Condition and Use Behavior are in line with the study conducted by Venkatesh (2003). Social Isolation 
which is the extended variable from the UTAUT-1 model, which also supported, these findings consistent with the 
study conducted by Raza et al. (2021). This indicates that isolated employees are more likely to use DigiHC for Work 
from Home (WFH). 
 
Regarding the calculation using moderating variables, it can be seen in table 8 which states that the Job Tenure variable 
moderates the relationship between Effort Expectancy and Behavioral Intention; the Gender variable moderates the 
relationship between Social Isolation and Behavioral Intention; and the Corona Fear variable moderates the 
relationship between Social Influence and Behavioral Intention. The other relationship was found not supported with 
these moderating variables. The relationship between Effort Expectancy and Behavior Intention moderated by Job 
Tenure shows that employees with certain tenures have different understandings of technology. This findings in line 
with Eom et al. (2016).  Therefore, tenure can accelerate the adoption of a technology. Meanwhile, the Gender variable 
was proven to moderate the relationship between Social Isolation and Behavioral Intention. This can happen because 
the reaction to social isolation varies based on the characteristics of certain sexes. The other variables, the Corona Fear 
variable has been shown to moderate the relationship between Social Influence and Behavior Intention. This can 
happen because the Corona Fear has an impact on the reaction of employees who are worried about COVID-19, thus 
accelerating the adoption of a technology. This is in line with research conducted by Raza et al. (2021) on Learning 
Management System (LMS) toward students in university. In his study stated that this will expect the influence by 
their friends and family to do so. 
 
6. Conclusion and Implication 
Without Moderating Variables, we found that the most influential factor was the relationship between Social Influence 
(SI) to Behavioral Intention (BI). The other found supported. Meanwhile, with moderating variables, we found that 
only a few variables successfully moderated the adoption of technology. There were Job Tenure (JT) Moderates the 
relationship between Effort Expectancy (EE) to Behavioral Intention (BI); Gender (G) moderate relationship between 
Social Isolation (SIS) and Behavioral Intention (BI); Corona Fear (CF) moderates Social Influence (SI) to Behavioral 
Intention (BI). It means that the moderating variables can strongly moderates adopting DigiHC in a Financial 
Institution in Indonesia. This study is expected to provide further insight to develop business strategies in the context 
of digital transformation adoption. For the companies, the study is expected to serve as a reference or input regarding 
the adoption of digital transformation so that they can develop their digital programs and digital applications better. 
In addition, the extent to which Job Tenure, Gender, and Corona Fear affect technology acceptance could provide 
insight to the company, specifically on identifying which employees could be given training in technology acceptance 
so that the requirement of these employees could be specifically given. It is recommended for future studies to use 
other various moderating variables, to obtain broader characteristics of technology acceptance for employees in a 
company.

Abstract 
Digital banks make it easier for a society to grow financial inclusion. The lack of digital literacy makes people still 
skeptical about the security of new technologies. This study aims to examine the impact of digital banking on gen z 
in Indonesia. The method used in this research is a literature review from various digital libraries and databases 
(IEEE Explore, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and Scopus). The subject areas of study are limited to 
""Digital Bank"", ""Gen Z"" and ""Technology"". The impact of the implementation of digital banks in Indonesia is very 
significant for the economy but is hampered by public skepticism about data security and privacy. Thus, it is 
necessary to increase digital literacy along with advances in technology

1. Introduction
Technological advances have had a significant impact on the development of the banking industry. The 
transformation that occurs is the development of digital banks in the form of bank services that go directly into the 
hands of customers. The factors that support this transformation are the adoption of smartphones and the massive

self-service, and artificial intelligence will make more use of guide robots. However, Various people have different 
ideas about how the branches will alter or transform in the future. Some think that branches will disappear and that 
digital channels will take over. Others say that branches will continue to satisfy consumers' requirements by 
embracing technological advancements. The key reason for the continuation of the branches will be the complicated 
items that require in-person consultation by banking employees (Balkan, 2022). 
According to the literature on digital banks, digital banks and traditional banks share numerous similarities. A 
notable distinction is that digital banks may be operated on an application to access the many functions offered. This 
is more about bringing business to customers and making it easier for them to use digital banking services. This has 
the potential to cross several frontiers, particularly in regional areas that have yet to obtain financial service 
coverage. Although digital banking has several benefits and impacts, people also have to educate themselves about 
digitalization literation because when an error happens in case of human error digital banking has limited access to 
prevent that mistake. 
Non-financial dangers are far more prevalent in remote banking services than in regular services. Software and 
human factors are the sources of risks. It is feasible to dedicate hostile Internet assaults to remote service channels. 
The key factors limiting banking expansion include the majority of the population's skepticism of Internet services. 
Phishing and pharming are current Internet banking cybercrimes, two of the most organized crimes of the twenty-
first century, manifesting themselves in a variety of ways. that hackers try to manipulate users over the Internet.   
 
Classified as external or internal depending on their sphere of effect or occurrence. External risks include dangers 
unrelated to the Bank's or a specific client's business, as well as political, economic, and other concerns. Internal 
risks are further subdivided into losses for the Bank's core and auxiliary businesses. The first type of hazard is the 
most common: credit, interest rate, currency, and market risks. The second category includes losses on deposit 
formation, risks associated with new sorts of activity, and risks associated with bank misuse (Litvishko et al. 2022). 
Effective service delivery and also ensure that the mobile network providers craft innovative services that are tailor-
made to the banks' customers. The banks should continuously upgrade their electronic banking technology so that 
they have an updated system in place for effective and efficient service delivery (Thabani, 2022). 
Telecommunications must be enhanced for banks and other financial institutions, as well as other organizations, to 
have an easy data communication network. As a result, electronic tellers and electronic money transfer services will 
be vastly enhanced. Customers must be informed on how to use their cards effectively and the need of maintaining 
the secrecy of their personal identifying numbers (PIN). However, the introduction of electronic automation via 
computer networks brought with it a unique challenge that had hitherto solely been associated with the manual 
approach. These are most commonly manifested as software fraud (Ibrahim and Daniel, 2022). 
The analysis of the diversification of world banks shows that in practice a set of strategies and methods of risk 
management should be applied to achieve sustainable development of the financial system. Studying the customers 
of banks and their needs in modern society requires constant international communication and the development of 
partnerships to create the conditions necessary for the provision of safe financial services and sustainable growth of 
banks (Aguayo and Ślusarczyk, 2020). 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the analysis described, it can be concluded that the progress of the financial industry, especially digital 
banks, has brought a lot of progress, especially in the younger generation who can be more financially literate. 
Based on data research by Google, Indonesia will be expected to reach $124 billion in 2025 in the digital economy. 
The expectation is seen to be reached because many players in banking create their digital banking. The acceleration 
is also supported by the domination of amount young people in Indonesia. Indonesia is one of the fastest in digital 
banking adoption, showing better results than China, considering of Indonesians is higher customer loyalty than 
other Asian countries. Digital banking has positively impacted the Indonesian people, especially in financial 
inclusion, in developing countries that make accelerated access to capital and many features for financial literacy.

Abstract 
Corporate Social Responsibility is the company's commitment to contributing to the community and the surrounding 
environment. The company maintains long-term sustainability by minimizing the negative impact of its operational 
activities. This study examines the effect of institutional ownership, liquidity, and risk minimization on corporate 
social responsibility disclosure. This study uses a sample of 73 companies in the infrastructure, utilities, and 
transportation sectors listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2018-2020 period. The analysis used in this study 
is descriptive analysis and panel data regression which is processed using the Eviews application. The hypothesis 
testing results indicate that liquidity positively affects corporate social responsibility disclosure. High liquidity 
suggests the company's ability to fund its social responsibility activities and disclosures. However, institutional 
ownership and risk minimization are not corporate social responsibility disclosure determinants. 
Keywords 
Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure, Institutional Ownership, Liquidity, Risk Minimization. 
1. Introduction
In the business world in recent years, there have been several issues of social and environmental problems. This 
problem starts from environmental management, which is not accompanied by corporate responsibility in preserving 
the environment. This causes losses to the surrounding community, such as disease outbreaks due to company waste, 
erosion, etc. Companies are required to carry out Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to reduce environmental 
damage and community losses. CSR is the company's commitment to contribute in the business world to the company's 
economic activities for long-term sustainability by paying attention to social responsibility for the community and the 
surrounding environment (Rahmawati and Retnani, 2021). The company's focus on long-term sustainability 
minimizes negative impacts, as evidenced by implementing CSR activities and disclosures. Disclosure of corporate 
social responsibility is part of accounting social responsibility by conveying company performance information related 
to acceptability and sustainability, which means the company is acceptable and sustainable (Widyastari and Sari, 
2018). Thus, investors can trust the company because they tend to invest in companies that carry out CSR activities 
and disclosures as a form of their social, environmental, labor, and consumer responsibility (Aruan et al., 2021). In 
carrying out the company's role to complete its increasingly complex social responsibilities, maximum efforts are 
needed to fulfill and carry out CSR activities (Cahyaningsih and Septyaweni, 2022) 
Government Regulation No. 47 of 2012 also states that companies must disclose social and environmental 
responsibility activities in the company's annual report and to the General Meeting of Shareholders (BPK, 2012). The 
Financial Services Authority also issued a regulation in the form of OJK Regulation Number 51/POJK.03/2017 
regarding sustainable finance, in which companies must publish reports containing economic, social, and

Purba and Candradewi (2019) and Sijum and Dewi (2021) that liquidity positively affects corporate social 
responsibility disclosure. 
Risk minimization has a probability value of 0.2710, greater than a significant value of 0.05, meaning that H3 is not 
supported. These results indicate that risk minimization does not affect CSR advertising. The presence or absence of 
a risk management committee within the company does not guarantee the company to improve the achievement of 
corporate social responsibility. The results of the study are in line with research conducted by Kurniawan & Yuniarta 
(2020). 
5. Conclusion
This study examines the effect of institutional ownership, liquidity, and risk minimization on corporate social 
responsibility disclosure in infrastructure, utility, and transportation sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange for 2018-2020. The test results show that liquidity positively affects the disclosure of corporate social 
responsibility. However, institutional ownership and risk minimization do not affect corporate social responsibility 
disclosure. Future research can examine other ownership structures, such as foreign and government ownership. 
Further researchers can also investigate other than the risk management committee, namely the sustainability 
committee. This research contributes to practice. The company should increase its level of liquidity so that it has more 
funds to disclose social responsibility. Investors could invest their funds in companies with a high level of liquidity 
and CSR disclosure.

Abstract 
Green product design has many attention recently since it brings environmental issues such as recycling, and green 
environmental. Eco-design as defined in ISO 14062 (ISO/TR 14062, 2002) is a design approach aiming to reduce the 
environmental impacts of products and services throughout the whole lifecycle, while assuring similar or improved 
services to the end customer. In this work, we focus on  product development that integrates green design and 
ergonomic aspects. The product is called 3 kg gas rack. The eco-design has been applied in development the product, 
by selecting recycled steel bar as the material. Ergonomic assesment by applying CATIA software  in the pre-
development stage brings crucial improvent in user’s  working performance. The finished product is stand firm and 
functioning properly. it is fulfill customer requirement of green design product.

Abstract 
During the Covid-19 pandemic that hit various parts of the world, it had an impact on various changes felt by various 
fields, especially government employess. There are employees who work from home (WFH) employees experience a 
variety of boredom and decreased level of satisfaction. This study aims to prove the effect of training and job 
satisfaction competencies with incentives as moderating variables. Respondents ini this study were employees at The 
General Election Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu) spread over 17 districts or cities ini South Sumatera Province, 
Indonesia. The sampling technique used is systematic random sampling which begins with selecting 9 districts/cities 
then random sample of 150 employees was taken from total population of 181 employees. Data collection techniques 
using closed questionnaires or google form, observation, and interviews. The data analysis technique was carried out 
using the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results of the study show that training has a positive effect on 
increasing competence and employee job satisfaction. Competence has a positive effect on job satisfaction. Incentives 
as moderating variables have an impact on increasing the relationship between training and job satisfaction. Training 
conducted by employees has a positive impact on employee job satisfaction, however, if incentives are given to 
employees, job satisfaction will increase. This is certainly an incentive for institutions or organizations to not only 
provide training assignments, but the need for incentives for training participants.

1. Introduction
Human resources are a very important factor for organizations within a company, especially to manage, regulate in 
utilizing existing aspects in an organization, to achieve the desired goals of the company. Because the progress or not 
of an organization in a company is determined by the quality of Human Resources (HR), Kasmir (2016). 
Job satisfaction cannot be obtained because there are still many employees whose performance cannot be improved 
because the level of employee competence is still low, low competence will affect employee job satisfaction. This is 
also due to the lack of training programs provided by the company. Job satisfaction is basically something that is 
individual. Everyone has a different level of satisfaction according to the value system that applies to employees. The 
higher the assessment of the activity is felt in accordance with the wishes of the individual, the higher the satisfaction 
with the activity. 
In research conducted by Renyut et al (2017) stated that competence has a positive and significant effect on job 
satisfaction. Nashar et al (2018) explain that training has a positive and significant direct effect on job satisfaction. In 
research by rizkia (2017) Explain if training has a positive effect on competence, from the results of research conducted 
4518","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022

The Effect of Training (X1) on Satisfaction (Y) 
From the test results above, training (X1) has a positive effect on satisfaction (Y) with a t-count value of 2.87. The 
more training is held, the more satisfaction it will provide for employees. This positive influence is because employees 
feel more cared for by the institution with the training held and through training they will receive material refreshment. 
This is also directly proportional to the research conducted. This means that the institution must also improve the 
quality and quality of providing technical guidance or training to employees, with training it can also increase the 
sense of team spirit in order to motivate employees to work better and be able to trust and support each other and help 
one another. 
The Effect of Competence (X2) on Satisfaction (Y) 
The test results above, Competence (X2) has a positive effect on satisfaction (Y) with a t-count = 2.74. This implies 
that competence has an effect on employee job satisfaction. This result implies that institutions can always pay 
attention to employee competencies and focus on efforts to improve the competencies of their employees. Increased 
competence must also be harmonized with the facilities and conditions of the institution that can provide job 
satisfaction for employees so that they can achieve organizational goals, meaning that the higher the expertise or 
competence a person has, the job satisfaction will also increase. Employees who feel they have a high level of 
competence will easily feel dissatisfied with the working conditions they are facing. 
The Effect of Training (X1) on Competence (X2) 
The results of the above test, training (X1) has a positive effect on competence (X2) with a t-count value = 7.16. This 
shows that training has an influence on competence. It can be concluded that the training that has been carried out by 
the company has been planned to improve the competence of its employees and realize what the company wants. The 
training provided has an impact on employees, especially in improving their skills or abilities as well as knowledge 
about new things that were not known before. In this case, training is also very influential in shaping the character and 
attitudes of employees. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Results Based on the research obtained, the conclusions from this study, 150 respondents spread over 17 
regencies/cities in South Sumatra are PPNPN Bawaslu and come from 3 existing divisions, namely HR, PHL and 
HPPS. and All variables stated are valid and reliable, as well as research models that have met the GOF statistical 
criteria and the results of hypothesis testing obtained that Training and Competence have a positive effect on 
objectives. The training variable also has a positive effect on Competence.

Abstract 
As one of Archipelagic State, discrepancy is still a general issue for Indonesia’s economic & human capital 
development. In general, difficulties on accessing automotive repairment services and getting spare parts are still faced 
by those who lived in lesser and far remote islands of the country. As Indonesian government has main agenda to 
achieve equitable development and fulfill UN Agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) No.8 on Decent & 
Economic Growth, realization has been made by state own subsidiary: PT Pertamina Lubricants (PTPL) through the 
establishment of Corporate Social Responsibility of Enduro Entrepreneur Program (EEP). Since it has been launched 
on 2018 in the province of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT), EEP which main goal is to create new entrepreneurs has 
brought new dimension on CSR programs by combining business, entrepreneurship, and social economic development 
program. This article examines how development program through CSR Activities of PT Pertamina Lubricants in 
establishing have brought multidimensional impacts in remote area of Indonesia. By applying methods of Social 
Return On Investment, the analysis shows that PTPL financing of EEP have impacted on advancing automotives 
repairing skills needed by mechanics, creating new employment, and making easier vehicle services access in rural 
areas. Based on the impact assessment of the Enduro Entrepreneurship Program, an SROI Ratio of 1:53 was obtained, 
meaning that for every investment of Rp.1, - an impact or benefit of Rp.5,3 is obtained. SROI method has proven to 
be sustainable approach on assessing social economic development program.

Abstract 
South African mining industry is struggling with quick methods of structural change set ups. This is also a 
challenge even in temporary set ups and installation. Most mining materials are handled/moved using conveyor 
belts. These conveyor belts are reducing downtimes and increases operating cost due to higher maintenance and 
breakdowns. A study for different equipment making up a complete conveyor belt was conducted to learn more 
about this equipment and their behaviour. Advantages and disadvantages were noted in studying different types. 
Causes of failures with recommended maintenance and operating methodologies were also noted on the research 
made in the past. Conveyors systems can be very dangerous especially when in operations. Protective devices and 
methods are also noted and advised. Plough Scraper and Tilting Device are also researched as they provide a 
cheaper method of transferring materials or offloading a conveyor system either temporarily or permanently. 
History of scrapers and tilting device is also observed to further understand the background in contribution to 
recommending the best suitable solution to scrap off materials either in a tilted method or non-tilted scraping off 
from a moving conveyor. All of the equipment making up the conveyor belts including the tilting and scraping 
systems contributed to coming up with a very successful method of scraping or offloading a moving conveyor in 
a reasonable time and cost without major modifications as before this technology was discovered.

1. Introduction
Exxaro is the third largest coal producer in South Africa. In November 2006 Kumba Resources Limited and 
Kumba coal and other assets merged with Eyesizwe coal to create Exxaro Resource Limited. It has since grown 
to be the largest and foremost black empowered coal and heavy mineral company is South Africa. Exxaro also 
has other business interest in Europe, USA and Australia. In South Africa Exxaro’s portfolio include coal mining, 
Iron ore, pigment manufacturing, renewable energy (Wind) and residual base metals (Exxaro Resources, 2021). 
Although more revenue and operations are in coal mining interest is also focused in expanding in these 
investments. Table 1 shows the operations where Exxaro has secured shares. Locations of Exxaro operates in 
South Africa in the province of Mpumalanga and Limpopo. Grootegeluk Coal Mine being the mine this research 
was developed feeds 2 Eskom Power Stations being Matimba and Medupi alone, No coal mine in close proximity 
to assist in case Grootegeluk is unable to. The coal is graded accordingly, crushed, screened, and washed before 
being supplied to different customers.

application. 4 being the rim. 
 
5. Fire Proofing/ Prevention During Belt Scraping 
It is to be noted that the scraping action creates lots of friction between the belt and the scraper. Effort is to be 
applied to ensure the scrapping plate and conveyor being scraped does not cause fire hazard especially when 
scraping coal as is highly flammable. There are lot of conveyor material that are easily flammable. The non-
flammable ones are to be considered as part of fire proofing in coal mines. Rubber textile conveyor belts used in 
underground coal mines require strong and standardized fire-resistant properties to guarantee the safety of the 
human beings and equipment’s. The purpose of this is the optimization of the rubber ingredients used in the 
conveyor which are the main contributors of fire hazard in the belts (Dushi, et al., 2013). The ingredients include 
but not limited to Sb2O3 (X1), chlorinated paraffins (X2) and clay (X3) (Dushi, et al., 2013). The experiments 
were designed using central composite rotatable design (CCRD) of second order, according to the mathematical 
model of desirability functions. The fitted responses for flammability were Spirit Burner test (Y1), Surface 
resistance test (Y2), and Limit oxygen index, LOI (Y3). The preferred solution minimum X1 = 0.2889; X2 = 0.39 
and X3 = -0.832. Composite appeal is minimum 0.932. This is well-organized rate for appeal (Dushi, et al., 2013).  
 
6. Belt Safety Devices 
Safety devices normally incorporated in the belt conveyor systems includes anti-roll back devices, speed limit 
switches, skew sensors, no speed switches, interlock protection switches and overload notifications 
 
7. Conclusion  
The objective was to acquire more information on the challenges, recommendations from past researchers and 
best ways to avoid failures on system equipment of Tilting Device and Plough Scraper. This included the history 
and other Plough Scrapers and Tilting Devices previously used and any other similar method to remove material 
from a moving conveyor into a new line or destination. The method of using Tilting Device and Plough Scraper 
was proven to be efficient and cost effective before and after being put into practice in Exxaro Grootegeluk Mine. 
Improvements can be made to adjust some smaller grey areas on the system. It can also be rolled out as it works 
better comparing to the effort and cost of using the traditional transfer tower method. More research can assist in 
improving this set up. Because the Tilting Device is rarely used, results obtained are good for a scarce system of 
this nature. This is less complicated and more ideal for the mining environment since complexity is not ideal. Ease 
of maintenance and operation is also evident on this Tilting Device and Plough Scraper. The only maintenance 
will be on the scraper of the plough, liners on the plough and flattening rollers on the tilting device. Time taken 
to design and install the system is also effective and economical. It takes lesser time to design and install this 
system with no alternative supplies or penalties to consider when installing this system. The customers remain 
undisrupted during this construction. The opportunity that rose to supply power station coal to other mines other 
than the ones currently supplied via directs belts was solved without an impact. Now coal is supplied to other 
users for additional income. This can open the market to supply even more customers for better profit. With this 
operational the mine does not depend on the current bigger customers being Eskom Matimba and Medupi. Some 
contracts can emerge from the ability to supply more from the current system. The scraper suppliers are to be 
involved when designing this kind of system. Scraper suppliers might not have supplied this kind of systems but 
have supplied a return belt scraper on the conveyor belts. Return belt scrappers work similar as this but they will 
just focus more of this kind of objective. Carry back scraping experience gives better insight to contribute to this

kind of system as scraping force is similar, just on different quantity and purpose for this set up. Plough also works 
fine without the Tilting Device. It is evident that the Plough without Tilting Device also produces good material 
transfer if the belt is flattened.

Abstract 
Operating a Plough Scraper and a Tilting Device should be very easy and safe. As much as the installation and 
maintenance is cheaper it does not require too much for both operation and maintenance. Some systems are 
automated with the plant and needs no operator to operate manually. Non-automated systems need only 1 operator 
of part time basis to operate and only when the system is engaged or in lowered position. Interlocking for the 2 
conveyors was ensured to protect the system from blockages and spillages. Once the scraper is lowered material 
is being scraped from the 4000 tpa conveyor to the 2000 tpa conveyor. The rest becomes just monitoring with no 
physical contact to the running system. When scraping is completed, the plough is lifted to allow material to pass 
straight to another feed being Eskom Medupi feed line. The system is easy to operate with 4 main buttons being 
Tilting Device lifting and lowering, Plough Scraper lifting and lowering. Once the Tilting Device is lifted and 
Plough lowered interlock kicks in to reduce the feed from the 4000 tpa. Once the Tilting Device is lowers with 
Plough lifted the interlocks is eliminated to now feed 4000 tpa.

1. Introduction
Exxaro Grootegeluk coal mine is the only supplier power station coal to Eskom’s Matimba and Medupi power 
stations in Lephalale area of the Limpopo province in South Africa. Exxaro Grootegeluk also supply metallurgical 
coal to local smelters and export first grade coal. Grootegeluk coal being the biggest Exxaro’s coal mine and is 
having the biggest coal beneficiation plant in Africa. The mine extracts its coal from the open pit which is around 
their plant in Lephalale area. The coal is graded accordingly, crushed, screened, and washed before being supplied 
to different customers. 
Due to high demand of power station coal in the country, decision was made to tap coal from Medupi power 
station conveyor line to load trains to be sold to either other power station or export purposes. Grootegeluk 
operation currently only has one silo to load trains but for metallurgical and export coal which are not that different 
in grade. Investigation was made on the cheaper and less down time method to tap coal from Medupi conveyor to 
the export silo so it can be transported by train. The point that had both advantages was at the intersection where 
Medupi conveyor (4000 tons per hour) passes above silo feed conveyor (2000 tons per hour). 
Medupi provides power to many South Africans and cannot stop production as South African power grid is always 
under pressure to supply both South Africa and local countries, it is not possible to shut down the supply for more 
than 12 hours at any given time. Other methods to tap from the top conveyor to bottom have been considered 
including to install a suffocating/flip chute. This was going to require major structural and setup changes that can 
take more than a week or months with delays. Tilting plough was then seen as a quick way in within he available 
12 hours a week shut.

6. Results and Discussion 
The use of Tilting Device and Plough Scraper worked very well for the intended purpose. The design tool less 
time to develop, fabricate and install on site. The cost of the system was also very less compared to the normal 
traditional transfer tower set ups used in many set ups. This operation is nicely shown in Figure 1,2 and 3 during 
operation. 
 
7. Conclusion  
The operation of the Plough Scraper and Tilting Device on the Conveyor is very simple and straight forward. 
Once the system starts no other activities are expected except monitoring. Once the system stops no activities are 
required except inspection to ensure all is in good order. No additional employees were added with this system. 
The operation is the simplest with only 4 buttons being Plough Scrapper up and down and Tilting Device up and 
down. Everything else is automated and interlocked to kick in when required.

In Indonesia, there are some interesting data when referring to the We Are Social (2021) report. YouTube is the most 
widely used social media platform by the public, amounting to 93.8% of the total 170 million social media users. The

needs of the audience in Indonesia, so it is not surprising that their channel occupies the top position. In addition, 
dominant capital ownership is not the main factor in determining position in the YouTube contest arena. Access to 
capital can be obtained through the manifestation of habitus owned by each player. The ability to utilize the fruits of 
this habitus ultimately brings players who previously did not have the power of capital, into a position that deserves 
to be reckoned with. 
6. Conclusion
YouTube is similar to a playground. The actors/players, like in a game, try to use various strategies and resources to 
win. The competition among some of Indonesia's top ten YouTubers demonstrates their ability to utilize and maximize 
capital to create interesting content for their followers. In addition to capital ownership, they have their own personality 
and characteristics, which are undoubtedly influenced by the habits and background of the environment in which they 
live. This competition should be viewed positively because the content on their YouTube channel is unique.

Abstract 
West Manggarai Regency is a regency in the province of East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia. Having a beautiful and 
abundant natural wealth makes West Manggarai Regency focus on developing tourism potential as a leading sector 
for regional income.  Unfortunately, this development was not balanced with publications on the Manggarai Regency 
Government website. In fact, the West Manggarai Regency government is currently also intensively pursuing digitally 
literate people. However, in fact, the government website has not accommodated the need for an up-to-date 
information and quick to respond to comments or suggestions from the public. From the observation results, it appears 
that the government website is not updated, error pages and pages that are still not filled. This paper aims to explain 
how the use of government websites as digital communication media to promote tourism. The approach used in this 
paper is qualitative with a descriptive type, while the content analysis method is used to help analyze the content of 
information presented on the Maggarai Regency government website. The results show that the website has not been 
managed properly, the response to the audience's questions on the website is also not responded well, the role of the 
government as a provider of public information on the website is not well implemented.

Abstract 
This paper aims to examine whether social media marketing activities plays an important role upon creating purchase 
decision, and the effects if mediated by brand awareness and willingness to buy. In addition, if Income and educational 
level can amplify the effects towards purchase decision. Causal relationships between hypothesized variables are 
related to each other so as to form a structural equation model (SEM) with one exogenous variable, three endogenous 
variables, and two moderating variables. Convenient sampling method was used to obtain 200 samples of ordinal data 
derived from respondents' assessments of 27 survey items with a scale of five. Respondents from this study were 
Taeyang Culture students whose entry was allegedly due to the influence of social media marketing activities. The 
decision of prospective students to join Taeyang Culture is strongly influenced by the dimensions of SMMAs which 
include interactivity, informativeness, personalization, and trendiness. This effect is more effective, especially if the 
SMMA is more directed at prospective students who are highly educated and have high incomes. This research refines 
previous research that has not considered environmental aspects in the model, namely income level and education 
level which strengthen the desire of prospective students to decide to join Taeyang Culture.

1. Introduction
Taeyang Culture is an educational company based in Bandung, Indonesia. The product they serve is language course 
with many programs for four languages, namely: English, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, with over 3000 students from 
Indonesia and abroad. Taeyang Culture uses social media marketing activities since the first time it was established in 
2016, it was used to spread awareness about the importance of having the ability to speak bilingually and cultures of 
other countries, mainly countries that they teach.  
There were several periods of time that social media marketing helps them finding new students, but there are two out 
of six months that social media does not help creating purchase decision, and thus further research was needed. The

The model has been developed into 13 hypotheses have been tested empirically using a one-tailed test, at a significance 
level of 95% (p value < 0.05), and with a total of 200 data. The model is built with six direct relationships, five indirect 
relationships (via mediating variables), and two moderating relationships. Test the hypothesis of the direct effect of 
the six pairs of causal relationships (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6) were all significant because they had p-values less than 
0.05. Social Media Marketing Activities have a positive effect on the significance level (p-value) of <0.001, with an 
influence strength of 0.238. The influence is direct influence (without mediation). The indirect effect of SMMA on 
Purchase Decision as illustrated by the paths SMMA → WB → PD (H8), SMMA → BA → PD (H9), and SMMA → 
BA → WB → PD (H11) are all significant with successive coefficients of influence of 0.427 (p<0.001), 0.168 
(p<0.001), and 0.269 (p<0.001). The direct effect of SMMA on PD is 0.238 (p<0.001) while the total effect is 0.568 
(p<0.001), so the difference of 0.330 indicates an indirect effect or in other words, the value indicates the role of BA 
and WB variables in mediating the influence of SMMA on PD. WB has a positive and significant effect on PD with 
an influence coefficient of 0.894 (p <0.001). The effect of WB on PD was moderated significantly by education level 
(EDU) and income level (INC) with moderating power of 0.250 (p<0.001) and 0.142 (p=0.013). (Table 2) 
 
6. Conclusion  
The effect of social media marketing activities (SMMA) on purchase decision (PD) is explained by the significance 
of direct influence, indirect effect, and total effect. The direct effect is the effect without a mediating variable, while 
the indirect effect is the effect through the mediating variables, namely brand awareness (BA) and willingness to buy 
(WB). The total effect is the sum of the direct and indirect effects. In the end, the magnitude of the total influence is 
also corroborated by education level (EDU) and income level (INC) which moderate the influence of WB on PD. 
 
All question items belonging to each indicator are valid and reliable, as well as the research model that has been built, 
has met the goodness of fit requirements. Marketing activities using social media have been proven to be able to 
encourage prospective participants to decide to join the training program, but the encouragement will become even 
stronger because these activities increase one's awareness of Taeyang Culture (BA) and willingness to participate in 
the training program (WB). The more effective the SMMA activities, the higher the BA and WB, and the higher the 
BA and WB in the end the higher the PD. Meanwhile, the rise and fall of BA in addition to affecting WB and PD in 
the same direction so that because WB also has a positive effect on PD, finally BA has a greater total effect on PD. In 
other words, it can be concluded that BA and WB as mediating variables have contributed to increasing the influence 
of SMMA on PD. The income level (INC) and education level (EDU) of the parents of students strengthen a 
prospective student who is willing to participate in deciding to take part in the Taeyang Culture (PD) training program. 
 
For academics, this research contributes an alternative model of increasing purchase decision originating from 
marketing activities through corporate social media by including BA and WB multi mediation variables, and multi 
moderating variables INC and EDU. As for business practitioners, this research provides recommendations on how to 
encourage Taeyang Culture’s target market to decide to join the program by making the company's social media 
platforms more effective.dd conclusion here. Make sure to address that all objectives are met and emphasize of unique 
research contribution (10 font)

Abstract 
Electric mobility represents a paradigm shift toward a more energy-efficient, low-carbon, and environmentally 
friendly mode of transport. Choosing the optimal locations for Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations is critical for 
EV adoption. Since EVs emit fewer greenhouse gases than internal combustion engines, their adoption is considered 
to be more environmentally friendly. Numerous factors affect the location-allocation problem for EV public charging 
stations, including understanding demand, assessing needs, identifying possible locations, and selecting an 
optimization model for facility location. This study conducts a literature review on the optimization of electric vehicle 
charging stations. Conclusions and recommendations for future research were extracted and documented.  
Keywords 
 Electric Vehicle, Location Optimization, Charging Stations, Transportation. 
1. Introduction
Over the last decade, climate change and its continued growth have been among the most investigated and debated 
issues (Kucukvar et al., 2021).  Governments have responded by enacting a variety of policies and regulations aimed 
at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, gasoline-powered automobiles were the second largest source of 
greenhouse gases, trailing only factories and power plants (Shehab et al., 2021).  Thus, when powered by natural gas 
or renewable energy, electric vehicles (EVs) are a viable alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles because 
they emit less pollution and consume less energy (Al-Buenain et al., 2021).  Around 2010, several countries saw a 
surge in electric vehicle adoption. However, market penetration of EVs varies by country due to a variety of factors 
including government policies, incentives, and other socioeconomic factors. Countries, notably China, the United 
States of America, and Europe, are implementing strategies to promote electric vehicles. As a result, global EV sales 
exceeded 3 million vehicles in 2017 and are expected to continue growing; Norway has the highest percentage of 
electric vehicles on the road, and more than 400,000 charging stations were available globally in 2017. (Nicholas & 
Hall, 2018).  These markets are not yet mature, and additional development of policies, battery and charging 
technologies, and charging infrastructure is required. Other EV markets, particularly in the Middle East (Qatar), are 
in their infancy, necessitating the planning of public charging infrastructure. Qatar is considered one of the most 
polluting countries due to its small population and extensive industrial activity (when measured per capita).  Qatar's 
government is aware of pollution's dangers and has launched several new environmental initiatives. Qatar will host 
the FIFA World Cup 2022 in November 2022, and to demonstrate its environmental sensitivity, Qatar has committed 
to hosting the world's first carbon-neutral World Cup (Kucukvar et al., 2021; Spanos et al., 2021). 
Home charging ownership is a significant factor in determining the design and location of charging stations. In 
countries (regions) with a low rate of home charging ownership, it is critical to deploy public chargers to encourage 
use, as this will become a necessity and the primary mode of charging. Whereas providing public chargers provides

Abstract 
Emily in Paris is a series by Darren Star which is set in Paris, France. This series tells about American women who 
have to work in France, where cultural differences between America and France become the main conflict in this 
series. This study aims to determine the representation of intercultural communication described in the series Emily 
in Paris Season 1 by using descriptive-qualitative research methods. The analysis technique used is semiotic analysis 
from Roland Barthes by looking for the meaning of denotation, connotation, and myth. The results of this study 
indicate that intercultural communication that occurs in it is displayed through several elements such as intonation, 
clothing, work culture, different perspectives, and language. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Film is a powerful mass communication medium, not only for entertainment but also for lighting and education. Film 
is used to convey a message and help to give an explanation to the community. Enjoying the story in the movie is 
more interesting than reading a book or novel. Films can support the public to process entertainment, education, and 
information seen. This is because the values in the film are packaged in such a way that it is easy to understand by the 
audience. Films have values to influence the audience cognitively, affectively, and conatively depending on the 
messages that the filmmaker wants to convey (Diani, Lestari & Maulana, 2017). 
Speaking of movies, Emily in Paris is not just a series that presents a story of love, work, or friendship in it. However, 
it also shows how Emily as an American had to adapt to a french culture which is portrayed quite differently in the 
series. Starting from the stage of culture shock experienced by Emily because of the obvious differences between 
America and France to how she managed to achieve the acculturation process presented in this series. The series also 
shows how to communicate between people with differences in language and culture. The series, which is presented 
in 10 episodes, also depicts a portrait of a different culture or custom between Emily as an American and her co-
workers who are native French.  
Keep in mind that the increasingly advanced times influenced the emergence of the era of information, technology, 
and transportation development as it is now. The easier it is for us to receive and send information, not only

Figure 2 Scenes depicting enculturation. 
The scene shows signs of enculturation carried out by Emily, which is when she is taking a French class to learn and 
understand their language. The enculturation process can be done in various ways, one of which is by taking a learning 
class as Emily did. Not only that, but the scene continues with Emily's attempt to ask her teacher about the best way 
to be accepted into a work environment filled with French, while she is American. In addition to taking French classes, 
the presence of Mindy and Camilla as Emily's friends provides many new experiences regarding the diverse cultures 
in France. 
After going through the phases of culture shock and acculturation, generally, a person will begin to get used to his 
new environment and blend in with it. In this phase, a person has experienced acupuncture, that is, the progressive 
adaptation of individuals, organizations, or classes of culture to elements of a foreign culture. According to Syarbani 
and Rusdiyanta, acculturation is a social process that arises when an individual or certain culture is dealing with 
elements of a foreign culture, where gradually the foreign culture begins to be accepted and processed in one's own 
culture without resulting in the loss of one's own culture (Riadi, 2020). (Figure 3) 
Figure 3 Scenes depicting saturation 
The results of the study on the cut of scene that has been analyzed previously shows that Emily looks doubtful and 
surprised when she receives la bise or welcome by giving a kiss on the left-right cheek that her co-worker did. 
However, in episode 7 depicted in the scene above, Emily unhesitatingly performs la bise with a man. In the series, it 
is shown that Emily only does la bise with the French people. This shows that Emily has successfully adapted and 
blended into French culture, one of which is la bise, but until the end of the episode, Emily did not take away her close 
personality to the American style. 
Those are some data and analysis results that prove how intercultural communication in Emily in Paris season 1 is 
represented in each episode. The series is quite representative of the difference in point of view between Emily and 
the French people she works with. However, the characters in this series have also shown how to respond to the new 
culture that enters their culture. 
6. Conclusion
In the series Emily in Paris - Season 1 there is a representation of intercultural communication depicted by the 
emergence of various elements of intercultural communication between the main character and the supporters, namely 
Emily as an American citizen and her friends or co-workers as French citizens. Some of the elements of intercultural 
communication seen in the Emily in Paris series are as follows: 
4582","Proceedings of the 3rd Asia Pacific International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, September 13-15, 2022

1. Clothing: While at work, French citizens may wear clothes that are semi-formal, simple but elegant, and show their 
smart side. On the other hand, Emily as a representation of American citizens comes to the office in clothes that look
fashionable.
2. Language: Emily's limitations in understanding French became the main problem that led to many
misunderstandings in the process of intercultural communication between Emily and her colleagues.
3. Intonation: The habit of Americans who want to show a sense of enthusiasm at work tends to be applied by using
higher intonation. Meanwhile, in this series, it is depicted that the French way of speaking tends to be more relaxed
and slower.
4. Work culture: The series chooses an office environment as its main setting, therefore the differences in work
culture between America and France are pretty much depicted in the series.
5. Perspective differences: Differences in cultural backgrounds between America and France greatly influence the
mindset and perspective of each character in this series, causing misunderstandings.
In addition to the elements of intercultural communication shown in clothing, language, intonation, work culture, and
differences in perspectives. In this study, it was also found that there were important phases in the process of
intercultural communication, a sense of alienity to French culture that Emily experienced (culture shock), her efforts 
to blend in by studying French culture (anculturation), and how she finally could accept the French cultures 
(acculturation).

Abstract 
Sexual harassment is often regarded as taboo because it is a disgrace that must be covered. The existence 
of patriarchal cultural practices that have been implemented for a long time has made marginalized 
groups become silenced. Entering the development of science and technology that continues to advance, 
many social figures, institutions, and organizations have begun to fight for women’s rights to live more 
comfortably through films. Researchers analyzed verbal harassment and gender discrimination in the 
world of work, using the object of a short film entitled Please Be Quiet. Researchers use group theory, 
mass communication and communication, film as a mass medium, and gender discrimination. 
Researchers used Roland Barthes’ semiotic analysis method with a descriptive qualitative approach and 
a case study research design. This study aims to understand the meaning of denotation, connotation, the 
myth of the silent mouth, and the forms of verbal abuse in the film.

1. Introduction
The phenomenon of gender discrimination is still a problem that often occurs in various communities, 
one of which occurs in the work environment. Often this act of gender discrimination occurs in women 
because there are still many people who apply the principles of patriarchy, namely believing that men 
have a higher degree or position and will continue to have that power in leadership, ownership, morals, 
and social rights (Griffin, 2012). Based on data from the annual records released by Komnas Perempuan 
on March 8, 2022, there were a total of 338,496 cases of sexual violence. Meanwhile, according to 
report data from women’s and children’s service institutions, 108 sexual cases occurred in the work 
environment in the public or community sphere, which was higher than the report of sexual violence in 
2020. In the workplace, generally, men have a more favorable position. Higher education is not only 
limited to work but also has power in other areas because society is like that. 
Nevertheless, as time passes and technology continues to develop, many movements aim to help victims 
get justice. Many social figures, institutions, and organizations have started to take various ways to fight 
for women’s rights so that they can carry out their activities safely. One media used in delivering 
messages, especially the campaign to eliminate gender-based violence, is film. The film is one form of 
mass media that is well known by the public. Not only getting entertainment after doing activities or 
filling spare time, but films can contain various educative, informative, and persuasive functions

something, where the perpetrator of sexual harassment offers something to the victim but must be 
returned with something in return. Komnas Perempuan recorded cases of sexual harassment in the work 
environment as many as 108 cases in 2022. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the research results of Verbal Harassment and Gender Discrimination in the World of Work 
(Analysis of Semiotics in the Short Film Please Be Quiet), using Roland Barthes’ semiotic model and 
interpreting the scene based on denotation, connotation, and myth, the following results are obtained: 
1.
The meaning of denotation, connotation, and the myth of the silent mouth sign in the short film
Please Be Quiet is the situation of Sarah and Putri as victims of sexual harassment by Mr.
Benny at work. Mr. Benny is a dominant group who holds the principle of patriarchy in his
life, and he believes that the position of men is always above women from all sides, such as
social position and position in the workplace. The silent mouth describes the condition of the
victims who belong to the marginal group and do not get the opportunity to express their
opinions as freely as how men express themselves. The dominant group has several methods
of silencing marginal groups, including ridicule based on rituals or culture, controlling to
committing violence or sexual harassment. The silence carried out by Mr. Benny is to control
and carry out sexual harassment.
2.
The form of verbal harassment shown in the short film Please Be Quiet is Quid Pro Quo
harassment or something for something, where the harasser offers something to the victim and
then asks the victim to give something in return which leads to sexual harassment.

Abstract 
This paper presents an experimental study to determine the effects of pH level, temperature of the tank, and 
temperature of the grow bed on the length of the Nile Tilapia and plant height of the Romaine Lettuce using the 
automated aquaponics system and to recommend optimal combination of identified factors to maximize their growth. 
A 23 Factorial Design with two replicates for sixteen runs was used to perform the experiment and the results were 
processed using the Minitab software.  Measurement on the length of both the Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce was 
done once a week.  The experiment lasted for 112 days.  The results indicated that the pH level, temperature in the 
fish tank, and temperature in the grow bed have great impact on both the growth in length of the Nile tilapia and 
Romaine lettuce.  It was also found out that the two-way interaction between the temperature in fish tank and 
temperature in grow bed significantly impact the growth of Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce, respectively.  Using 
Tukey’s test, it was also found out that the higher-level values of the pH level, temperature in fish tank, and 
temperature in grow bed showed significance when compared to other levels for a one factor, two-way interaction, 
and three-way interaction.  Moreover, the optimal values of the pH level, temperature in fish tank, and temperature in 
grow bed for both the Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce were (7.0 pH, 30°C, 27°C), (7.0 pH, 27°C, 27°C), and (7.0 pH, 
30°C, 24°C).

1. Introduction
Aquaponics is a sustainable technology that integrates the food production system by combining fish and hydroponic 
vegetable crops (Yep and Zheng, 2019).  Generally, there are two types of setups used in the modern commercial 
aquaponics systems. These are the coupled aquaponic systems, consisting of one continuous system loop where the 
water has only one direction or outlet in each tank, and the decoupled aquaponic systems where it utilizes sub-loops 
within the system in which water can travel in more than one direction in some tanks (Masabni and Niu, 2021; 
Forchino et al, 2017).  The setup of the aquaponic systems comprises mostly of the deep-water culture or floating raft 
technique, the media filled grow beds, or the nutrient film technique (Masabni and Niu, 2021; Goddek et al, 2016; 
Maucieri et al, 2018). Mauciere et al (2018) reviewed on hydroponics systems in aquaponic publications found that 
43% used the media-based systems, 33% used deep well culture, 15% used the nutrient film technique, and 9% used 
other less common hydroponic systems.   
One key challenge of the aquaponic systems is finding the appropriate fish-plant combinations adapted to local 
conditions without compromising yield (Knaus and Palm, 2017; Suhl et al., 2016).  According to Love et al. (2014), 
69% used Oreochromis niloticus (tilapia), 43% used ornamental fish and 25% used Siluriformes (catfish) in their 
commercial operations. On the other hand, in the study of Villaroel et al (2016) on the plant species used in aquaponics

Any of the three combinations of pH level, temperature in fish tank, and temperature in grow bed result to an optimal 
growth of Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce. 
5.4 Validation 
Table 12 shows the validation of using the original data of the three-factor combinations of the length of 
Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce compared with the optimal data.

The validation as shown in Table 12 indicated that using the optimal values of the three-way interactions 
between the pH level, temperature in fish tank, and temperature in grow bed proved to provide significant 
increase in the length of Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce with p-value of 0.002 and 0.007, respectively. 
6. Conclusion
The results of the experiment using the 23 Factorial Design showed that the pH level, temperature in fish tank, and 
temperature in grow bed significantly affect the growth of the Nile tilapia and Romain lettuce during the one-week 
duration of the experiment per treatment combinations.  Furthermore, there are also two-way interactions and three-
ways interactions of the factors that showed significant results.  Moreover, the data of the experiment were subjected 
to a normality test using the standardized residuals indicating to be less than ±3 sigma which means that the data are 
normally distributed.   
After determining significant factors from the ANOVA results for both the Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce, the 
Tukey’s test was employed to determine which among the levels of the factors showed significance.  As found out 
from the Tukey’s test the higher-level values were significant for the linear factors of the pH level, temperature in the 
fish tank, and temperature in grow bed.  These are the 7.0 pH, 30°C temperature in fish tank, and 27°C temperature 
in grow bed   The higher-value levels were also manifested in the two-way interaction of factors, and three-way 
interaction of factors.  
Lastly, three three-way interactions of factors were found to be optimal values for both the Nile tilapia and the Romaine 
lettuce.  Any of this combination of values of the three factors can be used in the actual implementation of growing 
Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce using the automated aquaponics system.  The optimal values of the pH level, 
temperature in fish tank, and temperature in grow bed were also determined.  Three treatment combinations were 
identified as the optimal values of the pH level, temperature in tank, and temperature in grow bed that will give optimal 
growth in length of the Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce, namely, the (7.0 pH, 30°C, 27°C), (7.0 pH, 27°C, 27°C), and 
(7.0 pH, 30°C, 24°C).

Abstract 
During the Covid-19 pandemic, the travel industry was one of the most significantly impacted and the office operation 
mostly using an internet for their offices activity purpose. Therefore, it creates opportunities for employees to use the 
internet not for office purposes but for their needs. This kind of activity is called as cyberloafing behavior. In the other 
hand, In Indonesia, many company have made rules regarding the prohibition of cyberloafing. Cyberloafing behavior 
often trigged by sense of officer needs like organizational justice, abusive behavior from manager, and self-control of 
the employees. This study is to analyze the impact of organizational justice, abusive supervisor, and self-control on 
cyberloafing behavior with work stress as a mediation variable. This study is descriptive research with quantitative 
method. The sampling technique uses a non-probability sampling with convenience sampling method by distributing 
questionnaires to 198 employees in travel companies in South Jakarta. Data were analyzed by using Structure Equation 
Modeling based on Partial Least Square at 95% confidence level. Work stress found as a mediator between 
organizational justice, abusive supervisor, self-control and cyberloafing behavior, but does not mediate relation 
between organizational justice, abusive supervisor, and self-control. Therefore, organizational justice has a significant 
influence on cyberloafing behavior.

1. Introduction
In the last decade, the development of the internet which is supported by the advancement of technology is developing 
very fast. This makes an opportunity for every company to use and develop technology from the internet to support 
office activities. Unfortunately, this also creates opportunities for employees to use the internet for non-office purposes. 
Employees can ignore office activities and do other activities with office internet facilities, for example they can use 
the office internet to open social media such as Instagram, play video games, watch movies, and listen to music. This 
counter-productive activity is called cyberloafing. Cyberloafing is an employee activity that utilizes the company's 
internet facilities during working hours for non-productive purposes (Lim, 2020).  
During the pandemic, internet usage increased by 19.3% with an average digital access of 11.6 hours per day. 
Reporting from www.republika.co.id (2021), productivity during work will decrease by an average of 25.83% to 36.5% 
caused by cyberloafing. Cyberloafing provides benefits for the perpetrators, namely it can reduce work stress and 
fatigue at work (www.republika.com). Some of the good advantages of cyberloafing behavior such as relieving 
boredom, stress, or fatigue, increasing job satisfaction, employee happiness. On the other hand, cyberloafing has a 
negative impact on employee productivity. Based on the news www.detik.com (2021) it was reported that recently 
one of the staff of the shinkansen (Japanese bullet train) received warnings and criticism by Japanese supervisor and

3.
The effect of self-control on cyberloafing behavior has a P value of 0.313 or more than 0.05 and T-Statistics
1.010 or less than 1.96. It can be said that self-control has a negative and not significant effect on cyberloafing.
4.
The effect of work stress on cyberloafing behavior has a P value of 0.601 or more than 0.05 and T-Statistics
1.601 or less than 1.96. It can be said that work stress has negative and not significant effect on cyberloafing.
5.
The effect of organizational justice on cyberloafing through work stress has a P value of 0.762 or more than
0.05 and T-Statistics of 0.303. It can be said that work stress can’t help to significantly mediate the effect of
organizational justice on cyberloafing.
6.
The effect of abusive supervisor on cyberloafing through work stress has a P value of 0.426 or more than
0.05 and T-Statistics of 0.796. It can be said that work stress can’t help to significantly mediate the effect of
abusive supervisor on cyberloafing.
7.
The effect of self-control on cyberloafing through work stress has a P value of 0.407 or more than 0.05 and
T-Statistics of 0.829. It can be said that work stress can’t help to significantly mediate the effect of self-
control on cyberloafing.
6. Conclusion
The research showed that organizational justice affects cyberloafing behavior. This is based on the results of the 
hypothesis test where an organizational justice has significant effect on cyberloafing behavior. It means, when 
employees feel they have been treated fairly in the office, the higher the chances of them to do cyberloafing. This 
indicates that during the Covid 19 pandemic, travel company employees in South Jakarta on average get good 
treatment while working in the office. The high use of electronic devices and the internet during the pandemic has 
made employees working in travel companies able to take advantage of office facilities to cyberloaf at the office when 
they feel bored or tired due to limited application requests to travel abroad. This is considered fair for travel company 
employees because they still must work when there is little request for their services during the pandemic. On the 
other hand, the results of hypothesis test showed that abusive supervisor, self-control, and work stress have not 
significant effect on cyberloafing behavior. This is because while working during a pandemic, travel company 
employees when they get abusive treatment by supervisors, they choose to work seriously rather than cyberloaf. Work 
stress cannot mediate the three variables. This is because there are few applicants who use their services, and their 
workload becomes more less so that’s why travel company employees feel less stressed about their work. this research 
was applied to a travel company in South Jakarta during the covid 19 pandemic so that if this research was applied in 
different places and conditions, it might get different results.

Abstract 
The logistic sector which is engaged in services business relies heavily on its human resources to compete with their 
competitors. This requires employees who are high performing, disciplined, and have a good work skill. To compete 
in business world, company must pay attention to their employee’s development. After recruit and develop a high-
performance employee, the company must also pay attention to the work environment and consider bonus for 
remuneration to increase their loyalty and satisfaction. This study is to analyze the impact of employee training, work 
environment, incentives, and work disciplines on employee’s job performance during Covid 19 pandemic through job 
satisfaction as a mediating role. This study is descriptive research with quantitative method. The sampling technique 
uses non-probability sampling with purposive sampling method by distributing questionnaires to 187 employees in 
logistic companies in West Jakarta. The data were analyzed by using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach 
based on Partial Least Square (PLS) at 95% confidence level. The result is incentives variable has positive and 
significant influence on job performance and job satisfaction, meanwhile other variables don’t have any significant 
influence. Therefore, incentives found to be an effective way to improve employee’s job satisfaction and job 
performances on logistic companies in Jakarta.

1. Introduction
Needs are something that must be met in every human life. To fulfill their needs such as food, clothes, household 
appliances, etc, people must buy them. In this Covid 19 era, shopping has become easier because people don't have to 
visit the store in person and can do it online. Online shopping also can limit people's mobility and help to prevent the 
spread of the COVID-19 virus.  Online shopping also not only makes it easier for people in fulfilling their needs, but 
also saves a lot of time and money compared to traditional shopping (Mujiyana and Elissa, I. 2013).  
Online shopping is also become a trend nowadays because people can compare some alternatives in marketplace and 
other platform and choose the best buy product for their needs. shopping online is very easy because customers only

6. Discussion 
Based on the data results above, we have found that only hypothesis 3 and 8 that are accepted. This study’s results 
showed that incentives have a positive and significant impact on job performance and job satisfaction. It means, the 
higher the incentives, the better the performance, and employees become more satisfied. These findings are in 
accordance with the research conducted by Angriani and Eliyana (2020) which stated that compensation is given to 
motivate the employee and improve their work performance. These findings are also in accordance with the research 
conducted by Liu and Liu (2021), which stated that the higher the incentives, the better employee’s job performance 
is. It is because incentives found to be a compensation for employee’s performance other than salary. This research 
also found that work environment and work disciplines have a positive but not significant impact on job performance 
and job satisfaction. It means, they have the impact, but not significant. So does the employee training. It has a negative 
and not significant impact on job performance but has a positive but not significant impact on job satisfaction. It means, 
employees in logistic companies, especially express delivery services in West Jakarta are not influenced with or 
without employee training. This research found that in this pandemic time, people are more satisfied with what they 
could earn in the form of cash to fulfill their needs. In this hard times, training, satisfaction, environment, and rules 
are not that important to them anymore. If they could still work, they will work hard to get the incentives as their 
additional income, thus, the result showed that only incentives that have impact on job performance, and job 
satisfaction cannot act as the mediator as it could in other previous research done in normal times. Moreover, most of 
the source person is the operational employee (sprinter or courier) which only paid by the people’s minimum wage, 
so that incentives do have the biggest impact for them to fulfill their needs. 
 
7. Conclusion 
This research found that employee training has negative and not significant effect on job performance. Employee 
training, however, has positive but not significant effect on job satisfaction. Work environment has positive but not 
significant effect on job satisfaction and job performance. Incentives has a positive and significant impact on job 
performance and job satisfaction. Work disciplines have a positive but not significant impact on job performance and 
job satisfaction. This study also found that job satisfaction does not act as a mediator between the independent 
variables and dependent variable. This research found that in this Covid 19 pandemic time, incentives affect job 
satisfaction and performance due to persistent inflation and the need for jobs that is very high, so employees are only 
focused on how to earn more income and be able to meet their needs in these difficult times. Though, this study also 
has some gaps and suggests the next researchers to study these variables impact on other companies, which has more 
back-office employee than the operational ones to emphasize the effect on these variables.

Abstract 
This research aims to investigate how capital structure of banks relates to levels of profitability, taking into account 
firm size and effect of Covid-19 pandemic. We present the analysis within the context of Indonesia whereby banking 
regulations are different to other countries. Extant literature studies the association of leverage, firm size and 
profitability during normal economic conditions, or influence of Covid-19 pandemic on profitability independently. 
This research examines all the antecedents altogether. We examine whether increased capital (debt) provided by the 
Indonesian government affects banks profitability, giving novel consideration to the heightened credit risks emanated 
by the pandemic. Fixed effect regression is employed to study the effect of leverage, firm size, and Covid-19 pandemic 
on banks profitability. We find that leverage positively affects banks profitability, while firm size negatively affects 
leverage and profitability. High debt levels pressures management to meet the required return of shareholders. Larger 
banks prefer zero-risk government bonds over lending creditors primarily during economic uncertainties. Covid-19 
pandemic has no effect on banks profitability. We expect that banks in Indonesia administer risk-averse investments, 
ensuring sustainability in the long run.

1. Introduction
The capital structure of a company refers to the combination of debt and equity to fund its operation. A firm finances 
growth through issuance of stocks, debt instruments or internally generated from reinvestment of profits (Chen, 2021). 
Financial structure determines the risks borne by investors, firm profitability as well as the fulfilment of shareholders' 
needs (Chang et al, 2019; Flannery and Rangan, 2006). The trade-off theory, pecking order theory and market timing 
theory explaining capital structure originate from Modigliani and Miller proposition (1958) that in perfect capital 
markets where taxes, transaction costs and information asymmetry are absent, financing strategies do not affect firm 
value. Notwithstanding, the theorem does not hold in the real world as tax advantage of debt increases firm value 
(Chang et al., 2019; Sheikh and Wang, 2013). In this setting, a firm should maximize their debt proportion for 
deductibility of interest.  
Studies on the field of capital structure and financial performance are diverse, using proxies of equity or debt and have 
been done in many countries (Abor, 2005; Badawy, 2020; Sheikh and Wang, 2013; Shubita and Alshawalha, 2012; 
O’Conell, 2022). The scope of these researches extends from an investigation of banks profitability at bank-specific, 
industry-specific to macroeconomic level. O'Connell (2022) demonstrated that banks’ profitability is associated with 
equity-to-asset ratio, interest rates and inflation. Venanzi (2017) documented that capital structure choice is 
inconsistent across countries due to the diverging macroeconomic characteristics. Chang et al. (2019) similarly find 
that the association of financial performance such as asset growth on profitability is different in Asian countries. For 
this reason, the authors limit the scope of the study to financial institutions in Indonesia, whereby the economic and 
political environment is dissimilar to other emerging markets.

1. Introduction
The massive increase in the development of internet technology has been able to change human life to be more 
advanced. It has also changed people's habits, which is in shopping. The easiness and convenience of obtaining 
products and services makes more people move from conventional shopping to online shopping. Based on a survey 
by We Are Social in April 2021, it was reported that as many as 88.1% of internet users in Indonesia used e-commerce 
to buy certain products in recent months. This figure has exceeded the average percentage of e-commerce globally, 
which is 78.6%. With this achievement, Indonesia is the country with the highest use of e-commerce in the world. On 
the other hand, the Covid-19 pandemic has also succeeded in accelerating the growth of e-commerce in Indonesia. 
Based on a SIRCLO report and Katadata Insight Center, the Covid-19 pandemic made 17.5% of offline buyers start 
trying to shop online. 
Suryani, Nurhadi and Fauzi (2020) stated that changes in consumer behavior in shopping need to be considered by 
businesspeople to adjust the right marketing strategy by adjusting changes in customer behavior. Along with the 
increasing number of internet users and the enthusiasm of Indonesian people for online shopping, they have finally 
started exploring electronic-based marketing or e-marketing. One of the e-marketing strategies that often do every 
year now is National Online Shopping Day or better known as National Online Shopping Day. National Online 
Shopping Day is the biggest online shopping day in Indonesia, which is held every December 12. The aim is to 
encourage and educate Indonesian people about the easiness of online shopping and as an effort to advance e-
commerce industries in Indonesia. Due to the extraordinary achievements when it was first held, now National Online 
Shopping Day has become a routine event held every year by many e-commerce companies in Indonesia.

factors that influenced generation Z online shopping decisions in Bandung during National Online Shopping Day. The 
first factor consists of product quality, trust, e-commerce credibility, product appearance, and website/mobile interface 
quality, named the trust factor with a component value of 31.56%, so that the trust factor becomes the first dominant 
factor. The second factor consists of time variables, payment methods, shopping habits, and product choice/diversity,

the components of each factor, it can be concluded that there are four dominant factors that influence generation Z 
online shopping decisions in Bandung during National Online Shopping Day, namely trust factors, shopping habits 
factors, information quality factors, and price factors. The most dominant factor influencing the online shopping 
decisions of Generation Z consumers in Bandung during National Online Shopping Day is the trust factor, with a

Abstract 
The Covid-19 pandemic has completely changed the state of the world. All sectors were disrupted including the stock 
market. Stock Return are predicted to have an effect due to the addition of Covid-19 cases and the effect of volatility. 
Indonesia is one of the countries that has a high number of Covid-19 cases. As a result, the capital market sector was 
affected. One of them is the automotive sector. Using a sample of 15 automotive stocks listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange, this study uses the Multiple Linear Regression analysis method to process some research data 6 months 
before and after the first case of Covid-19 appeared in Indonesia. The results showed that automotive stock returns in 
Indonesia were negatively affected due to the addition of Covid-19 cases. Meanwhile, on the other hand, in terms of 
Stock Price Volatility, it shows that the volatility of automotive stocks in Indonesia has a positive effect on stock 
returns during the Covid-19 pandemic.

1. Introduction
The year 2020 will be a year that will be remembered by all the people of the world. Starting in early 2020, the virus 
that eventually became the Covid-19 Pandemic claimed many lives. Until now hundreds of millions of people around 
the world have been infected. Millions of people died. Not only fatalities, the Covid-19 pandemic has also devastated 
the world's economy. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on global economic conditions. 
The Covid-19 pandemic has also affected the dynamics of global capital markets. Large stock markets, for example 
in Hong Kong (Hangseng), London (FTSE100) and News York (NASDAQ) tend to be negative. Okorie and Lin 
(2021) found that the financial crisis occurred during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Akhtaruzzaman et al. (2021) also 
highlight that financial companies are more negatively affected than non-financial companies. However, Caner 
Ozdurak et al (2020) in their research stated that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies tend to have a positive 
impact on the Covid-19 pandemic. 
According to CNBC Indonesia (2020), most companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) experienced a 
decline in stock prices, one of which is a company engaged in manufacturing. Companies with the manufacturing 
sector in 2019 have experienced a decline, especially stocks in the automotive and component sub-sectors have also 
experienced a decline in stock prices since the beginning of 2020. The Indonesia Stock Exchange explained that the 
automotive and components manufacturing sub-sector companies have decreased by 7.03 % since the beginning of 
2020 in line with the decline in the manufacturing industry, due to a decline in demand for automotive. The same 
thing was expressed by automotive business players with reference to data from the Indonesian Automotive Industry 
Association (Gaikindo), from the beginning of the year until March 2020, domestic car sales were recorded at 236,825 
units, down 7% from 3 months in 2019, which was 254,332 units. 
The decline in sales in March 2020 was quite deep or was corrected by 15% to 76,800 vehicles from the same period 
in the previous year of 90,368 vehicles since the work from home policy was implemented following the later social 
restrictions. In response to this, the shares of PT Astra International Tbk (ASII), fell 5.24% to the level of Rp 3,620 
per share, down 200 points. Likewise, the issuer of spare parts producer, PT Astra Otoparts Tbk (AUTO), which fell

5. Discussion  
The occurrence of the Covid-19 Pandemic and the addition of cases from day to day proved to have a significant 
negative impact on stock returns of the capital market in Indonesia, including the automotive sector. The increasing 
number of Covid-19 cases has resulted in negative automotive stock returns. This can be caused by a panic response 
from investors to then sell their shares. On the other hand, people's purchasing power has decreased due to the 
disrupted economy due to the lockdown or PSBB. Research by Al-Awadhi et al. (2020) stated that the increase in the 
number of Covid-19 cases created uncertainty in the future and had an impact on stock returns. Research by Ajeng 
Mugiarni et al (2021) shows that the addition of cases and deaths makes stock returns in Indonesia negative. 
Meanwhile, according to Rahman et al (2021), 
Stock price volatility during the Covid-19 period significantly had a positive effect on stock returns. High volatility 
seemed to occur when Covid-19 began to enter Indonesia and several months after. The results of the research by 
Iman Jayanegara et al (2021) explain that there are differences in volatility in the time span before the entry of Covid-
19 and when the entry of Covid-19. Research by Teresia et al (2021) explains that the entry of Covid-19 has a positive 
effect on stock volatility, including in Indonesia. Meanwhile, research by Husnil Barry (2020) explains that there is 
Volatility Clustering in the mid-March period in all exchanges of several countries. This is in line with what happened 
in Indonesia where in March Covid-19 began to enter Indonesia. The entry of Covid-19 into Indonesia, which quickly 
spread throughout the world, caused panic among stock investors, including automotive stocks, in Indonesia. This 
panic ultimately resulted in increased stock price volatility due to the fall in stocks because many sold their shares and 
of course the impact on stock returns tended to be negative. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
This study aims to specifically investigate the impact of the increase in Covid-19 pandemic deaths on the Automotive 
stock sector on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is measured by the number of 
additional cases. Meanwhile, the volatility is measured by the increase and decrease in automotive stock prices. 
Opening and closing of shares for the period of 6 months before and after the Covid-19 case first appeared in Indonesia 
on March 2, 2020. Meanwhile, Stock Return is measured by Current Income, namely the distribution of dividends and 
net income and from Capital gain or loss of shares from Increase in closing price of shares for the period of 6 months 
before and after the Covid-19 case first appeared in Indonesia on March 2, 2020. The results showed that the Stock 
Return of automotive stocks in Indonesia tended to be negatively affected due to the addition of Covid-19 cases. This 
may be due to the reduced and sluggish purchasing power of automotive as people are affected by economic conditions 
due to the Pandemic and prioritize other needs. For stock price volatility variables, the test results show that stock 
price volatility has a positive effect on stock returns. The precarious situation during the Pandemic that caused public 
panic is thought to have greatly increased the volatility of stocks at that time, so that high volatility had an impact on 
stock returns. 
 
Based on the results of this study, which only took a sample of shares in the automotive sector, further studies can be 
carried out based on other sector stocks, such as the energy sector or financial services sector, where both sectors have 
a major role in stocks in Indonesia. Other variables can also be added, for example government policies because during 
the Covid-19 Pandemic there were various policies carried out by the Government.

Abstract 
Workload is something that arises due to the demands of tasks, the influence of work environment factors, behavioral 
skills and quality of workers. This workload is not only physical but also mental. The achievement of goals at 
Company X is a demand that must be met by companies engaged in this printing. Therefore, it is necessary to improve 
both the existing system at Company X, both in terms of the technology used and the workforce that plays a very good 
role in it. Over time the demand for newspapers has increased while many employees have resigned, as a result, 
employees who continue to work experience excessive fatigue. This study aims to identify problems and calculate the 
workload on the shop floor of Company X using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index 
method (NASA-TLX) and the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT). The results is an average 
weighted workload of 60 were included in the high category, then workload of the workers should be adjusted to their 
standard of work ability because if it has to be adjusted to their work ability it can have a bad impact on the workers 
themselves.

1. Introduction
Workload is something that arises due to the demands of tasks, the influence of work environment factors, behavioral 
skills and quality of workers (Kurata et al. 2015). This workload is not only physical but also mental. Thus, the 
workload received must be balanced between the physical abilities and cognitive abilities of the recipients of the load. 
Everyone has a different level of loading so it is necessary to strive for the optimum level of loading intensity (Knisely 
et al. 2021). A load level that is too high will cause overstress, while a load level that is too low will cause saturation 
and boredom or under stress. In general, the relationship between workload and people performance has been studied 
extensively by researchers in reliability industries such as aviation and nuclear power and to a lower level in medicine 
(Mazur et al. 2012). 
A number of adverse effects that can occur when the physical workload of a job has exceeded the physiological 
capacity of the worker. Work physiology is an understanding of a person's physical capacity at work. By using the 
work physiology approach, physical work capacity is defined as the body's maximum ability to produce energy. 
Excessive workload can also have a negative impact on work quality and performance (Purwaningsih, 2006). These 
adverse effects, for example, can include decreased reaction time, increased error in decision making, decreased ability 
to concentrate, and increased potential for work accidents (Bevilacqua et al. 2013). 
Measurement of workload subjectively processed with qualitative data (Kuo et al. 2018). This measurement is carried 
out using a psychological approach by making a psychometric scale to measure mental workload. The measurement 
method used is to select the factors that affect mental workload and provide a subjective rating. The mental workload 
measurement method that can be used is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-
TLX) and another method that can be used is the Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT).

Calculating the average weighted workload is obtained by dividing the number of weights multiplied by the rating by 
the total weight. The following is the formula for calculating the average weighted workload see equation 1 then the 
results of the workload category with a predetermined interval scale can be obtained as can be seen in table 10:

In data processing based on the measurement of mental workload using Dosbox 0.7 software with the subjective 
workload assessment technique (SWAT) program. At the scale development stage, the value of Kendall's coefficient 
of concordance (W) > 0.75 from each operator of the production floor station means that event scoring data will be 
carried out on a group scale. The value of Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W) 0.9605 for the correlation results 
shows that operators tend to prioritize the time load factor (T) which is 71.79%, mental effort or effort load (E) is 
17.69%, and psychological pressure loads. Or stress load (S) is obtained by 10.52% in considering the mental workload 
factor. This shows that the workload that contributes the most to the cognitive workload is the time load. The time 
burden is the main factor felt by the operator because of the demands of the job that require the operator to be fast in 
carrying out each work activity, because the resulting product is a newspaper product that will be read every day. 
Every process carried out starting from the printer station, plate maker machine, plate processor machine, plate folding 
machine, printing machine and folder machine is a job that requires sufficient accuracy, because if there is a defective 
product it will affect the product to be marketed and must be reprocessed. 
 
The business workload or effort load is quite influential on the workload, while the lowest stress is on the operator. A 
low mental workload does not rule out the possibility of errors in the process of work activities, this can be due to the 
lower the workload felt by the operator, the faster the operator will feel bored or under stressed. The result of boredom 
can lead to indifference to the job description because they feel they are used to their work. 
 
4. Conclusion 
From this study, the results of data processing and calculation using the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) method on the shop floor for 6 operators per station, respondents at 
the printer station with an average weighted workload of 60 were included in the high category. Respondents at the

plate maker machine station with an average weighted workload of 80,667 were included in the very high category. 
Respondents at the plate processor machine station with an average weighted workload of 81 were included in the 
very high category. Respondents at the plate folding machine station with an average weighted workload of 57.31 are 
included in the high category. Respondents at the printing press station with an average weighted workload of 68,667 
are included in the high category. And the last respondent at the folder machine station with an average weighted 
workload of 57.33 was included in the high category. The results of processing and calculating data using the 
Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) method on the production floor for 6 operators of each station 
as respondents are obtained with the value of the Kendall's coefficient of concordance w = 0.9605 for the correlation 
results indicate that operators tend to prioritize the time load factor or The time load (T) was 71.79%, the mental effort 
load (E) was 17.69%, and the psychological stress load (S) was 10.52% considering the mental workload factor. The 
workload of the workers should be adjusted to their standard of work ability because if it has to be adjusted to their 
work ability it can have a bad impact on the workers themselves.

Abstract 
Boiling raw milk and other pasteurization methods have an excellent food safety consumption and maintain the food 
quality. The nutrition and microbiological qualities in milk are easily damaged, thus proper handling is required. A 
way to handle the milk properly by considering the pasteurization method and its condition, such as temperature and 
time in the pasteurization process. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of pasteurization 
method using individually heating and combine with pulsed electric field using various temperature and pre-heating 
time on the total amount of microbiological in dairy products enriched with hydrolyzed bovine collagen and 
determine a proper treatment. Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used as an experimental design with 
temperature variables (35 oC, 45 oC, 55 oC, and 65oC) while the pre-heating time used was (10 minutes, 20 minutes, 
30 minutes, and 40 minutes). A proper treatment was obtained from pre-heating conditions with a temperature of 
55oC and a time of 30 minutes by using inference statistics method with paired T-test and resulting total plate count 
(TPC) of 3.30 ± 0.01 log cfu/ml, viscosity of 4.48 ± 0.08 mPa.S, and emulsion stability of 12.33 ± 1.73%. 
Hopefully, this research can be an innovation in the combination process of thermal and non-thermal milk enriched 
with hydrolyzed bovine collagen. The product result is safer due to decreasing number of microorganisms in milk.

1. Introduction
Milk is one of the most important food in human life and is a source of animal protein which contains high 
nutritional value. The nutrient contents of milk consists of protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals that are useful for 
human health (Widyatama 2018). Milk is a beverage that is suitable for animals and humans due to easily digested 
nutrients. Apart from being a source of animal protein, milk is also very good for bacterial growth. In addition, milk 
is a medium for several microorganisms that can change the chemical composition of milk during storage. 
Pasteurization is one of the milk processing businesses by heating to maintain the quality and safety of milk. This 
effort is a process of eradicating pathogenic bacteria that may still be present in milk. Pasteurized milk is another 
form of fresh milk and as an effort to extend its durability (Resnawati 2020). 
Pasteurization using thermal is one method that can reduce the population of microorganisms present in milk, but 
this method also reduce nutrients from milk. Therefore, proper processing of fresh cow's milk to extend the shelf

average data of pre-heating and pre-heating+PEF with temperatures of 550C and 650C, so that it can be illustrated 
through the graph below. (Figure 6) 
Figure 6. Graph of One Way Anova 
6. Conclusion
From the research data, it can be concluded that the use of minitab software is very helpful in calculating inferential 
statistics accurately and quickly. In this case it includes Paired Sample T-Test and One Way Anova. These 
calculations are presented in several outputs showing that milk enriched with hydrolized bovine collagen which was 
given pre-heating treatment at 550C for 30 minutes followed by pasteurization using PEF was the best treatment. It 
is evident from H0 which is received more than the others. The hope of this research is to become literate for the 
processing of electric shock pasteurization, especially in dairy products enriched with good and correct hydrolized 
bovine collagen.

 Abstract 
Technological advances have an impact on changing the learning system with Blended learning with the consequences 
of diverse student perceptions. This paper aims to map students' perceptions of blended learning in the Character-
Building course and analyze how the Binusmaya LMS supports the success of blended learning at Bina Nusanatara 
University. The data was obtained from online articles and then confirmed by several students as informants in this 
paper. Informants were limited to a few students who had studied several semesters using the blended learning method 
and were randomly appointed from various majors. In collecting data, the interview guide instrument was used to 
formulate questions. Open-ended questions include three things: First, data related to the effectiveness of learning 
with blended learning. second, satisfaction with LMS Binumaya. Third, the success factor of the blended learning 
system. This study found three types of perceptions: First, in general, students were satisfied with the Binusmaya LMS 
as a supporter of the blended learning method. Second, a small number of them were dissatisfied with the LMS due 
to some technical issues, and third, the students felt quite effective and satisfied but needed improvement in the 
performance of the Binusmaya LMS. Thus, it is necessary to improve so that the perception of students is happier 
with the blended learning method.

1. Introduction
The monotonous learning method in lectures has made the quality of student learning decrease. This is because many 
factors include face-to-face routines in class, unattractive teaching methods by lecturers, and textual material. Study 
schedule that drains time and energy. The distance between the college and the place of residence. In addition to the 
above factors, technology demands to develop new teaching methods so that students do not feel bored. This coincides 
with the rapid advancement of information technology. Universities try to meet the demands of the problem. Binus as 
a university is one of the campuses that conducts learning methods by integrating online technology. Since 2010 Binus 
University already has a face-to-face learning curriculum that is not full. Of the total 16 face-to-face meetings, there 
are 3 meetings whose teaching is done through online Binusmaya. It is interesting to analyze whether the development 
of blended learning methods (Chaeruman, 2019) is more effective and whether the factors that support the success of 
this learning are. 
Unfortunately, the existing studies tend to largely ignore the importance of opinions about the relationship between 
students and campus facilities. Most of the existing studies discuss the factors, models and quality of blended learning 
(Setiawan & Aden, 2020) , (Putri et al., 2019) , (Chaeruman, 2019) . Only a few studies that discuss student perceptions 
show that blended learning is very attractive to students (Wiharja et al., 2020) . From the results of existing studies 
regarding student perceptions regarding online methods, it turns out that not all students are happy, even some feel 
difficulties and objections, some of them prefer to study with text books (Wiharja et al., 2020) . In addition, the blended 
learning method that the researchers found only discussed Indonesian language material. This is certainly an 
opportunity for the researchers of this article to discuss in the context of character-building material.

1. Conclusion
The findings of this study (contrary to previous results) indicate that student satisfaction with the blended learning 
method supported by LMS Binusmaya in learning Character Building is quite diverse. Most students are quite satisfied 
with the LMS Binusmaya and feel the method is more effective in the learning process. On the other hand, for a small 
number of students, they are dissatisfied with the Binusmaya LMS for various reasons, including the Binusmaya 
application still has many small bugs that reduce the QOL (Quality of Life) of the application, and for the standard 
mobile application in 2022, Binusmaya mobile can be classified as one that is quite slow in processing data and so on. 
Thus, one thing that needs to be improved is the optimization of LMS performance in processing data from all business 
learning activities where the number of students is very large. With this, the quality of the blended learning LMS is 
very important for the effectiveness of the blended learning method in supporting student academic success. 
Analysis of student satisfaction perceptions has made two important findings possible. First, the perception of 
satisfaction with the blended learning method is dynamic and diverse, which shows that even though it has been 
carefully prepared, there are still obstacles in practice and of course many of these constraint factors, both from the 
ability of students to use the LMS and can also from external factors that affect the learning process. technically 
possible. Second, this research also provides a new perspective on the renewal and development of blended learning 
methods with new technologies, especially related to the Binusmaya LMS. 
This research is limited to articles and information from social media (whatsapp) for several students, both regular 
students and Binus online learning (BOL) students. For a more comprehensive or in-depth understanding, further 
studies are needed which focus more on larger students and in a longer research period based on more complete 
research variables.

Abstract 
The overtime work is inherent in business development at this time. The increase in overtime work is expected because 
employees must complete their work. Overtime work is one aspect that causes employees' work-life balance to be 
imbalanced. The tight time of employee activities needs to have good time management. Time Management helps 
employees' activities and work become more focused. Employee work-life balance is correlated with employees' 
ability to cope with work pressure without neglecting personal activities. The development business requires the 
company to strive to be superior and compete. This phenomenon is a challenge for companies to create competitive 
human resources. This research aims to determine the influence of overtime work and time management on employees' 
work-life balance in the Human Capital Division at a Bank in West Java, Indonesia. This research uses a descriptive 
and quantitative analysis. The data was collected by distributing a questionnaire to the respondent. The data processing 
technique uses a multiple-liner regression. Sampling was done using a non-probability sampling technique, with a 
total sample of 59 people—research data processing using SPSS 26.0 software. The research presented that overtime 
work and time management have a significant positive effect simultaneously and partially on employees' work-life 
balance.

1. Introduction
Banks are intermediary institutions that have an essential role in the country's economy to improve people's living 
standards. The bank will collect and process all activities related to funding, lending, and providing services. The 
people's economy in a country is one of the major influences on that country's economic growth. Economic growth is 
an essential indicator in analyzing the development and measuring the achievement of economic growth (Kustanto, 
2020). The spread of Banks in Indonesia increased the country's economic growth through banking financial 
institutions. Several reports show the tremendous competitive growth of banking in Indonesia. According to Bank 
Indonesia's Monetary Policy Review Report data in November 2021, Indonesia's banking intermediation experienced 
positive growth of 3.24% Year over Year (YoY) in October 2021, driven by demand and improving credit supply 
(Bank Indonesia Department of Economic and Monetary Policy, 2021). Financial Services Authority (OJK) in July 
2021 stated the profitability of banking in Indonesia is in good condition, with the Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 
banking in Indonesia at the level of 4.54%, Operational Costs and Operating Income (BOPO) of 84.23%. Then, the 
bank's net profit was 9.69% Year over Year (YoY) (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, 2021).  
The achievement of banking industries in Indonesia causes good management of human resources. Human resources 
management must align with the company's goals. The bank's achievement proves it in the human capital division 
competition, namely the Indonesian Human Capital Award (IHCA) by the Economic Review. This award is an 
appreciation to companies in Indonesia to encourage and motivate the developing Human Resources to increase 
productivity, competitiveness, and the Human Capital Index globally. Human Capital Management (HCM) manages 
human resources as company assets or capital to improve individual performance so those company goals are 
optimally achieved. Good performance significantly affects how tight the work of this division is.

research conducted by Wicaksana research (2020), which states that millennial generation employees in the banking 
sector, the results obtained the dimensions of work-life balance that is reducing or disturbing (interference) formation 
of work-life balance classified into the low category (57.6% and 54.1%). It can be concluded that employees who are 
too busy with activities at work, such as meetings, deadlines, and work overtime, can reduce the quality of personal 
life. Thus, decreasing time with family, friends, and hobbies. 
Therefore, employees at Human Capital Division in a Bank in West Java, Indonesia, are advised to improve the work-
life balance program in this division to create a flexible work environment. Such as limiting working hours not to 
exceed normal working hours, reducing overtime work on jobs that are not a priority and can be done on another day, 
and implementing work remote or work-from-home policies in some conditions. So that employees are more flexible 
to work and interact with family when important things happen, the company can provide more employee benefits 
such as increased compensation and guaranteed career paths. Then, the company can provide opportunities for 
employees to develop themselves outside of their careers, such as interests and talents, sports, and other achievements. 
6. Conclusions
According to the data obtained from 59 respondents, the results conclusions can be described as follows: 
a. The Overtime Work variable is in the High category. The highest score is in the amount of overtime work
dimension. It means employees perceive the amount of overtime as strict frequency and length of overtime work.
Then, it is not proportional to the rewards of overtime work obtained.
b. The Time Management variable is in the High category. The highest score is in the managing task and works
environment dimension. The employees of the Human Capital Division at a Bank in West Java, Indonesia, can
manage tasks and work environment well. However, employees still have difficulty setting goals for each activity,
affecting priorities.
c. The Work-Life Balance variable is in the High category. The most influential in this variable is the Work
Interference with Personal Life (WIPL) dimension. This indicates that employees of the Human Capital Division
at a Bank in West Java, Indonesia spend more time at work, which impacts or reduces personal life activities.
d. The hypothesis testing indicates that Overtime Work and Time Management simultaneously and partially
significantly affect the employees' Work-Life Balance in Human Capital Division at a Bank in West Java,
Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Shopee launchedin 2015, Shopee is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Shopee provides 
consumers with an easy, safe, fast, and enjoyable online shopping experience enjoyed by tens of millions of consumers 
every day.  Shopee Indonesia was officially introduced in Indonesia in December 2015 under the auspices of PT 
Shopee International Indonesia. Offering a one stop mobile experience, Shopee provides a live chat feature that makes 
it easier for sellers and buyers to interact with each other easily and quickly. 
. E-commerce is  the dissemination, sale purchase, marketing of goods and services through electronic means such 
as the internet or television, www, or other computer networks(Harmayani, 2020) . In Indonesia, the e-commerce 
market is very profitable, because the large number of internet users continues to increase from year to year so that 
not a few businesspeople take advantage of these developments   become an opportunity in doing business.  One of 
them is the growth of online buying and selling platforms that implement the form of customer to customer (C2C). 
The quality of service has a close relationship with customer satisfaction, good service quality will create customer 
satisfaction.  If the service received or felt is in accordance with consumer expectations, then the quality of service is 
perceived to be good and satisfactory.   The quality of service becomes a factor that consumers consider reordering 
products from the company because they obtain satisfaction(Bharmawan & Hanif, 2022) .

Based on the Table 3 above, the composite reliability results show that the value of > 0.7 and Cronbach alpha > 0.6, 
this means that it is reliable and can be used as a variable measurement instrument in this study. 
 
3.4 Hypothesis Testing 
Hypothesis testing explains that in conducting hypothesis testing, it can be done by looking at the t-statistical value 
and the probability value. In the t-table value for alpha 5% or 0.05 the t-statistic value used is greater than the t-table. 
While the probability value with an alpha scale of 5% or 0.05 is t-table. Hypothesis testing in this study consisted of 
path coefficient (direct effect) and indirect effect. Based on the results of data processing, the results of hypothesis 
testing are obtained, as follows:

4.2 Suggestion 
a.
On the service quality variable, the lowest response is in the empath dimension of the second question about
providing information to customers accordingly, the Shopee needs to be more thorough in providing
information to customers so that customers get accurate information.
b.
In the customer satisfaction variable, the lowest respondent response is in the dimension of service quality in
the second question about satisfaction with the service provided in accordance with expectations, then from
that, Shopee must start improving the services provided by Shopee to customers so that  the service received
by customers is  in accordance with what is expected.
c.
On the variable of customer loyalty, the lowest respondent responses are on the dimension of resistance to
negative influences regarding the company on the second question about not being affected by negative
rumors   about Shopee.  Shopee is expected to maintain the good name of the company which aims to keep
the company away from negative rumors that can affect customers.
