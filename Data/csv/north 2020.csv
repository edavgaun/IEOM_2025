Abstract 
  
Given the high probability of occurrence of environmental disasters in Mexico, it is necessary to have emergency and 
response plans that attend the most urgent needs of the victims, as well as the subsequent recovery and reconstruction 
processes of the affected areas.  After the 2017 earthquake in Mexico City, the project ‚ÄúEarthquake Waste 
Management Proposal in Mexico City‚Äù was launched, which includes the removal of waste from the disaster site to a 
temporary site separation, which is a temporary storage and waste classification site before being sent to their 
respective recycling chains or for their proper final disposal.  The selection of optimal locations for temporary sites is 
important for efficient management of the supply chain and humanitarian logistics. This work presents the optimal 
location of the temporary site based on the Transportation Model of Mixed Integer Linear Programming, which 
evaluates the average distance between the collapse points caused by the earthquake (demand) and the sites authorized 
by the Government of the Mexico City, to select n temporary sites (facilities) whose distance must be minimal.  All 
above is necessary, in order to achieve the reduction of risks to public health and support the efficient management of 
waste for their proper recycling or final disposal. The methodology of the present study includes the application of the 
Transportation model, case study earthquake of September 19th, 2017 in Mexico City, considering next constraints: 
14 collapse buildings, 8 possible sites according to official data provided, 46 439 m3 (11 482 ton) earthquake waste 
generation according with previous estimations by the same Project and the location of a single temporary site.  The 
results show that the minimum total distance between each origin point and the temporary site is 534.29 km.  The 
minimum distance traveled between the points of origin and destination is 51% less than that of the farthest site, while 
it is 7.95% less than that of the next nearest site.  The study concludes that the location of temporary waste separation 
sites through the proposed model contributes to the planning of pre-disaster actions.  It is necessary to continue 
working on this issue to increase the resilience of Mexico City and in the long term of other vulnerable municipalities 
of the country.

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this paper is to examine what are main factors influencing trucks productivity of a freight transport 
company in Mexico. This study employed factor analysis to determine if there were a relationship between variables 
and multiple regression analysis to determine which factors had significant impact in delivery times. Data collected 
were analyzed using SPSS 23. Regarding factor analysis, it was used Kayser-Meyer-Olkin test to prove if a factorial 
analysis could be performed, resulting in reduction of variables from 7 to 2 ‚Äì with a KMO of 0.91 the results are 
suitable for factor analysis ‚Äì and Bartlett‚Äôs sphericity test to test resulting in 0.0 ‚Äì which means data structure is suitable 
‚Äì indicating factor analysis and data are useful to achieve research objective. Hence, this study is the base to improve 
service quality and client perception, by increasing number of fulfilled deliveries. This research is important for the 
company since it will provide insights about the performance of their logistics process and variables to be controlled 
to improve trucks efficiency and productivity.

1. Introduction  
Freight transport system is part of essential activities for the economy of each country (Kulovic, 2016; Bouguerra et 
al., 2016) and Mexico is not the exception, besides road freight transport is the most used modal transport due to low 
costs (Zamora Torres and Mora Zimbon, 2018). Hence, it is important for logistics company to measure efficiency 
and productivity of their operations. Moreover, no matter in what industry companies are involved, they use key 
performance indicators (KPI) to collect data regarding real performance of processes, defining a KPI as a quantitative 
verifiable representation to measure to what extent goals are met (Arango Serna et al., 2016). Moreover, since logistics 
operations and delivery times of freight transport companies have high impact for manufacturing companies as a cost 
driver for logistics processes and customer satisfaction (Sambracos and Ramfu, 2014).  
  
Quality service and operations efficiency should be an objective assessment regarding KPIs as mentioned by ≈†imkov√° 
et al., (2015) which should be based on factors affecting transport service; but identify those factors is a 
challenge for companies, since are internal and external factors affecting  operational

5. Conclusion and Recommendations  
This study recommended that company should pay special attention to maintenance, since it is the factor affecting 
meaningfully the supply chain performance of the logistics company from the case study. Hence, in order to reduce 
those times, it is important to implement a preventive maintenance program, which should be planned to be carried 
out when equipment has low utilization due to low demand, also, make a general check to the trucks with highest idle 
times in order to focus in the reduction of idle time to improve equipment productivity. Also, the analysis and 
classification of truck types by age should be performed, so they oldest can be assigned to flat routes where their 
performance cannot be reduced by type of road and service can be performed efficiently. Moreover, it is important to 
standardize truck logs to reduce data manipulation manually, since all data had to be cleaned before any analysis could 
be performed, which reduces visibility of logistics issues to make decisions regarding any route, impacting negatively 
in customer service level and reaction times are longer, increasing delivery times and, consequently, impacting 
manufacturing times from customers. Hence, it should be implemented KPIs to measure process efficiency regarding 
maintenance and equipment utilization.

Abstract 
 
The paper presents the results of the case study conducted in the South African railway sector. This research aimed to 
identify the challenges that affect the Thabazimbi channel of rolling stock, identify critical success factors and the 
level of adoption to improve and optimize the reliability and maintenance of rolling stock.  The study found that 
critical success factors had been well adopted in the study area. Age-related failures, vandalism, financial resources 
and weather conditions have been identified as key factors affecting reliability. It was suggested that the company use 
benchmarking to develop, maintain and improve its current state of affairs. The company should invest in security to 
combat vandalism and identify non-value-added activities to reduce maintenance costs. The organization should 
consider implementing an overhaul program and replacing components with high failure rates to address age-related 
factors. Although the results showed that senior management was committed to improving reliability, the company 
still needs to develop an integrated asset management policy that adheres to international asset management standards 
such as ISO55000 to reduce maintenance costs.

1. Introduction 
 
Railway transport is considered to be one of the safest and most efficient modes of transport. Railway transport plays 
an essential role in the advancement of the global economy. However, one of the challenges facing the railway system 
is the reliability of rolling stock and special infrastructure on the African continent. As a result, asset managers in the 
rail sector have shifted the focus from increasing the competitiveness of the sector to addressing unforeseeable system 
failures. In South Africa, the rail sector is positioning itself to be among the top five rail sectors in the world by 2030 
(George, et al., 2018).  The claims are shown in the number of infrastructure development projects and the acquisition 
of new rolling stock. The rail network in South Africa is estimated at 23 500 km of the rail network, of which 1 600 
km is mainly for export commodities and the remainder for domestic flows. The rail sector plays and continues to 
play a strategic role in linking ports and production hubs. The South African rail network enables smooth trade 
between neighbouring countries. Approximately fourteen percent (14 percent) of South African freight goods are 
transported annually by the rail sector. 
 
There is evidence in the literature that the rail sector in South Africa has challenges of reliability and maintenance of 
its rolling stock (Makhanya; 2016). Some of the factors affecting reliability include the ageing of locomotives and the 
operating environment (Dibakoane, 2013). Other factors include old rail infrastructure, theft and vandalism. Previous 
research focused on specific areas such as the Natal corridor (Makhanya; 2016) and the export of coal (Seshabela, 
2018) and ignored the Thabazimbi channel, which is also a major part of the South African rail network. The lack of 
knowledge on the factors affecting the reliability of rolling stock in the Thabazimbi channel has been identified as an

majority of the failures were age-related and cable theft which was part of vandalism.  There were sufficient 
similarities between the three data sources as a result, we conducted that the study had both validity and reliability.

The research aimed to explore the factors affecting fleet performance in the Thabazimbi channel; identify critical 
success factors and adoption them in the study area, and finally to propose an improvement strategy. The literature 
review provided an opportunity to identify the critical success factors that have been adopted globally, factors that 
affect the performance of rolling stock and formulate a recommendation. The case study was selected as an appropriate 
research strategy for this research due to its ability to integrate multiple data sources into a single study. The 
questionnaire and operational data were selected as the current research information providers. The study found that 
critical success factors had been well adopted in the study area. Age-related failures, vandalism, financial resources 
and weather conditions have been identified as key factors affecting reliability. It was suggested that the company use 
benchmarking to develop, maintain and improve its current state of affairs. The company should invest in security to 
combat vandalism and identify non-value-added activities to reduce maintenance costs. The organization should 
consider implementing an overhaul program and replacing components with high failure rates to address age-related 
factors. Although the results showed that senior management was committed to improving reliability, the company 
still needs to develop an integrated asset management policy that adheres to international asset management standards 
such as ISO55000 and reduces maintenance costs.

Abstract  
 
Water is among one of the valuable resources that are now under threat due to human activities in the world exposing 
it to vulnerability to pollution. This study investigated the factors that affect the reliability of wastewater treatment 
plants in Lesotho and recommended strategies that can be used to improve the reliability of the wastewater treatment 
plants in Lesotho. Since the purpose of the research was not to generalize the findings but to gain an in-depth 
understanding, the X wastewater treatment plant was chosen as the case study with the questionnaire and secondary 
data as data collection methods. All sources identify operation and maintenance, health and safety risk, and human 
factors as factors influencing plant reliability. The study did not provide the evidence to conclude that policies and 
governance, vandalism, and theft had an impact on plant reliability, but corruption, design, and infrastructure 
inefficiencies were identified as areas that need to be investigated further. The following were found to be strategies 
that can be used to improve the reliability of the X wastewater treatment plant; Proper plant maintenance, policing, 
implementing health and safety systems, rehabilitation and upgrading of the wastewater treatment plant and employee 
focus.

1. Introduction 
 
Water is regarded as one of the most valuable resources in the world which is now under threat due to human activities 
exposing it to pollution (Majumder, et al., 2019). The fact that water is considered a valuable resource must be utilized 
efficiently to enable the next generation access to it and therefore it must be returned to the environment in a better 
state than before (Van, et al., 2011). This valuable resource must be prevented from pollution at all levels hence a 
need for treatment of wastewater before disposal into the environment. The need for wastewater treatment was 
influenced by John Snow to prove that the cholera outbreak that killed tens of thousands of people in London in the 
years 1832, 1849 and 1855 was caused by polluted water from Thames River (Angelakis and Snyder, 2015). Even 
though there had been a collection of wastewater back in the centuries but the treatment of wastewater dates back to 
1800 and 1900 years (Dhote, Ingole and Chavhan, 2012).  
 
Approximately 80% of wastewater is discharged into the environment without treatment and this is usually the root 
cause of waterborne diseases (Majumder, et al., 2019). In South America, 85% of wastewater is not treated, while in 
Venezuela only 3% of wastewater is centrally treated at the wastewater treatment plant and the rest is discharged 
untreated directly into the environment (Dhote, et al., 2012). Even in highly industrialized countries such as China, 
only 45% of its sewage goes through the treatment processes while the rest is discharged to the environment untreated 
(Dhote, et al., 2012). However, some countries and states take wastewater treatment and reuse seriously, for instance, 
California, Singapore and Spain (Angelakis and Snyder, 2015). Countries like South Africa are regarded as one of the 
countries having the facilities of wastewater treatment but aged infrastructure, overloading and improper maintenance 
have caused the treatment facilities to be as good as nothing thus posing serious health and socio-economic hazards 
to the dependents of such receiving water bodies (Dhote, et al., 2012). 
 
For many years the reliability of wastewater treatment plants has attracted a lot of attention in the engineering and 
scientific world (Adraka, 2019). Reliability in the context of operational efficiency of wastewater treatment plants is 
one of the most important aspects in the field of the water sector and has driven technological innovation in today‚Äôs

health and safety, design and infrastructure inefficiencies.  
 
Both sources identify operation and maintenance, health and safety risk, and human factors as factors influencing 
plant reliability. There was no evidence to conclude that policies and governance; vandalism and theft affected plant 
reliability, while corruption; design and infrastructure inefficiencies were identified as areas that require further 
investigation. However, even though policies were found to be having no impact on the reliability of the X wastewater 
treatment plant there were very important missing policies such as asset management, supply chain management, 
maintenance, and risk management policies. The unavailability of these policies may later have an impact on the 
reliability of the X wastewater treatment plant. Vandalism and theft were also not found to be a problem that may 
have an impact on the reliability of the plant but for the fact that a minority of the respondents mentioned it, it cannot 
be overlooked and needs investigations. 
 
It was determined from the respondents and the literature that proper plant maintenance and operations, as well as the 
adoption of best maintenance and operation best practices, can be used as a strategy to mitigate the problem of 
operations and maintenance issues. Rehabilitation and upgrading of the wastewater treatment plant were also 
identified as a strategy to improve the reliability of the wastewater treatment in cases where design and infrastructure 
inefficiencies affect the reliability of the plant. Last but not least employee focus was found to be a very good strategy 
in controlling human factors, errors and competency at the workplace. All the above-mentioned strategies can be used 
to improve the reliability of the X wastewater treatment plant.

Abstract 
 
Organisations in the construction industry are frequently faced with the challenges of not achieving the set targets 
with reference to late project completions, exceeding the budget and undesirable quality of work due to poor 
workmanship. The global financial challenges have encouraged numerous organizations to investigate the possibilities 
of improving the delivery of their products and services. Consequently, clients in the construction industry require 
more efficient management of projects and services to meet project objectives; and including post-mortems as best 
practice allow organisations to further enhance the successful management of future projects. This paper describes a 
study carried out to explore the key factors and benefits of effective and successful project post-mortems for 
organisations in the construction industry. For this, a quantitative methodological approach employing a structured 
closed-ended research instrument as a data source was followed. The findings identified people and systems related 
factors that contribute to successful and effective project post mortems for organisations in construction environment. 
The study further identified the benefits organisations can gain from successful project post-mortems.

 1. Introduction 
The construction industry plays an important role in the economic growth of a large number of  organisations and the 
projects carried out having a significant environmental and social effect (Opoku and Fortune 2011). Thus, there is a 
need for suitable change and ability of construction organisations to adapt to such changes as part of the process 
whereby organisations acquire knowledge from previous projects. Organisations in the construction industry are often 
faced with the challenges of not achieving the set targets with reference to late project completions, exceeding the 
budget and undesirable quality of work due to poor workmanship. The global financial challenges have encouraged 
numerous organizations to investigate the possibilities of improving the delivery of their products and services. This 
pattern has become visible in the construction industry with the clients requiring efficient management of projects and 
service provided, in order to meet the set project objectives.  
Project management is an important and advanced practice pursued by organisations in managing projects within the 
construction industry (Sanjuan and Froese 2013). Many organisations perceive project management as a vital tool 
which has an effect on the organisation‚Äôs performance, profitability and competitiveness (Maluleke and Marnewick  
2012). Literature by Chron√©er and Backlund (2015) emphasise the importance of learning in project-based 
organisations as a way an organisation sustains and enhances its ability to compete successfully with other 
organisations. According to Demirkesen and Ozorhon (2017) construction project performance is dependent on 
several aspects of project management. Integration management is one of the crucial aspects as successful project 
management practices begin with merging humans and a series of actions to be taken to achieve the required results. 
Therefore, efficient handling of lessons learned is important in a construction industry. For the reasons that obtaining, 
distributing and using information in a construction environment is important, effective handling of such information 
is regarded as critical components that assist organisations in achieving positive results (Ozorhon, Karatas and 
Demirkesen  2014).  
Organizations use most known methods like post-mortems, post-project reviews, project debriefings and lessons 
learned discussions for reviewing and analysing the project performance (Chirumalla 2016).  By including post-

repetitively use post and graphics to establish the root causes of the challenges (Vignos, 2014; Enshassi et al. 2016). 
Cronbach‚Äôs coefficient alpha was equal to 0.935, suggesting that reliability of the research questionnaire was 
acceptable. 
 
5.6 Proposed Improvements  
 
From the findings and conclusions, the study recommends that organisations must consider investing on improving 
their knowledge management systems and implementation thereof, to ensure that organisations learn from mistakes. 
A key outcome of any project post-mortem lies in motivating the project team by also recognising and rewarding the 
team‚Äôs successes. Future research to be conducted to test the findings obtained by comparing two or more 
organisations that conducts projects in the construction industry. It would be interesting for future research to analyse 
the application of project post-mortems by different organisations within the construction industry. Further research 
may follow a case study approach with both a questionnaire and interviews in the research to better understand how 
organisations facilitate and incorporates project post mortems to perform better in future projects. 
 
5.7 Validation  
 
The study used content validation through extensive literature review and the questionnaire were adopted from the 
existing sources. The adequacy of the data collection tools was further confirmed using face validation. Further, 
theoretical validation was conducted on the study results by comparing the findings against the findings of other 
researchers from literature.   
 
6. Conclusion  
 
The objectives of this research were to identify the key factors that lead to an effective and successful project post 
mortem for organisations in construction environment and identify the benefits of a successful project post-mortem. 
A closed-ended questionnaire was developed to address the objectives of this research. The people-related and 
systems-related factors as well as the benefits of a successful project post-mortem were identified. The people-related 
factors such as learning from mistakes, communication and common understanding, teamwork, top management 
support and commitment, technical support from experience individuals, active participation by clients/project 
owners, trust, willingness to share information and incentive and reward initiatives were identified as contributing to 
the effectiveness and successful project post mortems. 
 
Information technology, procedures/standards, workshops/project assessment, information capturing database and 
lessons learnt registers are the systems related factors used by organisations for effective and successful post-mortems. 
Further, cross-collaboration and increased customer relations, cost reduction and time savings, better decision making, 
active participation by all stakeholders, improved communication, reflection and closure on project, improved 
productivity and continuous learning are the key benefits that organisations can benefit from successful project post 
mortems. The research found that project post mortems is a beneficial tool and methods by which organisations can 
learn and improve its capabilities to achieve accomplish better results in future projects.

Abstract 
 
Despite a noticeable decline in the South African mining industry, opportunities still exist to exploit the current 
resources. Curbing the devastating effects of this decline and the job losses would necessitate a change in approach; 
to one that promotes safe and profitable mining, to enable consistent product development or service reliability. 
Manufacturing methodologies such as Lean Six Sigma and Theory of Constraints were adopted to demonstrate the 
slot raising in long-hole stoping mining. Slot raise is the critical long-hole stope stage, that if effectively executed 
warrants optimal extraction of the planned reserves. Challenges with achieving the consistent performance of long-
hole stopes performances were experienced to have been a major challenge at South Deep contributing to poor slot 
raise establishment often leading to re-work. Hence, it was prudent to consider improvement interventions to reduce 
wastage and promote good recoveries. Improvements of 16% were attained from slot compliance from 56% in 2019 
to 73% for the same period in 2020. These resulted from the design modifications through improvements in current 
slot patterns‚Äô void ratios. Process refinements from rigour tracking and leadership-driven performance ensured the 
right levels of accountability and sustainability of outcomes.

1. Introduction 
The global competitive nature of mining economic resources tends to compel mines to seek solutions that promote the 
reduction of wasteful events and improve productivity. In addition to the increase in demand, the quality and 
productivity of the product are basic requirements needed to ensure the sustainability of an organization (O'Connor 
and Kleyner 2012). This article outlines the research work conducted on long hole stope slot raise improvement 
initiatives at one of the Gold Fields branches (South Deep) located Southwest of Johannesburg in South Africa, South 
Deep is the deepest single drop mine in the world with a bulk of its production acquired from long-hole stopes through 
sublevel open stopping methods. Sublevel open stopping is one of the low cost and bulk mining methods with most 
of its development inside the payable ore contact. Development constitutes access ramps that offer ways to drift drives 
that are placed vertically between parallel sublevels and spaced 15 to 20m horizontally (Fellows 2001). The vertical 
and horizontal ore middling defines the stopes‚Äô target ore boundary content. Just like any underground mining method, 
it relies upon the establishment of slot raise to unlock the stopping extraction process. There are four commonly used 
slot establishment methods in mining, these include, conventional raising, drop raising, raise boring, and crater 
blasting (Technical Services 1998). South Deep often deploys the latter two methods, with most of its slots established 
from crater blasting which relies on dense drilling of a slot pattern using a combination of small and large diameter 
holes. As previously noted by Henning (2007) that slot underbreak and dilution are the most common challenges 
experienced in sublevel open stopping. South Deep is not estranged from alluded challenges, with some of its planning 
irregularities relating to re-work emanating from slot establishment failures, which consequently affects the 
organisation‚Äôs production profile. 
 
There are various reasons that could potentially cause slot failures. For example, some failures may occur because of 
design flaws, others due to process ineffectiveness or execution-related failures. Whilst there is a wide variety of 
sources leading to slot failures. Most often, these failures perpetually occur because of the inability to identify their

fluctuations within the control limits, i.e., Upper Control Limit (UCL) and lower control Limit (LCL). The pink dotted 
lines represent both upper and lower specification limits, USL and LSL respectively. Moreover, the chart reflects two 
different phases one being the pre-intervention phase (controlled state) reflecting more data fluctuations below the 
mean. Whereas the improved state displays less slot data variability with most of it lying above the mean.  
 
 
       Figure 8. Slot/Stope Compliance Graph                          Figure 9. Slot Compliance Control Charts 
 
Shown in figure 10 below is results obtained from splitting compliance for slot raise only and slot taken together with 
the extension. The extraction of the slot together with extension reflects more favourable outcomes compared to slot 
only as reflected by the higher mean and low deviation for the former compared to the latter.   
 
 
Figure 10. Slot Compliance histogram 
 
4.4 Validation 
Analysis of means (ANOM) reflected in Table 1 is used to provide statistically significant differences between process 
outputs that are similarly categorised (Lee Sye 2009). No statistical inferences linking the difference in compliance to 
the categorical data as the means of all categories were within the upper and lower decision limit. However, the sample 
data displayed good performance when bigger bits (89mm) are used as well as when execution is with slot and its 
extension together. This could be attributed to the higher void ratio of 89mm bits and further analysis is needed to 
understand the performance associated with taking slot and extension together. 
 
The validation made from the numerical planned slot height and blast size data using Pearson correlation reflects the 
p-value < 0.05 for compliance vs height meaning there is a significant relationship worth studying between these two 
variables. Established from the overall analysis including analysis made from CRT, is that slot compliance is sensitive 
to the drill pattern used and high-performance variability caused by lack of accountability from the crews. Moreover, 
the team felt that there is more opportunity for improvement associated with the accuracy of the input placed towards 
slotting.The outcome of this improvement initiative reflects an advancement in sigma levels made on discrete data 
from 2.05 to 3.03 as reflected by a significant reduction in a number of defects occurrences when compared to the 
previous years. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study provided insights on the current slot processes and an appreciation of Lean Six Sigma combined with the 
theory of constraints methodologies. The DMAIC methodology enabled the correlation of the literature review aspects

56","to the practical and theoretical knowledge. It surfaced the importance of defining the problem prior to assuming any 
improvement intervention. The measuring results and the process capability assessment provided an indication on the 
direction to be followed for analysis and improvement. The analysis made from the stratified data has shown the 
overlying rock and the stope categories to have little to no influence on slot compliance. In contrast, the mean for slot 
compliance taken from Slot & Extension (bigger blast size), and that of slot patterns consisting of 89mm shot holes 
displayed a relatively higher mean than those of slot only and 76mm bits, respectively. This suggests that the use of a 
modified 89mm reamer pattern on extracting the slot together with the extension yields better results. In addition, a 
negative correlation is displayed by the height of the stope and the planned tonnes to compliance. Although, the 
measuring results reflected the slot compliance to be normally distributed with the mean of 59% standard deviation 
of 24% at a p-value of 0.07. The post improvement intervention outcomes reflect non-normally distributed compliance 
with a mean of 73% and standard deviation of 20% with a p-value of 0.003. This is attributed to the shift in 
performance where the bulk of the data set is positioned to the high-performance ranges of 70% with fewer slots on 
the lower performance range, thus skewing the results to the left. 
 
In conclusion, even though Lean Six Sigma provides a well-structured framework to guide improvement. Assessment 
of the organisational competency enables the right application of solutions to the right problems leading to reduced 
wastage. Casting the improvement to the organisational strategy together with the role of the senior management team 
in enabling effective reporting and tracking forum played a critical role in the sustainability of improvements. The 
performance outcomes of the slot compliance commensurate a process improvement by two up to a sigma level three 
(3). Often with improvements, customers‚Äô requirements evolve, necessitating further modifications and 
standardization of processes. Lean Six Sigma being a process-orientated framework provides an effective vehicle that 
is adaptable to making continuous improvements, thus providing a company‚Äôs competitive advantage. 
 
6. Recommendations 
Even though there are improvements in slot compliance, sustainability and further improvements relies upon 
understanding the drilling and charging-up accuracy and precision. Owing to time and resource constraints, it was not 
feasible to cover the scope of drilling and charging up. Although the study focused on slot compliance similar systems 
and processes are adaptable to overall long-hole stopping compliance. The current slot patterns‚Äô spacing yields 
satisfactory results, however, there is frequent reports regarding the intersection of holes. This is often not picked up 
during the drilling process, but rather observed when charging up, through seepage of an emulsion into adjacent holes. 
This then necessitates patterns modifications that are aimed at increasing the slot inter-hole spacing, thus reducing the 
likelihood of holes intersection.  Improvements in slot compliance commensurate the overall stope performance, thus 
causing excessive inventory levels between loading and tramming.  The model suggests a drum buffer rope where the 
rate of drilling and blasting is determined by the buffer depletion of the broken rock.

Abstract 
The research identified benefits that are associated with implementing the ISO 9001:2015 quality management system 
as well as the critical success factors required to realise the benefits. Organisations often successfully implement the 
quality management system but fail to unlock benefits that are beyond achieving formal certification of the system 
such as reduced defects and improved internal communication. The study identified benefits associated with 
implementing a Quality Management System and grouped them as primary, secondary, and tertiary. Furthermore, 
twenty-one critical success factors have been identified that benefit the success of a quality management system. The 
research presents the findings of the case study which evaluated the existence of the critical success factors as well as 
their effectiveness in realising the benefits that the Quality Management System offers. The research benefits 
organisations who plan to adopt the system as well as those who aim to improve their implemented system utilising 
the identified success factors.

1. Introduction 
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 series is a formal quality management certification 
system that is widely known and implemented internationally (Ismyrlis, 2017). Global organisations implement 
Quality Management Systems (QMS) to enhance efficiency and competitiveness and to improve customer satisfaction 
(Psomas, Fotopoulos and Kafetzopoulos, 2010). While most organisations manage to acquire ISO 9001 certification, 
organisations exist that struggle to realise the benefits of a formalised quality management system. The QMS offers 
benefits that are beyond receiving formal certification, such as improved productivity, increased market share and 
client satisfaction (Psomas, Fotopoulos and Kafetzopoulos, 2010). The literature notes that although many 
organisations implement the QMS, not all organisations that implement the system experience the expected positive 
results (Terziovski, Power and Sohal, 2003; Denton and Maatgi, 2016). 
Researchers have identified the following factors as the reasons why organisations implement the system but fail to 
unlock the full benefits that a certified QMS offers: 
‚Ä¢ 
According to Psomas, Fotopoulos and Kafetzopoulos (2010), the reason for the struggle often stems from the 
organisation‚Äôs initial reason for seeking certification and also how well the organisation understood and 
implemented the quality management system. 
‚Ä¢ 
Mar√≠n and Ruiz-Olalla (2011) explain that organisations often struggle to sustain positive results if 
certification was achieved through complying with the standard requirements and not due to actual 
improvements made to the organisation's internal processes to meet customer requirements.

59","Responses from participants were transcribed and analysed to determine common themes among the responses. The 
themes identified were assigned applicable codes in order to determine the frequent occurrence of these codes and 
finally determine the overall response to the question posed. From the interviews, it was noted that a majority of the 
participants agreed that their organisation had achieved certification and through doing so had unlocked the basic 
advantage of gaining access to tenders that require the QMS. However, participants agree that achieving certification 
does not automatically lead to winning the tender as the advantage is only applicable against other organisations that 
are without QMS and only within tenders that require QMS as a prerequisite. A second finding indicated that, for an 
organisation to enjoy benefits that result in improved operational processes, the organisation must spend valuable time 
in developing its processes and procedures to be in line with operational practices. A third finding was that, for an 
organisation to improve communication utilising QMS, the departments must share their procedures with other 
departments as well as continuously alert them of updates that are done on their procedures. Furthermore, the 
departments must dedicate time to develop their procedures and forms with the intention to extract all relevant 
information that will assist in the understanding of requirements of work that may be requested by other internal 
departments. 
The fourth finding states that to better understand and execute client requirements that organisation needs to properly 
develop their forms and procedures to allow proper and exact extraction of requirements from the client, develop 
forms and procedures that are easily understood by old and new employees and lastly conduct regular audits to verify 
the applicability of these procedures and forms as the business improves operational methods. A fifth finding related 
to improving client satisfaction and it was found that organisations are required to conduct and review client 
satisfaction surveys on a regular basis, improve processes quality of service offered, and utilise client satisfaction 
surveys to identify areas of poor performance and improve on them.  
4.2 Validation 
In order to improve triangulation and strengthen the case study (Yin, 2003), this study considered utilising multiple 
sources to collect data. According to Yin, (2003), evidence for case study research can be gathered from six possible 
data sources namely documents, archival records, interviews, direct observation, participant-observation and, physical 
artefacts. This study considered six possible data sources and found documents and interviews to be beneficial to the 
study‚Äôs objectives. Both the documents and interviews are complementary to one another with no data collection 
source exhibiting a complete advantage over another (Yin, 2003). Reviewing documents will allow the researcher to 
gain descriptive knowledge and conduct interviews which will help the researcher gain insightful knowledge from 
direct stakeholders who are responsible for the upkeep of the quality management system. 
5. Conclusions 
The effectiveness and existence of critical success factors in the identified QMS were evaluated against the list 
generated from the literature review and the summarised findings were as follows; leadership involvement, availability 
of resources, intentional continuous improvement, auditing and external pressure were found to be evident in this 
system and had the most impact while working environment and aligning company practices with ISO QMS were 
least verifiable factors in the system. The research findings indicate that a quality management system is beneficial 
for organisations and offers benefits that are beyond achieving certification, provided the organisation adopts practices 
such as taking time to develop procedures that are a reflection of how the work is carried out and procedures that allow 
for all crucial information to be captured when clarifying the scope and work to be done. Furthermore, continuous 
improvement of the twenty-one critical success factors is important to both the implementation and development of 
the quality management system. It is recommended that further research be conducted to verify the applicability of 
the findings made by this research on other organisations with certified quality management systems that have 
remained in existence for a period longer than three years.

Abstract  
 
Cost of Quality (CoQ) has become a familiar concept across industries and its‚Äô popularity is evident in the number of 
featured international academic publications. This research utilized previously published work, action research and 
the Delphi technique to identify the activities required to plan, execute, check and improve a CoQ implementation 
program. Action research was facilitated through a series of brainstorming sessions with seven researchers from the 
University of Johannesburg. The Delphi Technique was conducted in three stages: during the first stage experts were 
identified and invited to partake in the study, and during stages, two to three the research questions were distributed 
to the select participants and agreement amongst the experts was assessed. The study identified the following important 
activities required to plan a CoQ program, namely the quantification of errors in financial terms; the development of 
a CoQ management policy; definition of roles and responsibilities and a rewards and recognition system; specification 
of the attainable CoQ targets and key performance indicators; and identification of the stakeholder reporting 
requirements. The research contributes to the current body of knowledge of cost of quality by identifying the activities 
needed to plan and implement a CoQ program in the industry. 
 
Keywords  
Cost of Quality, Delphi Technique  
 
1. Introduction  
Cost of Quality (CoQ) has become a well-recognized concept across industries as demonstrated by the significant and 
increasing number of academic publications featured globally. The implementation of a CoQ program assists 
companies to identify non-value adding activities and provides an opportunity for process and cost improvement 
(Guinot, Evans and Badar, 2016). The concept has its origin in the manufacturing industry, but with time, it has 
developed and found application in different sectors  (Laporte et al., 2012). Xerox Corporation was one of the first 
companies that implemented cost of quality outside manufacturing, and its‚Äô implementation contributed significantly 
to the company being awarded the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige quality award in the 1980s. 
 
Literature contends that companies that do not assess the cost of quality of their operations or systems lack the drive 
for quality improvement and they swiftly run out of improvement innovation (Sower, Quarles and Broussard, 2007; 
Murumkar et al., 2018). The implementation of cost of quality promotes quality management as one of the integral 
parameters of business, and the business that is serious about quality enjoys an improved relationship with customers 
which ultimately translates to profit.  Despite the benefits associated with the adoption of CoQ, the concept is not fully 
adopted across industries (Sower, Quarles and Broussard, 2007; Kaur, 2009; Murumkar et al., 2018). Sower, Quarles 
and Broussard (2007) attempted to identify the reasons behind the poor adoption of CoQ as the business improvement 
strategy; the reasons included the poor involvement of leadership, the lack of commitment amongst departments and 
the shortage of processes to facilitate the implementation of CoQ. According to  Basak and Viswanadhan (2015), the 
challenges leading to the poor adoption of CoQ as a business strategy are much more than the involvement of leaders 
and the commitment between departments. Some of the factors influencing CoQ implementation are the challenges 
associated with the literature of CoQ, the definition of cost of quality, and the use of models to assess quality costs in 
industries.

68","the expert panel did not reach a consensus on the activities needed to monitor and improve the implementation of the 
cost of quality program. Future research is required to investigate in detail the set of activities required to plan, 
implement, control, and improve the cost of the quality programs. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The study identified from the literature the factors affecting the implementation of CoQ and employed action research 
to map the factors in the PDCA cycle. Consequently, action research identified a list of activities that could improve 
the planning, execution, monitoring and improvement of the CoQ program; and the Delphi technique was used to 
validate the results of the action research based on expert opinions. The Delphi technique consisted of two rounds and 
the panel of experts reached a consensus on 11 items (7 planning and 4 execution). To plan the CoQ program, we 
concluded that companies should consider quantifying quality errors in financial terms; develop a cost of quality 
management policy; define roles and responsibilities; define a rewards and recognition program; define the clear and 
attainable cost of quality targets and identify the reporting needs of stakeholders and specifying the leading and lagging 
key performance indicators (KPI). 
 
To implement the COQ program, the expert panel acknowledged that companies should consider collecting feedback 
from customers; provide regular feedback to stakeholders, gather performance-related information and monitor 
performance trends. Despite the high rating of items, the checking and improvement phase of the PDCA cycle did not 
reach an agreement. The research has contributed to the body of knowledge by identifying the activities needed to 
plan and implement a Cost of Quality program.

Abstract  
 
Manufacturing is one of the most important sectors in the South African economy. The paper examines the use of 
Lean Manufacturing tools in the context of South African manufacturing. To gain an in-depth understanding of the 
application of Lean manufacturing tools in South Africa, the research used a case study as the research method. 
Questionnaires and operational data were used to determine the type of waste generated by the case study company, 
as well as the most used Lean manufacturing tools for waste management. The study findings identified defects, 
inventory, transportation, waiting, and unused people's ideas as all have an impact on the company‚Äôs performance. 
Transportation, defects, and inventory wastes were found to have a high main interaction effect with the paint line, 
anti-intrusion box line and bogie fitting line as some of the highly affected areas. The research also found 5S, Standard 
Work, and Kanban as the most used lean manufacturing tools. The findings of the study can help the case study 
company's leaders to identify performance gaps and improve lean manufacturing implementation.

Abstract 
 
Traffic noise pollution is a huge issue throughout the world, especially in urban areas. Traffic noise pollution can 
cause serious health issues including headaches, nausea, irritability, and insomnia. It can also cause a lower percentage 
of intellectual development in children‚Äôs brains after long-term exposure when compared to a quiet environment. 
Solutions to this problem have been implemented in the past and many options have been proposed. However, the 
social aspect of the solutions is also important. These social indicators are often qualitative and thus difficult to 
measure. This paper presents the application of Fuzzy Logic, to evaluate the social acceptance of different noise 
reduction strategies in the region of Western New York (WNY). A questionnaire was utilized to collect data for the 
region. The created fuzzy model was verified using the questionnaire filled out by residents of WNY. The results 
gained from the developed fuzzy model showed that the highest level of social acceptance is for Planting Trees at 
61.30% and the lowest level of social acceptance is for Traffic/Transportation Restrictions at 22.10%.

1. Introduction 
Noise pollution is a growing issue year after year. Its intensity level can be very high and its influence can be very 
widespread. However, it is somewhat localized and does not cause regional or global pollution like some other sources 
such as water or air pollution. Although our cities and towns allow a great deal of convenience when everything is 
close and any store is a short drive away, it can also cause some inconvenience as well. As the development of cities 
and towns helps to boost the economy, it can also cause an increase in various noises, such as the sound of construction 
sites, the sound of car horns, the sound of the car engines, or the noise generated by social activities. All of these 
factors contribute to noise pollution. The rapid increase in the number of motor vehicles has caused the noise pollution 
of urban road traffic to become more and more serious. It has gradually become the main pollution source of urban 
environmental noise, and it has also become a difficult point in environmental noise control. 
 
Noise level is a major concern for the population living in urban areas or along major roads. Noise can cause and 
aggravate cardiovascular disease. Also, it could cause some damage to children‚Äôs brains. Children who have been 
exposed to noise for a long time have about 20% lower intellectual development than in a quiet environment (Den 
Boer & Schroten, 2007). Noise affects people's normal life and rest. Residents living on both sides of arterial roads 
can be troubled by traffic noise pollution at any time. The survey data in Den Boer, et al. (2007) shows that long-term 
exposure to a high vibration in a noisy environment can make people irritable, nauseous, causing headaches and 
insomnia. Den Boer, et al. (2007) reported that 70 decibels of noise or higher can affect 50% of people‚Äôs sleep and 
any sudden noise of 60 decibels or higher can also wake people from sleep. 
 
To find out the best methods and solutions to prevent noise pollution, it is necessary to collect the information of cost 
estimates of noise, valuation of damages imposed on health or property values, costs of preventing noise, and 
contingent valuation of willingness to pay to avoid noise. Studies have been done to learn about noise pollution. 
However, these studies have not considered annoyance levels due to traffic. Kim, et al. (2019) conducted a study about

The results mentioned above obtained by the survey in Western New York, as well as the application of the developed 
fuzzy model, the level of social acceptance of certain traffic noise pollution reduction methods (building walls, quieter 
road surface, planting trees, and traffic/transportation restrictions), were calculated and depicted on Table 2.  
 
The results obtained show that the method in the highest level of social acceptance in Western New York is for planting 
trees (61.3%) and after that for quieter road surface (30.7%). The method in the lowest level of social acceptance is 
for traffic/transportation restrictions (22.1%). 
 
4. Conclusion 
This study uses the developed fuzzy model to evaluate the level of social acceptance of certain noise reduction methods 
by two input variables. The study showed that fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic can provide an approach to deal with 
uncertainty in determining social indicators. The level of social acceptance obtained from the fuzzy model indicates 
that people have common knowledge and experience of the function of planting trees to reduce noise and they can 
easily accept this method depending on both effectiveness and cost. For the methods of quieter road surfaces, building 
walls, and traffic/transportation restrictions, some of the respondents are not clear with the actual effectiveness of 
these methods and the high cost. Uncertain effectiveness may make them consider that these methods are not worth 
investing in, which could cause low social acceptance. 
 
Some of the limitations in this study include the small number of respondents and the small age ranges of respondents.

Abstract 
This study focuses on possible factors affecting an electric vehicle (EV) in ‚Äúreal world‚Äù testing. Factors such as wind, 
temperature, and humidity were considered in testing range. A base model 2017 Nissan Leaf EV was modified to 
remove weight through altering wheel rims and car seats. Removing weight from a vehicle has been used in car racing 
for many years to increase vehicle speed. Through past studies focusing on new Teslas (EV), wheel rim structure has 
been found to increase range. Increasing the EV range through the removal of weight was thought to be possible. In 
addition, the Nissan Leaf was recharged while hot air was pumped underneath (for one hour from a clothes dryer) to 
increase battery capacity thereby adding extra kilometers to the range. There was an increase in range through 
recharging after the trial ended that day, it was aided by the hot air. A minimal gain in range was found after the third 
set of trials where weight was removed. Future research should look at pumping hot air underneath the EV (for multiple 
hours) while recharging during cold weather (under 0 C/32 F) to find a solution for reduced range during colder 
months.

1. Introduction 
Electric vehicles (EVs) have become more popular over the past few years because they offer cheap 
maintenance, a low cost to recharge, and financial incentives are often prominent during a purchase. There has been 
an abundance of EVs sold in the USA and Canada since 2018. Tesla leads the way (by far) in electric vehicles sold 
from 2018-2019. However, Chevrolet and Nissan each sold a substantial number of EVs during this time. For the 
years 2018-2019, the Chevrolet Bolt EC sold 34,437 units while Nissan sold 27,080 of its EV called ‚ÄúLeaf‚Äù (Crider, 
2020). 
 
The Nissan Leaf has been around for ten years, its d√©but was in 2010. Battery power has increased in the 
Leaf over the past few years with the original 2010 model using a 24-kWh battery. More recent models including 
2017 use a 30-kWh battery while 2020 includes a 40-kWh. There are two important differences between Tesla 
models and a Nissan Leaf‚Äîprice and range. Glon and Edelstein (2020) found the price of a Tesla 3 at $39,990 
(USD) including a range up to 322 miles. A Leaf is $31,600 (USD) with a range of 150 miles (Glon & Edelstein, 
2020). The more affordable option is the Leaf, one of the reasons why it was chosen to be used in this study. 
 
Expanding battery capacity and efficiency while utilized by an affordable EV continues to be a central focus 
in extending range. Range is a key issue when consumers are determining which EV to purchase. However, more

89","There were many problems that occurred during the process of trying to get readings and values. The 
purchase of the wheel rims via Amazon was problematic because the advertised weight was incorrect and there was 
not enough time for a return and repurchase. A 1.05 kg (2.3 lbs.) ‚Äúactual‚Äù difference in the weight of the steel wheel 
rims versus an advertised difference of 4.27 kg (9.4 lbs.) would have a possibly created more significant results. 
 
There are two important findings within this study (1) A heating source applied to the battery area while 
recharging will help add range, and (2) Increased range is possible with weight reduction in an EV. The increased 
range of 1.02% after removing 24.18 kg (53.2 lbs) was lower than expected. Removing 24.18 kg (53.2 lbs) from a 
car weighing approximately 1503.18 kg (3307 lbs) will only add approximately 1.73 kms (1.08 miles). The 24.18 kg 
(53.2 lbs) removed represents 1.6% of the overall car weight. Removal of 145.08 kg (319.2 lbs.) seems to be the 
least amount of weight reduction for double-digit gains in range. Many of the lower capacity battery EVs would 
benefit from using lighter construction materials to add this double-digit gain. Manufacturers such as Nissan and 
Ford typically use similar seats and wheel rims included in their standard combustion vehicle engine offerings. EVs 
need redeveloping from the ground up to maximize their potential range. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
EVs are now a viable option for traveling short and long distances in North America. Battery capacity is 
improving on a continual basis. However, the construction of the actual EV needs to be rethought to gain additional 
range efficiencies. A five-kilometer addition in range, with minimal design changes, can mean the difference from 
making it to a recharging area or not. Practical heating options for keeping batteries warm during recharging in the 
fall, spring, and winter need to be researched.  
 
Since EVs are a relatively new area of study, there are many opportunities for future research in the ‚Äúreal 
world.‚Äù More trials need to be conducted over a longer time to get improved results. Future research should focus on 
adding a heating source under the car while recharging for all 4.5 hours (using a Level 2 charger) to extend range in 
the winter. Research using used EVs with altered wheel rims, including an ‚Äúaero style‚Äù, like some Teslas use, should 
be tried and tested to see if added range is gained. Different materials that remove weight from an EV need to be 
tested so range can be extended without additional battery upgrades. EVs are different than ICE vehicles and their 
design materials need to be updated.

Abstract 
Older generation robot-based production lines necessitate the adaptation to Industry 4.0 standards for smart 
manufacturing within the factory. Combining assisted reality technology with industrial internet of things (IIoT) 
networking systems into a robotic manufacturing cell enables communication of critical data to any individual, 
independently of the human‚Äôs state.  Through assisted reality, the human is unencumbered by a tablet, laptop, or 
Human-Machine Interface and free to navigate other tasks, while passively monitoring the progress of the production 
cell. This paper presents the integration of assisted reality and IIoT into an older generation robotic cell. The robustness 
of the IIoT application is validated through the integration of a diversified range of devices. These devices include an 
older generation industrial robot, a modern programmable logic controller, a Raspberry Pi embedded system, a series 
of external digital devices, an industrial analog weight sensor and a custom designed low-cost analog opacity sensor. 
A system was developed to prove the feasibility of modernizing an older generation robotic cell without altering its 
technology. The system was tested under multiple conditions, involving data passing through the IIoT, and was found 
to be reliable in reporting statistics and adapting to user input for 1 hour or 50 cycles.

1. Introduction 
As the manufacturing industry progresses further through the fourth industrial revolution, the need to create 
networks of manufacturing information to assist data-driven decision-making becomes ever more critical 
(Neugebauer, Hippmann, Leis, & Landherr, 2016). In addition, a separate but parallel goal of creating manufacturing 
data collection networks, is the ability to access production information from anywhere in the world, at any given time 
(Monostori, 2014).  Both of these Industry 4.0 objectives, collecting information at every stage of a manufacturing 
process and making that information available anytime, anywhere, can be addressed by the use of IIoT.   
The IIoT is a cloud-based data storage and sharing network, accessible via the use of many industry-standard 
brands‚Äô technological platforms, such as the Siemens MindSphere system (Tao & Zhang, 2017) and PTC‚Äôs 
ThingWorx.  By adding IIoT hardware in automated machines, companies can create vast information networks, 
displaying the state of every cell within the factory, in real time (Wan, et al., 2016).  Then, the IIoT data network can 
be accessed by any compatible devices such as tablets, laptops, personal computers (PCs), or even assisted reality 
(AR) glasses (Knell, 2019).  The use of AR glasses, in particular, adds another dimension to this industry 4.0 
application and will be further detailed in this paper. 
The fourth industrial revolution and the ever-expanding network of information that is the Internet of Things 
(IoT) are discussed by (Neugebauer, Hippmann, Leis, & Landherr, 2016). (Monostori, 2014) covers the advantages 
of remote operation, utilizing the IIoT, from a production perspective.  The details of how industry 4.0 is affecting

102","This IIoT demonstration process was tested by running the robot for 50 cycles in a row.  During the execution 
of this test, the system functioned as intended.  The robot manipulated and sorted the cubes based on the attributes of 
weight and opacity, but most importantly, the data was put in the cloud and it was viewable in real time through the 
AR glasses.  
4.3 Findings 
In completing this project, it was found that a combination of either Siemens or PTC IoT packages, an Allen-
Bradley PLC, and a Raspberry Pi could be used to communicate information from an older generation robotic cell to 
any operator over the IIoT in real time. Furthermore, it was found that the same technology can be adapted to enable 
any personnel to communicate information to an older generation robotic cell over the IIoT in real time. The system 
functioned reliably for endurance tests of 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 50 cycles.  During these tests all data and statistics 
were collected by the Siemens MindSphere package.  Statistics from the 30-minute test is displayed in Figure 12 and 
Figure 13. 
 
5. Conclusion 
IIoT was integrated with standard industrial sensors, custom designed sensors, an older generation robot, a 
modern PLC, and a pair of AR glasses. Production data was successfully accessed and displayed to a human, without 
the need for a traditional HMI setup.  In addition, simple two-way human-robot non-contact interaction was achieved 
through AR. These outcomes show promise for using Siemens MindSphere and Vuzix AR glasses together on large-
scale industrial operations.  The proof of concept presented in this paper validates the opportunity for companies to 
join Industry 4.0, independent of the type of data, technology, and age of the system. 
In addition, this paper proves that an old system can be updated to reap the advantages of IIoT information 
networks.  The project team was tasked with using a robot that was designed and manufactured before the standard 
integration of IoT in industrial settings, and through research proved the feasibility and merit of upgrading a dated 
robot to the age of Industry 4.0.   
By integrating IIoT-compatible devices at every step of the manufacturing process, companies can collect 
massive amounts of data both instantaneously and autonomously, creating a network of information that can then be 
data-mined to assist in making specific decisions.  These decisions can range from immediate manufacturing 
maintenance adjustments such as rerouting production lines to exclude a broken machine, to very long-term 
investment strategy moves based on overall efficiency of production lines.

Abstract 
 
As Electric Vehicles (EVs) become more widely adopted by consumers, their use in emergency evacuation situations 
becomes a more relevant challenge. Short-notice evacuations, such as those caused by wildfires and earthquakes, may 
lead to stall-outs, resulting in increased traffic and accidents. To avoid this, EV charging stations need to be located 
far enough away from emergency sites but within the range of an average charge to prevent stall-outs. California is 
the state that has the largest number of EVs and the largest number of wildfires annually. The objective of this study 
is to analyze the state of California‚Äôs current EV charging capacity in emergency situations by applying existing 
methodology while focusing on a new aspect.

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background 
One of the drawbacks of EVs is that they generally have a smaller driving range than a gas-powered car. Most electric 
vehicles have a range between 100-200 miles, which is at least 100 miles less than the average gas-powered car. In 
addition, recharging to full capacity can take anywhere from 3 to 12 hours, with ‚Äúfast charges‚Äù to 80% still taking at 
least 30 minutes (fueleconomy.gov). This can create serious problems in evacuations because of the large disparity 
between refueling a gas-powered car and recharging an EV. Stalled EVs will create huge traveling delays for the 
people using them and even increased traffic if a stalled EV is blocking a lane. 
 
In 2019, EVs made up 1.9% of the United States vehicle market share, with the largest concentration of EVs located 
in the state of California (energy.gov, 2019). With EVs making up such a small percentage of the current vehicle 
market, the problem of publicly available charging stations does not affect a significant percentage of the population. 
However, in 2020, Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, issued an executive order that requires all new cars 
sold in the state to be EVs by 2035 (Newsom, 2020). If this executive order continues to be upheld by successive 
California governors, within the next 30 years, EVs will see a significant increase in market share, presenting a 
problem for charging station capacity. Governor Newsom‚Äôs executive order contains no mandates about the 
installation of publicly available charging stations. 
 
California‚Äôs two main natural disasters are earthquakes and wildfires. Both are short-notice events that have the 
potential to knock out the power grid with no warning, making it especially difficult, if not impossible, to charge a 
Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV). Over 2 million properties in California are at extreme risk from wildfires, making up 
about half of all properties at extreme risk from wildfires (Verisk, 2020). Additionally, the occurrence of wildfires 
has increased greatly in recent years, with 2020 seeing 5 out of the 6 largest California wildfires ever (McGough, 
2020). This has continued to be proven true in 2021, with the Dixie fire becoming the largest single fire, and the 
second-largest fire ever in California‚Äôs history, spreading through four counties, two national forests, and a national 
park and destroying over 1,000 buildings (AP, 2021). Wildfire evacuation will become a bigger problem with a wider 
spread adoption of EVs if the power grid is not at full capacity.

116","to donate to the government to encourage the use of EVs. Second, it was assumed in this model that all publicly 
available charging stations would have a similar amount of traffic, and there would not be a few stations in much 
higher demand than all others because of the lack of information about the highest concentrations of EVs within a 
given area. This information would be able to identify the publicly available charging stations likely to experience a 
bottleneck and the ones that are being underutilized. 
 
Additionally, the population growth patterns of Santa Rosa and California, in general, could be considered within the 
model. According to the California Department of Finance, the population of California is declining for the first time 
in a century (Hubler, 2021). A continued decline in the population could affect the results of the model when that data 
becomes available.  
 
6. Conclusion 
As expected, more publicly available charging stations need to be added in any scenario. What was surprising what 
that no level 3 chargers would need to be added to accommodate the evacuation of 40% of EVs in the city. This leads 
to the assumption that if less than 40% of the population of Santa Rosa needed to evacuate from a fire in 2035, the 
current level of publicly available charging stations would most likely be sufficient to support all residents safely 
evacuating, indicating that Santa Rosa is already in a good position to support electric vehicle evacuations.  
 
Although the initial objective of this model was to determine the minimum number of charging stations that would 
need to be added to safely evacuate all EVs, it was found that to get the minimum number, they would need to all be 
level 3 charging stations. Level 3 charging stations are much more expensive than level 2 charging stations and put a 
greater burden on the electric grid, which is not a good thing in evacuation scenarios. Instead, an even balance of 
Level 2 and Level 3 chargers was found to help alleviate this issue. 
 
Once the optimal number of publicly available charging stations has been identified, the next step is to identify where 
these new charging stations should be located. By looking at traffic patterns, proximity to neighborhoods and freeways, 
and the locations of currently existing charging stations, a simulation could be developed to find the optimal placement 
for the new charging stations. Additionally, further study into the everyday needs of publicly available charging 
stations in California under Governor Newsom‚Äôs executive order could be investigated as well.

Abstract 
 
This work shows the design process for the construction of a reciprocating sliding tribometer used for the tribological 
study of materials, coatings and lubricants. In the development of the final design, a methodology is shown 
that includes an analysis of the client's needs, a state of the art of the already existing tribometers, a stage of 
conceptual designs, evaluation of the conceptual designs and then to arrive at a detailed engineering and 
manufacturing that resulted in the design of a functional tribometer and up to 14 times cheaper than those 
that exist in the market. This tribometer has commercial parts, some from custom design and is manufactured 
with conventional manufacturing processes. The design methodology used allows optimizing resources and 
maximizing results, all of the above in just 16 weeks.

1. Introduction 
Tribology is the study of lubrication, friction, and wear between surfaces in relative motion (Shewan et al. 2020). It is 
an interdisciplinary area, as it is linked with materials, chemistry, physics and biology (Yan 2010). Since the beginning 
of the twentieth century, knowledge in all areas of tribology has expanded tremendously, due to enormous industrial 
growth, which led to the demand for an improved understanding of tribology (Affatato and Grillini 2013). 
Wear is a measure of progressive material loss as a result of relative motion between the operating surfaces in contact. 
In the industrial sector, wear is a massive problem and its direct cost is estimated to vary between 1 and 4% of the net 
gross national product (Mahadikar et al. 2020). 
In the modern era, research has been done with the purpose of developing techniques for wear reduction of tools and 
to increase its lifetime. Currently, the devices used to study the tribological properties of materials are the tribometers. 
However, the design and the selection of this machine is crucial. 
A carefully selected tribometer can simulate all the critical characteristics of a wear or friction problem without the 
difficulties associated with the experimentation on actual equipment. Conversely, a poorly designed or selected 
tribometer can provide entirely false results (Stachowiak et al. 2004).  
There are several common bench tests existing for friction and wear measurements, that are pin-on-disc, block-on-
ring, linear reciprocating, and four balls which are classified based on test geometry, type of contact, contact geometry, 
and relative motion (Tiruvenkadam et al. 2013).

As shown in table 6, the target price was raised by 12%, due to the elevated prices of some parts at McMaster in 
comparison to local suppliers, thus, in order to reduce the cost, it would be convenient to look in these businesses.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In this project, a tribotester was designed, in order to replicate the reciprocating movement of different industry 
applications, as well as, predict the materials performance in constant friction situations. In addition, due to the design

will be selected for the application. 
 
On the other hand, one of the challenges presented during the development of this project was the remote design of 
the tribotester, because a good communication between the team members and a good work distribution was necessary. 
Moreover, another challenge presented was the necessity of doing multiple changes in the design of the tribometer in 
accordance with the evolution of the project. 
 
Furthermore, the opportunity to develop different knowledge areas of the Mechanical Engineering program was given, 
the main area was mechanical design, where the NX Software was used, for the CAD, drawings and motion simulation. 
Also, the manufacturing processes and the material selection were approached. Additionally, on the administrative 
side, the most adequate parts were searched and a cost analysis was carried out.  
 
Finally, during the development of the project, we realized that a crucial part was the weekly control of activities, 
since it allowed us to distribute the workload. In addition, we were able to observe the evolution of the project week 
by week. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, we lost the opportunity to build the machine. So, the next possible step 
is to build the tribometer and start doing experiments.

Abstract  
 
We successfully evaluated the accuracy of full-body dynamic simulation with the use of TSB within JACK Siemens 
PLM software via analyzing the common lifting and carrying tasks. The deviation of joint angles between the real and 
predicted human movement directly resulted in the significant difference of lumbar forces imposed on participants. 
These joint deviations were provided as references for ergonomists and engineers to manually manipulate the joints 
on digital human models to achieve accurate dynamic simulation. In this study, we also revealed the effect of muscle 
strength between genders on the motion of shoulders, and the effect of different loads on the adoption of postures. To 
lower the workers‚Äô injury rates, software manufacturers have to continue their efforts to improve products for robust 
ergonomics analysis.

1. Introduction  
According to the United States Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics (2019), over 900,000 reported cases caused worker 
absence from work in each year. Nearly 37% cases were direct cause of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). To reduce 
injuries and high medical costs, companies have to improve their workplace safety via analyzing operations and 
implementing training. Currently, digital human model (DHM) technology has been prevalently implemented in 
diverse workplaces to prevent MSDs (Baskaran et al. 2019; Fletcher et al. 2018; Quintero-Duran and Paul 2018). 
Daily activities within a virtual environment could be easily analyzed by modifying DHM anthropometrics and 
external applied forces (Maurya et al. 2019). 
 
To obtain the robust ergonomics outcomes, the predicted DHM postures in simulation have to be accurate. One 
previous study (Chaffin 2005) indicated that the small deviation of joint angle in DHM manipulation could cause 
significant difference in the exposed forces. However, there is a lack of studies focusing on the evaluation of DHM 
postures. Although two studies (Kajaks et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2008) have investigated the posture evaluation via 
using JACK Siemens PLM software, their conclusions are conflict. The first reason could be the DHM created in the 
study of Kajaks et al. (2011), which cannot accurately represent the anthropometrics of real workers. The second 
reason could be the limited analysis in the study of Zhao et al. (2008), the joints and postures were not enough for 
assessment. There was another study (Park et al. 2011), which also indicated the significant discrepancy between the 
predicted and measured postures via using RAMSIS software (HUMANSOLUTION). Although these studies 
provided a good start for posture evaluation, they were only limited in the upper body joints and static poses.  
 
Considering the exposed lumbar forces which are directly affected by the cross-correlation among anatomical joints 
and external applied loads, it is essential to have full-body dynamic simulation for ergonomics analysis. It will help 
end-users effectively identify all awkward postures which may cause MSDs during the entire task performance. 
However, there is no study to assess the accuracy of DHM kinematic data in dynamic simulation. Only two studies 
(Turk et al. 2020; Fritzsche 2010) with a focus on dynamic simulation, but they are in the analysis of simulation time. 
JACK Siemens PLM has been used as the advanced human-centered ergonomic tool for product design and injury 
risk assessment (Qi and Chen 2020; Naddeo et al. 2017). It has the unique compatible feature to efficiently create

136","given the load that was only 5kg, the posture for evaluation was selected in the middle phase as the participants walked 
with the right foot in a stance phase, and the left foot in a swing phase. 
 
For Task 1, the maximum Compressive forces occurred as the participants at the low squatting pose (pose#1) in the 
Lifting phase, and at the pose in the Placing phase with the maximum shoulder flexion (pose#2). Except the 
Sh_R_Abd/Add at pose#1, all other joints were significantly different between the Real_HM and Predicted_HM. In 
reality, the participants preferred to extend their elbows to lift the load from the floor with an average extension of 
2.5¬∞ ((4.5¬∞+0.5¬∞)/2), and to place the load onto the table with an average flexion of -3.5¬∞ ((-8.5¬∞+1.4¬∞)/2). However, 
the corresponding predicted elbow movement in TSB dynamic simulation had great flexion with the average values 
of -43.4¬∞ ((-44.6¬∞-42.2¬∞)/2) and -15.7¬∞ ((-18.9¬∞-12.6¬∞)/2) at two poses. Given the large elbow flexion, it resulted in the 
other joints, such as the knees, trunk, hips and shoulders, having corresponding great flexion to achieve the task 
performance in the Predicted_HM. Considering the average body heights between genders (M: 180.6cm; F: 165.7cm), 
the participants with short body height may need great shoulder flexion to place the load onto the table. Moreover, 
one previous study (Clarke et al. 1975) reported that the females had more range of motion in abduction. All of these 
may explain why in our study the females had greater shoulder flexion and abduction than the males at pose#2. 
However, in TSB at the same pose, the predicted Sh_R_Abd/Add was adduction. Given the complexity of shoulders, 
more considerations should be involved for the improvement of posture prediction algorithm in simulation. 
 
In the comparison between genders, the female participants had greater Hip_R_F/E and less Trunk_F/E than the male 
participants in the Real_HM. It seems that there was an inverse correlation between the trunk and hips. The study 
(Hogg et al. 2018) indicated that the hip‚Äôs range of motion was greater in the females than males. It may explain the 
phenomenon in our study that the female participants preferred to flex their hips and extend trunks, but the male 
participants preferred to flex their trunks to lift and place objects. However, in the Predicted_HM, the male manikins 
had greater hip flexion than the females. It seems that the hip flexion of DHM in TSB dynamic simulation was just 
proportional to the body height. Although there was no significant difference for the Hip_R_F/E and Trunk_F/E 
between genders, their exposed lumbar forces were significantly different. It affirms the conclusion that a small 
deviation of joint manipulation can result in a large impact on the forces (Chaffin 2005). In our study, the average 
maximum Compressive forces of males were less than the safety standard 3400N as they lifted a 5kg load, but nearly 
all males were exposed to the peak A/P Shear force greater than 700N (Waters et al. 1993). The National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH] has provided the maximum lifting weight at 50 pounds (approximate 
22.7kg). Any deviation of joint manipulation in TSB dynamic simulation may cause the inaccurate assessment of 
injury risk during workers‚Äô daily activities. 
 
For Task 2 as the participants carried a load forward, although nearly all joints (except the Elbow_R_F/E) had 
significant difference between the Predicted_HM and Real_HM, the deviation of Hip_F/E (approximate 17¬∞) could 
be the primary factor, which resulted in the statistical difference of lumbar forces. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the 
participants extended their shoulders to keep the load close to their bodies in the Real_HM. However, in the TSB 
Predicted_HM, the shoulder‚Äôs movement of DHM was flexion. Also, as the load was increased from 5kg to 10kg, 
there was no change of the predicted full-body postures in TSB. However, in reality, the shoulders and trunk should 
be extended more to maintain body balance as the load increased. This hypothesis could be verified by the study 
(Attwells et al. 2006). It indicated that the trunk significantly flexed forward as the load of backpack increased. 
Besides, in our study the females had greater shoulder extension and elbow flexion than the males in the Real_HM. If 
considering the difference of muscle strength between genders (Stoll et al. 2000), their performances should not be 
identical in the Predicted_HM. These limitations in TSB will cause the inaccurate evaluation on the muscle fatigue 
and joint strength capability.  
 
5. Conclusion 
We successfully evaluated the accuracy of full-body dynamic simulation with the use of TSB within JACK Siemens 
PLM software via analyzing the common lifting and carrying tasks. In this study, nearly all joints were significantly 
different in the Predicted_HM as compared with the Real_HM. These joint deviations directly resulted in the 
significant difference of lumbar forces imposed on participants. Although our results greatly help ergonomists and 
engineers fully understand the deviation of DHM predicted postures in dynamic simulation compared with the actual 
human movement, the long-term goal for human dynamic simulation requires the minimum manually joint 
manipulation on DHM. Particularly, in the scenario of not recording the real human performance, the software still 
can achieve accurate posture prediction. Accordingly, the software manufacturers have to continue their efforts to

comprehensive study will follow up to assess the impact of different loads on postures. Also, more tasks (e.g., pushing 
and pulling) will be involved for end-users to fully understand the accuracy of predicted postures in TSB.

Abstract 
Surface texturing is a process that enhances the tribological properties of different materials. This topic has been 
widely studied because it is a tool that saves resources such as materials, money, and time. To obtain the most 
useful set of parameters to get the smallest Coefficient of Friction (COF), several simulations in the program 
COMSOL were made, varying depth, width, texture density and oil film thickness. Design of experiments with 
the methodology of Box Behnken was applied through Minitab to reduce the number of simulations that had to be 
performed (from 81 to 27 runs), and to identify the most significant parameter that provided a lower COF. Minitab 
showed that every input parameter (oil film thickness, width, depth, % textured area) has an important role for 
reducing COF, being the most important the lubricant film thickness. The results showed us improvements 
depending on the lubrication regime ranging from 60% and 95% where the greatest decreases in COF were 
observed in boundary lubrication conditions. This demonstrates the importance of texturing for reducing the COF 
in Tribological tests and the potential it has for manufacturing processes, as well as the use of simulation programs 
to help reduce the consumption of laboratory resources. A design guide was made including Minitab and 
COMSOL for different manufacturing processes considering boundary, mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication.

1. Introduction 
The surface texturing is a very effective technique used to improve tribological properties of mechanical 
components where micro/nano cavities are created on a pattern such as circles, channels, S-shape, chevron, 
crosshatch, etc. The result of this process is a significant improvement in load capacity, wear resistance, COF, and 
the useful life of tribological mechanical components (Chen, 2018) (Etsion, 2005). There are different types of

145","We can see evidence of this in the study by Maldonado, D (Maldonado, 2021) where 1 MPa is hydrodynamic, 2.5 
mixed and at very high pressures it becomes boundary, where, as we can see, the lines are the best results, this 
because they are open geometries, and this makes them contain more lubricant and less burr. It should be noted 
that our COF is very low since there is no roughness, we tried to add it, but we realized that it was not feasible 
since it did not have a significant change in the comparison between the plane and the texturing since the whole 
study was carried out without roughness, this means that there will be no difference in the results compared to 
other studies (Maldonado, 2021).  
 
3.4 Design Guide 
A design guide was obtained which relates the COF vs. the film thicknesses and the possible manufacturing 
processes using Comsol and the optimization obtained in Minitab. Some processes found in the literature such as 
that of Recklin V. and Akt√ºrk, D. and it was found that for forming processes such as die cutting, punching and 
bending, the thicknesses tend to be thin. If you have Metal Forming, the recommended thing to have a good COF 
would be to have a density between 20% to 30% with a width of 20 Microns and a depth between 40 to 70 Microns 
(Recklin, 2018) (Akt√ºrk, 2015). 
 
 
Figure 9. Graph Non-textured vs. Textured, the design guide is obtained based on the Design of Experiments 
data from MINITAB and COMSOL. 
 
These recommendations come from studies and literature, which tells us that a boundary lubrication regime 
requires a lot of texturing since the lubrication film thickness is very low and a higher percentage is occupied in 
the geometries so that more lubricant is retained. For machining with high speeds, thicker thicknesses are needed 
since there is no need to texturize as much, with 20% texturing and with a width of 20 Microns a lower COF can 
be obtained, in addition, it is cheaper, and it uses less laser (Aldana, 2014). 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this project we carried out a simulation of the tribological test T-05 through COMSOL (Thin-Film Flow), then 
we carried out a Design of Experiments (Box Bhenken) that later we analyzed statistically by Minitab, both were

established parameters are significant, however the lubricant film thickness is the most statistically significant 
parameter, also through Minitab results showed a second order equation, to obtain an expected value of the COF 
where our ùëÖùëÖ2gave us a value of 80.41%, which tells us that it is a reliable model. As shown in Figure 8, the 
graph of the nontextured versus the textured, shows an improvement in percentage of approximately 60 to 95%, 
where in the boundary lubrication regime it was approximately 90%, in the mixed lubrication it was between 85 
to 95%, and in hydrodynamic it was between 60 to 80%. A design guide shown in Figure 9 was made, in which 
the optimized parameters were obtained according to the lubrication regime and the manufacturing process. Our 
recommendation would be to carry out these same tests in the laboratory to validate what was obtained in our 
simulations and in our Design of Experiments, our study could also be implemented for different geometries 
searching to improve the COF.

Abstract 
 
This research aims to identify the Facilities Management diffusion model in an emerging market taking Sri Lanka as 
a case. The purpose was to identify its diffusion model with special features that can advance the Diffusion of 
Innovation (DOI) theory. The research took a pragmatist paradigm and was conducted through a mixed-method 
approach. It took a quantitative approach from a positivist point of view for a deductive theoretical approach to finding 
the nature of FM diffusion in Sri Lanka based on current innovation diffusion theories. A qualitative approach was 
used in parallel for a deeper understanding of the unique context being studied. Facilities Management is being adopted 
in Sri Lanka in its generic definition with minimum re-invention. A higher education institute has played the role of 
principal change agent while being an education innovator. Theoretical change agents have had an insignificant role. 
Several unique features had contributed to diffusion efficiency. The diffusion model can be employed by both higher 
education institutes and authorities to introduce new professions or practices to a new market effectively. The study 
concludes with a unique innovation diffusion model that has shown its success. It shows how a higher education 
institute plays a key change agent role in the diffusion of a new professional. A similar innovation model has not 
previously been reported.

1. Introduction 
International Facilities Management Association (IFMA) introduces ‚ÄúFacilities Management (FM) as a profession 
that encompasses multiple disciplines to ensure functionality, comfort, safety, and efficiency of the built environment 
by integrating people, place, process, and technology‚Äù (IFMA 2019). The International Organisation for 
Standardisation (ISO)complements this definition by identifying FM as the ‚Äúorganisational function which integrates 
people, place, and process within the built environment to improve the quality of life of people and the productivity 
of the core business‚Äù (ISO 2017). The term FM originated from the field experience during the late 1960s (Natukunda 
et al. 2013). FM discipline emerged in the United State of America (USA) in 1975 (Maas and Pleunis 2001). Maximum 
growth occurred in the 1980s in the USA and FM started to spread throughout the world (Linda and Chris 2011). It 
has evolved as a new industry from the property and construction sector in the latter part of the 1980s and early part 
of the 1990s (Varcoe 2000). Tracing its development trajectory, Meng (2015) notes that FM has undergone rapid 
development and became the fastest developing industry in the United Kingdom (UK). Moreover, Wood (2012) 
observes the rise of FM around 35 years ago from a European viewpoint  
FM can promote solutions for social challenges such as adaptation to climate changes, optimum energy usage, green 
concept, and sustainability and also create positive influences in the organisations and society (Galamba 2016). 
Moreover, the role of FM is looked for in the pre-disaster risk reduction phase due to the flexibility it carries to

157","Figure 3: -The gap between came to know about FM and FM initiated in their organisations 
 
Next on the list were Sri Lanka firms and professionals with a 19% portion. These firms can be competitive firms of 
the organisations or friendly/neighbouring organisations. By observing FM adoption at these firms and/or through 
communications from related professionals, other organisations have got to know about FM, especially the benefits 
and challenges of such adoptions. In addition to that, nearly 47% of respondents had already recommended FM to 
other organisations to adopt FM. This is evidence that early adopters play the role of opinion leaders at the current 
FM diffusion network in Sri Lanka. Surprisingly, FM outsourcing firms have had a less significant role with only 8% 
overall influence to promote FM. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Innovation diffusion studies are about how new ideas spread in communities or markets. FM is relatively new to Sri 
Lanka and not many organisations have adopted it. This makes it an ideal innovation to understand the diffusion 
model and its special features at the early stage of its diffusion. A study with a mixed-method research design was 
conducted with an online questionnaire among practicing top management of Facilities Managers in Sri Lanka. 
 
The study showed that FM in Sri Lanka is in its Early Adopter phase and has already started to diffuse in Sri Lanka 
but still at a slow rate. Feedback of current adopters was positive, and a majority of early adopters will embrace FM 
with ease creating momentum for sustainable adoption. Re-invention of FM as innovation will be minimum, a large 
majority will adopt FM in its current definition. Engagement of FM in its full scope is emerging, involvement during 
all stages of buildings from design to demolition is observed. All main functions of FM are performed, though at 
varying degrees. No standardisation was identified in the innovation packaging of FM delivery, and Facilities 
Managers are supposed to have all-round competencies. The University of Moratuwa has offered both awareness 
and trialability of FM and has played the role of principal change agent while been an education innovator.  
 
Interestingly, theoretical change agents have had an insignificant role in FM diffusion in Sri Lanka. 
The study concludes with a unique innovation diffusion model that has shown its success. It is a case that a higher 
education institute playing a key change agent role in the diffusion of a new professional. The inherent characteristic 
of a profession-oriented study programme that requires student interaction with the industry creates initial 
awareness, and industry internships offer trialability of innovation. Challenge for the graduate to find employment 
further disseminates awareness. Theorized competencies offered in the profession-oriented degree make relatively 
homogeneous adoption of the new profession with minimum re-invention at early stages that minimises the chances 
of failure. While the model is in line with current innovation diffusion theories, it presents a unique model for the

professions.  
 
Key limitations to the application of this conclusion arise from the study context. National universities, including the 
University of Moratuwa, offer higher education for free. Entry is based on academic merits at Advance Level exams 
and is highly competitive. Demand for a new degree programme could vary when self-funded. Further to this, the 
methodology adopted does not offer an in-depth analysis of the diffusion network. A deeper understanding could 
offer higher customisation for the future adoption of the diffusion model.

Abstract 
 
This research study proposes a new alternative for monitoring and managing maintenance work in neonatal respiratory 
equipment at the Edgardo Rebagliati Martins General Hospital, a general health facility in Lima, Peru. This proposal 
is based on a Mobile Vision Optical Character Recognition (OCR) algorithm, which identifies the numerical code of 
each device in the field through an Android mobile application. This information is then processed using a Weibull 
model to determine equipment failure probabilities. Based on the mean times between failures collected from history 
information, the system calculates the current failure probabilities for each device. These probabilities are recalculated 
every time the equipment is scanned. This paper describes the variables used, obtaining an 88% accuracy when using 
the OCR system, thus identifying preventive maintenance needs from device information. 
 
Keywords  
Optical Character Recognition, Weibull Distribution, and Neonatology and Maintenance Information Management. 
 
1. Introduction 
The large number and variety of hospital equipment devices, such as the one this paper focuses on, requires constant 
innovation in information management processes to secure their preventive maintenance. The success of 
maintenance management is based on the time, cost, and income numbers obtained, which, in turn, are directly 
linked to the work environment structure in terms of the materials used, workflows established, work methodology 
guidelines proposed, and their work teams (Ben√≠tez et al. 2018). Hence, within the hospital complex assessed, each 
neonatal device is associated to intrinsic alphanumeric information, such as a unique ID code, its location, its 
technical installation sheet, its purchase information, and its current status. 
 
For this study, an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) model with a number of classification techniques has been 
used to recognize the numerical codes from neonatal equipment through an Android application. OCR technology 
has proven helpful when digitizing documents or extracting information from images. For example, this technology 
prevents users from having to type texts, thus not only releasing them from tedious work, but also reducing typing 
errors, among others.  
 
OCR-based applications capable of detecting and interpreting text information from images using Android mobile 
devices require to prevent operation issues (Jim√©nez, 2018). For this project, Android version 4.0.3 was used 
featuring an appropriate functionality on a daily use. On the other hand, to guarantee proper processing, only 
neonatal equipment placed in well-lit environments, with a minimum of 100 lux, were considered in scope.

167","5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The application was shared with the Maintenance Team at the Hospital for final approval. We received feedback on 
how to strengthen the application by adding new functionalities such as a graphic dashboard with equipment 
operation indicators. 
 
5.4 Validation  
The system recognized the numerical and alphabetical values that were displayed in the label. However, since the 
objective was to capture only the numerical values from the equipment code, we had to change the OCR detection 
parameter configuration. The application had issues reading codes in spaces lighted at less than 100 lux. Therefore, 
the lighting fixtures had to be changed in areas where the neonatal ventilation equipment operated. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Among our conclusions, we can mention that this study focused on improving the maintenance management of 
neonatal equipment using an OCR algorithm to capture the numerical codes associated to each device, thus automating 
the existing manual process that hindered adequate equipment monitoring. The OCR recognition algorithm was 88% 
effective in identifying the numerical codes printed or written on device labels, detailing device information, and 
calculating their failure probability to anticipate possible maintenance actions.  
As part of the research study, information was collected from six machines, identifying premature failures in all of 
them. This evidences the usefulness of the Weibull model to represent lifespan expectancies for neonatal ventilators. 
This behavior can then help take action with other ventilation equipment. To reduce initial failure risks for these 
machines, device information must be recorded as they are commissioned, and their failure probabilities must be 
compared against the values accepted by the people in charge of the maintenance management process. For the 
equipment assessed, this value was set at 90%.  
Future lines of research must be related to using remote operation sensors to monitor device operation indicators to 
create an indicator dashboard.

Abstract 
 
Sacha Inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) is a crop with great agro-industrial potential since it contains omega 3, 6, 9 and a 
high value in unsaturated fatty acids, so it can be used to transform it into different products with high nutritional 
content; In the present work, a bibliographic review was carried out in countries such as Peru, Ecuador and Colombia 
where the information on the production of the crop was determined in kilogram per hectare for the first 5 years, the 
data were taken from existing documents and interviews carried out in Colombia to companies that work with Sacha 
Inchi, in order to know the productive behavior and the yield capacity of the crop. It was obtained that the production 
of sacha Inchi seed at the international level presents a grouped deviation of 718,31 kilos with an R2 of 64,94% and 
an average of 2.541 kilos for year 3 of production, in the same way and through the national review made it possible 
to show a deviation of the data for each period of time from 490 to 1.001 kilos and a grouped deviation of 638,65 kilos 
with an R2 of 65,39% and an average of 3.411 kilos for year 3 of production.

1. Introduction 
The Sacha Inchi seed is a non-traditional crop, originally from the Peruvian, Colombian and Ecuadorian Amazon and 
that has been cultivated by their indigenous communities for centuries (Palacio, 2018), being used as a source of food, 
whose nutritional contribution according to The study ""Compositional analysis of the cake and oil of seeds of sacha 
inchi (plukenetia volubilis) cultivated in Colombia"" presents a proximal composition with a crude fiber content 4,79 
¬± 0,02%, fat 4,84 ¬± 0,02% and protein 51,23 ¬± 0,10%. The protein fraction presented a content of total essential amino 
acids (TEAA) 45,3% and total amino acids (TAA) 99,3%. (Z. Adriana and H. Ordo√±ez, 2020). 
 
At present, the planting of Sacha Inchi has played a fundamental role in the substitution of illicit crops, as it presents 
a high potential for commercialization in national and international markets given the nutritional benefits, especially 
those from the oil extract. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Colombia, the area 
planted with this plant in the national territory has increased by 300% during the last three years, going from 111 
hectares in 2015 to 463 in 2017. 
  
Due to the above, the interest arises in knowing how the productivity of the plant grows to measure during the first 5 
years of life, and thus understand the minimum resources necessary for an adequate exploitation of the crop, the 
planning of the resources and the commercialization of the same. In this way, it is expected to demonstrate the impact

In the national information (figure 6) there are 54 data of total kilos per hectare from year 1 to year 5, a greater R2 
adjustment compared to international and departmental data of 65,39% and a lower accumulated standard deviation 
of 638,65 kilogram. 
 
6. Conclusion 
‚Ä¢ 
Through the international review it was possible to determine the behavior per hectare that the crop presents from 
the beginning of its productive stage at 8 months and up to 10 years, which start with 50 kg per tree up to 800 kg 
per tree planted per year. 
‚Ä¢ 
It was also possible to establish a relationship of 1 to 3 in terms of the amount of oil extracted per kilo of seed, it 
should be taken into account that the above depends on the extraction method and quality of the seed. 
‚Ä¢ 
Through the international review it was possible to show a deviation of the data for each period of time from 496 
to 914 kilos and a grouped deviation of 718,31 kilos with an R2 of 64,94%. 
‚Ä¢ 
Through the national review it was possible to show a deviation of the data for each period of time from 490 to 
1.001 kilos and a grouped deviation of 638,65 kilos with an R2 of 65,39%. 
‚Ä¢ 
The information in the department of Cauca is scarce and does not allow a quantitative analysis to be carried out 
and correlate the behavior of productivity vs. the number of hectares vs. the cultivation time. 
‚Ä¢ 
According to the estimation of the mathematical model and the productivity forecast, a potential harvest of 29 
tons of seed per year is estimated from the third year and for the rest of the useful life of the plant.

Abstract 
 
The result of this research changed the traditional annealing heat treatment to a continuous annealing heat 
treatment process in a copper wire drawn machine with benefits in efficiency, quality, WIP and energy 
consumption. Increasing temperatures above 500¬∫C in the segment of the annealing process in a copper wire drawn 
machine by keeping elongation results matching the technical specifications using statistical analysis tools and 
comparing the relationship between the values and behavior of the copper stretched with pulleys during the 
continuous annealing process in a copper wire drawn machine. These changes reduced at least forty-eight hours 
from the original process by avoiding the traditional annealing heat treatment. Applying the factorial analysis 
method reduced the number of significant factors that represents the relationship of the independent variables as 
well as a multiple regression analysis were identified establishing the parameters to operate a continuous annealing 
process. More than 3,000 observations were computed, the study significantly identifies two important 
components whose initial eigenvalues are greater than 1 and together reach a cumulative intercorrelation of 
90.686%. The KMO index indicates a high correlation of 0.718 and Bartlett's sphericity with a significance value 
of 0.000 and rotation method VARIMAX with normalization KAISE the second factor is most highly correlated 
with electric charge and elongation.

1. Introduction 
This research is part of the improvements made in the operational processes carried out in the company Cables y 
Pl√°sticos S.A. de C.V. (CYPSA) which manufactures low voltage cables, outlets, harnesses, and electrical 
extensions. The cable consists of several stranded copper wires and a plastic cover around them. In CYPSA the 
manufacture of the caliber 30 AWG represents 95% of the total production of wire. The copper used is electrolytic 
type (C-1100) for its excellent purity, higher than 99.9% and the advantages of its physical properties. The supplier 
of the raw material has been the same for more than fifteen years. The capacity per shift of the drawn wire machine 
is 270 kg and it is necessary to carry out a subsequent heat treatment that allows it to reach the levels of elongation 
indicated by the NMX-J-036-ANCE-2017 standard. The annealing process cycle lasts six hours at a temperature 
of 600¬∫C. This process is carried out in an electric furnace which has a capacity of one ton. Nitrogen inert 
atmosphere is used to avoid oxidation. Cooling takes eight hours and is done at room temperature. Therefore, the 
total time to anneal a ton of drawn wire takes forty-eight hours. The drawn wire machine has a 35KW transformer 
for the continuous annealing of copper wire, which is connected to a 220V line. Because of the low voltage, there 
is a limitation on the temperature that can be reached in the continuous annealing. Temperatures above 300¬∞C 
cannot be achieved and creates the necessity for a heat treatment after drawing wire. Therefore, it is essential to 
evaluate if it is possible to increase the voltage to 440V in the transformer and monitor the performance of the 
machine and copper wire during the process using the continuous annealing process when the temperature rises 
above 500¬∫C. 
 
Copper is a non-precious metal and is the third most used metal in the world after iron and aluminum. According 
to the world market the copper wire in the electrical sector represents 27% (Phillips 2020).  
The automation of the copper wire elongation process has been carried out (Lin and Cheng 2019) without affecting 
the copper properties. The results allow to identify in general terms, the improvement in the efficiency of the

a) Values tpc = 5.187 > 2.365 
b) Significance 0.05 > 0.001 
 
Analysis of variance 
This Table 9 ANOVA reports whether there is or not a significant relation between the variables. The critical level 
(Sig.) indicates the probability = 0.001, which is less than the index of 0.05. Which means that the variables are 
linearly related, and the electric charge knob determines the value of elongation. 
 
Hypothesis: 
H0: R = 0      
Elongation is not related to the electric charge knob 
 
H1: R > 0      
Elongation is related to the electric charge knob  
 
 
With significance level:

Degrees of Freedom = 1.7 
Critical Value F (0.05,1.7) = 5.591 
 
Where:  
F = 26.905 
Accept the null hypothesis if: F < 5.591  
 
 
 
 
Therefore the Null Hypothesis is rejected, and elongation is correlated to the electric knob.

6.  Conclusions 
Eliminate the traditional annealing heat treatment by a continuous heat treatment in a copper wire drawn machine 
it is possible, see Figure 4, the new drawn wire process by placing a 35KW transformer plus changing voltage 
from 220 to 440V. The main reason is to increase temperature of the copper wire above 500¬∞C without affecting 
the physicochemical properties of the material, production speed and complying with the NMX-J-036-ANCE-
2017 standard. Adjusting the electrical load, it is critical in a continuous annealing heat treatment and the only 
way to find the right values is by using statical analysis tools which compares the relationship between the 
variables and the behavior of the copper stretched. Various positive aspects can be found ones the improvements 
were placed. Main benefits 1. Inventory reduction in process 1.3 tons, 2. Reduction in the electric consumption in 
15 KW every two days, 3. Eliminate electric oven, 4. No more consumption of nitrogen gas. Furthermore, applying 
the statistical methodology improves the parameters of annealing by combining different variables in the copper 
wire drawn process. In this case, for each solution studied, some series are proposed of behavioral verification 
constraints that are the same as the process. For future analysis, copper wire from other suppliers should be 
included to establish several supply alternatives and validate the electric charge-speed model. 
 
Industrial processes in SMEs are usually carried out manually based on some theoretical calculations and 
according to the experience of the operator. It is generally difficult to optimize it due to the impossibility of 
measuring all the parameters that influence the process, such as the internal stress to which the wire is subjected. 
In addition, this adjustment analysis needs the process to be stopped, which is a serious inconvenience for 
production. Supporting SMEs to reduce their costs by improving their manufacturing processes guarantees their 
positioning in the market and the viability of the company. To achieve this, cooperation between universities,

Abstract  
 
Studies have shown that the mortality rate due to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has drastically 
increased in developed and developing countries. The purpose of this study is to develop a diagnostic support tool to 
help classify STEMI patients and validate the predictive risk factors associated with STEMI using an ensemble 
learning approach. In this retrospective data-mining study, the data are retrieved from electronic health records of an 
urban emergency department between January 2017 and August 2020. A Random Forest model is trained to classify 
non-acute coronary syndrome (non-ACS) etiologies and STEMI patients using 38 features. Of the study cohort, 411 
patients with chest pain fulfilled inclusion criteria, of whom 225 (55%) are STEMI, and 186 (45%) are non-ACS 
etiologies patients. The proposed framework successfully classifies the non-ACS etiologies and STEMI patients with 
recall and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values of 73% and 90%, respectively.

Abstract  
 
The supply chain is also a significant aspect in project infrastructure because almost all activities in it are included in 
the supply chain. Good supply chain management have a positive impact on the construction projects development. 
The way to determine the condition of the supply chain in construction is by measuring the supply chain performance. 
This research was conducted on The Sikatak Bridge construction project in Indonesia. The several constraints that 
occur are changing the pillar body design that make having a more time to finish, delaying in material delivery, and 
the bad weather conditions. Based on those problems, performance assessment can be done using the Supply Chain 
Operation Reference (SCOR) method. The result of the study is there are 10 indicators of supply chain performance 
assessment and in this study uses only four indicators because the determination of indicators is based on the needs of 
the project and project data actual. The indicators used in this study are Perfect Order Fulfillment (POF), Total Supply 
chain Management Cost (TSCM), Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and Return on Supply chain Fixed Cost (ROF).

210","because the material orders are adjusted based on the project‚Äôs needs, so it difficult to calculate the certain of existing 
material orders. The DSCA indicator also cannot be counted, the DSCA practice in the Sikatak bridge construction 
project cannot be seen clearly. Again, the ordering of materials is in accordance with the needs of the work on the 
project, so it cannot be known with certainty the decline in the supply of raw materials. VAR is the total cost used to 
prevent the risks of each activity in the development project. The VAR indicator cannot be used because there is no 
data on the costs of each risk involved in the Sikatak bridge construction project. CTCCT is amount of time that needed 
by company for investment. The CTCCT indicator cannot calculated because there is no investment process in the 
project. ROW is the amount of relative investment to the company's working capital position with the income 
generated by a supply chain. The ROW indicator also cannot be considered because there is no investment process in 
the project.  
  
5. Conclusion  
This study uses the SCOR 12.0 method and focuses on level 1 metrics where there are 10 indicators of supply chain 
performance assessment. This study uses only four indicators because the determination of indicators is based on the 
needs of the project and the completeness of the data from the project. Based on the information obtained from the 
project, the indicators used in determining the measure of supply chain performance in the project are Perfect Order 
Fulfillment (POF), Total Supply chain Management Cost (TSCM), Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and Return on Supply 
chain Fixed Cost (ROF).

Abstract   
 
The objective of this study is using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to determine the value of supply 
chain performance in the Sikatak bridge construction project and provide recommendations for improvements to the 
Sikatak Bridge construction project. The AHP provided are accurate performance assessment on the Sikatak Bridge 
construction project is expected to facilitate the existing SCM process. Therefore, the effectiveness of the supply chain 
on the project is increasing. The results of this study are based on monitoring system of supply chain performance, 
this value belongs to the average index or average. There are two indicators that need to be improved from the four 
indicators used, namely ROF and TSCM. The strategy that can be done to increase the value of ROF and TSCM is to 
ensure that the process plan or project development planning is carried out optimally so as to produce optimum costs, 
which will benefit both the contractor and the owner.

1. Introduction  
In general, the construction is described sector that has low productivity, high fragmentation, time and cost overruns 
and many disputes compared with other sectors (Xue et al. 2007). Supply Chain Management is defined as concept 
that offers an innovative solution for overcoming those difficulties from system perspective (Kim and Nguyen  
2018). The supply chain management (SCM) has become a fundamental strategic element for the company to improve 
its competitive advantages‚Äô. Based on operation supply chain evaluation, the difficulties can be resolve immediately.

219","who in accordance with specifications so as to minimize delays in material delivery, minimize the occurrence of 
damage to materials sent and obtain materials at efficient prices, anticipate of unexpected things by carrying out project 
risk management. Risks in construction projects must be controlled so that the project can run smoothly and will not 
incur additional costs. Another strategy that can be done is to minimize the cost of prevention. Prevention costs can 
be streamlined through regular evaluations from various parties, especially supervisory consultants and owners and 
contractors so as to minimize the occurrence of errors in project work. Next strategy is to supervise suppliers such as 
coordinating between logistics parties and suppliers which aims to ensure that the goods ordered have the right quality 
and quantity. Many companies today have established good relationships with their suppliers because this is considered 
one of the strategies to obtain optimum quality and price. Some of the actions are sharing information about the 
condition of the project field, the quality of the desired material, the appropriate price, the technology used and others.   
  
5. Conclusion  
The performance value of the performance of the Sikatak bridge construction project is 56.90. Based on the monitoring 
system, this value belongs to the average index or average. There are two indicators that need to be improved from the 
four indicators used, namely ROF and TSCM. The strategy that can be done to increase the value of ROF and TSCM 
is to ensure that the process plan or project development planning is carried out optimally so as to produce optimum 
costs, which will benefit both the contractor and the owner. The process that can be done to ensure that the plan has 
been carried out optimally is to ensure that the design built is in accordance with field conditions so as to minimize 
the occurrence of design changes, ensure that the work process on the project is optimal or unite several processes that 
can be combined so as to shorten the processing time, choose a supplier who in accordance with specifications so as 
to minimize delays in material delivery, minimize the occurrence of material damage sent and obtain materials at 
efficient prices, anticipate of unexpected things by carrying out project risk management.

Abstract 
 
South Africa has in the past relied heavily on coal for its power generation needs. The introduction of an Integrated 
Resource Plan for Electricity in South Africa marked the government‚Äôs intention to diversify the country‚Äôs power 
generation technologies. Other than diversifying the power generation technologies, the South African government 
planned on using this shift to boost the local manufacturing facilities. The local content requirements in the country‚Äôs 
Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) were meant to achieve this 
goal. This study investigated whether the wind energy project, established through the REIPPPP, has been able to 
meet the local content requirements. The study further explored possible ways in which local content can be improved. 
This was done by investigating how other countries had successfully established sustainable local manufacturing of 
wind energy components.

1. Introduction 
According to the World Bank, South Africa has one of the most unequal societies in the world. According to the 
globally accepted measure of a society‚Äôs inequality, i.e., the Gini coefficient, South Africa‚Äôs was 0.63. This number is 
closer to the upper limit of 1 which denotes the most unequal society. With this in mind, the South African government 
is under immense pressure to introduce initiatives that will create jobs and boost the economy. Increasing 
manufacturing is one of the key components of the South African industrial policy, as it is a high job multiplier. 
Manufacturing, however, has not performed very well over the years. South Africa‚Äôs manufacturing base declined 
from the very high levels in the 1980s, when manufacturing contributed 23% of the country‚Äôs gross domestic product 
(GDP), to 18% in 1997, and to 11% in 2018. To enable the country to create a significant number of jobs, there is a 
need to focus on this sector and try to improve it. Some of the biggest capital projects that the country has recently 
undertaken, were in the power generation sector. The lack of proper planning in this sector, meant that the supply of 
electricity was lagging far behind the demand and needed a significant transformation for it to get in line with the 
power needs required for the country‚Äôs economic growth. Power generation, therefore, became one of the focus areas 
that the government planned to use to boost local manufacturing in the country. 
 
2. Transformation of South Africa‚Äôs Power Generation Landscape  
Historically South Africa has relied heavily on coal as its primary fuel source. It is estimated that at least 72.1% of 
South Africa‚Äôs primary energy source originates from coal. As a result of this abundance of coal, almost all of the 
country‚Äôs power stations constructed from the 1920s until the 1980s, were coal fired power stations, except for the 
Koeberg nuclear power plant and a few other power generating plants. The dawn of democracy in the country brought 
with it an investment that required a substantial supply of power. The lack of proper planning by the authorities meant 
that the supply of electricity fell far behind the demand. This led to severe rolling power cuts that were detrimental to 
the country‚Äôs economic growth. This emphasised the need to have an appropriate strategic plan for the country‚Äôs 
energy needs and supply. The country‚Äôs overall energy plan is known as the Integrated Energy Plan (IEP), while the 
Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) is a subset that focuses on the plan for electricity in the country. The country‚Äôs first

4. Discussion  
The paper has presented how the South African power generation market is being transformed from a coal-based 
power market to a diversified one, where renewables play a significant role. Of utmost importance, the paper further 
explored how the government plans to use wind energy to grow local production in the country. Whilst the REIPPPP 
has resulted in the successful establishment of local production facilities, the level of local production has not gone as 
far as the government was hoping it would. Wind farm developers have simply met the minimum requirements and 
based on the local content numbers, there appears to be room for growth in the local production of wind energy 
components. This study sought to draw some lessons from international markets that had successfully implemented 
local content policies, which had resulted in the creation of sustainable domestic production of wind energy 
components. The lessons that can be learnt from the Chinese, Spanish and Brazilian market can be summarised as 
follows: 
‚Ä¢ 
Guarantee large capacity allocation to successful bidders. 
‚Ä¢ 
Provide a stable, predictable and sustainable wind energy market. 
‚Ä¢ 
Use different policy instruments to drive local manufacturing. 
 
The publication of the IRP2019 was a step in the right direction for the South African government because it shows 
the continued appetite for wind energy, after a four-year break in the programme. This unexplained break did not instil 
any confidence in investors and manufacturers. The immediate implementation of the IRP2019 would go a long way 
in gaining this lost confidence. In addition, the government would require changing the structure of the REIPPPP, to 
the extent that the allocations for each round are known well in advance to create the predictability required.

Abstract 
 
Natural resources such as forests, land and water are primary assets that should be maintained on the basis 
of the principle of sustainability and national benefits. Any development concerning natural resource 
management must be planned properly and directed in a watershed unit (DAS). Watersheds have different 
characteristics from one and another. It consists of size (area), elevation and slope (slope), aspect and 
orientation, the shape of the watershed and drainage network. Currently, stakeholders are not well handled 
by stakeholders, which is still technically (sectoral) and centralized. In line with the issue, it‚Äôs important to 
study integrated watershed management to improve the community welfare in Aceh province, Indonesia. 
The purpose of this study is to identify the watershed management actions, including maintained and 
restored. This study is designed using cross-sectional data with a survey method which consists of four 
stages, i.e., preparation, preliminary survey, main survey, data analysis and result presentation. The data 
analysis carried out by utilizing the Classification of Watershed (e.g., criteria, sub-criteria and weighting). 
This study indicated that six sub-watersheds in the Krueng Peusangan must be restored, namely Krueng 
Celala, Krueng Meuh, Krueng Peusangan Hilir, Timang Gajah and With Balek due to watersheds are 
damaged, during drought and monsoon.  In conclusion, this study has identified six sub-watersheds that 
needs to be restored across Krueng Peusangan, Aceh, Indonesia. Of these, some efforts must be made by 
the stakeholders, namely conserving soil on agricultural land, harvesting/ storing excess water during 
monsoon and utilizing it in drought. Also, promoting sustainable farming and stabilizing crop yields 
through improved agricultural systems management and improving ecological balance, including the 
relationship between upstream water management and downstream, water quality, land quality and 
capability and biodiversity.

Abstract 
 
Islamic bank is a business entity within the scope of Islamic Financial Institutions. The most notable 
difference between Conventional Banks and Islamic Banks lies in the principle of profit obtained by the 
bank and the customer. However, the facts on the ground, the authors find that some customers do not 
understand where the difference in principle lies; many customers feel that it is the same thing. Moreover, 
the transfer of customers from using conventional banks to Islamic banks is followed by the government, 
making people inevitably convert. Therefore, it is one of the problems faced by Islamic banks, where they 
must provide education and understanding to customers, that there is a difference between the two things. 
In conjunction with the present issues, this study is written to analyze the Effect of Products and Human 
Resources on Customer Loyalty in the Post-Conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah, Indonesia. This cross-
sectional study used primary data and obtained from distributing questionnaires to 100 respondents using 
the convenience sampling method. The data analyzed using multiple linear regression by assisting the 
statistical software, namely SPSS-23. The results showed that the product positively and significantly 
influenced Customer Loyalty at the Post-Conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah. Also, human Resources 
positively and significantly influenced Customer Loyalty at the Post-Conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah. 
Simultaneously, Products and Human Resources positively and significantly influenced Customer Loyalty 
at the Post-Conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah. In conclusion, this study has successfully identified that 
product and human resources positively affect customer loyalty at post-conversion of Bank Aceh Syariah, 
Indonesia.

3. Results and Discussion 
 
Table 1 indicates the products and human resources have simultaneously influenced customer loyalty is together. 
Based on the Adjusted R Square test results in this study, a value of 0.274 or 27.4% was obtained. This shows that 
27.4% of the customer loyalty variables are influenced and can be explained by the two independent variables in this 
study, namely products and human resources. While, 72.6% is influenced by other variables not examined in this 
study. Based on the results, the Fstat value is 19.673, which means it is greater than Ftable (19.673 > 3.09). It means 
that Ha is accepted with a Prob level (F-Statistic) of 0.000 < 0.05, so it can be concluded that there is a significant 
simultaneous effect of product and resource variables. Human behavior towards customer loyalty at the Aceh sharia

loyalty will increase by 0.298. Furthermore, a significant value of 0.001 < from p-value is 0.05, then there is an 
influence between x1, and Y. Human resources have a positive relationship to customer loyalty, with a coefficient 
value of 0.174 with a positive sign (+). This finding shows that human resources increase by one Likert scale. The 
customer loyalty variable will increase by 0.174 and a significant value of 0.010 < from p-value of 0.05, then there is

Based on the results of the research above, we concluded that all variables, namely X1 (product), X2 (human 
resources), have a p-value smaller than 0.05, which means all variables are positive. The adjusted R square value 
shows the contribution of the independent variable to the dependent variable in a model. For example, the calculation 
results presented in the table above show the adjusted R square = 0.274 or 27.4%. It means that 27.4% of customer 
loyalty can be explained and influenced by product variables (X1) and human resources (X2), while the remaining 
72.6% is influenced by other variables not included in the study.

Abstract 
 
Judicial reform is an essential reference policy for state administrative courts to change its quality more 
effectively and efficiently. The state administrative court is one of the judicial environments under the 
supreme court that apply technology-based electronic justice in the 4.0 era. It makes it more informative, 
transparent, and accountable. Therefore, the current investigation is written to study the concept of 
technology-based electronic justice in optimising the utilisation of electronic justice in state organisational 
justice, Banda Aceh, Indonesia. This study is designed using qualitative research through normative 
juridical. The data was collected from legal literature studies, such as books, national or international 
journals and interviews with relevant parties, especially state administrative court in Banda Aceh. The result 
of this study is the implementation of the case search information system has marked a significant shift 
from the conventional judiciary to digitalisation. Optimisation efforts have been conducting in the online 
trial process through the equipment needed by the judiciary, selected as a pilot project using electronic 
justice. The trial has been accomplished by doing some training on improving human resources in the 
environment. As a result, it is expecting that e-Court and e-litigation applications would be more efficient.

to be used as a whole. Optimisation of the digitisation process must be continuously improved and must apply in all 
courts in the judicial environment under the MA, not only in civil, religious and TUN cases that have  done but must 
continue to expand to criminal cases; Utilisation of SIPP in the digital era is the first step in changing the conventional 
judicial system towards digital that has been supported by the e-Court system and e-litigation that has been used by 
TUN  judiciary and needs to continue to make optimal efforts in its utilisation so far; Improvement of facilities and 
infrastructure has also been made which is directly supplied by the MA and sent to all regions in Indonesia which of 
course has been selected several justices who become Pilot Projects for the utilisation of the judiciary electronically, 
has also been conducted several times socialisation and training of human resources conference organisers as an effort 
to optimise their use, especially TUN judiciary in Banda Aceh;  Research needs to perform to find concepts to 
maximise the use of digitalisation in electronic judicial services, especially in the TUN environment.

Abstract 
 
Women are one of the vulnerable groups that needed to empower and always discussed in many spaces. 
This study tried to identify the lack of women backed by structural problems in village policies that do not 
consider women as a class of vulnerable groups become the most crucial part of development. Qualitative 
research with natural methods because it is on the basis of natural conditions. This approach is focusing on 
phenomena or natural settings. The data is collected by interviewing and observing a member of the 
empowerment and family welfare group (PKK). This study found that mothers of households who serve as 
household heads trained to take advantage of what they must earn additional income. PKK Group pioneered 
the village's opposition by involving themselves completely, both from development planning, 
implementation to the evaluation of performance already underway. The empowerment efforts are not 
arbitrarily successful as expected; the PKK group is precisely dealing with the problem in the internal body 
of the organisation. Many planned work programs often fail because they are affected by internal issues.

1. Introduction 
Geographically Pante Gajah Village is one of the villages in the sub-district that is very strategic, seen in terms of the 
economy, education and agricultural potential. That is because almost the district Peusangan is located on the road 
axle to facilitate access to the district capital and the trade route between cities in the province. Vulnerable groups are 
not only due to their inability to physically earn income. Those who are harmed over the implementation of 
development can also be categorised as vulnerable groups. Generally, they are the women who act as housewives and 
the head of the family, the elderly, the poor, the people who have physical and psychic disabilities and so on. This 
study did not examine the entire vulnerable group. This study focuses solely on women as part of a vulnerable group.

The principles of mutual assistance need to return to be encouraged to resolve the problems of vulnerable groups. The 
team is another form of local wisdom that can be used to face post-disaster conditions. In local terms, and team or 
work together resolves a physical problem. All activities are and team done from, by, and for the community or

5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, vulnerability is the most crucial part to be noticed in development which needs the role of others as a 
party to remove them from the primary problem that is being hit. Without immediate policy intervention leads to the 
empowerment of vulnerable groups, the development will be seen as a discriminatory effort. Vulnerable groups are 
those with disabilities because they are disabled, nursing, children, women, and poor people. The closest 
neighbourhood that makes it possible to help them is the PKK group located in the village. The PKK group plays an 
important role as the party, which is possible to do so, as did the PKK elephant group of elephants Peusangan village 
Pante Gajah. This group of PKK has had several programs that lead to the empowerment of vulnerable group 
communities based on participatory principles. That is to make the group vulnerable as a subject of the development 
that will be held, instead of placing them as development objects. 
The participatory approach to completing a group of vulnerable groups for children, for example, is the 
community collectively bringing the main educational functions to the core family. Revitalising the role of a family 
as an educational institution is an investor. So that, the distorted behaviour of children is not regarded as a fault of 
certain parties. Next up is a healthy environment for children. Children spend a lot of time interacting with the 
environment. The environment is where he plays, finds friends, stories and develops himself. 
Furthermore, it is an educational institution that serves to meet cognition, affection and psychomotor children. 
There needs to be a directed and measurable work program for resolving problems in a participatory group of 
vulnerable principles. By involving them as part of a development perpetrator, it does not make them an object. This 
study is still minimal and found some very fundamental flaws, which are not yet able to find the concept of 
development for the overall character of vulnerable society. This study saw more children as an object of study.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia has great biodiversity's and genetic resources and essential natural resources due to its utilization 
by industry activities as the second largest megadiversity country. However, industrial activity is identically 
vulnerable in causing biopiracy continuous use and detrimental to the community. The convention on 
biological and Nagoya protocol have recognized the protection of biodiversity and genetic resources 
through accent and benefit-sharing. Of these, Indonesia has ratified two international arrangements 
supported in protecting biodiversity and genetic resources. In line with the issue, the present study aims to 
analyzes the importance of protecting biodiversity and genetic resources in Indonesia. The result of the 
study indicated that two reasons underlie the need to preserve biodiversity and genetic resources, i.e., 
increasing economic value and reasons for moral rights to communities around biodiversity and genetic 
resources. In conclusion, the legal protection of biodiversity and genetic resources is crucial for Indonesia. 
As an island nation, Indonesia has a very strategic position with a wealth of natural resources and high 
endemic species of flora and fauna. The richness of biodiversity and genetic resources includes genetics, 
species, to a variety of unique ecosystems. In addition, the use of biodiversity and genetic resources in the 
activities of the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries has increased the economic value that can bring 
prosperity to the community.

257","The pharmaceutical industries have also intensively used biodiversity and genetic resources in high-cost 
research. The contribution of herbal medicines from biodiversity and genetic resources by the pharmaceutical industry 
reaches 50 per cent of drugs globally, such as leukaemia drugs. The sale of vinblastine for Hodgkin's disease and 
vincristine is obtaining from tread specimens found in Madagascar. It generated over 200 million US$ in one year for 
Eli Lilly Corporation as a manufacturer in the United States (Torrence, 2017). Second, the importance of protecting 
biodiversity as a moral right in the universal teachings of Nature Law shows the treatment of moral values (Howse & 
Langille, 2012). Grotius asserted that morality is based on considering the human mind or mind, which can show what 
is right and what is not. Good reasons and actions have a moral quality (Crouch, 2012). In the view of modern 
teachings, morals give equal treatment to anyone and are not discriminatory. In protecting biodiversity and genetic 
resources as a gift from God, morality refers to the meaning that it is a mistake to unfairly use biodiversity and genetic 
resources (Stenson & Gray, 2018). Thus, protecting biodiversity and genetic resources is a moral responsibility. 
Protection of Indonesian genetic resources are an important thing to do. It needs to regulate the national legal system 
for the welfare of the people, especially the Indonesian people. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Legal protection is necessary primarily to protect genetic resources by region, where Indonesia as an island nation has 
a very strategic position with a wealth of natural resources and high endemic species of flora and fauna. The richness 
of biodiversity and genetic resources includes genetics, species, to a variety of unique ecosystems. The use of 
biodiversity and genetic resources in the activities of the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries has increased the 
economic value that can bring prosperity to the community.

Abstract 
 
Candle Nut (Aleurites moluccana) is classified as one of Indonesia's substantial available natural resources, 
is considered a wide prospect marketing commodity either domestic or overseas. The purpose of the study 
was to find out and evaluate the temperature against the percentage yield and characteristics of pyrolysis 
products produced for the application of the product as an alternative fuel. The research consists of the 
initial stage of raw material preparation, pyrolysis process stage and analysis stage of Bio-oil, Gas, Char 
products. Pyrolysis uses a fixed Batch Reactor equipped with a dual condenser system (SKG) at 
temperatures varied at 350, 450, 550 ¬∞C and pressure 1 (one) atmosphere and sampling time of 30, 60, 90, 
up to 420 minutes. The use of cooling water temperature in condensers ranges from 25 -35 ¬∞C. A Bio-Oil 
level analysis measured the amount of bio-oil volume produced in the measuring glass during pyrolysis 
time intervals performed at each temperature used. Product identification carried with GCMS (Gas 
Chromatography and mass spectrometry). Also, it measures tar products, solid products and gases from 
pyrolysis processes utilized for alternative fuels. The results showed that at optimum temperatures produced 
liquid smoke yield products of 8.6%, charcoal 81.6 %, tar 3.7 % and 6.1 %. Identification results using GC 
Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) at optimum temperature conditions of 450 ¬∞C and pyrolysis time of 210 
minutes show a smaller number of components that are 7 (seven) components, namely: Cyclopentanone, 2 
Cyclopenten1-one,  2 cyclopentene-1-one, Acetic acid, 2 Furancarboxildehide, 2 methoxyphenyl and 2 
Methoxy-4-methyl enols.

Abstract 
 
Biomembran is one type of wound dressing. Wound dressing is usually used in healing wounds and can 
create good conditions in the process of wound healing. The raw materials used for making these 
biomembranes are chitosan, alginate, and aloe vera. This study aims to examine biomembrane processing 
and analyze the physical-chemical properties of biomembrane. The process of making this biomembrane is 
by mixing all the raw materials, namely chitosan: alginate: aloe vera with a ratio of 40:60:40; 50:50:40; 
60:40:40; 70:30:40; and 80:20:40.  Then proceed to the stage of printing using glass molds and then dried 
using an oven. Biomembranes produced were carried out several tests such as for absorption test the value 
obtained was 73%; 131%; 167%; 258%; and 267% for each of the above comparisons, and for membrane 
thickness the value obtained is 0.09 mm; 0.0867mm; 0.0833 mm; 0.07mm; 0.0667mm, and for the swelling 
test the value obtained is 100%; 122.2%; 140%; 200%; 225%, and for analysis of this biomembrane FTIR 
group contains alkyl halides, CH bonds, alkyl amine groups, NO2 bonds, CO/CH bending groups, NO2 
bonds, alkene (C = C), alkaline compounds (C‚â°C), compounds alkanes (CH), and amine compounds, 
amides (NH).

The percent S difference in each biomembrane showed in Figure 4. The percentage S of material is heavily reliant 
on its hydrophilic properties; chitosan and alginate are hydrophilic. Figure 4 depicts the increase in per cent S is due 
to the increased volume of chitosan. The volume of chitosan consumed, the greater the absorption. Suppose the 
chitosan and alginate are comparable. Biomembrane destroyed, whereas biometrics will produce flaccid biomembrane 
because it contains more composition than chitosan.  The swelling value of the application of wound dressings is 
between 200%-500%. The results obtained show that the membrane chitosan-chitosan-aloe Vera is qualified, and 
some are not eligible for use as wound dressings. The longer the soaking time to a certain extent, the NaCl solution 
absorbed as much as biomembrane. The swelling value that can use for wound dressing application ranges from 200 
to 500 per cent. The results show that some membrane chitosan-aloe Vera are qualified for use as wound dressings, 
but others aren't. To a certain extent, the longer the soaking time, the more NaCl solution was absorbed as 
biomembrane (Bontha & Pintauro, 1994).

Abstract 
 
The number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on the roads worldwide increased from few thousand units in 2010 to more 
than 10 million in 2020. Developed countries show a rapid adoption of EVs and an intensive deployment of public 
chargers. In developing countries, the pace of adoption is not as fast as in developed countries. In this paper, we 
analyze the sales of EVs, the range characteristics of the BEVs and the charging infrastructure in Mexico. We develop 
time series decomposition and regression models to predict the quarterly and yearly sales of EVs in Mexico. The 
results show that the sales of EVs in Mexico have trend and seasonal effect. The first and fourth quarters show 
relatively high sales. However, the increasing trend is not enough to replace soon the sales of new internal combustion 
vehicles. In addition, considering that over 70% of battery EVs sold in Mexico are low-range vehicles, we show that 
interurban traveling is hindered for many BEV models due to scarce charging infrastructure outside urban areas and 
compatibility issues of chargers.

1. Introduction 
The adoption of EVs grew exponentially in the last decade worldwide. According to the 2021 Global EV Outlook, 
the number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on the roads around the world exceeded 10 million in 2020 (International 
Energy Agency, 2021a), while in 2010 there were less than 20,000 units. Most of the EVs are in China, Europe, and 
the United States. Approximately 66% of these vehicles are battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and the remaining are 
plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). BEVs work only with electricity, and they must be charged from the grid, 
while PHEVs combine an internal combustion engine (ICE) with an electric motor connected to a battery that also 
needs to be charged from the grid. 
 
The accelerated adoption of EVs is due to multiple factors. For instance, M√ºnzel et al. (2019) identified several 
monetary and non-monetary incentives. The former includes tax reduction, waivers, special depreciation, subsidy to 
install home charger, and rebates; the latter includes access to special circulation lanes and traffic zones, free public 
charging, and special parking spots. 
 
In addition, several governments have set sustainability targets to incentive and enforce the acquisition of zero-
emission vehicles (ZEV). The International Energy Agency (2021a) reported that more than 20 countries set 100% of 
ZEV sales beginning in 2025 (Norway), 2030 (Denmark, Israel, among others), 2035 (UK, some states in the United 
States), 2040 (France, Canada, among others) and 2050 (Costa Rica and Germany). While other countries have 
committed to reach net-zero emission economy by 2050. 
 
On the other hand, an increasing environmental consciousness has also positively influenced the acquisition of EVs 
(Li et al., 2017; Brise√±o et al., 2021). Although the tank-to-wheel GHG emissions of a BEV is zero, the emissions in 
the life cycle of the vehicle and the batteries, and the well-to-tank cycle emissions are still significant (International 
Energy Agency, 2019). Hence, the transition to electric mobility must also consider the transition to renewable 
generation of electricity. In 2020, the share of renewables accounted for 20% worldwide (International Energy 
Agency, 2021b).

284","5. Conclusion 
Electric mobility has been penetrating the markets worldwide at a high speed. Nevertheless, the pace of adoption of 
EVs in developing countries is slow. One of the main barriers is related with the scarce charging infrastructure and 
low range of BEVs, which produce range anxiety on the driver and hinders interurban traveling. In this paper, we 
analyzed the sales of EVs in Mexico and we fitted forecasting models to predict the incorporation of EVs on the roads 
of the country. In addition, we analyzed the feasibility to complete interurban trips using the state of Jalisco as a case 
study. 
 
The sales of EVs in Mexico follow a linear trend with seasonal patterns. The first and the fourth quarters of the year 
are the seasons with the largest sales. So far, most of the EVs sold are in states with high economic development, 
including Mexico City, Estado de Mexico, Queretaro, Jalisco and Nuevo Leon. According to the prediction model, in 
the next five years about 16,000 new EVs are expected to be sold. If this prediction occurs with a high level of 
accuracy, by 2025 there would be about 30,000 EVs on the roads of Mexico. This number is still very low compared 
with the 35 million of light passenger vehicles registered by the beginning of this year. Hence, incentives with greater 
impact must be implemented to accelerate the replacement of ICE vehicles. These incentives could be related with the 
deployment of charging infrastructure and the reduction of upfront cost of vehicles with high range. 
 
Most vehicles sold in Mexico are models with low range. In addition, charging infrastructure is mainly located in 
urban zones. Therefore, completing interurban traveling is challenging in Mexico. In the analysis presented for the 
state of Jalisco, we realize that current charging infrastructure is not enough to allow any BEV to complete trips within 
the state, and between the capital city Guadalajara and Mexico City. This problem is due not only to the lack of 
charging infrastructure, but also it is due to compatibility issues of fast chargers. 
 
Future research lines extend to analyzing the main highways in Mexico to determine the feasibility to complete the 
trips and formulating an optimization model for the location of new chargers considering ranges of existing BEVs and 
compatibility issues.

Abstract  
 
There is no doubt about the importance of the family business within the economic fabric, that is why public policies 
and the academy of researchers around the world focus on ensuring their subsistence, since this type of company is 
one of the enterprises that disappears when passing to the second generation. Because of this, it is necessary that 
researchers orient their efforts in those problems inherent to the operation of the organization, leaving aside intrinsic 
factors of the family-business circle, which are crucial for the survival of the company; thus, the literature review 
shows that said survival does not depend on economic issues but on other subjective factors.  
 
The construct ‚Äúfamiliness‚Äù refers to the interaction that the family has in the company and, which leads the business 
to develop distinctive characteristics, which can contribute both to knowledge and shed light on the field of study of 
family businesses. Therefore, the objective of this work is to analyze the relationship of the dimensions of the 
participation, essence and identity approaches of the business and the family business. The main results suggest that 
the dimensions of the participation, essence, as well as organizational identity approaches are related to the family 
business, that is, the influence of the family in the business is unavoidable, where from the level of participation of 
the family members the essence of the organization will depend on, allowing it to be distinguished from non-family 
members due to its unique, inseparable and synergistic characteristics. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
 
The importance of the family business within the economic fabric lies in the high percentage that they contribute to 
the gross domestic product (GDP) in the societies where they are established, such is the case of the Latin American 
continent and, in Mexico specifically, a high percentage of family businesses have as a characteristic they are small 
and medium-sized companies that also have an impact on the country's economy. However, both public policies and 
the academy of researchers around the world focus on guaranteeing its subsistence, since the family business is one 
of the enterprises that disappears when passing to the second generation.

Abstract 
 
Customer loyalty depends on a combination of objective and subjective factors. For retailers, the benefit having a 
positive perception in the public is the credibility transmitted to their brands. This investigation is focused on the 
implementation of artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict customers‚Äô loyalty to supermarket chains measured in 
terms of their purchase frequency. The research is carried out following a classic 4-stage methodology (analysis, 
design, development, and validation). During the analysis, the results of a customer loyalty survey are preprocessed. 
During the design, the full questionnaire is divided into several domains (e.g. products‚Äô quality, buying experience, 
etc.). Each domain is then used to build and compare predictive models. The original dataset containing 1.050 
surveys is split up in two sets: 80% of data for training and test, and the remaining 20% for validation. To predict 
customer loyalty twelve different ANN-based models are built. The results reveal that the proposed ANN-based 
models can predict correctly 60% and 72% of customers‚Äô purchase frequency. In conclusion, predictive ANN-based 
models help determine how often an average customer made purchases on a given supermarket chain with a 
reasonable degree of certainty by means of analyzing some of their habits and preferences.

1. Introduction 
Supermarket chains permanently try to attract new customers and retain old ones by means of implementing 
different strategies. Some of them involve the location of their stores, the diversity in the offer of products, the 
ambience in the stores, marketing campaigns, and private labels. In the case of supermarkets, several authors suggest 
that customer loyalty depends of a combination of different factor such as: low prices, closeness, good access, 
product variety, discounts, and also for an emotional connection with a specific store based on the trust, environment 
and service (Allen and Rao, 2000; Flavi√°n, et al., 2001; Martos-Partal and Gonz√°lez-Benito, 2013). Other authors 
mention a relationship between customer loyalty and the retailer's social responsibility policies (Ailawadi et. al, 
2014). 
There is a correlation between customer satisfaction and brand loyalty, being the first a necessary condition to 
generate the latter. However, it is not enough by itself because brand loyalty depends on emotional factors 
(Neumeier, 2006; Allen and Rao, 2000).  
Building a corporate brand implies creating a value proposition for customers based on meaningful relationships and 
on specific characteristics to support the group of brands of a company. The establishment of a brand can lead to 
customer satisfaction and satisfied customers are likely loyal to the company (Martenson, 2007). 
Customer loyalty to supermarkets can be measured by the frequency of purchase (Dick and Basu, 1994), but it is not 
an indicator of real loyalty, because repeated purchases at a particular supermarket may be due to mere convenience 
if there no other closer alternative. Thus, it is a purchase based on emotional satisfaction. Even more, customers

6. Conclusion 
The survey about supermarket chains and private labels used this research provides enough data to build models to 
predict customers‚Äô loyalty in terms of their frequency of purchase. In other words, how often they visit the chain‚Äôs 
stores. Whether the purchase frequency is the best indicator to measure the loyalty is not part this work‚Äôs scope, 
which, instead, is limited to the building of predictive models based on ANNs. 
During the building of a machine learning model it is recommendable to implement a cross-validation scheme to 
minimize the influence of the dataset split up instead of holding out a portion of the data. Averaging the results of k 
iteration will be always better than having only one result. Furthermore, replicating the experiment many times 
allow estimate the variability of the results, which can be expressed in terms of the standard deviation of the 
percentage of correctly predicted classes. 
On the other hand, having a validation helps determine whether the models can generalize properly or not. Since, 
considering a complete rotation of k folds, during the cross-validation each instance (rows) is used for training k-1 
times, data are known to the predictive. For this reason, it is crucial to have a separated validation set to evaluate the 
models‚Äô performance with unknown data. 
The results of the experiment replications show that only models M6 and M11 predict correctly less than 70% of 
customers‚Äô purchase frequency with the training and test dataset. With the validation dataset, instead, only models 
M0, M1, M2, M4, M5 and M10 predicted correctly over around 70% of the instances. In the latter case, although 
prediction ratios are similar, between 69% and 72%, there are significant differences in the number of attributes used 
to build each model, being M0 the largest one with 26 attributes and M1 the smallest with only 5.  
From the prediction rate, it seems that each domain provides enough information to build models that have a similar 
performance. This a particularly important result because it proves that a short and focused survey is equally useful 
than an extensive one when predicting purchase frequency. 
Finally, prediction ratios and confusion matrices suggest that the ANN-based classification models M0, M1, M2, 
M4, M5 and M10 help predict customers‚Äô purchase frequency.

Abstract 
 
In recent years there has been a tendency to incorporate entrepreneurship related contents in engineering academic 
programs to help students identify opportunities, create, and innovate. It is interesting to analyze the interrelation 
between factors such as subject, working experience, university infrastructure, and social background in the 
entrepreneurial interest. This research compare models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the 
interest in entrepreneurial activities among engineering students. The research is carried out following a classic 4-
stage methodology (analysis, design, development, and validation). During the analysis, the local results of the 
University Entrepreneurial Spirit Students‚Äô Survey 2018 (GUESSS) are preprocessed. In the design, GUESSS 
questionnaire is divided to create different predictive models. Both phases, construction and validation, are carried 
out entirely using the software WEKA. The complete dataset is split up to create 2 subsets, one is used for training 
and test (80%) and the other for validation (20%). The results reveal that the models can predict correctly between 
34% and 78% of the validation dataset‚Äôs cases. In conclusion, the investigation‚Äôs results show that some of the 
proposed models based on ANNs can help predict the interest in entrepreneurial activities among engineering 
students with a reasonable degree of certainty.

1. Introduction 
After graduation, engineering students must face new challenges and difficulties to initiate their professional career. 
Whilst some of them get prepared to be recruited by prestigious companies, others try to create their own businesses 
to work independently. However, it is common to find students hoping to work for some years in a company to gain 
some working experience and then to initiate their own business. The factors that influence such decision have been 
a matter of study for a while. Subject, previous working experience, university infrastructure, and social background 
seem to be the logical factors that influence students‚Äô preferences. 
Although there is wide variety in the approaches proposed to study this matter through the years, some authors have 
achieved more popularity than others. Two of the most accepted and followed approaches are: the theory of planned 
behavior (Ajzen, 1991), and the theory of the human motivation (McClelland, 1987).  
In the literature, factors that explain the entrepreneurial attitude are commonly classified in two categories. On the 
one hand are the personal characteristics such as risk aversion, autonomy, goal-orientation, power, and management 
knowledge. On the other hand, factors related to social environment such as family‚Äôs entrepreneurial background, 
economy, formal education and training, and social networks (Sieger, 2011; Zellweger et al., 2011; Bagheri et al., 
2015; Gorgievski et al., 2018; Israr and Saleem, 2018; Bosma et al., 2021).

The survey GUESSS 2018 provides valuable information about mid-term students‚Äô career development preferences. 
This new information can be used to adapt lectures and contents to help undergraduate students develop the 
necessary skills to start their business or to facilitate their access and adaptation to private companies.  
When working with machine learning schemes, it is recommendable to apply a cross-validation to minimize the 
influence of the dataset split up instead of simply holding out a portion of data. Averaging k classification results 
will be always better than having only one result. Furthermore, running replications help reduce the bias caused by 
the fold partitioning. Having a validation dataset is an important part of the investigation, it helps determine whether 
the models can generalize properly or not.  
The classification results show that only the proposed models M0, M4, and M9 can predict correctly over 70% of 
the students‚Äô preferences with the training and test dataset. With the validation dataset the situation is similar, being 
M0, M4, and M9 the only models predicting correctly over 70% of the surveys.  
Even though, prediction ratios are similar (72%, 77%, and 78%) there are significant differences in the number of 
attributes used to build each model, being M0 the largest one with 56 attributes (questions). Both, M4 and M9 
employ 26 and 27 attributes respectively. In all cases, the domain related to entrepreneurial interest (D4) is present. 
This one, with 24 questions, is the largest domain used in this investigation.  
Finally, prediction ratios and confusion matrices suggest that the proposed classification models M0, M4, and M9 
based on artificial neural networks can help predict mid-term professional career preferences among engineering 
students.

Abstract 
 
The pandemic caused by Covid-19 has led university students in Mexico to take their classes online, where they have to interact 
with furniture and computer equipment different from the one that exists in classrooms. Interaction with such furniture and 
equipment can be uncomfortable and have an impact on the students‚Äô Academic performance. Therefore, this article aims to 
determine the impact of Desk / Table design, Chair design, and Human-computer interaction (antecedent variables), as well as 
the Mental workload (mediating variable) on university students‚Äô Academic performance (consequent variable) during the 
Covid-19 pandemic. A questionnaire is developed and applied online to 167 university students, and three mediation models 
were built where seven hypotheses are included. These hypotheses were statistically validated by applying the ordinary least 
squares regression algorithm. The results indicated that the three antecedent variables have a significant direct effect as well as 
total effects of 0.21, 0.14, and 0.49, respectively, while total effects of 0.22, 0.17, and 0.49 on the university students‚Äô Academic

328",,"computer equipment is essential to improve and maintain the ability to use human resources, in this case, university students, 
efficiently. Also, in turn, it impacts their profitability over time, and therefore their sustainability.  
Moreover, this research allows us to conclude that online classes do not generate an excess Mental workload in university 
students since the maximum Mental workload value obtained was 60, on a scale of 1 to 100 with the NASA-TLX method. 
Likewise, the research also allows discovering that the mediating variable Mental workload does not impact on university 
students‚Äô Academic performance. Based on the above, higher education institutions must have the culture of offering classes 
with ergonomic design of furniture and computer equipment for students to interact with, since this allows improving the 
sustainability of human resources, that is, of the students, in the first instance, and the institution in the second instance. 
 
6.1 Theoretical and Managerial Implications 
Based on the results obtained from the direct and total effects of the three antecedent variables on Academic performance, the 
following theoretical and administrative implications were obtained: 
‚Ä¢ Academic performance depends not only on the time students spend studying or their ability to memorize information, but 
also on other variables. 
‚Ä¢ The ergonomic design of furniture and computer equipment is essential to improve university students‚Äô Academic 
performance who take online classes. This can help improve students‚Äô sustainability in the first instance and of higher 
education institutions in the second instance. 
‚Ä¢ Sustainability first impacts human resources (such as university students), and later companies, such as educational 
institutions or those belonging to the manufacturing or construction industry. 
 
7. Further Research 
As detected in this research, the university students‚Äô Academic performance who take online classes has been affected by the 
pandemic caused by Covid-19, specifically due to the Desk/Table design, the Chair design, and Human-computer interaction. 
However, other variables can have an impact on the university students‚Äô Academic performance who are taking online classes. 
Such variables can include the lighting, noise, and temperature of the place where the student is taking a class, online interaction 
with the teacher and classmates, social support, to name a few. 
 
Therefore, as future research, different analyzes of the relationships among the variables mentioned above can be performed, 
for both students and university teachers. This is because not only were university students affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, 
but the teaching staff of higher education institutions as well, which can impact their job performance and, consequently, their 
sustainability.

Abstract 
 
In recent decades, developed countries have raised in the political, economic, social, and cultural sectors. In this 
context, nations aim to search for the common welfare, security, technological and commercial competitiveness, and 
sustainable development. We currently live in a globalized world where we seek to generate wealth by transforming 
resources, which are primarily finite or only renewable under certain conditions. Due to this problem, other production 
alternatives have been designed, such as remanufacturing, which seeks to extend the life cycle of products through 
recovery to meet the population's needs. These practices are more common in developed countries where appropriate 
incentives, technologies, knowledge, and provisions form a contrast with the emerging countries such as Russia, 
China, India, Mexico, and Brazil, without capacities fully developed. This article aims to identify the variables 
intervening in the consumer's perception of remanufactured products to understand the impediments or differences 
generated to adopt a circular economic model based on responsible consumption.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to design a powertrain configuration tailored for specific applications, allowing a reduction of net 
emissions, investment cost, and operational cost when comparing to its fossil fueled alternative. The methodology is 
divided into 3 phases: i) Select the specific niche to be electrified whose local conditions ease their social adaptation 
and monitor their current operation for a long time to determine their driving patterns and operational conditions, ii) 
Construct a real-world driving cycle based on the typical driving profile of the niche using the Energy Based Micro-
Trips method, and iii) Define the vehicle performance metrics to optimize and then based on a multi-objective 
optimization and an iterative energy-based approach, determine the best electric vehicle‚Äôs powertrain configuration 
(number of batteries, motor size, and gearbox transmission ratio) that optimizes the chosen performance metrics. In 
this work, a university shuttle service is considered as the case study. Based on a measurement campaign on the normal 
operation of these buses, a geometrical gearbox and an energy management system have been designed through a 
multi-objective optimization using an iterative energy-based approach. It was considered Deep-cycle Lead Acid and 
Lithium Polimer (LiPo) batteries within the design of choice. The best results were observed with LiPo batteries, 
which shows improvements of the vehicle‚Äôs acceleration capacity by 26.5% while at the same time reducing energy 
consumption by 37%, CO2 emissions by 31%, and the total cost of ownership by 10% when compared to its counterpart 
diesel buses. Furthermore, it was studied the evolution of the TCO as a function of autonomy under this configuration, 
and it was obtained that the TCO can be even better to its diesel counterpart under low autonomies (< 160km). In the 
case of study considered in this work (aka CircuitoTec), each route has approximate distances of 25 km and therefore 
a range of 50+ km is reasonable. Therefore, for this application, the operation of passenger transport with electric 
buses is not only feasible, but it is also a better choice.

Abstract 
 
This article describes case studies with respect to the establishment of so-called classification schemes used in 
engineering design education within the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics at the Deggendorf 
Institute of Technology (DIT), former University of Applied Sciences, Germany. The described techniques aim at 
providing undergraduate students with examples for systematic product development and fostering and stimulating 
student‚Äôs creativity. It serves also as a guideline for conducting engineering design projects embedded within the 
curriculum of their studies. The described procedures are based on existing design methodology and long term 
experience of the authors in giving respective design lectures and in conducting engineering projects with students 
and enterprises as well. Eventually, by taking advantage of the approach, a patent and innovative product is presented.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Systematic Design Process 
A systematic/methodical design has a long tradition in Mechanical Engineering. The theory has been worked out 
and outlined in literature and publications (Pahl and Beitz et al. 2007, Roth 2012, VDI 1993, VDI 1997). According 
to the literature cited the design process utilizes several stages, beginning with the clarification of the task, followed 
by a conceptual design phase, an embodiment design phase and ending with detail design (Fig.1, left) which finally 
results into a mechanical, electromechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic respectively combined structure of the product.

363","5. Outcome and Conclusion 
Innovative and distinguished products are the key to the long-term growth and success of an enterprise. This requires 
talented employees and designers which have the competence and capability to generate ideas and smart solutions for 
given tasks. From the perspective of an engineering design education the challenge is to prepare students in a way that 
they will achieve these capabilities. Students and design beginners usually have poor problem solving experience. 
Therefore, the instructors face the challenge to convey appropriate means and techniques to foster creativity and the 
generation of ideas and solutions. It has long been recognized, that a structured systematic design process and the use 
of appropriately embedded techniques is inspiring with respect to the number and variety of generated ideas. In this 
context, the development of classification schemes, which has been demonstrated and described in detail, is a good 
means to extend the number of solutions in different directions. Classification schemes facilitate the identification of 
important product characteristics and initiate the combination of essential solution characteristics. It makes the design 
process and the methodology more understandable. Students experience the production of ideas and design variants, 
which encourages and strengthens their confidence, and a systematic variation is definitely a source of creativity and 
innovation. They benefit also from written documentation, visualization of solutions in formal schemes, and of 
comprehensive worked out exercises. Note: Experienced design engineers have a lot of solution options of given tasks 
in their minds and are able to retrieve appropriate solution patterns when specific design problems come up, but these 
patterns are not available for beginners, they have to work for them.

Abstract  
 
Research on consumer culture continues to develop but is limited to one field or one country. From a bibliometric 
review, this study aims to visually research mapping and research trends in the field of consumer culture. As a matter 
of fact, bibliometric indicators are increasingly being used as a tool for research performance evaluation (Wallin, 
2005). This study used bibliometric techniques with secondary data from Scopus. It is carried out by examining and 
visualizing the data using VOS Viewer program then by analyzing search results function on Scopus. Furthermore, 
this study analyzed 1,850 scientific documents published in scopus.com from 1977 to 2020. According to the research, 
the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Craig J. Thompson had the most active affiliated institutions and individual 
scientists in consumer culture research. Journal of Consumer Culture was the most disseminated outlet of consumer 
culture research. Moreover, there were four category maps of collaborative researchers which based on the 
identification of a collection of knowledge generated from over fourty-three years of publication. This research results 
a grouping of consumer culture research themes: Consumerism, Human, Identity, Culture, and Advertising, 
abbreviated as the CHIHA research themes.

Abstract 
 
This paper buttresses the need for IoT-enabled agriculture, in order to tackle food insecurity globally, especially in the 
Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region where the global population rise is predicted to concentrate. It details the nitty-
gritty involved in setting up a smart irrigation system and presents a systematic review of seven (7) scheduling 
algorithms used to drive smart irrigation systems. Analysis of the algorithms shows that they differ in terms of sensor 
inputs and level of precision. Recommendations were made in choosing a suitable algorithm and how the chosen 
algorithm can be deployed to withstand network connectivity problems. This paper also proposes a community 
Internet of Things (IoT) network to deploy smart irrigation systems and other applications of IoT-enabled agriculture, 
in rural areas among smallholder farmers. This is to mitigate the challenges that are likely to discourage farmers 
especially those in the SSA from embracing the technology.

Introduction  
The Internet of things (IoT) has provided us with a brilliant way of interacting with physical systems remotely via 
wireless sensor networks and internet technology. With IoT, the behavior of physical systems can be monitored and 
controlled seamlessly, and the data harnessed from sensors can be used to model physical systems, make predictions 
and automate processes. IoT is rapidly revolutionizing the fields of precision agriculture, control, data science, 
artificial intelligence, etc. Precision agriculture, for example, is leveraging on the technology to supply just the 
required input needed for healthy plant growth and productivity. IoT for agriculture is presently being used to measure 
several agricultural variables such as plant growth, rainfall, soil moisture, temperature, PH, humidity, airflow, motion 
in a farm, soil dielectric constant, mechanical resistance, electrochemical properties of soil, solar radiation, etc. Data 
gathered from sensors are mined and used for soil erosion control, disease diagnosis of plants and animals, fertilizer 
application, field monitoring, crop yield analysis, smart irrigation application, etc. 
 
Irrigation is an age-long practice that is adopted to ensure continuous cropping irrespective of seasonal changes, so 
that food production can always meet demand. The global population rise predicted by the United Nations (UN) 
Department of Economic and Social Affairs(UN, 2019) is yet an omen that is drawing serious attention to methods 
and practices that can be used to boost agricultural throughput and ascertain food security in the nations. Presently, 
research on the use of IoT-enabled irrigation systems is gaining attention. Smart irrigation system powered by IoT 
promises better crop yield, water conservation and reduces labor while also making irrigation practice germane and 
attractive to farmers. 
 
What makes an irrigation system smart is the algorithm that drives it. Designing computationally efficient, cost-
efficient, and high precision algorithm for optimum crop yield is a research concern in precision agriculture. In the 
SSA, the major concern is how to drive the technology among smallholder farmers who produce over 80% of the 
food(Sirimanne, 2017; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC): Strategy 2017 ‚Äì 2020, Global

Abstract 
 
Invasive species devastate ecosystems and understanding them is key to their eradication or management. The 
objective of this project is to use STEM methodology to research the population ecology of Senecio Elegans at Half 
Moon Bay State Beach (HMB) in California to inform volunteer removal efforts. Senecio Elegans is native to Africa, 
but threatens the biodiversity in California. The method of random sampling of two populations of Senecio Elegans 
was used to find their population sizes. The dispersion of Senecio Elegans at both populations was determined 
separately to generalize the dispersion pattern for the species. The research was repeated for Cakile Maritima, a non-
invasive plant similar to Senecio Elegans, to benchmark its growth in relation to native plants. Chi-square test for 
Dispersion yielded a contagious dispersion pattern for both beaches and plants. Beach 1 had an estimated population 
size of 55 Senecio Elegans and Beach 2 had an estimated population size of 240 Senecio Elegans. Beach 1 had an 
estimated population size of 185 Cakile Maritima and Beach 2 had an estimated population size of 6 Cakile Maritima. 
Comparing the population sizes on both beaches to determine which beach was in greater need of weeding yielded a 
statistically insignificant result.

Abstract 
 
This paper studies the relationship between eye movement and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a comparison that 
can be easily made in most homes with current advances in AI and basic webcam technology. Diagnosis of autism 
spectrum disorder in children is an important and difficult task which is crucial for children who need treatment or 
aid. Therefore, it is optimal that people take advantage of modern technology to create accessible methods of diagnosis 
that are reliable. The data studied is a dataset of images and the eye traces of children with ASD and children without 
ASD who viewed the images. Weighted distance variance, a measure of how variable eye movement is, is calculated 
using trace data that has a gaussian filter applied. Additionally, the mean brightness and variance of brightness in the 
images are also calculated. The weighted distance variance is compared for the children with ASD and the children 
without ASD. The two groups are also compared by their reactions to the brightness of the images. The data analysis 
reveals that variableness of eye movement can be used to differentiate children with ASD and children without ASD. 
However, the two groups‚Äô reactions to image brightness are found to be indifferentiable. 
 
1. Introduction 
The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children is an important task, as it allows children with ASD to 
get adequate and appropriate treatment during the developmental stages of their life. Current diagnosis techniques 
include monitoring the subject‚Äôs behavior throughout childhood and beyond, but there are no medical tests for ASD 
(CDC 2021). Treatments for ASD include cognitive behavior therapy and nutritional therapy, but are not 
standardized and can vary from person to person (NICHD 2021). With early diagnosis and treatment, autistic 
children can more effectively make progress against ASD and even completely move themselves off the spectrum 
later in life (NICHD 2021). However, many children go undiagnosed until they are older, and often do not get as 
many resources for their disability (Wiggins et al. 2019). Especially in children of minority groups, the accuracy and 
thoroughness of diagnosis is often less than the quality of diagnosis that white children receive (Wiggins et al. 
2019). Additionally, the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is a complex ordeal that could span months and 
years, which can leave the few unlucky to remain undiagnosed until they are much older. 
 
The purpose of the project is to study the variableness of eye movement and the brightness of the observed images, 
and whether they are behavioral indicators of ASD. With current technology and software, eye movement is 
relatively simple for people with access to technology to measure. Therefore, by thorough analysis of eye 
movement, the diagnosis of ASD in children could become more accessible to people, as it could be done directly in 
homes instead of at clinics and in tedious evaluations. Current research on the topic focuses on how trace paths of 
eye movement can be used to detect ASD. With deep learning models being used to diagnose ASD (Xie et al. 2019) 
and models using eye trace maps to analyze how often the subject makes eye contact (Solovyova et al. 2020). 
Moreover, convolutional neural networks, models that specialize in analyzing image data, have been used as well to 
give accurate and fast diagnoses of ASD (Fern√°ndez et al. 2020). This paper instead analyzes the isolated variable of 
the variableness of eye movement in relation to ASD and focuses on how the variable can be used to differentiate 
between children with ASD and children without ASD. Separate from previous research, this paper does not give a 
model for diagnosing ASD, but instead hopes to demonstrate why and how the variableness of eye movement can be 
used by predictive models to diagnose ASD.

390","hypothesis that childrens‚Äô reactions to the overall brightness of images would be different for children that have 
ASD when compared to the reactions of the children without ASD. Ultimately, the visual reaction that children had 
to the brightness of the images would not be helpful for differentiating between children with ASD and children 
without. 
 
The two tests comparing the variance of brightness of the images and the weighted distance variance returned 
statistically significant results of ùëüùëüùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥= 0.120 (ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥= 0.0376) and ùëüùëüùëáùëáùëáùëá= 0.128 (ùëÉùëÉùëáùëáùëáùëá= 0.0261). However, for 
the test regarding the variance of the brightness of the images, the P-value results were disregarded since the 
correlation coefficients were very weak and as there was no visual indication of a correlation. So, the analysis 
concluded that the childrens‚Äô reactions to images of greater or lesser variance in brightness were likely the same, 
which was reflected in both the ASD group and the TD group. Since the results of the test were the same for both 
groups, it was again concluded that the visual reaction that children had to the variance of brightness of the images 
would not be helpful for drawing a distinction between the ASD and TD groups. 
 
Overall, the analysis regarding brightness of images showed that sensitivity to brightness was not affected by ASD. 
Considering all correlation coefficients were weak or insignificant, it was reasonable to say that the eye movement 
of the children did not depend at all on the brightness of the images. The relationship between the brightness of the 
images and the variability of eye movement would not be helpful for diagnosis. 
 
4. Conclusions 
From the results of the analysis, the conclusion can be made that there is indeed an association between erratic eye 
movement and ASD. When comparing the distributions of the weighted distance variance of the children that had 
ASD and the children without ASD, a highly significant result of ùë°ùë°= 7.87 (ùëÉùëÉ= 1.64 ‚àô10‚àí14) was returned. This 
indicates that weighted distance variance could be used as a helpful measure of erratic eye movement to draw the 
distinction between children with ASD and children without. For brightness and eye movement, the difference 
between the two groups was not realized by the data. In the tests on the correlation between mean brightness of 
image and weighted distance variance, the tests for both the ASD and non-ASD group returned statistically 
insignificant results of ùëüùëüùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥= ‚àí0.0165 (ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥= 0.776) and ùëüùëüùëáùëáùëáùëá= 0.0557 (ùëÉùëÉùëáùëáùëáùëá= 0.337), meaning that there was 
no helpful distinction that could be drawn between the two groups using the mean brightness metric. Similarly, for 
the same tests performed on the mean brightness of image and weighted distance variance variables, significant but 
very weak correlation coefficients of ùëüùëüùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥= 0.120 (ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥= 0.0376) and ùëüùëüùëáùëáùëáùëá= 0.128 (ùëÉùëÉùëáùëáùëáùëá= 0.0261) were 
returned. It was found for both correlation tests that the mean brightness or variance of brightness of the images 
could not be useful for separating the ASD and non-ASD group for predictions, as the tests returned similar results 
for both groups. So, comparing the eye movement with relation to the brightness would not be helpful for making 
predictions or drawing distinctions between children with ASD and children without ASD. 
 
5. Future Research 
Future investigations of this project could gather more data with more children, which would make the sample more 
reflective of the population. Possible sources of error in the current analysis could come from biases in the sample 
itself, as a group of 14 children does not seem to completely encompass the population of children. Some questions 
to ask for future researchers would be whether there is a better way to analyze the eye movement of the children, 
other than using simple weighted variance. Future investigations could be done to answer questions about whether 
eye movement is a good indicator for diagnosing autism in children, compared to current methods. Determining 
whether the eye movement can be tracked and analyzed in real time would be an interesting follow-up to the current 
project. Moreover, similar analysis could be applied to different sources of data, such as features of the images 
instead of simply the behavior of eye movement (He et al. 2021).

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to determine whether playing video games is associated with happiness - both in short 
and longer terms. Previous studies have identified mixed results of video games on mental health. For this study, data 
was obtained through an online survey sent to teenage students in online and brick-and-mortar schools. Three variables 
were collected: hours spent playing video games per week, hours of sleep per week (as a confounding variable), and 
‚Äúhappiness‚Äù ranked on a scale of 1-10. There was an overall, undefined happiness and a ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù broken into 
satisfaction in three categories: academics, relationships, and extracurriculars. Because it was inferred that the average 
of the satisfaction in the three different categories did not fit with the overall happiness, the averages were used going 
forward. There were no significant results showing that sleep or ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù were different for people who did and 
did not play video games. The final test of association only indicated that the ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù of an individual in a month 
was associated with hours of sleep. Though the results do not suggest that happiness is associated with playing video 
games, there was enough evidence that happiness was associated with sleep in a month.

1. Introduction 
In the age of rapidly developing technologies, the Internet and video game industries have experienced rapid growth. 
As the new technologies are developed, many studies have researched the effects of 3C devices on individuals. Many 
studies focus on either side of the spectrum - researching the possible benefits of video games or the negative effects 
on cognitive skills. 
 
Teenagers in the US spend an average of over 7 hours per day on screen media and entertainment, and this excludes 
the time spent using screens for school and homework. ‚ÄúAmong teens, the amount of time dedicated to several 
individual screen activities inched up by 42 minutes per day since 2015‚Äù (Rogers 2019) and this time has certainly 
increased in the past years. Especially during COVID and lockdown, many individuals have turned to online sources 
of entertainment and the use of the internet in some areas have doubled. Researching the effects of internet use is more 
important than ever. 
 
Concurrent with internet growth, video games have become more prevalent and accessible as well. Over half of the 
individuals were reported to have at least one gaming console in their homes and mobile games have also been rising 
in popularity (Yau et al. 2012).  
 
With the increased amount of time spent playing video games, some people have defended the positive effects of 
playing video games and researchers have examined benefits. Some such benefits include improvement in attention, 
cognitive control (Green et al. 2012), and volumetric brain increase (Brilliant T. et al. 2019). However, these are 
typically not why teenagers decide to play video games. People play video games for fun and enjoyment, not because 
it improves certain cognitive skills. The cognitive skills are simply a side benefit.  
 
On the other hand, the negative effects of gaming give more insight to playing video games and the happiness that 
comes with it. One notorious impact of playing video games is addiction. According to the paper Brain activity and 
desire for internet video game play, ‚Äúthe brain circuitry mediating cue induced desire for video games is similar to 
that elicited by cues related to drugs and alcohol‚Äù (Han et al. 2012). This similarity is supported by similar activations 
in the regions of the brain. In particular, the dorsolateral prefrontal (executive function and response selection),

398","After that, a similar chi-square test was used, but this time using the data for a month instead of a week. A chi-square 
value of 44.17 was obtained. Since this is less than the critical value, the null hypothesis failed to be rejected: there is 
not sufficient evidence to show that there is an association between ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a month and hours of video games 
played. Similarly, to the previous test, this goes against the initial hypothesis. While the data in a week may not show 
obvious negative results (perhaps due to the fact that the negative effects have yet to surface and grow), a month was 
expected to be able to detect these possible negative effects. The lack of evidence showing the impact of video games 
on happiness does not question whether playing video games too much negatively influences mental health ‚Äì that 
much was agreed upon by previous studies. However, it suggests crucial information about the sample itself: no one, 
based on their answers in the survey, had played video games enough to exhibit negative effects. 
 
Next, it was to be determined whether there is an association between ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a week and hours of sleep. These 
two variables were tested for an association because it was originally hypothesized that hours spent playing video 
games may be related to hours of sleep, which in turn may relate to happiness. Hence, hours of sleep and ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù 
were to be tested for a possible association. After running the test, the Chi-Square Value of 45.49 was calculated. The 
degree of freedom is (7 rows - 1) * (7 columns - 1) = 36. The critical value for p<0.05 is 50.998. Because the statistic 
calculated is less than the critical value, the result is not significant, and the null hypothesis failed to be rejected. There 
is not enough evidence to suggest an association between ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a week and hours of sleep. This was not an 
unexpected result. While it was predicted that ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù and hours of sleep would be associated with one another, 
it was also noted that the short time period of a week may mask the results. An individual may not feel that lack of 
sleep in only one week influences his/her ‚Äúhappiness.‚Äù  
 
Next, another Chi-Square test was performed, but instead, this time using the data for ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a month and 
hours of sleep. A chi-square value of 84.03 was obtained. The degree of freedom is 36 (same as the previous test). 
Interestingly, this time the result is highly statistically significant because 84.03>50.998 (the test statistic is greater 
than the critical value for p<0.01). The null hypothesis is rejected, and we infer that there is an association between 
‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a month and hours of sleep. This is a significant result that suggests a positive relation between the two 
variables. Additionally, this result does fit in with the original hypothesis. However, regarding the larger picture and 
overall objective, this result by itself does not seem that crucial. The variable ‚Äúhours of sleep‚Äù was originally collected 
because sleep may be a confounding variable that can be influenced by the time spent playing video games and affect 
‚Äúhappiness.‚Äù However, in the first Chi-Square Test of association, an association between sleep and playing video 
games was failed to be detected. Therefore, even though sleep is associated with ‚Äúhappiness,‚Äù it is not related to the 
time spent playing video games.  
 
4. Conclusions 
The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between hours spent playing video games and happiness. 
The hours of sleep was collected as a confounding variable. The Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Test determined that the 
average of the three categories of happiness (satisfaction in academics, relationships, and extracurriculars) did not fit 
the overall happiness. Because the average of the three categories was more specific and well-defined, it was a better 
measure of ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in this study. This average was used for the other tests. In the study, the only significant result 
detected was that ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a month is associated with sleep; no results that suggested an association between 
‚Äúhappiness‚Äù and video games were detected. 
 
From the normal distribution in the Mann-Whitney test, no significant results were obtained. Three inferences were 
drawn based on the sample: 1) the average hours of sleep for people who do and do not play video games were from 
similar populations, 2) the ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a week of people who do and do not play video games were from similar 
populations, and 3) the ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a month of people who do and do not play video games were also from similar 
populations. The first result was not unexpected, for there could be people who spent little time playing video games 
and it would not influence their hours of sleep. Whether one plays video games or not, their average hours of sleep 
and ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in different time intervals were the same, indicating that video games do not appear to affect 
‚Äúhappiness.‚Äù These two results were unexpected and did not support the initial hypothesis that video games and 
‚Äúhappiness‚Äù would be from populations with different averages.  
 
From the Chi-square Test of Association, 5 inferences were drawn and only one result was significant - the test for 
‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a month and sleep. Firstly, there is not enough evidence to show that the hours of sleep and hours of 
video games are associated, which does not support the initial hypothesis that sleep is be a confounding variable that 
may be influenced by hours spent playing video games. Next, it was failed to be detected that the ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù of an

406","individual in both a week and a month and the hours of video games played were associated based on the sample in 
the study. Both these results also did not support the hypothesis that people who played games at a certain ‚Äúright 
amount‚Äù (0 minutes - 30minutes to 2 hours) would be happier, but people who played too much would actually be 
less happy. Lastly, while the ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù of an individual in a week did not seem to be associated with the hours of 
sleep, these two variables are associated when the time interval is a month. These two variables were initially tested 
for an association because sleep may have been associated with playing video games and happiness. However, from 
the first Chi-Square Test of Association, no association was detected between sleep and video games. Therefore, even 
when sleep and ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a month do appear to be associated, it does not have to do with playing video games, 
as original hypothesized.  
 
A possible explanation for these insignificant results that do not suggest a relationship between happiness and playing 
video games could be the small sample size. Perhaps the sample obtained was not representative of the population, 
which can be the case with samples consisted of volunteers. Additionally, because a survey was used to gather 
information, people may not have answered honestly. Even if the survey had reached people who actually had gaming 
addiction, they may have inputted lower times spent gaming or higher ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù than they were actually feeling. 
This would have led to inaccurate results.  
 
Some of this data does not support the original hypothesis, which was that ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù would be affected by video 
games. When one plays ‚Äújust the right amount‚Äù ‚Äì greater than 0 hours per week but less than 2 hours of video games 
per week ‚Äì it can make them happier. However, when one plays too much, it will affect the sleep they get, and hence 
make them unhappier. The statistical tests imply that happiness and sleep are mostly unaffected by video games. The 
only test that yields significant results other than the Chi-Square Test Goodness of Fit indicates that ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù in a 
month is associated with hours of sleep, but since sleep is not associated with video games, it does not really contribute 
to the overall objective of the study. Therefore, this study suggests that happiness and playing video games are not 
associated with one another, but happiness and sleep may be associated in the long term.  
 
5. Future Research 
For this study, three variables were analyzed: ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù of students in a week and month as well as their hours spent 
playing video games and hours of sleep. However, several possible factors may have impacted the accuracy of the 
results. Convenient sampling was used - the people who took the survey were volunteers. As a result, most individuals 
in the sample were Stanford Online High School students and few were from brick-and-mortar schools. Additionally, 
the survey indicated that approximately half of the online school students did not play video games, but this result 
seems inaccurate based on personal experience. Most of the researcher‚Äôs friends and acquaintances who are full time 
online students do play video games and many call together while playing up to hours of video games. Further 
repetitions of the study could use random selection (specifically stratified random sampling) to obtain a more 
representative sample and minimize sampling error. Another way to mitigate confounding variables could be to select 
all students from the same school (because for example, the curriculum and academics at Stanford Online High School 
is more challenging).  
 
An option for follow up studies would include analyzing causal relationships between these variables. Do video games 
cause less sleep? Does less sleep cause less happiness? Do video games impact the happiness of an individual (and in 
a positive or negative manner)? An experiment would be required instead of an observational study, since causation 
cannot be inferred from observational studies.

Abstract 
 
The authority of prosecutors in handling criminal cases alternatively in the Indonesian judicial system is 
very important to investigate. Therefore, it needs to be regulated in the draft revision of Law Number 16 of 
2004 on the Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Indonesia. Thus, in the draft amendment to the 
Prosecutor's Office, it must accommodate the values, customs and laws that live in the environment of 
society in the framework of the NKRI, which is Bhineka Tungga Ika, under Pancasila as the basis of Idil 
and the 1945 Constitution as the Constitutional Foundation of the Republic of Indonesia. Furthermore, this 
study found that the prosecutor's role is as a public prosecutor and as a mediator in resolving minor criminal 
cases alternatively as one of the solutions to anticipate the swelling of prison inmates and the swelling of 
the budget for inmates.

1. Introduction 
The Correctional Database System reports that the prisoners in Indonesia totalled 272,005 people scattered in 
prisons and financing for criminals while in Correctional Institutions. Throughout all regions in Indonesia. The 
expression of Agus Toyib, Bc.IP, MH Regional Office of the Ministry of Law and Human Rights in Aceh as one of 
the samples in this paper is explained from the 26 prisons and prisons in Aceh that only have 4090 prisoners/convicts. 
Still, until today, June 20, 2019, it is filled by 8,552 prisoners/convicts. If a solution t found quickly, this problem will 
become a big problem for the community, state and nation. 
Since ancient times until now, the sense of community justice in handling legal cases in the community such as 
theft, domestic violence, fights, traffic accidents and various other matters in the community prioritizes peaceful 
settlement by deliberation consensus. The culture and customs, and customary law have grown and developed from 
generation to generation in a pluralistic Indonesian society (Judiasih & Fakhriah, 2018). (Hadikusuma, 1992) stated

409","Indonesian criminal law and criminal procedural law are more oriented to humanitarian principles by values , 
culture, and customs. Customary law that applies in Indonesian society gives the prosecutor the authority to resolve 
minor criminal cases alternatively to anticipate the booming inmates of prisons and the high budget requirements for 
prisoners. The prosecutor's task, especially in minor crimes, is to delegate cases committed by criminal offenders to 
court. The essential issue is utilizing the community's sense of justice which must be obtained by these justice seekers 
who are the most priority. It can only take a solution if the prosecutor, as the public prosecutor, is given normative 
power and authority to resolve minor criminal cases.  
The customary government carries out the settlement of minor criminal cases. In the context of Acehnese customs, 
the village government is called the village government and carried out by  the prosecutor to reduce the buildup of 
issues in the judiciary and a sense of justice. The success of the rule of law is not marked by ""overdose of prison 
inmates"", providing protection for human rights and being able to create state administration apparatus and law-
abiding society. In addition, prosecutors who handle criminal cases, especially minor crimes, the law provides space 
for prosecutors in the form of alternative settlements of criminal cases that are under the sense of truth and justice of 
the community, so that it can have an impact on the accumulation of points in court.Prisons in Indonesia are 
overcrowded. This problem is an indicator of the failure of the rule of law.  
For a person suspected of a criminal act being processed to transfer his case to court, from the initial process until 
there is a judge's decision and sentenced to prison for 1 (one) month, it costs a minimum of Rp. 900,000 becomes the 
burden of the state‚Äîthe state (Article 34 Paragraph (1) of the 1945 Constitution), excluding law violators. The 
authority to settle cases of minor crimes alternatively  given to prosecutors to reduce the buildup of issues in court, 
reducing the burden on the state budget. Indonesian people who have a communalistic understanding, then resolving 
legal problems in society requires togetherness through deliberation and consensus, different from individual 
European institutions. It is necessary to question whether the criminal law product, which is the competence of the 
Prosecutor's Office in enforcing the law, has been sanctioned.  
The values and principles of the life of the Indonesian people in general who adhere to a collective understanding 
with very pluralistic culture and customs with the motto ""Bhineka Tunggal Ika"". The value of derivation manifests 
itself in the form of legal norms oriented to the principle of humanity in accordance with the culture and character 
adopted by the pluralistic Indonesian society. It should be integrated with the land of Indonesia to restore the dignity 
and dignity of the original law of the Indonesian nation. The intervention of the customary justice system into the 
criminal justice system is due to the prosecutor's authority to resolve criminal cases alternatively in accordance with 
the law and values that live, grow, and develop. In the community (Living Law), which leads to the Prosecutor's 
alternative criminal case settlement process. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The granting of the prosecutor's authority in handling criminal cases alternatively in the Indonesian justice system is 
very important, so it needs to be regulated in  Law Number 16 of 2004 concerning the Attorney General's Office of 
the Republic of Indonesia. Thus, in the Draft Amendment to the Law, the Prosecutor's Office must accommodate the 
values, customs and laws that live within society within the framework of the Unitary State of the Republic of

Abstract 
 
In the digital era, marketing plays a crucial role in creating the confidence to launch a new product rather 
than entering the market without exposure. For every business, marketing is essential to ensure long-term 
customer relationships with the organization's products or services. Therefore, the marketing system has 
switched from conventional to digital-based technology (online marketing). Following Indonesia's vision, 
a creative economy developed to promote creative digital marketing, particularly for small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs). Innovation through digital marketing brings out a variety of changes in the 4.0 
era. It will change the paradigm by marketing digital technology and driving up creative business economic 
factors. The various marketing programs and community benefits in the region will be improved, allowing 
these communities to enter the global market digitally in both areas. Thus, the present study aims to 
investigate innovative commercial marketing in the digital era 4.0. This qualitative study conducted through 
survey questionnaires, observation, and interviews. It intended to better understand natural phenomena by 
emphasizing the process of deep communication interaction between researchers and the phenomenon 
under study. The study's findings can lead to social developments in the two regions of Lhokseumawe and 
Central Aceh. Technological innovations in the transformation era and creative economy-based MSMEs 
can produce innovative products and various breakthrough sectors of the economy in global markets.  
Government intervention and SMEs and society must create jobs in the future and work closely with related 
parties to advance in the business world. The outcomes of MSMEs based on online marketing have the 
potential to generate competitiveness in the field. As a result, the two regions will serve as pilot districts in

very well. In three main areas, namely the marketing process, the ability to produce goods and services and the low 
quality of technology in this production sector, marketing is not innovative. It impacts the creative quality of the two 
regions. Bekraf, as the government representative, will oversee the sub-sector or participate in the growth of the 
businesses with visionary people. It is a core aspect of Bekraf and a global industry. The value of promoting the 
development of local marketing talent would undoubtedly be successful and innovate in different marketing, the use 
of business models from various regions and communities is productive and a knowledge source for the Community 
in the future. The strategy applied through a variety of other applications from upstream to downstream. 
 
Conclusion  
The influence of digital factors is very dominant, thus increasing the rate of capital and marketing factors based on 
the creative economy require cooperation from various parties to achieve progress in the business world. Furthermore, 
these factors will be analyzed and studied by examining trends and leading features of the Community's expertise. 
The value of technology for 4.0 years to market superior goods requires a governmental touch to encourage 
improvement on existing to help and monitor economic trends, whereas deviation is indirect. Rising capital rates and 
buying and selling that depend on the creative economy demand cooperation from different parties to progress 
throughout the future, particularly in marketing goods. The superior regional products that need developing The 
Marketing System massively dramatically determine the quality of the product and requires entrepreneurs or tenacious 
entrepreneurs to create target markets. The quality of the products marketed will provide more opportunities for local 
entrepreneurs, thus requiring an increase in the quality of goods to be sold in the regions. The quality of the products 
to be marketed will positively impact consumers and the production itself and significantly affect local entrepreneurs, 
local artisans, and foreign investors. Regional products exhibit various handicrafts, supporting the Lhokseumawe City 
Government and the Central Aceh City Government and other agencies that focus on developing SMEs in these two 
areas.

1. Introduction 
The goal of company can be achieved in the form of increasing profits or increasing the quality of the 
company to compete with its competitors (Budiono et al, 2021). However, to achieve this, sometimes the company 
does not pay attention to the surrounding environment where the company is only focused on increasing profits without 
seeing the environmental damage because of the strategy implemented by the company (Purba et al, 2020). Therefore, 
it is important for a company to implement a strategy that has been made as best as possible to improve the 
performance of the company itself (Adirinekso et al, 2020). In addition, company performance can increase depending 
on the company itself. 
Unilever itself has been established since 1800, which was originally a very small family business formed 
because of a partnership. Initially this business was only trading in butter, which was carried out by the Jurgen Family. 
Then in 1870 when he was successful in the Dutch market, Van den Bergh expanded his business to England which 
was one of the largest markets for selling butter at that time. Along with the development of the times, until 1894 
people started to get acquainted with cleanliness and hygiene. Lever brother finally created a new product known as

Abstract 
 
Maintaining brand equity is a key business strategy to increase market share. This paper wants to analyze the extent 
to which brand awareness, perceived quality, brand loyalty affects brand equity in a multinational company, namely 
Starbucks Co. The data analyzed consisted of 298 respondents who lived in the Jakarta area and outside the Jakarta 
area of Indonesia. Through statistical testing on data collected with Stata Release 15 Software, it proves that the data 
is reliable and valid. The methodology used is an econometric approach with multiple regression equation models 
with robustness requirements. The calculation result proves that the model is robust, and all selected variables have a 
significant effect on the 5% degrees of freedom. The results of this study suggest that maintaining brand equity must 
be influenced by consumer‚Äôs brand awareness, perceived quality, and brand loyalty.

1. Introduction 
The country of Indonesia is one of the ten countries with the most population. The range of population 
projections in Indonesia, estimated at 265 million, makes Indonesia the country with the largest population of almost 
one-third of the total population of the ASEAN countries (Budiono et al, 2021). Most of the Indonesia's population is 
filled with young people or who are in the productive age range of around 15-64 years (Purba & Budiono, 2019b). 
Because of it, Indonesia has a great opportunity to dominate the market in Southeast Asia and therefore also becomes 
its own attraction for domestic and foreign investors to take advantage of opportunities to invest and build businesses 
or their companies in Indonesia (Budiono & Purba, 2019). 
The effect of globalization has made the boundaries of economic activity between countries disappear, making 
it easier for multinational companies with a global brand to enter the country so that they converge into economic 
activities that involve many countries (Purba et al 2020). Products that are produced by foreign companies usually

they import raw materials from the country of origin to maintain the quality standards that have been determined  
(Budiono et al, 2021). This also triggers local companies to be able to innovate and adapt to the latest culture and 
trends to compete with global brands competitively.

1. Introduction 
The main objective of a firm is to maximize the value of the firm or wealth for shareholders. Firm value is an 
investor's perception of the firm that is often associated with the share price of a firm. The higher the share price, the 
higher the value of the firm, on the contrary if the share price is lower, the lower the value of the firm (Henriansyah 
and Dharmayuni, 2017). 
 
Automotive and component companies are part of the manufacturing industry in Indonesia. The automotive industry 
is one of the flagship sectors that continues to prioritize its development because it plays a big role in national 
economic growth (Baihaqi et al., 2019). The development of the automotive industry needs to continue because the 
automotive industry has a wide association with other economic sectors and also has considerable domestic market 
potential. With a lot of investment from the world automotive industry so as to contribute positively to the national 
economy and the absorption of professional labor in Indonesia as well as improving the competitiveness of 
Indonesian automotive products. 
 
However, during the last five years, 2015-2019, automotive and component companies experienced fluctuating 
share prices. This share price volatility is very interesting to study further, because it will have an impact on the 
value of a company. In 2016 the firm average share price decreased by 1.30%, in 2017 decreased by 12.49%, in

440","This research is in line with research conducted by Akbar and Fahmi (2020) which states that dividend policy has a 
significant effect on the value of the firm, but this result is not in line with research conducted by Utama and Dana 
(2019) which states that the dividend policy has no effect on the value of the firm. 
 
6.5 Effect of Investment Opportunity Set, Firm Size, Institutional Ownership and Dividend Policy on Firm 
Value 
Based on the test results above, it was found that Investment Opportunity Set, Firm Size, Institutional Ownership 
and Dividend Policy simultaneously affect the Firm Value. It can be a concern for the firm to pay more attention to 
these four elements. Investment Opportunity Set, Firm Size, Institutional Ownership and Dividend Policy may affect 
the Firm Value. These four elements can make a firm value go up or even down. 
 
The results of this research are in line with research conducted by Kartasukmana (2015) which states that Investment 
Opportunity Set, Institutional Ownership and Dividend Policy have an effect on the Firm Value and research 
conducted by Firmansyah and Suwitho (2017) which states that the Firm Size and Dividend Policy affect the Firm 
Value. 
 
7. Conclusion  
Then the researcher took some conclusions as follows: 
1. Investment Opportunity Set has no effect on the Firm Value in Automotive and Component Companies listed 
on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019.  
2. Firm Size affects the Firm Value in Automotive and Component Companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019. With the direction of influence given firm size the value of the company 
is negative.  
3. Institutional Ownership affects the Firm Value in Automotive and Component Companies listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019. With the direction of influence given firm size the value 
of the firm is negative.  
4. Dividend Policy affects the Firm Value in Automotive and Component Companies listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019. With the direction of influence given firm size the value of the 
firm is positive.  
5. Investment Opportunity Set, Firm Size, Institutional Ownership and Dividend Policy affect the Firm Value in 
Automotive and Component Companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019.

Abstract  
 
The development of organizations in Indonesia is increasingly rapid and competitive. One of the growing 
organizations in Indonesia is a cooperative. Cooperative is a form of business that is characterized by togetherness 
or based on kinship. In Indonesia, cooperatives are engaged in various fields to achieve community welfare. At first, 
cooperatives were a collection of people who had a lower level of the economy, where through cooperatives they 
both wanted or had a goal to improve their welfare. Nationally, the number of registered cooperatives is more than 
adequate to support the people's economic movement. This means that if the existing number has a paradigm, 
ideology, and a real cooperative spirit, it will become a very large force and provide guarantees for economic 
sustainability that is based on the spirit of self-help and cooperation. This condition actually became the ideals of the 
founding fathers of the nation when they had to choose the economic model to be built when the world was divided 
into 2 (two) models, namely capitalism and socialism. Cooperatives have similarities with the original social system 
of the Indonesian nation, namely collectivism. The Indonesian gotong royong community likes to help each other.

Cooperatives, People's Economy, Business Entities, Family, Gotong Royong.

the international arena. 
Of the many things described earlier, of course, data collection on the community's industry is very important for 
regional economic progress. Because according to Christian Messakh, the number of industrial units in the Bogor 
district is estimated at more than 10,000 units. Until now, from the results of direct involvement in the field with the 
relevant agencies, the local government has confirmed that 2000 MSME units have been registered on the MSME 
special web. This data collection will continue to be carried out consistently by conducting socialization and inviting 
industrial community activists to participate. 
In addition to entrepreneurs getting strategic points in marketing, registered MSMEs will be given guidance and 
training by the government. With this provision, it is hoped that the local community's economy can be much more 
effective and advanced. It is planned that the debriefing is scheduled after July with a target of 1000 participants and 
will continue as needed. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Cooperatives and MSMEs, especially micro, must build the synergy of the two institutions to be necessary. Because 
the potential for micro-enterprises, especially those associated with cooperatives, is quite large. First, the dominance 
of economic activity in Indonesia in terms of a large number of MSMEs. Second, micro MSMEs have the fighting 
power to survive in a difficult economic era. This is verified by history. Third, MSMEs when they join cooperatives 
have strong bargaining power with third parties. Because cooperatives with legal entities will easily access capital, 
provide guidance to their members and have the opportunity to prosper together. Fourth, there are requirements for 
synergy, namely improvements to cooperatives so that regulations are strong enough, professional management, 
access to capital opportunities, and assistance from both central and regional governments. 
Cooperatives must keep up with the times and utilize digital considering that in the covid era, physical interaction is 
very limited so that innovative business actors by utilizing digital technology have far more potential to access better 
markets. With assistance from the government local, technically it accommodates the role of the parties in digital 
marketing and educates business actors to have the capacity to take advantage of access to digital marketing.  
It is necessary to formulate policies that are implementable in the form of programming and activities by the 
Department of Cooperatives and MSMEs in Bogor Regency to strengthen and empower cooperatives, in the form of 
Changes in business models and management and services.

1. 
Introduction 
Optimization of Regional Original Income (PAD) became a phenomenon that appeared in almost all districts / 
cities in Indonesia after the enactment of the era of regional autonomy. The local government can manage and manage 
its own government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and auxiliary duties and each region is given the 
authority to manage finances derived from the Regional Original Income (PAD). According to (Rahmawati, Somaji 
and Adenan, 2019) Broadly speaking, the implementation of fiscal decentralization is one form of solution undertaken 
by the government to improve and equal the welfare of the community by transferring power from the central 
government to the local government through authorities in the government financial sector. increase in Regional 
Original Income (PAD) becomes one of the fiscal instruments that can not be avoided in building the regional economy. 
According to Mardiasmo (2002), Regional Original Income is revenues obtained from the local tax sector, regional 
levies, the proceeds of regionally owned companies, the results of the management of regional wealth that is separated, 
and other legitimate local revenues.  One of the efforts to improve the ability in the field of funding the implementation 
of local government for economic growth development is to increase and explore every potential that exists in each 
region, and small medium enterprises (SMEs) in telematic field is one of the sector which is potential to develop 
according to industry 4.0 (Tosida et al. 2018, Tosida et al. 2019, Tosida et al. 2020) . According to (Akmaliyah, 2013) 
The amount and increase of adequate PAD contributions will determine the level of independence of the District /City 
Government in its regional development so that it does not always depend on assistance from the Central Government 
and provincial governments. The effort is always carried out by the Bogor City Government by always trying to 
increase the Regional Native Income (PAD) and Economic Growth. Various obstacles faced by the Bogor City 
Government in optimally improving regional native income and economic growth in the city of Bogor, including 
efforts made by the Bogor City Government during the covid-19 pandemic which is an extraordinary event that must 
be as soon as possible to find a solution to every problem that exists. According to Bima Arya, the Mayor of Bogor, at 
the PAD Evaluation Rackor mentioned that pad evaluation rackor is not just pursuing the annual routine target, but is 
intended to build a system so that pad Bogor city can be improved for the benefit of the community (Kotabogor.go.id, 
2019). The following is the report on the Realization of The Original Revenue of Bogor City in the Regional Revenue

This study does not require a regression coefficient test (Test F), because this study only uses 1 independent variable 
namely Regional Native Income (X) and 1 dependent variable namely Economic Growth (Y), which there are no other 
variables together to be tested against dependent variables that are economic growth. 
 
4.   Conclusion 
This study aims to determine the optimization of Regional Native Income to Economic Growth in Bogor City in 
Fiscal Year 2015-2020 (Covid-19 Pandemic). By using 1 variable X namely PAD and 1 variable Y namely Economic 
Growth. Based on the discussion that researchers have discussed dibab previously the author concluded as follows: 
1. Bogor Municipality always strives to improve PAD, starting from service to the community, which is now not 
only conventionally available to bapenda offices but taxpayers can pay their taxes through banks, post offices, 
alfamart, indomaret, QRIS BJB mobile cars, Tokopedia, open stalls, link aja, blibli, gojek, PPOB Masago, and 
PPOB bayarin aja. In addition, prospective taxpayers can also report sppt through online websites. Then, by the 
time of 2020, pandemic comes and the economy is very down. Including regional income, because during the 
pandemic all are limited to quarantine and freeze activities in order to break the chain of the covid-19 virus. Bogor 
City Government continues to find ways to keep regional revenues running even during pandemics like this. 
Therefore, there is a policy of leniency in paying taxes for taxpayers such as extended tax payment period, 
reduction of tax payable by BPHTB, free of UN fines, free of administrative sanctions on payment of local tax 
receivables (self), reduction of BPHTB payments, unanized tax discounts P2 and others. The waivers are done to 
relieve the taxpayer but the area still has the usual regional revenues. 
2. Economic growth in Bogor city is monitored quite well. Bogor city as a strategic city for economic development

1. Introduction  
The progress or destruction of a country depends on the youth, this has been felt by Indonesia which was able to 
achieve independence thanks to the struggle and role of the youth. Since the time of independence until now, youth 
organizations in Indonesia have continued growing and take various forms. One form of youth organization in 
Indonesia is Karang Taruna. Karang Taruna is a forum for the development of the non-participant young generation 
that grows on the basis of awareness and a sense of social responsibility for the community, especially the younger 
generation in the village or sub-district area or an equal social community engaged in social welfare (Salmah et al., 
2020).  
As a youth social organization, Karang Taruna is a forum for fostering and developing as well as empowering in an 
effort to develop productive economic activities by utilizing all the potential available in the enviroenment, both 
human resources and existing natural resources (Baesti, 2017). Karang Taruna is a forum that can help the government 
in solving social problems that exist in the community and can also be a forum for the development of rural 
communities. The purpose of establishing youth organizations is to provide guidance and empowerment to youth in a 
village or region in the fields of economy, sports, skills, religion and the arts (Angkasawati, 2018). In addition, youth 
organizations were established together youth workers and channel their potential to develop and become supporters 
in the development of a village or region.  
One of the Youth Organizationa located in Cibinong Village, Bogor Regency, West Java, Indonesia, named Karang 
Taruna Cibinong Village. Realizes how important the role of youth in the area is build the welfare of the community. 
However, the background of the youth in Cibinong Village who only graduated from high school makes many youths 
in this village are still unemployed. The low level of education of the youth makes it difficult for them to find work. 
In addition, the lack of soft skills from the youth makes them less confident to apply for jobs because they will compete 
with graduates from diploma and undergraduate programs. Turistiati and Ramadhan (2019) Soft Skills are abilities 
beyond technical and academic abilities that prioritize intra and interpersonal skills. Soft skills include motivation, 
character, attitudes, self concept, values, self confidence, communication skills and others.

5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the discussion that has been stated above, it can be concluded that there is an increase in the 
soft skills of the Karang Taruna youth in Cibinong village. This can be seen from the increasing understanding of each 
training variable given. The highest increase in the first order is in the psychological test variable, the second is the 
grooming variable, the third is general questions, the fourth is interview techniques and CV making, and the fifth is 
the use of social media to apply for jobs. Young people think that by participating in preparatory training to enter the 
world of work, their knowledge will be improved and the process of applying for jobs can be carried out more 
effectively and efficiently.

ABSTRACT 
 
One of the government's efforts to realize a responsive law is to implement laws such as the implementation of 
Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine. The problems studied are how to apply criminal 
sanctions in Law Number 6 of 2018 for violators of Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) in the Jabodetabek 
area and what obstacles are faced in implementing criminal sanctions against PSBB violators and what are the 
solutions. The research method used is normative legal research which is supported by empirical research, while 
the data collection technique uses library research and field research. The results of the study indicate that the 
application of criminal sanctions in Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine is in the form of 
imprisonment and fines. Obstacles encountered in the application of criminal sanctions against violators of 
Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) and efforts to resolve them include unclear references to articles 
regarding criminal threats in regional regulations regarding PSBB. Another obstacle is the lack of precise 
application of criminal sanctions against PSBB violators. As an effort to overcome this obstacle, namely, the 
application of criminal sanctions against PSBB violators is the ultimum remedium or last resort.

1.  Introduction 
Indonesia's national development aims to promote the general welfare, to create a just and prosperous society 
based on Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia (UUD 1945). To achieve this goal, 
the Government of Indonesia seeks to develop and strengthen all sectors of people's lives, including health. This 
is in accordance with the right to live needs of Indonesian citizens as reflected in Article 28H paragraph (1) of 
the 1945 Constitution, which states that: Everyone has the right to live in physical and spiritual prosperity, to 
have a place to live, and to have a good and healthy living environment and has the right to obtain Health 
services are realized through the development of the health sector. Health development according to Article 3 of 
Law Number 36 of 2009 concerning Health, aims to increase awareness, willingness, and ability to live healthy 
for everyone, to realize the health status of the community as high as possible, as an investment for the 
community. development of human resources (human resources) that are socially and economically productive. 
 
In realizing health development, of course, it is accompanied by the development of law in it, because all 
implementing instruments and their enforcement require legal instruments. Legal development can be 
interpreted as fostering the law and improving legal policies in a better direction. Therefore the law must be able 
to carry out the role of guarding the realization of the desired development goals, which in the development of 
the law include the development of legal materials, legal structures including legal apparatus, legal facilities, 
and infrastructure as well as legal awareness and culture. 
 
One of the government's efforts to realize a responsive law is to implement laws such as the implementation of 
Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine. This law is used as a legal umbrella to prevent the spread 
of the pandemic Corona Virus Disease 19 (Covid-19), namely by implementing Large-Scale Social Restrictions 
(PSBB). As is known, on December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office 
reported a case of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On January 7, 2020, 
China identified pneumonia of unknown etiology as a new type of coronavirus (coronavirus disease, COVID-
19). On January 30, 2020, WHO has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
(KKMMD/PHEIC). The increase in the number of COVID-19 cases is happening quite quickly and has spread 
between countries.

481","Data on reports of PSBB violations throughout 2020. Of the total 8,345 reports that were accommodated in the 
Rapid Community Response (CRM) system, as many as 8,155 or 97.7% were successfully followed up by the 
ranks of the Jakarta Government. 
5.2 Obstacles Faced in Implementing Criminal Sanctions Against Large-Scale Social 
Restrictions Violators and Efforts to Get Out 
Article 93 of Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine has clearly stated that anyone who does not 
comply with the implementation of health quarantine and/or hinders the implementation of quarantine health to 
cause a public health emergency shall be punished with a maximum imprisonment of 1 (one) year and/or a 
maximum fine of Rp. 100,000,000.00 (one hundred million rupiah). However, in practice, the implementation of 
these criminal sanctions still encounters several obstacles. The following is a list of these obstacles and their 
solutions. 
1. 
The unclear reference to the article regarding criminal threats in the regional regulation on PSBB; 
If you examine Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine, PSBB is indeed a form of 
implementing health quarantine which is explained in Article 15 of the law that PSBB is a form of activity 
from health quarantine at the entrance and in the region. However, what must be considered in Article 93 
of Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine is the next element, namely causing a public 
health emergency. 
 
To ensnare someone with a criminal threat, every element in the criminal article must be fulfilled, Article 
93 contains an element of consequence, that violations of actions in the PSBB can be punished if they 
cause a public health emergency. Meanwhile, what is meant by a public health emergency in Article 1 
number 2 of Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine is an extraordinary public health 
incident marked by the spread of infectious diseases and/or events caused by nuclear radiation, biological 
pollution, chemical contamination.  bioterrorism, and food that poses a health hazard and has the potential 
to spread across regions or across countries. This means that PSBB violations in the form of not complying 
with or hindering the implementation of PSBB can be punished only if they result in extraordinary public 
health events marked by the spread of infectious diseases that have the potential to spread across regions or 
across countries. 
2. 
The lack of precise application of criminal sanctions against PSBB violators in the PSBB Covid-19 
pandemic situation 
Is one manifestation of the health quarantine. In DKI Jakarta, the Police have enforced the regulation, even 
though the PSBB in DKI Jakarta was only effective on April 10. A total of 18 (eighteen) people were 
arrested for not heeding the call for social distancing at Bendungan Hilir and Sabang. The article imposed 
in Article 93. This sanction article was criticized and deemed inappropriate. In a press statement Number: 
012/Humans/KH/IV/2020 dated April 8, 2020, Komnas HAM stated that instead of imprisonment, PSBB 
violators should be punished with sanctions and/or social work. 
 
The main reason is that the current condition of the prison is overcapacity. The Ministry of Law and 
Human Rights even released 30 (thirty) thousand inmates for that reason. It would be contradictory if, on 
the one hand, the government gave freedom, the apparatus actually carried out arrests and imprisonment. 
Another reason is that the application of sanctions is not in accordance with the principle ultimum 
remedium (criminal law being the last resort of law enforcement). In addition, sanctions for fines and/or 
social work are considered more appropriate to raise awareness, be more useful, and encourage solidarity 
among others. 
3. 
The difficulty of implementing Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine in all regions 
In its implementation, Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine will be difficult to apply in all 
regions. This is because the condition of each region has a different level of vulnerability so that it affects 
the policies taken by the region. 
 
As an effort to solve the problems above, local governments can make policies in the form of regional 
regulations, so that they can overcome various problems that arise due to the spread of Covid-19 in their 
regions. The Covid-19 pandemic not only requires solutions from the health and economic fields but also 
responds with a socio-cultural approach because the increasingly wide spread of the virus and the difficulty 
of overcoming this pandemic are more of a socio-cultural problem than a health problem.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The application of criminal sanctions in Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine for violators of 
Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) in the Greater Jakarta area is in the form of imprisonment and fines.

488","The imposition of criminal sanctions on violators of PSBB rules must be applied objectively, rationally and 
proportionally as a means of deterrence and public education to realize the impact of Covid-19 as well as a 
means of social control so that people comply with the rules of social distancing and physics distancing. 
Obstacles encountered in the application of criminal sanctions against violators of Large-Scale Social 
Restrictions (PSBB) and efforts to solve them include unclear references to articles regarding criminal threats in 
regional regulations regarding PSBB. In the context of accelerating the handling of Corona Virus Disease 2019 
(Covid-19), which must explain precisely what actions in the PSBB, if not implemented, will result in a public 
health emergency, only then can regional regulations implement PSBB in accordance with clear boundaries. 
Another obstacle is the lack of precise application of criminal sanctions against PSBB violators in the Covid-19 
pandemic situation. As an effort to overcome this obstacle, namely the application of criminal sanctions against 
PSBB violators is an ultimum remedium or last resort.

narcotics. Narcotics now touches all levels of society and is very detrimental to the state. In order to find a 
solution to this problem, narcotics is often the object of study from law and criminology. This paper purposes to 
analyze the impact of the use and trafficking of narcotics in Indonesia and law enforcement on narcotics crimes 
in Indonesia. The method used is socio-juridical using a statutory approach, case approach, and criminology. 
The data used are primary data and secondary data obtained through interviews, literature study and document 
study. All data collected were then analyzed qualitatively. The results showed that the direct impact of drugs on 
the human psyche/mental is causing mental depression, serious mental disorders/psychotic, causing suicide, and 
causing crime, violence and destruction. The factors causing narcotics crimes in the jurisdiction of the Kutai 
Barat Police Department, which the authors managed to get from the field study, could be caused by many 
factors, both internal (family, economy, personality) and external (intercommunication and social/community) 
factors. Law enforcement is an effort to bring the ideas of justice, legal certainty and social benefits into reality. 
The efforts made by the Kutai Barat Police Department in overcoming narcotics crimes that occurred in the 
Kutai BaratRegency and Mahakam Ulu Regency were carried out in two ways, namely preventive (prevention 
before the crime occurred) and repressive (after the crime). 
Keywords: criminological studies, Indonesia, narcotics use and selling.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this research was to analyze the relationship between the Net Promoter Score (NPS), broadly used in 
industry, with dichotomous word-of-mouth (WOM) metric to gain more insight into customer satisfaction. The NPS 
is an indicator, which its author claims to be the ultimate question that industry practitioners should be increasing. The 
NPS system works with a single question: How likely are you to recommend our company to friends and family? This 
methodology classifies the status of interviewed clients into three groups using an eleven-point Likert scale: the ones 
answering from 0 to 6 are treated like detractors, the ones answering 7 and 8 are treated like passives and the ones 
answering 9 and 10 are treated like promoters. The methodology of this research was quantitative and exploratory. 
The data collection was through a probabilistic approach with a self-administered survey presented by waiters on a 
tablet in a full-service restaurant. The chosen statistical method was a logit regression towards suggesting a scale 
transformation; the reason to do so is to face one of the most criticized characteristics of the NPS system, which is the 
lack of justification while clustering. The results show evidence that the relationship between metrics is statistically 
significant. The originality of the article resides in the contribution of a complementary metric on the NPS system. 
Instead of making three big groups, the logit approach comes up with a probability of word-of-mouth intention for 
each of the responses to achieve more insight for each type of client in the original classification.

1. Introduction  
The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a broadly used indicator in industry related to customer satisfaction (CS). Even 
though it is one of the most used and popular indexes, it is also one of the most controversial and criticized by 
researchers and academics. Reichheld, its author, published an article in 2003 in the Harvard Business Review 
proposing this one-question-eleven-Likert-scale-point as a solution for the industry and claiming that this metric is the 
one that most business should be growing, paying attention to reach CS and thus loyalty. 
 
Customer satisfaction has been an important subject of study in social science since it has been related as an outcome 
of reaching customer‚Äôs expectations (Zeithaml et al., 1996), usually through business performance and having 
beneficial behavioral outcomes, such as repurchase, loyalty, word-of-mouth intention, and so on (Chen, 2012; 
Garbarino & Johnson, 1999; Lee et al., 2020). 
 
Parsa et al. (2005) acknowledge CS as a very important factor for success in the 800+ billion-dollar restaurant industry 
(National Restaurant Association, 2020), which has been struggling since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
a situation that makes it especially important to gain insight into new customer‚Äôs behavior knowledge so it can be 
applied in industry, thus helping companies to thrive during the lockdown.

6. Conclusion  
The main research question in this paper aims to know how the NPS clusters clients could be better, so in this fashion, 
the data shows that the probability of detractors to recommend varies a lot. The value of 0 in the NPS means a 0.22% 
probability that the client would be willing to recommend, while the value of 6 on the NPS represents above 81.45% 
of the probability. If NPS is claimed to be a predictor metric of some other outcomes, such as loyalty and growth 
(Reichheld, 2003), a serious concert is derived from this investigation regarding the arguments and reasons about NPS 
treating the same way responders from 0 to 6, which in all probability implies going from 0 to up to 80%, making 
predictability, in this case, of willingness to recommend very inaccurate.

496","It is also important to analyze the behavior of the cumulative frequencies of the probabilities, as well as the change of 
the previous values (or deltas) all along the NPS scale. The greatest substantial change goes from the punctuation 4 to 
5, which change probability to recommend in 29.44%, having a cumulative probability of 55.30%. Following the same 
exercise, moving a client from 5 to 6 aims to have a delta of 26.15%, having a cumulative probability of willingness 
to recommend from 55.30% to 81.45%, which is also a very clear sign that the post-purchase efforts with clients 
clustered as detractors should be differentiated according to the score. 
 
The managerial implications of this research are to provide NPS users with a complementary metric to enhance the 
decision-making derived from this metric. One of the most common arguments coming from managers using NPS 
about not asking many questions in customer satisfaction surveys has to do with delivering a good user experience 
and not overwhelming clients. This companion metric does not require extra information from the clients, while 
companies could gain extra insight for their post-purchase strategies. 
 
There are some limitations and future research lines that are acknowledged. The first is that this research was only 
carried out in one brand of restaurant, even though the sampling was done in different branches. This implies a 
limitation to properly making inferences about the whole full-service restaurant industry, so future investigations could 
repeat the research with a broad sampling in a confirmatory approach. The second limitation is that this research was 
done in the restaurant industry, and NPS is broadly used in pretty much all industries, so it may be important to also 
assess some other industries in a confirmatory approach with this approach. The third limitation is that both, NPS and 
the willingness to recommend (WOM) are self-reported. It may be interesting to use different sources of information, 
like having real return data (from loyalty programs or credit cards) and the previous scores from NPS. This research 
approach would be really powerful because instead of working with recommend or return intention, the new data 
would be about behavior, which is more accurate than intention.

Abstract 
 
At present, SMEs are facing problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In Indonesia, COVID-19 has put pressure 
on the economy of the entire country, resulting in an impact of 3% to 16% of PDP. The COVID-19 pandemic also 
resulted in Indonesia's economic growth dropping to 2.3%, and a threat to the stability of the financial sector. The 
weakening in terms of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on households, companies, and 
SMEs. The problems faced by many SMEs in all industrial sectors, including the creative industry sector, are cash 
flow problems, supply chains, and changes in public demand. This article will discuss that the current state of the 
COVID-19 pandemic demands changes to SMEs in the creative industry in Indonesia. SMEs need to explore new 
things but at the same time maintain existing businesses or carry out ambidexterity. To do ambidexterity, SMEs need 
to obtain external resources to increase internal resources, so it is necessary to build social networks and good 
cooperation with external parties. Social networks can provide a variety of external resources, both tangible and 
intangible, so that they can overcome resource shortages and increase the ability to perform ambidexterity. The output 
of this research is a comprehensive model that describes a framework to be tested empirically.

Abstract 
 
In the early years of the lengthening history of usage of discrete-event system simulation, its primary domain of 
application was manufacturing and assembly operations; indeed, the automotive industry was one of its early 
adopters.  In the last few years, the range of application of this valuable industrial-engineering analytics tool has 
greatly expanded to include delivery of health care services (e.g., hospitals, clinics, pharmacies), improvement of 
supply chains via application to warehousing and transport operations, government services such as airports and 
mass transit networks, and the consumer sector (hotels, retail stores, and delivery of services such as grooming 
and hair care).  The project described in this paper is an application of discrete-event process simulation to a resale 
retail store (one of a franchise) which buys and resells gently used children‚Äôs clothing, toys, books, equipment, 
and furniture.  The project successfully addressed challenges faced by the store management; these challenges 
comprise long queues (especially for resale), misallocation of resources, and consequent dissatisfaction of store 
employees, customers seeking to buy from the store or sell items no longer needed to the store.

1. Introduction 
Historically, the first extensive uses of discrete-event process simulation were in the manufacturing sector of the 
economy, and this usage continues to expand and deepen (Wenzel et al. 2019).  In intervening years to the present, 
applications of discrete-event process simulation have expanded extensively into health care (Bruballa et al. 2015), 
transportation systems (V√∂gl et al. 2018), military applications (Jnitova, Elsawah, and Ryan 2017), public utilities 
(Szpak, Tapamo, and Roy-Aikens 2008), and the retail/service sector.  Examples of simulation studies in the retail 
service sector are (Vallette et al. 2009), which studied process improvement in the receiving area; (Siebers et al. 
2008), which examined various customer experiences via agent-based simulation; and (Ramesh et al. 2018), which 
used simulation analysis to reallocate service personnel at a hair-styling salon. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:  The next section presents an overview of the operation of 
the store from the viewpoints of both buyers and consigners.  Next, we describe the data required by the model 
and describe the collection of those data.  Next, we present the process of building, verifying, and validating the 
simulation model.  Subsequently, we describe the results provided by the model and our analysis of them, leading 
to recommendations provided to the franchisee management. and owners.  We conclude with a summary of the 
project and indications of likely future work. 
 
2. Overview of Store Services and Operations 
Once Upon a Child is a retail resale store that buys and sells gently used children‚Äôs clothing, toys, books, 
equipment and furniture.  This store is part of a franchise and is unique in that the suppliers are everyday 
customers.  Therefore, there are two categories of customers: ‚Äúbuy-customers‚Äù or Customers, who purchase items 
from the store and act as suppliers, and ‚Äúsell-customers‚Äù or Suppliers who sell their items to the store.  It is 
relatively uncommon, but entirely plausible, that a particular person plays both roles on one visit to the store; for 
example, the mother of a child one year old may sell clothes fitting a small baby and buy toys appropriate for this 
child.  The primary stakeholder is the store owner; the secondary stakeholders include the employees and 
customers/suppliers.  The business problems addressed by this project are (1) the store is experiencing long queues 
in its buying process and (2) may be inappropriately utilizing its resources.  ‚ÄúDual-role‚Äù stores (e.g., pawnshops, 
consignment shops) have these typical ‚Äúproblems in dual,‚Äù pertaining to both types of customers, as described in 
(Horwitz and Shilling 1989).  The analytical problems confronted by such stores are receiving increased attention; 
for example, (B√°nyai, B√°nyai, and Ill√©s 2017) have proposed a ‚Äúblack-hole‚Äù algorithm to optimize their supply 
chains.

While this particular model was built with metrics specific to the Once Upon A Child store in a relatively small 
town in mid-Michigan, the methodology can be applied to other locations within the broader franchise.  To do 
this, data must be collected on the locations‚Äô service times and arrival rates, as well as the distribution for the time 
Customers spend in the stores.  For new locations, service times can be derived from other locations in the region 
and the arrival rates can be approximated through the new location‚Äôs population and the current arrival rates 
experienced by existing regional locations.  An extension of the work in this model could be to examine the effect 
of various realistic Employee Work schedules on the average time spent in the system for both Customers and 
Suppliers, analogously to recent work by (Yung et al. 2020).  In this model, the number of Employees remains 
constant throughout the day, but could conceptually be any combination of different employees and shifts to 
achieve that number of Employees.  In the actual system, the Employees have constraints on their availability and 
desired shift schedule, making such flexibility more complex to model.  Further work could add varying shifts 
with differing Employees, who may also have their own service time distributions.  These components could be 
combined to create a more realistic simulation that could prove useful in determining an optimal work schedule 
that allows for an acceptable amount of waiting time in the system for Customers and Suppliers alike. 
 
Another extension of this work would be to add balking and reneging components typically experienced by 
businesses of this type. For our simulation, we were unable to obtain data regarding typical balking and reneging 
behavior within the store.  However, this would give a more complete simulation of the business model (as appears 
in (Pazgal and Radas 2008) and would allow the stakeholder to more accurately target efforts towards eliminating 
either or both of these profitability-reducing behaviors.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between the values and attributes of the loads in the forged 
rings in materials such as nickel, titanium and waspaloy in furnaces for their heat treatment, the effect on the 
preparation time, duration and stabilization of the temperature of the furnaces, to be within parameters and be able to 
carry out the loads and start their holding time according to the recipe assigned for their heat treatment. Applying the 
factorial analysis method, it is possible to identify a reduced number of significant factors that can represent the 
relationship of the independent variables set, as well as a multiple regression analysis that allows the establishment of 
a system for estimating or predicting the time it takes for the furnace to operate the preheating and to receive the 
programmed charge. 6,135 data of the loads between of the year 2018 and 2019 were collected, the results had a total 
variance of 64.61%, a KMO index of 0.620 and a Bartlett sphericity test with a significance of 0.00. The study 
significantly identifies three important factors on the time of preparation of furnaces obtained from the factorial 
analysis, which are: the conditions between loads that represent 33.203% of the total variance, the temperature 
precision for the load 18.149% and the exposure of matter in ovens 13,263%. From the factors identified in the 
multiple regression analysis, it was obtained that the relevant variables are: the temperature difference with respect to 
the previous load, the weight of the load, the load of the holding time and the treatment temperature for its maintenance 
has a significant impact on setup time. The result of this research benefits programmers to formulate load sequencing 
more efficiently in the heat treatment area.

1. Introduction 
The thermal treatment of the material is one of the fundamental steps so it can achieve the mechanical properties for 
which it is created (Burgos, Rodr√≠guez, Svoboda, & Surian, 2018). 
 
This type of process consists of heating and cooling a metal in its solid state to change its physical-mechanical 
properties. With the appropriate heat treatment, internal forces can be reduced, grain size, increase toughness or 
produce a hard surface with a ductile interior (Guzm√°n, 2018). The key for heat treatments consists in the reactions

Figure 9 shows the results and indicate that there is a strong and significant relationship between the preparation time 
in ovens and the independent variables previously exposed (F = 1313.350, with a significance <0.05). Figure 9 shows 
the value R2 = 0.600, indicating that the independent variables explained 60 percent of the variation in the preparation 
or preheating time in ovens. Figure 10 shows the individual determinants, it was found that the temperature difference 
between loads (Œ≤ = -0.714, t = -64.603, p = 0.000 <0.05). This was followed by the weight of the load (Œ≤ = 0.458, t = 
53.615, p = 0.000 <0.05), the time of holding or soaking (Œ≤ = -0.251, t = -26.981, p = 0.000 <0.05) and the treatment 
temperature (Œ≤ = 0.148, t = 7.346, p = 0.000 <0.05). All the variables are found with a significance lower than 0.05. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study has identified three important factors such as the conditions between charges, the temperature accuracy for 
the charge, and the mass exposure in ovens. In addition, this study also established that there is a substantial association 
with the temperature difference between loads, the tons of the load, the holding time or soak, and the treatment 
temperature. This study has some limitations. This document considers only eight independent variables: the type of 
the loads heat treatment, the number of pieces or batch size, the load weight, the alloy hardness, the treatment 
temperature for its support, the furnace tolerance for its stabilization, the load holding time and the temperature 
difference based on the previous load, excluding the number of pieces or lot size as it is not significant in the analysis. 
This study consists of a dependent variable, the preparation time or ovens preheating. In the future, similar studies 
could be carried out by adding more number of dependent variables that allow the exposed phenomenon to be 
explained more fully. This study was done only in the heat treatment area of the Aerospace plant. A similar study can 
be expanding for the rest of the forging plants. The results of this research are relevant to determine the priority order 
of the variables that allow generating the programming sequencing that increases the efficiency of the heat treatment 
area, and consequently, reduce the stay time of parts and the cost of travel. Using the multiple regression, a model is 
generated which allows predicting the expected time to prepare the furnaces for batch loads of rolled rings.

Abstract   
 
Hot Dip Galvanizing is one of the oldest and more used methods to protect steels substrates from corrosion due to the 
good corrosion resistance of the Zn coatings. This work studies the effect of the addition of small amounts of Ni to 
hot-dip galvanizing bath on the corrosion behaviour of hot-dipped Zn rich coating using open circuit potential (OCP), 
electrochemical noise (ENM) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the Zn-Ni 
coating alloys exhibit nobler potentials and low current density indicating the increase of the corrosion resistance of 
the sample due to the protective effect provided by the oxides formed on Zn-Ni coating alloys. However, the corrosion 
products allow the mass transfer of aggressive species showing a semi-infinite behaviour. The protective effect shows 
a relationship with the Ni amount employed. The hot-dip method for deposition of ZnNi coatings using 0.5% Ni 
exhibit the best performance.

1. Introduction   
One of the oldest ways to protect steel or iron from corrosion is by immersion in a molten zinc bath known as the hot-
dip galvanizing process. The hot-dip galvanizing process is commercially relevant and widespread in the industry. The 
treatment consists of submerging steel on a Zn rich bath to obtain a coating over the surface (Abdel Hamid et al. 2010). 
To improve the corrosion resistance of Zn coatings the research on this field is open (Belleze et al. 2006).  
 
The basis of this galvanizing process lies in obtaining a series of layers of intermetallic compounds, produced by the 
diffusion that takes place when the piece is submerged in the bath, mainly constituted of molten Zn, although it can 
count on small amounts of other elements. The corrosion protection that hot-dip galvanizing can provide is 
proportional to the thickness of the coating, therefore, the life span of galvanized steel depends on the thickness and 
the environmental conditions in which the coating is located. The objective of hot-dip galvanizing is to obtain a series 
of intermetallic layers, from the diffusion of the molten Zn on the surface of iron or steel.  
  
Furthermore, Zn-Ni coating alloys have been reported to provide higher corrosion resistance, better properties of 
machining such as weldability and formability, and an increase in temperature resistance in comparison to pure Zn 
and other coatings formed by Zn alloys (Vourlias et al. 2001).

522","In general terms, results obtained are similar to those observed on the Nyquist diagrams; during the first immersion 
hours, the plots exhibit a higher resistive behaviour (R1 and R2) that decreases as corrosion time proceeds, evidencing 
the loss of the protective properties and the increase of the diffusive phenomena. Additionally, is observed that the 
sample with 0.5 Ni exhibits a higher resistance R1 and R2 than those displayed for the pure Zn and Zn-0.1%Ni 
indicating that this amount of Ni added provides better corrosion resistance.  
  
Despite the degradation of the Zn-Ni galvanized samples, results acquired indicate that the low amount of addition of 
Ni enhances the corrosion resistance of the samples. This is in agreement with the work reported in the literature 
(Guosheng et al. 2013) and with the results determined on this work.  
 
5.3 Validation  
To validate the results and the behaviour determined, the impedance modulus in the low-frequency region (Figure 3 
(a)) and the linear polarization resistance (Figure 3 (b)) were plotted. The results display a similar behaviour amongst 
both techniques indicating that the corrosion protection decreases as immersion time proceeds. Figure 3 (a) evidences 
that the Ni addition enhances the impedance modulus leading to higher corrosion protection of the samples. On the 
other hand, the linear polarization technique Rpol shows a minor contribution of the Ni addition to the corrosion 
performance of the samples but the trend prevails along immersion time.  
 
  
 
Figure 3 (a) Impedance modulus in the low frequency and (b) linear polarization resistance of the hot-dip galvanized 
samples.  
  
6. Conclusion  
The corrosion characterization of hot-dip galvanized steel samples covered with Zn, Zn-0.1%Ni and Zn0.5%Ni was 
performed and several conclusions can be derived. The results obtained indicate that the coating displays a stratified 
developed by the intermetallic phases Œ∑, Œ∂, Œ¥ and Œ≥ related with the Zn diffusion process. Also, the existent phases 
changes with the Ni amount added leading to the formation of a two and three-layered structure as Ni amount increase. 
The composition of the coating remains almost constant, evidencing the presence of crystalline phases attributed to 
simonkolleite, zinc hydroxide, zinc and Ni.  
  
The corrosion behaviour of the samples shows that the samples exhibit at least two electrochemical processes related 
to the charge transfer and the protective behaviour of the coating and the oxide layer. Additionally, the mass transport 
is evidenced attributed to the displacement of aggressive species through the corrosion products layer developed. The 
impedance modulus and the polarization resistance slightly increase with the amount of Ni added. The protective effect 
of the layer decreases in a short time but trends to stabilize as immersion time proceeds.

Introduction  
Customer service is a differentiator in a highly competitive market, and the human factor is responsible for putting 
this service into practice (Solnet et al. 2019). The team members have several soft skills that allow them to: generate 
experiences that the customer wants, increase sales, and promote loyalty towards the organization (Heskett et al. 2008). 
The service approach in the organization has the purpose of satisfying the needs presented by the customer (Wagner 
et al. 2019). The service constitutes the fundamental experience where the contact between the organization and the 
customer occurs, this is known as moments of truth (Carlzon 1991). To keep or loose a prospect or customer depends 
on these interactions. It is necessary for organizations to view customer service as the essential factor where their 
existence and/or permanence in the market lie (Agudelo & Saavedra 2013).  
 
Albrecht (1990) proposed the customer service triangle. In which he positions team members as one of the key 
elements within this model. The team members are those who represent the organization in the customer‚Äôs experiences 
(Baker et al. 2010). They are the ones who can cause an emotional connection, a unique bond of warmth and trust. 
When team members achieve the human touch in the service experience, a competitive advantage of the business is 
guaranteed (Bowen 2016; Mody et al. 2019).  
 
This is how soft skills in team members who are in direct contact with customers require special attention (Faizal et 
al. 2019). Heckman & Kautz (2012) quote the Collins English Dictionary in which soft skills are mentioned as qualities 
that do not depend on the knowledge acquired and are of relevant value in some positions. Soft skills are made up of 
common sense, the ability to deal with people, a positive attitude, and flexibility (Nickson et al. 2012). Hurrell (2013) 
defined soft skills as non-technical skills, nor related to the abstraction of reasoning, that is, they are interpersonal and 
intrapersonal skills, which enhance and improve the performance of team members. They are character traits, attitudes, 
and behaviors. Soft skills are the intangible and specific skills of the personality that determine the strengths of the 
leaders, facilitators, mediators, or negotiators of an organization (Savaneviciene et al. 2014). Those who have them 
can develop interpersonal relationships, increase job performance, and have better professional prospects (Robles 
2012; Faizal et al. 2019).  
 
Certain universities and studies carried out on executives previously investigated soft skills to find out which of them 
were important in the labor market. These include, among others: hospitality, teamwork, effective communication, 
problem solving and motivation (Robles 2012; Singh & Jaykumar 2019).

Abstract   
  
One of the critical challenges of traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a lack of discriminant ability, 
particularly if there is a relatively large amount of variables with respect to observations. To overcome this problem 
and uncover some essential messages behind successful business operations, this research introduces an advanced 
decision making scheme that combines fuzzy robust principal component analysis (FRPCA) and context-dependent 
data envelopment analysis (CD-DEA) to handle the performance measurement task. FRPCA condenses a large 
amount of information into some essential and manageable elements, while CD-DEA derives the learning path of 
each observation to reach an assessable benchmark. The introduced scheme not only yields a precise performance 
evaluation outcome, but also equips it with forecasting capability via artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. The 
introduced scheme, examined by real cases, is a promising alternative for performance forecasting and evaluation.

Abstract 
 
This work attempts to evaluate the consortium-based Ph.D. program in Technology Management at Indiana State 
University to offer needed curriculum changes applicable to modern time. Through over two decades of existence, the 
program has sought to update its curriculum to keep it relevant. Topical coursework concerning Technology 
Leadership, the Management of Technical Experts, Production Processes and Control, Fundamentals of Technical 
Finance, Project Management, Technology Marketing, Philosophy of Technology, and the Strategic Management of 
Technology is under consideration for inclusion in the curriculum. Increasing professional communication and 
collaborative proficiencies, promoting moral and ethical discourse concerning technology use, mastery of skill and 
professional discipline, and the ability to contribute to an ever-increasing diverse and complex professional 
community is sought to make the program more robust. Topical information content in terms of core and elective 
courses with the corresponding credit hours, skills, and experience necessary before admission and before graduation 
have been discussed in this paper. The discussion will be useful for universities in the US and outside that offer Ph.D. 
in Technology Management program or plan to offer in the near future.

1. Introduction 
Technology Management links engineering-related fields and management disciplines toward planning, developing, 
and implementing technological capabilities. It is pursed to shape and accomplish the strategic and operational goals 
of organizations. The field of Technology Management focuses on developing technical and management skills of 
people, projects, and business and industry operations. It involves the intentional supervision, control, application, and 
diffusion of innovation and technologies to better the intended individual, organization, or human civilization as a 
whole. The speed of technology transfer and technology diffusion, involves technology identification, selection, 
acquisition, and exploitation, which are critical toward reaching organizational strategic and operational goals.  
 
However, the field of Technology Management can be thought of as a dichotomy too. Effective practitioners of 
Technology Management are concerned with the technology producer's viewpoint before technology deployment and 
the technology user's viewpoint upon technology deployment. This dichotomy promotes the use of applied science to 
determine and resolve technology-related problems. Technology management education and research activities cover 
this dichotomy of concerns, and the various disciplines, roles, and applications of both viewpoints.  Whereas science 
deploys the scientific method to answer questions about the physical world, technology management deploys the 
scientific method to answer human-made, technological issues. As society becomes ever more complex due to human-
made technology use, through technology management the need to address the issues that arise from this complexity 
increases.  
 
Through earlier work, McKirahan et al. (2020) compared five Ph.D. programs in Technology Management in the 
United States. Indiana State University (ISU) offers one such program, which is consortium-based. They reported that

546",,"Finance, Project Management, Technology Marketing, Philosophy of Technology, and the Strategic Management of 
Technology, etc.; hence such topical coursework is under consideration for inclusion in the curriculum. Increasing 
professional communication and collaborative proficiencies, promoting moral and ethical discourse concerning 
technology use, mastery of skill and professional discipline, and the ability to contribute to an ever-increasing diverse 
and complex professional community is sought to make the program more robust and manageable.  
 
In addition to maintaining a relevant curriculum that is applicable to modern time, another advantage of curriculum 
revision is to provide flexibility to students and advisors to conduct more independent studies. The current curriculum 
offers five specializations or concentrations. The proposed change by adding a custom specialization allows this 
flexibility to students and faculty to study and explore subjects that seem to be beyond the existing concentrations.  
 
This paper adds knowledge to the area of Technology Management curriculum for Master‚Äôs and doctoral degrees. The 
discussion will be useful for universities in the US and around the world that currently offer Ph.D. in Technology 
Management program or plan to offer in the near future.

Abstract 
 
Several publications address topics such as continuous improvement, Lean, and Toyota Production Systems 
in manufacturing organizations.  However, these same topics have not been addressed deeply for higher 
education institutions (HEIs).  As an HEI business unit, a classroom is a small complex group of persons 
interacting during a short time to achieve an organizational/personal goal.  Therefore, applying TPS 
principles in an HEI classroom could be a strategy to achieve stakeholder goals.  This paper has two purposes: 
to traduce TPS into a classroom and define behaviors expected from main participants in a classroom for each TPS 
principle.  To achieve these goals, the authors followed three steps: literature review, research method and data 
collection, and definition of the TPS principles and behaviors. Lastly, in the discussion section, the authors address 
topics such as research limitations and future works.

1. Introduction 
The Toyota Production System (TPS) principles, systems, techniques, methodologies, and tools have been applied in 
different service organizations (e.g., hotels, hospitals, and higher educations to improve their performance metrics).  
Recently, a high level of papers related to continuous improvement projects has been published to addressed multiple 
problems in higher education institutions (HEIs), such as improving the education system using Lean Six Sigma 
(Haerizadeh and Sunder, 2019), Lean Six Sigma methodology to improve service process (Li et al., 2019),  defining 
state of the art in the application of Lean Six Sigma in HEIs (Cudney and Furterer, 2020), and increasing quality 
service in a master degree program (Gonzalez Aleu et al., 2021).  However, from the authors‚Äô perspective, there are 
several topics that have not been addressed deeply in HEIs, as the implementation of TPS principals in a classroom, 
as well as students‚Äô and professors‚Äô behaviors to increase the dissemination of knowledge.

In the end, we have to remember that several of the TPS principles, systems, and tools were created or implemented 
to guarantee Toyota¬¥s financial health.  Universities used metrics like the number of students per faculty to assess an 
HEI classroom profitability; however, to authors‚Äô knowledge, there are not metrics to measure HEI classroom 
financial health in terms of knowledge dissemination.  An economic quantification of waste in an HEI classroom 
could be used as an initial approach to assessing HEIs classroom financial health.  Table 6 shows different behaviors 
that could help to impact on HEI classroom business health.

5. Conclusion 
Ideal behavior from professors and students could improve the performance of the knowledge dissemination and 
outcomes from this process (see Figure 1).  To achieve the initial research goal, the authors used the following steps: 
define the HEI classroom as a business unit, study for the different quality meanings in education, use four publications 
from authors that had firsthand TPS knowledge, map HEIs classroom process, and group the TPS factors or lessons 
in the four main TPS principles. 
 
An initial list of behaviors was documented using the author‚Äôs academic experience.  Although this research has some 
limitations, such as among of literature included in the research, HEI classroom mapping, and behaviors definitions, 
the authors believe that this could be used as initial work to conduct future work with more research methodology 
research.  For example: a SLR of TPS principles, identification of faculty and student behaviors observing a full day 
of work, and complement TPS application in HEI classroom with other educational concepts, as excellence in higher 
education.

Abstract  
 
The study demonstrates how organizational culture through traits developed in the workplace is connected to the 
organizational citizenship behaviors and provides significant results produced through training processes on how 
employees can improve their behavior in their work environment this investigation was worked in an international 
steel company located on Monterrey, Mexico the study is quantitative and cross-sectional has been performed for 5 
(2015‚Äì2019) years divided into six stages. The instrument consists of 70 questions, divided into two sections; section 
number 1 shows the organizational citizenship behavior questions within 39 questions adapted for Organ, Podsakoff 
and MacKenzie (2005). In section 2 the instrument contains 31 questions corresponding to organizational culture 
developed by Fey and Denison (2003), Thus, the questionnaire consists of a Likert scale number 1 to 5. The sample 
was 830 suppliers, the results was worked to SPSS 21 where first the data was proceed worked in Alphas of Cronbach, 
after that within SPSS 21 analyzed the multiple linear regression process were obtained as R Square, Durbin Watson, 
and Correlation to identify the relationship between organizational culture traits and organizational citizenship 
behaviors, and the conclusion the authors explains different ways to work about the results and considering future 
investigations.

participation remains constant over the years, with the exception of 2019 where adaptability and mission was 
highlighted, during the 2016 (June) ‚Äì period, and 2019, lastly, the mission stood out on four occasions such as 2015, 
2016 (January), 2017 and 2018.  
6. Conclusions  
Through the development of the present study, it was noted that the organizational citizenship behavior help has a 
relationship within cultural trait of participation being constant within coworkers, they were involved inside the 
progress of their functions in this process to formation. The cultural traits corresponding to consistence, adaptability 
and mission started to be significative since the personal company were involved in the capacitation. The 
organizational citizenship behavior loyalty was established in the organizational culture through adaptability trait, 
feeling identified with the organizational mission, in contrast with the organizational citizenship behavior compliance 
that is observed when the coworkers are participants and are part of the company, aware of their aims and specific 
targets. 
The organizational citizenship behavior initiative is reflected within the participation, adaptability, and consistence 
traits as part of their organizational culture, which is practiced every day, it should also be noted that the behavior of 
civic virtue is observed thanks to the features of organizational culture, such as adaptability and participation, on their 
part the organizational citizenship behavior of self-development has a significative influence on the adaptability and 
mission traits. 
 
Answering the question planted in the study of identify to the organizational culture trait that mostly influences to the 
organizational citizenship behavior is Adaptability trait, so that the company increasing the organizational process 
likewise cultural traits, enabling the development to organizational citizenship conduct, such as the help, compliance, 
initiative, civic virtue, and self-development which were present since the beginning of the study. 
 
It is important to mention that the organizational culture traits of adaptability and consistence were manifested on the 
organizational culture subsequent to the capacitation during the process to the organizational conduct for example, 
help, loyalty, compliance, initiative, civic virtue, and self-development. The organizational citizenship behavior self-
development was only reflected two years after the capacitation, when the organizational cultural mission trait was 
identified for the personal, in this way the self-development allows the coworker to feel identified with the 
organizational mission, moreover the organizational citizenship behavior sportsmanship does not demonstrate 
relationship in no way organizational culture traits.

Abstract 
 
Subitizing, the ability of people to unconsciously and accurately count sufficiently small quantities of objects, is 
heavily tied to both visual perception and a somewhat fundamental understanding of mathematics. Peripheral vision, 
despite its wide range, has relatively poor visual acuity relative to central vision, which is primarily used when one 
focuses on an object. By using a custom testing interface (which flashed an image for a specific duration of time) and 
logging the result, it was possible to see the effect that peripheral vision, and by extension its reduced perception, had 
on the ability of one to subitize. The results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference for the 
accuracies between central vision and peripheral vision, but such a difference was not found between near peripheral 
vision and far peripheral vision. 
 
Keywords 
Subitization, counting, perception, peripheral vision, numbers. 
 
1. Introduction 
Subitization allows humans to visually deduce the quantity of a group or category of objects given that the number is 
less than 5 (Campbell, 1976). When one uses this process of subitizing, they can instantaneously recognize the 
numerosity of objects with almost absolute certainty (Kaufman, 1949). In this study, I investigated the connection 
between visual perception and subitization by testing the effect of different forms of vision on one‚Äôs ability to precisely 
subitize a small group of objects. 
 
Peripheral vision allows people to see objects that are outside the focus of the eye. Although central vision within the 
focus requires most of our mental resources, such as memory and attention, and allows us to see things with sharp 
detail, peripheral vision enables us to view objects around the entire visual field. However, peripheral vision has 
relatively poor acuity relative to foveal vision (Strasburger, 2011). Testing one‚Äôs ability to subitize the number of 
objects presented to the peripheral vision compared to central vision will thus unveil whether visual resolution has a 
significant effect on subitization ability. While previous research has studied the perceptual aspects of subitization, 
this study will give some insight into the ability of humans to parse and count while simulating visual hindrance. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
I collected and analyzed data to evaluate the ability of people to accurately subitize the number of objects in a drawing 
along different angles of vision and the time in which an image was presented. I intend to find the accuracy of 
subitizing across different modes of peripheral vision and effects of the presentation duration on participants‚Äô 
performance. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Researchers concur on the idea that people are able to subitize instantly up to numbers less than five.  A study by 
Campbell (1976) flashed afterimages, rather than displaying images, to force participants to subitize over direct 
counting, and the results indicated an almost instantaneous response for quantities less than or equal to four. Unless 
given the opportunity to linearly count, Cordes (2001) found that the variability of a person‚Äôs response grows 
proportionally to the number displayed, indicating that the perception of numbers persists for larger numbers. Despite

578","6. Conclusions 
Based on the data collected and statistically analyzed in this study, I have been able to illustrate that the mean precision 
is different among tests from different angles of vision (F = 47.5, p < .001.). However, I have been unable to detect 
such a difference exists between near and far peripheral vision (same as for previous sentence‚Äîneed ot report the 
actual values!). Despite the relatively large amount of data points tested, the p-values for statistical significance should 
be considered as an upper bound due to the small amount of people tested. The convenience sample could have also 
caused further confounding of the variables.

Abstract 
 
The pandemic has changed the lives of everyone. To adapt to this unexpected situation employees in most sectors 
have shifted to remote working and it has become the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù almost overnight. Therefore ‚Äútelecommuting‚Äù 
has suddenly become a quite popular concept. This current paper systematically reviews the available literature under 
remote working practices and its impact on employees. It was identified that previous research has focused on different 
categories of factors. Therefore, the identified factors were categorized accordingly. Also, the impact on employees 
were closely studied. The current study was conducted through a systematic review of literature using the PRISMA 
framework. 36 studies which were carried out before and during the pandemic from different countries and sectors 
related to remote working has been reviewed. Based on the findings of the current review proper guidelines have been 
provided for the decision makers of organizations and directions for future research has been provided.

1. Introduction 
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of a global disease called COVID-19 on the 11th of 
March 2020 (Mostafa 2021) which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Peeri et al. 2020). The 
pandemic has changed the which is known to us in the past. Many countries around the world imposed nationwide 
lockdowns to mitigate the spread of the virus and ‚Äòflatten the curve.‚Äô People were required to wear masks, wash their 
hands, and keep at least a meter distance between each other in public places (El-Elimat et al. 2021). As of now 
globally there have been 230,418,451 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 4,724,876 deaths. The battle against 
COVID began to develop a vaccine and in December 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs (BNT162b2) and Moderna 
(mRNA-1273) mRNA vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the US (El-Elimat et al. 2021). As of 22 
September 2021, a total of 5,874,934,542 vaccine doses have been administered. Because of the lockdown most of 
the offices were closed and employees had to adapt to the practice of working from home (Anderson and Kelliher 
2020) to resume economic activities in the most convenient manner. As of now people around the world have been 
restricted in their homes for almost two years. Many employees are used to the practice of working in an office with 
their fellow colleagues. Therefore, many people around the world would have a significant psychological impact 
which would last for a long period of time. The psychological impact on employees should be focused more than other 
factors. There is currently a need to develop proper policies and guidelines to protect the most important resource, the 
employees of an organization. To fulfill this need, the factors that are most affected in remote working, should be 
properly identified. A systematic review of literature has been conducted to identify evidence on the impact of remote 
working on individual workers. The identified factors were categorized accordingly to identify the most influenced 
factors. In addition, the gender differences of these impacts were identified. The evidence from the studies were then 
used to develop recommendations for employers to improve the health of their employees and carry remote working 
practices in a more effective manner, during its highest peak of adoption. Also, there is a need to shift the research 
focus on how to get the most out of remote working (Wang et al. 2020) in the context where remote working is not 
simply an option for employees anymore.

583","The study done by Molino et al. (2020) introduces a scale called the technostress creator‚Äôs scale. The study revealed 
that workload was positively related to technostress, work-family conflict, and behavioral stress.  
 
The final broad category of factors which was identified is COVID-19 related factors. The study done by Raiesene et 
al. (2020) during the pandemic talked about motivation to telework during COVID-19 and discovered that women 
preferred to work from home more than men. Khan (2021) studied the relationship between social media 
misinformation and perceived COVID-19 threat. It was discovered that the relationship between the two factors 
triggered anxiety and social media fatigue among the selected sample of teachers. Afonso et al. (2021) study 
introduced the factor concern about COVID-19 which moderated the negative relationship between remote working 
and social isolation.  
 
Most of the studies have talked about factors which affect teleworkers. But the study done by Page and Vella-Brodrick 
(2009) talked about a unique concept of teleworking. They have defined the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow‚Äù of 
teleworking. According to the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äù concept employee well-being consists of: subjective well-being, workplace 
well-being and psychological well-being. The ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù is the importance of employee well-being for the organization. 
Finally, the ‚ÄúHow‚Äù of employee well-being, how well-being can be enhanced.  
  
 
5. Conclusion  
The current paper has systematically reviewed the literature related to remote working effect on employees conducted 
both before and during the pandemic. The studies show that each author has defined the same variable in different 
ways. This has been done to match the industry and the context of the study. Studies done before the pandemic shows 
that there is positive relationship between remote working and other factors. But studies also reveal that prolonged 
remote working can lead to a negative outcome. It was also evident that most of the studies have focused on the 
psychological factors of employees. The current review reveals that when teleworkers are supported by their 
organizations, they are more productive. Therefore, organizations should focus more on making the work from home 
experience more comfortable for their employees. 
The future research conducted in remote working specially during the pandemic should focus more on specific 
industries and different types of economies.

Abstract 
 
The last mile logistic is the delivery to the end consumer and it is the most important step when considering the entire 
logistical distribution process involved in e-commerce. Analyzing the process backwardly, there are many concerns 
about how to ensure that the product reaches the customer in a satisfactory manner, as the operations have high 
distribution costs, are polluting, and/or low efficient. There are several vehicles placed on route to serve different 
regions within the same city. There are often areas with heavy traffic that demand efficient planning of routes and 
delivery times. In this context, technology becomes a strong ally of the last mile. Technological revolutions over the 
past 60 years have enabled greater connectivity and integration in product distribution, and the adoption of smart tools 
connected via IoT, mobile and AI is crucial for companies that want to thrive in this environment. Based on a survey 
and literature review, the objective of this work is to identify which are the last mile delivery alternatives available on 
the market to relate them to the customer's perception regarding delivery preference, and the environmental impact 
inherent in the choice. As a result, this study showed that the age of the respondents is a factor that can influence their 
perceived safer mode of last mile delivery.

1. Introduction 
With the advance of coronavirus, everyone had to adapt to the practice of social isolation to protect themselves. Bars, 
shops, and restaurants were also affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and had to reinvent themselves. E-commerce has 
become existing even in this non-online environment and has since adapted to new customs and demands, due to 
social distancing. In this context, we can separate e-commerce into two phases: pre- and post-pandemic. 
 
The pre-pandemic phase showed a greater growth in internet use and highlighted the shift of consumers to the 
preference of making their purchases digitally than in person in physical stores. Companies and businesses were 
already looking for better experiences for consumers to make e-commerce a big trend. However, although the 
expectation was high, it would still take years for digital commerce to exceed sales of physical stores. 
 
During the pandemic many companies closed or reduced workloads, as a result of traffic restrictions aimed at reducing 
contagion among people. In this situation, companies saw no other way than to reinvent themselves and start selling 
through digital channels, accelerating digital transformation. 
 
According to E-commerce Brazil (2020), Brazilian e-commerce earned R$ 9.4 billion in April 2020, an increase of 
81% over the same period in 2019. The categories that had the highest volume of purchases were food and beverages, 
musical instruments, toys, electronics and bed, table, and bath. 
This significant increase directly impacted the companies because it was necessary to review inventories, movement, 
storage and transportation, the latter being the one that brings the most impact on the customer's perception, because 
it is the stage that realizes the sales cycle and, which brings more challenges to entrepreneurs, since it involves high 
operating costs.

The results of this study corroborate with the findings of the Green Button Project, that a consumer decision can be 
highly influenced when they see a minor data of environmental impact. Moreover, the present study correlated the 
preference with the age of the respondents, which can also give insights when analyzing safety and consumer 
perspective for green last mile delivery. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper aimed to bring for discussion the current alternatives used in last mile logistics in Brazil, acknowledge by 
a population sample with a range of age from 18 to 60 year or more. After one week, it was possible to gather data to 
analyze the customer‚Äôs preference regarding different ways of receiving purchased stuffs, not limiting to food or bigger 
home appliances. Then we correlated the respondents age with their perceived safer mode of distribution by running 
a correspondence analysis test in R software. 
 
As a result of the analysis, we could conclude that older respondents consider bicycles safer rather than drones, vans, 
reception boxes and motorcycles, as the younger do. However, bicycles are not the top #1 preference between 
customers. Giving this, we can infer that even being the safer delivery mode, the customers consulted would rather 
prefer to receive their deliveries in a faster or less secure way. 
 
Limitations of this study are the number of respondents, which could be higher to generalize results, and that the 
answers of the respondents correspond to their opinion in a specific period of time. We must consider that the 
respondents‚Äô opinions can change once they get more information about other distribution modes. Future works may 
expand the survey questions, in order to investigate further the reasons that make respondents feel safer with a 
distribution mode when compared to another.

Abstract  
 
The Industrial Engineering capstone projects at Tecnologico de Monterrey (ITESM) are usually affected by several 
uncertainty factors: scopes poorly defined by the company; variable levels of collaboration with company 
personnel; ignorance about the company, and some technical methods by the students. In the Feb-Jun 2020 
semester, this complexity increased due to the COVID19 contingency. The management of academic projects 
under these levels of uncertainty to achieve the satisfaction of students, clients, and teachers is indeed a challenge. 
This article presents the results of an innovation methodology for managing full-immersion projects using the 
Scrum-based Project Management tropicalized to academic assignments. The pilot test was carried out in the Feb-
Jun 2020 semester with 30 students. The experimentation group (5 Scrums) used Scrum with three Scrum sprints, 
weekly 20-minute Scrum meetings, and three complete, customer-validated deliverables. The control group (3 
projects) used a project charter, progress presentation, and deliverables at the end of the semester. The exit surveys 
answered by students, companies, and professors show that agile project management improved the experience 
and results for all the people involved, supported by Analysis of Variance with a 5% significance level.

1. Introduction 
In the last year of Bachelor, students in the Industrial and Systems Engineering program have the opportunity to 
work on projects with companies. Projects have high levels of uncertainty caused by: Companies with unrealistic 
or un-defined objectives and scopes, conflicts of interest with the project, and poor collaboration with 
students; teams of students who do not know any aspect of the company and its culture, also quite possibly lack 
of knowledge of specific technical tools to use for the project. Ensuring the quality of learning of the students 
and the quality of the product delivered to the company in these projects of high uncertainty represents a 
challenge for the academy. 
 
Usually, the capstone projects are defined in a Project Charter generated in the first three weeks of work with a 
presentation of progress in the middle of the semester and delivery of the results and proposals for improvement 
at the end of the semester. The results of this management have a high variability of the levels of satisfaction of 
students and companies concerning the achieved results, the level of communication, and the flexibility of reach 
and deliverables. Given this scenario, it is crucial to have better methodologies or ways to deliver to the 
company a quality project, where students can carry out more effectively and efficiently project management.

602","group‚Äù. The corresponding box plot also depicts the difference in means between group 0 (control) and group 1 
(experimentation). Finally, a power and sample size test is performed to verify the level of power from the test due 
to the sample size. The calculations show high power levels (98% - experiment group, 100% - control group) that 
indicates the sample size is sufficiently large to identify mean differences in the study.  
 
The communication levels among the stakeholders in both groups of projects are analyzed in the second ANOVA 
(lower side Fig. 6). The results show similar perceptions among students, project leaders, and advisors from both 
groups. The teams in the experimental group that used Scrum as a project-management methodology were ranked 
much better in communication outcomes than the teams in the control group that used the traditional approach to 
project management. Test powers are also close to 100% providing certainty that the sample size, although small, 
is sufficiently large to identify significant differences between group means.  
 
Overall, the results were promising, leading to continuous application of Scrum-managed projects for outreach, 
capstone-like projects for our students, especially in these times of high uncertainty caused by the COVID19 
pandemic. The survey includes variables of the respondent's role, type of company, type of project, sources of 
project information which support the overall finding of better project performance with the Scrum methodology. 
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements. 
It is planned to continue with this innovation in future semesters to expand the sample size, as well as the analysis 
of the impact of variables such as project type, scope, and type of companies on the levels of satisfaction of students 
and companies with the projects. 
 
5.3 Validation. 
All of the hypotheses were tested using ANOVAs done in Minitab, showing that indeed the Scrum-based projects 
were better for student and stakeholder satisfaction (Fig. 5) and adaptability to scope change and stakeholder 
communication (Fig. 6). Normality was monitored in the results, which were statistically significant with p-values 
equal to zero in all four hypotheses presented here.  
 
A special concern was the sample size since the projects were done only by students to-be-graduating, which 
usually are less than 60 people per cohort. This concern was addressed through the application of ‚Äúpower and 
sample size‚Äù test in Minitab, using as inputs the experiment levels, maximum mean differences, and pooled 
standard deviation. All power results were higher than 97% for each group, indicating that even the ‚Äúexperiment 
group‚Äù sample size was sufficiently large to identify the mean differences in all four variables. Fig. 7 shows the 
power test results from Total Satisfaction ANOVA, indicating the power per sample on the left side and the power 
curve on the right side. Group 1, the smallest sample size (13 students), has a power of 97% which means a high 
probability to correctly reject the null hypothesis.

6. Conclusion 
The integrative projects of the course IN3044 Industrial and Systems Engineering Projects (IIS) linked to training 
partners have high levels of uncertainty in the definition of their scope; the level of commitment, technical 
knowledge, and cultural differences of those involved. Managing these projects of high uncertainty through the 
agile management of Scrum, adapted to the specific conditions of the team and the company is the heart of the 
proposal tested in the semester February-June 2020 in 8 projects. With the participation of 30 students, 4 teachers,

610","and 8 different companies, it was possible to create two groups of projects: 1) experimental with agile Scrum 
management and 2) control with traditional project management. The teams faced various changes in scope and 
deliverables through the specific management of the project, the main change being remote work for the entire 
team as a result of COVID-19. The results of the proposal show significant evidence (mean perception difference 
of 20 points with a significance level of 5%) of the best performance of projects with the agile methodology of 
projects with Scrum to meet the needs of students, clients, and teachers both in the final result and in the project 
process.

Abstract 
 
Industry 4.0 did not just bring new requirements for today‚Äôs industries, it also brought new technologies to increase 
its efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, an e-Kanban system for internal logistics and production is developed 
and implemented in the automotive industry. The system functions according to the kanban methodology, where the 
consumption usage of a part triggers its replenishment. The development of the presented e-Kanban system took into 
consideration the limitations and improvement opportunities of previous works where authors developed their own e-
Kanban systems. Before the e-Kanban system‚Äôs application, a simulation using the EKS¬© software was performed to 
obtain the number of labels and stock levels needed for the calibration of the e-Kanban system. The system was then 
applied, and the results show a 19% stock reduction and a 22% reduction in inventory costs. Additionally, the system 
proved to respond to the factory‚Äôs necessities and allowed for real-time control of production and inventories.

1. Introduction 
Lean Manufacturing approaches are widely adopted in industry since they allow for cost reduction and efficiency 
maximization, which are obligations for today‚Äôs global market. The kanban system is the most used tool for enhancing 
manufacturing efficiency (Sapry et al., 2020). Yet, due to increased supply chain complexity, product variability, 
uncertain demand, and the need for quicker information exchange, the traditional kanban system is now outdated and 
incapable of reaching the new market requirements. As well, Industry 4.0 pushes organisations to undertake a digital 
transformation of their processes and information flows. Thus, to adapt to both market and Industry 4.0 requirements, 
organisations must attain an active and accurate control of their production processes and an overall and real-time 
view of the value chain. For that, companies must have a continuous information flow throughout their value chain, 
which can be achieved through the current advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). 
The electronic Kanban (e-Kanban) system is an efficient way to combine the advantages of the traditional kanban 
with the technologies needed for Industry 4.0, and the upgrade in ICT brings the obvious solution to achieve it. The 
present work was developed in an automotive Portuguese manufacturing company, integrated within an international

613","6. Conclusions and Future Work 
In this work a new e-Kanban system for production and stock management is presented and tested in an automotive 
manufacturer company. Its implementation intended to overcome the problems detected regarding priority definition, 
clients‚Äô satisfaction, stock levels and synchronism between production and assembly lines. Since the company 
possesses in-house software development teams, it was ruled more cost-efficient to develop a new e-Kanban system 
internally rather than adapting an existing e-Kanban market software to their specific requirements. Moreover, it must 
be noted that, in the development of the new system, the limitations of previously implemented e-Kanban systems 
were considered. The detected limitations in the literature were analyzed and the following solutions proposed: 
‚Ä¢ 
Limitation to only one urgency per production loop with the Urgent kanban label functionality. 
‚Ä¢ 
The Logistics Planner is the only one with clearance to create/delete e-Kanban labels. 
‚Ä¢ 
The existence of production boards with the order of production based on consumption, which facilitates the 
priority management activity. 
‚Ä¢ 
The existence of stock boards which show the stock levels throughout the products‚Äô production flows. 
‚Ä¢ 
The creation of a user-friendly dashboard for the production operators. 
 
Once developed, the new system was tested in operating conditions for component 8 (C8), along a 3-month period. 
The results show that the stocks were reduced by 19% (which equals a 22% reduction in the cost related to stock), and 
that the number of parts shortages was also reduced, proving the benefits of a pull system compared to a push system. 
To the reduction of the latter, the automatic definition of priorities was also essential. Additionally, it was noted that 
the problems related to kanban labels‚Äô loss were eliminated and that a real-time control of the component‚Äôs internal 
value chain was now possible. Also, the even distribution of stocks allowed for a mitigation of the demand variations‚Äô 
impacts and permitted the synchronism between the production lines of the different processes. 
 
As future work and to further test the system, we propose its applications in the remaining factory components (C1 
through C7). Additionally, to bring the system closer to Industry 4.0 requirements and reduce human errors related to 
the scanning process, the authors propose the introduction of RFID technology to track the CUs‚Äô movements through 
the production. This way, instead of the operators having to scan each label, the RFID tags are placed in the containers 
and automatically trigger the state changes. As well, we propose the system‚Äôs connection to the factory‚Äôs ERP. This 
would allow for an autonomous update in the number of MTS labels according to the clients‚Äô consumption and an 
automatic release to the production of the MTO labels based on the client‚Äôs deadlines.

623","proved that the simulation‚Äôs input data were correct. Also, in agreement with the results of Table1, the number of parts 
shortages inside the factory was reduced. Besides the previous advantages regarding the pull and push system, the e-
Kanban allowed to overcome several disadvantages of the traditional kanban system highlighted in Table 1 and in 
Romeira and Moura (2020). First, it eliminated the loss of kanban labels, which was the most common and made it 
possible for everyone to have the visibility of the entire value chain anywhere and in real-time. The labels‚Äô monthly 
update was also simplified since it can now be done remotely in the e-Kanban platform. Another advantage noted with 
the e-Kanban application, that was not discussed in the works of Table 1, is related to the definition of production 
priorities. With the system‚Äôs application, the order, and quantities in which the components needed to be produced 
were automatically displayed in the production boards. This simplified the process of priority management and 
stopped the constant changes in production priorities. Also, with the e-Kanban system, the number of parts in stock 
was automatically displayed in the stock boards. In fact, in the papers of  Razafuad et al. (2018), Ricky and Kadono 
(2020) and Svirƒçeviƒá et al. (2013), the authors do not present any production boards, only stock boards, and the 
developed e-Kanban systems are mainly a graphical way of seeing the level of stock available. Contrarily to the 
previously, Jarupathirun et al.  (2011), the authors present a production board and not a stock board, however the 
system only displays what to produce, without considering upstream real consumption. Moreover, with the 
introduction of the Urgent kanban label functionality, the developed system was able to overcome a limitation exposed 
in the work of Menanno et al. (2019). Here, the developed system allowed the creation of urgencies, however, does 
not restrict them. Has this may produce a huge number of urgencies at the same time, and thus everything is urgent, 
which orders must be done first? In contrast, the system we propose only consents to the creation of one urgency per 
production loop. Our e-Kanban system also surpasses a problem detected by Ma≈ô√≠kov√° in (2008), regarding the 
creation of e-Kanban labels by the operators. As the author stated, labels were emitted when not needed, creating 
excessive stocks in the production lines. In contrast, the current e-Kanban system only gives clearance to the Logistics 
Planner to create e-Kanban labels. Lastly, in comparison to Hawari and Aqlan (2012), we created a more user-friendly 
interface, where just the needed information appears to the workers. Therefore, in the production/stock boards, the 
operators only have a table with the reference, designation, and quantity in the order that they must produce (Figure 8 
(a)), and in the scanning menu the place for the scanned reference (Figure 8 (b)). 
 
Figure 8. (a) The production board of the e-Kanban system; (b) The Scanning Menu of the e-Kanban system. 
Despite the advantages mentioned, it was noted that, from time to time, the operators forgot to scan the references. 
Although it happened less than before, the application of the e-Kanban system forced the weekly verification of the 
number of labels in each state and recalibration accordingly. Nevertheless, the tests showed that, with the new system, 
the factory was able to control and balance the stock level which addressed the impact of demand variations and 
allowed the synchronism between production stages. It also allowed real-time monitoring of production and inventory 
and, due to a 24-hour visibility, the production and logistics managers know what would be in production until the 
next 24 hours creating increased flexibility and responsiveness. Table 3 synthetizes the results obtained in this work.

Abstract 
 
This paper is focused on the overview of the organizational factors affecting Lean marketing readiness in the retail 
sector in Sri Lanka. Retail businesses are one of the fast-growing sectors in Sri Lanka. However, retails have to 
compete with each other for the small consumer base inside the country. Those retailers should be able to attract their 
consumers and communicate with them using marketing. This study is conducted as a systematic literature review by 
reviewing 34 papers using the PRISMA framework. This study has identified several main organizational factors 
affecting lean marketing readiness: Management and leadership; Lean tools, techniques, and knowledge about Lean 
concepts; availability of organizational resources; organizational culture and business processes; employees' 
involvement and skills; communication management. This systematic review is the first attempt to overview the 
organizational readiness for Lean marketing readiness in the retail businesses area.

1. Introduction  
After the second world war, Japanese companies have to reduce the gap between them and European businesses. So, 
most Japanese companies moved into the concept called Continuous Improvements (CI) and Just-In-Time (JIT). 
However, the lean concept was highlighted with the success of the Toyota Production System (TPS) in 1950. Eiji 
Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno initiated to development of the lean concept. The lean concept was spotlighted with the 
success of the TPS in the 1950s. (Womack et al. 1992) Intel, John Deere, and Nike are the few other companies using 
the lean concept for their organizational processes (Lombardi 2021). These companies applied their lean philosophy 
not only directing their manufacturing process also other departments as well. Numerous applications of lean 
philosophy were introduced like lean manufacturing, lean product development, lean accounting, lean development. 
It involves never-ending efforts to eliminate or reduce wastes in design, manufacturing, distribution, and customer 
service processes (Payaro and Papa, 2016). The lean concept is mainly focusing on eliminating waste and using 
resources optimally. With the development of the business world, subsections of lean were born. The lean concept 
was expanded over other processes like lean finance, lean IT, etc.   
 
When considering the Lean practices in Sri Lanka, mostly that concept is related to the Manufacturing, Supply Chain, 
and Logistic areas. The most prominent companies in the apparel industry and a few others have adopted lean 
principles into their operations and developed their own operating systems. For example, Atlas Axillia Co. (Private) 
Limited and MAS Operating System (MOS) in MAS Holdings Pvt Limited. These companies mainly focused on their 
direct manufacturing operations. Even though the Lean concept is familiar, the Lean marketing concept is not very 
popular in Sri Lanka.  
 
Retail refers to the activity of selling goods or services directly to consumers or end-users (WWW1). Retail businesses 
are one of the fast-growing sectors in Sri Lanka (WWW2). Even though that sector is fast-growing, they have to 
compete for a small consumer base. Those retailers should be able to attract their consumers and communicate with 
them. According to the Sri Lanka Retailer's Association, there are subcategories of retails in Sri Lanka like FMCG 
(Supermarket, Food, and Beverages), Clothing, Fashion and Jewellery (Apparel, Fashion stores, jewellery, and 
accessories), Shelter and Housing (housing, real Estate, Apartments), Household and Consumer Durables (Household 
Appliances and Electronics, Furniture, etc.), Footwear and Accessories (Footwear, Leather Handbag, and

4. Discussion 
This study was focused on the organizational factors affecting lean marketing readiness in the retail sector in Sri 
Lanka. Factors were identified by referring to 30 studies. Thirty-five subfactors were identified and categorized under 
management and leadership; Lean tools, techniques, and knowledge about Lean concepts; availability of 
organizational resources; organizational culture and business processes; employees' involvement and skills; 
communication management main constructs. Even though every factor is important to organizational readiness, the 
most concerning factor is management and leadership, and the least concerning factor is the availability of 
organizational resources. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This paper review literature is regarding the adaption of the lean approach in marketing and organizational readiness 
in retail businesses. Since there are few papers regarding the lean approach in marketing, studies regarding lean 
readiness in other areas are also considered when identifying organizational factors. Few papers were found from the 
Sri Lankan context and other studies from different regents of the world. There are two types of factors as internal 
factors to the business and external factors which affect the readiness. This study is mainly focusing on the internal 
factors (organizational factors). Prisma framework was used to identify and sort the papers. According to the identified 
factors, management and leadership affect organizational readiness when considering the other factors.

Abstract 
The growth of population and road users is increasing every year, and road network development that has not been 
carried out optimally has had a significant impact on the current congestion. This condition can be seen in several 
roads that experience an increase in vehicle's morning and evening rush hours. This situation makes the government 
have to implement traffic restriction policies congestion can be unraveled. One of them is the application of Electronic 
Road Pricing (ERP). This paper will discuss ERP system implementation plan. This research method was carried out 
through a field survey by collecting data from the ERP road section of the Blok M-Kota corridor with a sample of 
Jalan Medan Merdeka Barat. The analysis is carried out to determine the level of road services and the cost of 
congestion before and after ERP implementation. The results showed that the road service level on Jalan Medan 
Merdeka Barat is E, where the road characteristics have unstable currents, low speed, and vary, the volume is close to 
the road capacity. ERP is calculated to have the potential to reduce congestion costs by Rp.221,788/hour with a 
reduction in vehicle volume by 19% if ERP is implemented.

1. Introduction 
Every year the growth of motorized vehicle users has increased relatively high. Until now, the government has carried 
out various kinds of traffic restriction engineering to reduce congestion. The government has been made to implement 
a 3 in 1 (three in one) and odd-even system (Hanna, Kreindler and Olken, 2017). However, the efforts that have been 
implemented seem to be still ineffective in its implementation, so that the DKI Jakarta Government must find a 
solution in overcoming the congestion that occurs. One of the emerging discourses is the implementation of an ERP 
system. ERP is the term for a system that implements congestion pricing in  a road segment area. Where the goal is to 
reduce congestion that is happening at this time. The purpose of implementing an ERP system is to reduce the volume 
of vehicles passing through a road segment to solve congestion problems by installing the On-Board Unit (OBU) tool 
as a means of payment transactions. (Senapati and Najid, 2020).  
Based on the paper Gu et al. (2018), identifying factors that influence public acceptance in the road pricing scheme 
are (1) privacy issues for road users because travel data will be recorded; (2) the problem of equity because there are 
socio-demographic differences among road users; (3) the complexity of the road pricing scheme, especially during 
the system trial process and the learning process for road users; and (4) uncertainty especially in the allocation of 
revenue from road pricing and its effectiveness. In the end, vehicles crossing these roads will be charged according to 
the level of congestion that occurs. The higher the congestion level, the higher the motorists' rate when traveling on 
roads with this ERP system.  
This research was conducted in a more centralized manner and gave good results in avoiding problems beyond the 
researcher's reach. By only examining road users with light vehicles, heavy vehicles, and motorcycles, the survey 
implementation time was only during morning rush hours at 07.00-09.00 and in the evening 16.00-18.00 on Jalan 
Medan Merdeka Barat, and calculating the cost of congestion based on the results of field data calculations.

5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the research on the analysis of the implementation plan of the ERP system on the Jalan Merdeka 
Barat, it is concluded that the road conditions have a service level of E, where this value explains that the characteristic 
conditions of the road have unstable currents, low speed and vary, the volume is close to road capacity. For the impact 
due to the implementation of this system, it can be seen that ERP can save costs by Rp. 217,788 / hour and the potential 
to reduce congestion levels by 19%. However, the implementation of the ERP system will also impact alternative 
roads around Jalan Medan Merdeka Barat, where the alternative road will experience an increase in congestion costs 
for each volume of vehicles that pass through it.

Abstract 
One of the characteristics of an excellent urban environment is a friendly environment for pedestrians. Pedestrian facilities 
that meet the standards are required in the central business district, where most activities are walking. In recent years, 
Jakarta, as a business city, has continued to improve its pedestrian facilities. Of course, these improvements must be 
examined whether they are following the community's needs or viceversa. This paper aims to find out about the level of 
comfort and level of service at the new pedestrian facilities in the Metropolitan City of Jakarta. The research method was 
carried out through a survey and a questionnaire. Data was collected in the Mega Kuningan Business District with repaired 
pedestrians. The number of respondents was 100 people. The analysis carried out is Importance Performance Analysis 
(IPA) and Level of Service (LoS) analysis. The results of this study indicate that the newly built pedestrian has met level 
A. Based on the analysis of interest, it is still necessary to increase security. Meanwhile, based on the comfort analysis, 
additional lighting and shade are required. This study shows that pedestrians' improvement in the business district in the 
Metropolitan City of Jakarta is good and needs to be developed in other locations.

Introduction 
Cities have various functions, such as a place to live, commercial activities, education, work, and others. In most cities as 
a central business area, the area is much mobilized by foot. Walking is an environmentally friendly mode of transportation 
for short trips. Walking makes people healthy because walking burns calories or does not emit greenhouse gases. 
Moreover, walking is an ideal transportation method in urban areas because it does not require parking space. 
Figure 1. Pedestrian in Metropolitan City 
The existence of sidewalks encourages people to walk instead of using other modes of transportation; this, in turn, reduces 
pollution and improves physical condition and health. As a result, various activities are created, and social relations are 
enhanced due to people's presence in suitable spaces on the street. (Osman, 2016)

seen that only two indicators need improvement. 
5 Conclusion 
Based on some research beforehand, the conditions pedestrian in Jakarta Metropolitan City are not in standards, but when 
this city of Jakarta continues to improve with arranging pedestrian to be comfortably used for pedestrian foot. The study 
results have demonstrated that LoS is on a scale of A. By using IPA, it is still necessary to repair shading and lighting 
facilities.

Abstract 
 
The construction of Trans Sumatera Toll Road aims to facilitate transportation and industrial sector development 
along the Sumatera region. This research aimed to uncover the pavement thickness of Trans Sumatera Toll Road 
on Pekanbaru-Dumai section, obtain the asphalt thickness for each asphalt overlay method, compare the AC-WC 
in terms of thickness results and heavy equipment productivity, and determine the more effective method of AC-
WC overlay. This research used the field survey to gather primary data on the field and also collect secondary data 
from several institutions. The road pavement was analyzed using the MDPJ 2017. Meanwhile, the heavvy 
equipment productivity was analyzed using direct single overlay and double overlay methods. The heavy 
equipment specifications and productivity calculations were measured using AHSP 2017. The analysis results 
showed that the flexible pavement thickness on the Trans Sumatera Toll Road Section Pekanbaru-Dumai were: 
300 mm LPA, 105 mm AC-Base, 60 mm AC-BC, and 40 mm AC-WC. The AC-WC thickness with direct single 
overlay method was 98.7% and it needed 6 hours of Asphalt Finisher work. Meanwhile, the AC-WC thickness with 
double overlay was 99.2% and it needed 18 hours of Asphalt Finisher. In terms of AC-WC overlay productivity, 
the direct single overlay method was more effective. However, in terms of thickness, the double overlay method 
was more effective.

1. Introduction 
Toll roads are public roads that are part of the road network system and as national roads whose users are obliged 
to pay a certain toll fee, (Badan Pengatur Jalan Tol). Toll roads are built with the aims of accelerating the 
realization of road networks in which part or all of its funding are from the road users for the sake of easing 
government‚Äôs burden, smoothen traffic in developed areas, improve equitable distribution of development results 
and justice, and ease government fund burden through road paarticipation. Toll road services target the smoothness, 
safety and comfort of its service users. In order to achieve such target, there are operational benchmarks defined in 
the form of service time at the substation, toll road travel time, level of smoothness, level of facilities, level of 
customer complaints and standards of road level. 
 
According to PT Hutama Karya, the construction of Pekanbaru-Dumai Toll Road is a part of the Trans-Sumatera 
road that connects Pekanbaru and Dumai in Riau province. This toll road has 6 sections: Section I Pekanbaru-Minas, 
Section II Minas-South Kandis, Section III South Kandis-North Kandis, Section IV North Kandis-South Duri,

Abstract  
 
In order for higher education entrepreneurship education to be able to make students have a productive and efficient 
entrepreneurial attitude, a learning process with the right strategy is needed, to provide broad opportunities for 
students to construct meanings for the entrepreneurial concepts they learn in relation to the learning experiences they 
get in life. daily. Such a learning strategy requires a contextual approach. In its application, it is felt that it is efficient 
if real phenomena that exist in students' daily lives can be presented in the classroom through a technology-based 
PBL learning model. This study was designed as an experimental study, which populated on 236 students of the 
Economic Education Department STKIP PGRI Jombang. The number of research samples was 129 students. The 
data collected were analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression. The results prove: there is an effect of technology-
based PBL learning models on entrepreneurial attitudes , there is an effect of learning methods on entrepreneurial 
attitudes , there is an influence of motivation on entrepreneurial attitudes  and Simultaneously there is an influence 
of the PBL learning model based on technology, learning methods, learning motivation on entrepreneurial attitudes.

1. Introduction  
21st century learning has influenced the education system, the education system in the world including in Indonesia. 
The quality of learning must be improved through innovation and educational development. The education system in 
Higher Education with the Merdeka Campus program is designed to encourage higher education lecturers and 
students to disrupt themselves and transform agile. Higher education must be ready to produce graduates who are 
flexible, adaptive, self-directed, creative, complex problem solver, and cannot be separated from strong characters 
(PKKMB) 2020, Universitas Indo Global Mandiri (UIGM). 
 
Tertiary Education Institutions focus on 8 (eight) indicators that have the potential to bring out the potential of 
higher education including their resources to interact intensely with the industrial world and the world of work, by 
inviting industry to enter higher education, and vice versa (Dwi Ratnadi, 2020). In line with the existence of an 
independent campus, students are required to have special skills that students must have for their field of study and 
skills that they must master when they graduate. This expertise is not only theoretical knowledge but also the ability 
(competence) of students to be active, creative, and innovative in their field of study. Every student should be able to 
use their knowledge to be applied in everyday life. Therefore, the application of learning methods must be in 
accordance with the teaching and learning process (Setiadi Wira Buana, 2011). 
 
According to Taha (2008), the learning process in the classroom is focused on memorizing information. students 
need to remember information but are not required to understand the information that is applied in everyday life. As 
a result, student learning outcomes are not always achieved because student knowledge is rich in theory, but 
students' understanding and experience in applying this knowledge in practice is very lacking.

The conclusion of this study is a partial and simultaneous influence on the use of technology-based PBL Learning 
Model, Learning Method, Learning Motivation on the entrepreneurial attitude of students in the Economic 
Education Department of STKIP PGRI Jombang. 
Based on the conclusions of the research results as mentioned above, several suggestions can be made as follows: 
1. The use of technology-based PBL learning models can improve student entrepreneurial attitudes, preferably 
higher education institutions, especially the economic education study program STKIP PGRI ombang, as far as 
possible can improve the teaching and learning process by using the technology-based PBL Learning Model so 
that the teaching and learning process can be achieved optimally and students can be active, creative and 
innovative 
2. The level of student learning motivation and student learning has an influence on entrepreneurial attitudes in 
entrepreneurship learning, especially in the economic education study program STKIP PGRI Jombang, so it is 
suggested that at the beginning of learning it is necessary to know the level of learning motivation and student 
learning methods for the materials to be taught with giving initial questionnaire. By knowing the level of student 
learning motivation and student learning methods, then the form of learning can be selected (both models, media, 
systems, etc.) in accordance with the hope of encouraging student study groups in the learning process, 
especially student study groups who have low motivation and lack of learning methods. efficient, so that learning 
objectives can be achieved optimally. 
3. Because factors such as the ability of the lecturer to teach, social environmental conditions, socio-economic 
conditions, student background, students' initial abilities are factors that have not been researched by researchers 
and this is the weakness of the researcher, it is suggested that further researchers conduct further research on 
factors -these factors.

Abstract 
 
This research focused on the language mastering of mentally retarded student in terms of the speaking skill at 
SLBN 1 Jombang. This research problem was formulated how the speaking skill could be mastered by third 
grade mentally retarded student at SLBN 1 Jombang. Speaking skill means a skill taught to students to be able 
to speak well in reciting each letter in alphabet, each consonant, then each word, and how to pronounce them 
correctly.  It aimed that student has no difficulty to pronunce the articulation by using manipulative media to 
facilitate students‚Äô understanding in speaking as well as analyzing the speaking skill of mentally retarded 
student. It was conducted to facilitate the teaching learning process in the classroom, to communicate in the 
community and to introduce how mentally retarded students pronounce letters and words. The researchers chose 
one research subject from one of the mentally retarded students, Aisyah. The method employed in this research 
was descriptive qualitative method because they tried to describe the pronounced words, mimicked words for 
speaking skills by introducing the letters while interviewing the subject. The results showed that the learning 
outcomes of Aisyah had good development. It was prooved by Aisyah‚Äôs better performance seen from Aisyah‚Äôs 
learning book note, Cindi‚Äôs learning in speaking. Cindi‚Äôs learning development can be known by knowing the 
letters and vocabularies‚Äôpronunciation obtained when interacting with teammates, teachers and family 
environment.

Abstract 
Mathematics learning certainly involves interaction between teacher and students. The interaction can be teacher gives 
promoted-actions and students will give respons. When the teacher‚Äôs promoted-actions can stimulate students‚Äô 
mathematical ideas, students will communicate their thinking verbally or non verbally. The way students communicate 
their ideas is called mathematical representation. Students‚Äô representation becomes important thing to evaluate 
learning because mathematical representation indicates students‚Äô understanding of mathematical concepts. This 
research aimed to describe student‚Äôs mathematical representation on accepting teacher‚Äôs promoted-action. This 
research was a qualitative research with two students in high and middle mathematical ability (HA-MA) as subjects. 
Data was collected through online observation and interview. The validity of the data was checked by using time 
triangulation. The results showed that HA-subject‚Äôs representation was appear when teacher stimulates students to 
answer verbally then subject pronounce mathematical object frequently and correctly, and when teacher gives an 
exercise then subject write the mathematical expression correctly. MA-subject‚Äôs representation was appear when 
teacher stimulates students to answer verbally then subject pronounce mathematical object correctly in several times, 
and when teacher gives an exercise then subject write mathematical expression.

1. Introduction 
The pandemic COVID-19 cause a change the learning method from face-to-face into online learning. 
Nevertheless, the learning process certainly still involve interaction between teacher and students. The 
interaction in online learning occur trough various applications commonly used by the teachers. Such as 
whatsapp group, google classroom, youtube, and zoom meeting. All of these application allow the use of 
video, so that students can see the teacher‚Äôs expression during explaining the lesson.  
Teacher‚Äôs facial expression is the one of soft skill attributes in teaching mathematics (Hidayati, 2015), so 
that it become a thing needed to consider in determining what application should be used. On the other hand 
teacher also needs to assess students‚Äô affective. For this purpose, teacher can choose the application that 
enable the teacher to observe students‚Äô activities during online learning easily. A mathematics teacher in 
MA Madrasatul Quran Tebuireng Jombang prefer to use zoom meeting application for online learning. The 
reason is it allow teacher and students to interact like face-to-face learning.  
The interaction between teacher and students in mathematics learning occurs from beginning to the end of 
the lesson. In this process, teacher gives some instructions to students that will stimulate students‚Äô 
responses. For example teacher starts learning by saying greetings, asks students to open the book and 
prepare their stationery, asks students to copy the materials, asks students to solve the problem, invite 
students to ask question, invite students to make conclusion, and etc. All the teacher activities that make 
students take action or behave to acquire new skill is called promoted-action(Iffah, 2015). 
Based on students‚Äô response, promoted-action is categorized into accepted, rejected, and pseudo promoted-
action. Promoted-action is accepted when the students conduct a particular instruction given by the teacher, 
rejected when the students do not conduct particular instruction given by the teacher, and pseudo when the

‚Äúopposite of‚Äù (‚àí‚àí4 could read as ‚Äúthe opposite of negative four‚Äù)(Lisa, et.al., 2020).   
 
4. Conclusion  
Based on the online observation and interview conducted by the researchers, the results showed that HA-subject‚Äôs 
representation was appear when teacher stimulates students to answer verbally then subject pronounce mathematical 
object frequently and correctly, and when teacher gives an exercise then subject write the mathematical expression 
correctly. HA-Subject the internal representation about mathematical facts of HA-Subject is accordance to the 
concepts, but the external representation that communicated orally is not appropriate, HA-Subject‚Äôs external 
representation about arithmetic operation is correct but the internal representation is inappropriate, involved contextual 
representation that terminologically correct but mathematically inappropriate. MA-subject‚Äôs representation was 
appear when teacher stimulates students to answer verbally then subject pronounce mathematical object correctly in 
several times, and when teacher gives an exercise then subject write mathematical expression. MA-Subject‚Äôs external 
representation in mathematics operation was correct, stated that negative and minus have the different meanings but 
still related. The subject‚Äôs statement was not accordance to the theory of minus signs.

Abstract 
He existence of the disruptive era has made many new products launched tend to be innovative due to market 
competition that pursues excellence. The purpose of this study is to determine and explain the effect of the disruptive 
era on innovative product launches. This study conducted sampling with a simple random sampling approach and used 
data collection techniques through a questionnaire method that was given to the general public who met the criteria of 
respondents, by determining the criteria for respondents, namely the wider community who was more than fifteen 
years old and using product or services. The variables used in this study are the disruptive era as variable X1, new 
products as variable X2, and innovative product launches as variable Y. The results of the analysis using the linear 
regression method show that there is a significance between the disruptive era variable (X1) and the innovative product 
variable (Y) where the value of sig is 0,000 < 0,05 and the value of tcount is 4.120 > ttable is 2030 which shows that the 
disruptive era has an effect on the launch of innovative products, then the test results of the analysis of new product 
variables (X2) have a significance for the innovative product launch variable (Y) shows the value of sig is 0,000<0,05 
and the value of tcount is 7,840 > ttable is 2030 shows that the existence of a new product also has an influence on the 
launch of innovative products.

1. Introduction 
Along with the changing times, old or new companies are competing continuously not only because of the very 
competitive conditions, but also because of the demands for increasingly advanced technological developments. 
technological developments are accompanied by human thinking that is increasingly effective and efficient in all 
respects. Effective and efficient thinking certainly makes technological developments increasingly and very much-
needed. The technological capabilities will be more advanced because those that are able to integrate traditional old-
fashioned transformations become universal. 
 
The digital world has a major influence on the era of globalization in the ability to develop increasingly new 
technology to replace the old ways that are less efficient so that there are many innovations being 
developed. The  technological developments application is free to do and enforced by all corporate companies, both 
beginner and old companies. Company competition in the current era of globalization requires companies to act 
quickly and precisely in facing this competition. 
 
Today, Indonesians often hear about the emergence of actors in the business world who disturb the existence of old 
players. Basically, these new competitors have unique advantages when compared to incumbent actors. There are 
many examples, for example those that are still pros and cons, namely the phenomenon of online motorcycle taxis 
that have replaced conventional taxis. Another example is the online hotel booking technology that replaces

(Atuahene‚ÄìGima, 1997). Thus the innovative product launches are expected to supply the volatile market. With the 
innovative products, the market competition will synchronized rigorously. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The disruptive era affected the launch of innovative products. The influence given from the disruptive era on the 
launch of innovative products is quite large, in other words, the disruptive era has increased the launch of innovative 
products. The existence of new products also affects the launch of innovative products. This study has similarities 
with previous research, this means that the results of previous studies are still in line with the results of this study. 
Suggestions that can be given by the author for similar research in the future are to try to provide more detail from the 
case studies raised, in other words that are smaller than the research space so that the research results obtained can be 
more accurate and more in line with the needs of the study in the future.

In this era of globalization and increasingly fierce business competition, human resources are the most important asset

Every employee really wants to get an office promotion, for that the organization must provide opportunities for 
employees who have good performance and have high discipline to get a job promotion. The results showed that 
leadership has an effect on work environment. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of 
leadership on the work environment is smaller than 0.05 which means that leadership has a significant effect on  work 
environment. For that the organization needs to improve good leadership and leaders must be able to improve the 
work environment for the better. The more positive leadership, the better the work environment. Likewise, vice versa, 
the more negative leadership, the lower the quality of work environment. The results showed that job promotion had 
an effect on the work environment. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of job 
promotion on work environment is smaller than 0.05 which means that promotion has a significant effect on work 
environment. This means that the better the promotion, the better work environment will be. Organizations need to 
carry out promotions on a regular basis according to the needs or opportunities for available positions and the 
promotion of these positions must be implemented fairly. The results showed that  work environment has an effect on 
employee performance. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where the P value of work environment to 
employee performance is smaller than 0.05 which means that work environment has an effect on employee 
performance. A good work environment will provide a sense of comfort and safety for employees in doing the work 
assigned to them. For this reason, it is hoped that the organization will always make improvements to the work 
environment so that the work environment remains comfortable and supports employees in carrying out the work tasks 
assigned to them.

Abstract 
 
The world now considers information security to be a critical concern while most Sri Lankan public and commercial 
enterprises also have it as a legal requirement. Businesses must utilize an Information Security Management System 
(ISMS) as it improves resilience to cyber-attacks and decreases information-security expenses. Organizational factors 
are vital because no system or technology will be properly applied if the human aspect of the setting is neglected. As 
no prior study has been undertaken to focus on Sri Lankan organizations and the IT sector is an advancing sector, this 
research is aimed at identifying the organizational factors that influence the efficacy of ISMS in Sri Lankan IT 
organizations. A qualitative approach with a systematic literature review was done following the PRISMA method. 
Identified Success Factors were analyzed, and a conceptual model is developed from the top 7 constructs (Implementer 
IT competency, Information Security Training, Employee acceptance and readiness, Information Security Policy, 
Employee Security Awareness, Top Management Commitment, Information security standard compliance). 
Understanding the impact of organizational factors will aid businesses in developing more effective information 
security strategic planning and deployment suited for all employees. The suggested constructs will offer a base for 
future research on this study area.

Introduction 
As data plays the crucial factor in the present firm context, Information can be mentioned as the blood of an 
organization especially as access to high-quality, complete, accurate, and up-to-date information is vital in supporting 
the managerial decision-making process that leads to sound decisions ( Burns 2018) ( Susanto et al. 2011). Information 
security,  shortened to infosec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. ICT, being a 
fast-developing sector in Sri Lanka, offers a wide range of applications. Currently, Sri Lanka's fourth-largest export 
earner is the ICT industry. It is stated in Jothirathne and Pushpakumara (2017) that ICT investment should comprise 
funds for the development of ICT infrastructure, the training of human resources in ICT skills, and the creation of a 
favorable policy framework. Moreover, it describes that out of many opportunities available for the ICT industry of 
Sri Lanka an important benefit is its high level of information security stating that Sri Lanka, has one of the most 
stringent intellectual property protection regimes in the region. So, with these factors, it is evident that the IT industry 
has a growing future and with technological advancements the need for information security management is high. But 
still, there is a gap in this research area as not many studies have been done in the Information Security Management 
related to Sri Lankan organization context. It is clearly stated in Ibrahim and Ali (2018) that understanding the 
significance of organizational factors will aid businesses in developing a more successful information security 
strategic plan and creating the deployment of information security awareness customized to all employees, from top 
management to subordinates. Since ISMS is a management system that is used to safeguard an organization's 
information environment according to that enhancing the ISMS quality has a beneficial impact on administrative 
performance. Indeed, the fact that the ISMS is dependable and completes its operations on time is beneficial to the 
company's main business, and it should thus be carried out on time. Similarly, the more adaptable the ISMS, the more 
adaptable the global management system (Al-Rashdi et al. 2017) (Tewamba et al. 2019). Hence it is evident that a 
properly established and operated ISMS will be vital in ensuring information security in a firm. So, this research will 
be interesting and useful because there is no previous research focused on the effectiveness of Information Security

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this research is to study the challenges that managers face daily at one of south lighting company, and 
how these challenges affect customer satisfaction. The research focuses more on organization which designs and 
manufactures lights. The hypothesis of the study is: Delays in production has led to customer dissatisfaction. 
Customers do not like waiting, because it is time-consuming, and disturbing. An interview was conducted with the 
production manager to statement the hypothesis. Understanding what it takes to satisfy customers, however, mostly 
for service products, where human communications often assume considerable importance. As both the size of the 
service sector and the importance of customer service for manufacturing organization develop, it turns out to be more 
and more important to understand the complications of customer reactions to services. Customer satisfaction survey 
must be conducted every twelve months to get numerical statistics for the quality indicators developed within the 
Performance Management Framework of the company. The customer satisfaction index is further required to evaluate 
yearly performance targets for services delivered by green craft lighting.

1. Introduction 
The company designs and manufactures customized lightings from scratch, by using cutting edge technology. It was 
formed in 1963, located in Johannesburg, South Africa. The main objective of green the company is to satisfy their 
customers and exceeding their expectations, since they have been in the industry for decades, they continue to strive 
to create relationships with their customers and it has been working for them. The company supplies hospitals, hotels, 
architecture, and any individual who have money because their lightings are expensive and eye catching. All lights 
manufactured at the company have at least one-year warranty. Before technology improved, they experienced few 
returns over the years, now that technology has improved, they are experiencing many returns because they have many 
machines and always receiving big orders, they do not maintain their machines until their machine‚Äôs breakdown. When 
machines breakdown they take into consideration to maintain them and they have little time to perform maintenance, 
to produce, and to deliver their products to their customers on promised time 
 
Managers involve their customers in process design, so that they get to choose the kind of lighting they prefer or want, 
John T Bowen (2001) and Charles (2014) indicated that lightning influences customers in certain stores and they can 
enhance romantic pleasures in different circumstances hence the company always took it seriously when 
recommending lighting to an organization or installing one of their lighting. The importance of in store lightning in 
determine the customers perception of certain goods and purchase this then put on an emphasis that more attention 
should be directed to lightning on more functional interests. Therefore, it is the company‚Äôs responsibility to make sure 
that their customers are satisfied to satisfy the other third parties involved. 
 
Customer satisfaction has been perceived as a tool to enhance customer loyalty in an organization especially in an 
overhanging environment that we live in today. Al-Msallam (2015) highlighted that customer loyalty has rather been 
an obsession for many managers in organizations and a strategic tool to ensure they stay competitive due to the intense 
competition. A customer who is satisfied with a product or service rendered is more likely to visit the store more

and 20% not receiving on time. Figure 4 indicated Satisfaction with quality of the product, with 90% of the customers 
being happy with the quality of the product delivered to them by the company, and only 10% of the customers are not

Figure 5: Will customer purchase again, based on experience. 
 
The above figure 5 illustrates that, 80% of the customers are satisfied and they will purchase again from the 
organization because the organization met and exceeded their expectations. 
18% of the customers are not sure if they can return to purchase or not, because they are not loyal customers, and only 
2% of the customers will not purchase again, because they were not satisfied with the quality of the products. 
 
5. Conclusion 
There is no device to distinguish between a satisfied customer and a faithful customer. The existing model only reveals 
the loyalty constraints as part of customer satisfaction feedback, on the other hand does not reveal the term of 
relationship, and faithfulness. Feedback on satisfaction is provisional and limited to the development where the 
relationship cuts through the element and society and expected to develop over the period of relationship. Contributors 
might provide different meanings to the word customer satisfaction. The assumption of this research is that high levels 
of customer satisfaction can result in an increase of the marketplace share. The significance of customer satisfaction 
is that satisfied customers will always come to buy product from the company. It is not loyal customers who spend 
longer period, it is not expensive to keep customers joyful than trying to get a new customer. Satisfied customers are 
good for the organization‚Äôs stability.  Therefore, the challenges that managers face in a daily basis at lighting company 
does not affect customer satisfaction because many customers are satisfied with the service and the quality of products 
delivered to them by the organization. This paper has recommended what is useful and can be done by other companies 
in relation to brand fairness, brand credibility, customer satisfaction, brand commitment, supposed quality, brand trust 
and brand loyalty. 
 
6.Recommendations 
In this research study, customer satisfaction has been considered which is a very important 
element for the success of any business.  
 
‚Ä¢ 
Establishing a good relationship with customers is an essential business strategy as they will also be loyal to 
the brand and the growth of an organization. 
‚Ä¢ 
Employers need to instill quality departments and service companies it is important to have courtesy and 
know all the products being sold as it increases confidence in a customer. 
‚Ä¢ 
Managers need to also consider customer service quality and price fairness as it leads to customer 
satisfaction.

Abstract  
 
Effective project governance and project management are fundamental mechanisms of ensuring that projects are 
successfully delivered within the project timelines.  It involves a multifaceted set of relationships with stakeholders in 
an organization. Project governance provides a structure through which project related objectives are set, and the 
means of accomplishing those are documented and prioritized. In summary, the purpose of this paper was to provide 
a comprehensive understanding through documentation and re- search on the impact of project governance impact on 
project delivery. The research also intends to increase awareness of the inherent risks associated with poor 
implementation of project governance which leads to poor project delivery and consequently project failures. A mixed-
method research approach was under- taken where data was gathered through primary and secondary sources. A 
questionnaire was circulated in one of the branches in Johannesburg Enterprise Project Management Office, to a 
population of 58 staff in EPMO comprising of Head of Department, 6 senior project managers and 51 junior staff 
members. Half of the respondents know the tools and techniques used by EPMO and are readily in place to be used, 
but Half neither agreed nor disagreed. Almost all respondents indicated that the EPMO does not have to change the 
current project management approach.

1. Introduction 
Project governance has become an important role in organizations and every activity within an organization begins as 
a project, (Rankins, 2010) states that organizations are facing challenges in extracting maximum value from 
investments in projects. Project governance has been used to approach and meet the organizational objectives in either 
academic or application (Joslin, and M√ºller, 2010). Research evidence by Khan (2019) also suggests that poor project 
governance is widespread and is neither company nor industry specific (Joslin, and M√ºller, 2016). This includes 
historical information available as evidence to indicate to those in corporate governance the need for more effective 
project governance from the outset in many projects. According to Murray, (2011) there is a difference between 
individual governance of projects and project management governance. www.best-management-practice.com 
mentioned that individual governance speaks about how a specific project is governed  and  project  management is 
the capability  of the organization governed as a whole.  
 
Good governance needs leadership as it is critical for both the governance of both project and project management. 
South African bank has a functional department which manages the cross functional departments such as Cash 
Delivery (deals with cash logistics for the bank), Self Service Delivery (Auto Teller Machines and Auto Deposit 
Machines), Branch Delivery (Retail banking) and International bank (International branch outlets and offices). To 
carry out a project known as an Enterprise project management office (EPMO)Enterprise project management office 
is set to deliver quality solutions to businesses within the constraints of project management which is time, quality, 
resources and cost. 
 
This paper gives an insight on how project governance is while being systematically in place within organizations and 
the relationship it has with project deliverance in enterprise offices in order to give an emphasis of the proper use of

720","also a considerable level of non-compliance to the governance process as there is a small percentage of respondents 
who do not know governance processes and do not know attributes of a successful project. Majority of the respondents 
indicated. Some respondents indicated that they do not follow governance for their projects. These findings make the 
extent to which project governance assists EPMO is unclear 
 
B. Epmo Governance Approach 
Half of the respondents indicated that they follow group frameworks for project management and the majority of 
respondents indicated that they know their project stakeholders. A more significant number of responses indicate that 
respondents do not know the project charter and a significant few indicated disagreement with the use of a project 
standard. The majority indicated that they know what is expected of them. 
 
C. Factors Contributing to Poor Project Governance 
All respondents indicated that communication is essential for project success. There is still a significant number of 
employees with no clearly defined roles in the projects and do not know their role in the initial stages of projects. 
Majority of the respondents agreed to be assigned to the project. Majority of the respondents did not indicate if they 
can manage their projects or not. All respondents indicated that they received formal training to be in their roles. All 
respondents are aware of their KPIs. There is a significant number of respondents with no knowledge of documented 
processes. A significant number of respondents indicate that project governance does not improve the quality of 
projects. All respondents believe project reports must be of good quality and for the project team to share a common 
purpose and collaborate. A significant number of respondents indicated that some stakeholders are not actively 
involved in projects half of the respondents neither agreed nor disagreed to the involvement of senior managers   in 
projects. 
 
D. Tools And Techniques to Assist Epmo 
Half of the respondents know the tools and techniques used by EPMO and are readily in place to be used, but Half 
neither agreed nor disagreed. Almost all respondents indicated that the EPMO does not have to change the current 
project management approach. They indicated that EPMO could continue using Frameworks and risk management as 
a project governance approach, but they can add Agile and more PMBOK principles. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This research shows that there is a project charter in place, there is communication in place, they have tools and 
techniques in place, there is senior management involvement in projects, there are several successful projects, and 
there are adequate stakeholder engagement and involvement. However, the research has indicated operational gaps 
within the project management process in EPMO where there have been operational inconsistencies which do not 
match the project governance process. 
 
7. Recommendation  
The main implication for EPMO management is that there needs to be a department-wide training and education 
aware- ness on the EPMO project management value chain to give employees a view of how each role, each function, 
each project fits into the greater scope of EPMO. EPMO needs to create awareness of project administration and 
management and the difference with the day-to-day role requirements, and there needs to be aware on how to priorities 
projects to meet deadlines or focus on projects with high impact on business. Another implication for management is 
to decide how they will ensure that each staff member follows and adheres to project governance within the project 
programmers they are managing. They need to educate staff that EPMO culture is aligning to bank‚Äôs culture of not 
putting results before ethical conduct. Management needs to decide on how they will roll out a general approach to 
project governance in line with the Group Project Risk Management Framework and EPMO Strategy. 
 
There need to be effective escalation procedures in place for non-compliance because strong project management be- 
gins with a sound project plan which must include project governance management. Through the project charter, each 
stakeholder must have their clearly defined roles and responsibilities so that stakeholder engagement. There needs to 
be a steering committee that will oversee and monitor governance and give feedback every month. The department 
must also be open   and willing to adjust when changes to the project governance processes are made, or changes are 
made to the framework or operational changes must be enforced. 
Tools and techniques to be used by EPMO will include the Group Project Risk Management Framework and the 
Project Management Framework. PMBOK has been incorporated in both these frameworks while Agile will have to

726","be decision management needs to make because Agile does not form part of governance standards set out in the Group 
Frameworks for project management. Other tools and techniques exist and will have to be properly executed: project 
scheduling, project reports, project milestones, responsibility matrix, communication plan, and resourcing plan, risk 
report, project log and change request documents.

1. Introduction 
In today's industrial era, innovation is very important for every company. The rapid development of technology has 
provided various kinds of benefits in all aspects of human life, including the development of products in the digital 
era that are instantaneous today. The development of a product has become a necessity that applies to today's products. 
According to Chen (2014), a good product is a product that is designed according to consumer needs, with various 
purposes such as security, comfort and beauty so that it will make the product more valuable and futuristic. Technology 
has helped researchers or designers to design a product or tool, this can be proven by the many innovations, 
discoveries, and new breakthroughs in development today. One of the he products that have been designed was 
standard baby incubators. The designer combined consumer needs and market design decisions in every hospital. 
Based on the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), IDHS Data (Indonesian Demographic Health Survey) 2017 Neonatal 
Mortality Rate (AKN) 15/1,000KH, Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) 24/1,000KH while Indonesia's target (RPJMN 2024): 
AKN 10/100,000 KH, IMR 16/100,000 KH and in 2020 until August there have been 74 cases of Neonatal death AKN 
6.23/1000KH and 116 deaths post-neonatal IMR 9.78/1000KH, and the causes of this infant death are several things, 
namely: LBW (Birth Weight Low), Asphyxia (low oxygen conditions in infants) and congenital abnormalities. 
The research was conducted and developed to an ergonomic baby incubator, affordable and durable. The baby 
incubator will later help consumers to facilitate care and take emergency action for the baby. This baby incubator will 
prioritize ergonomics, emergency handling measures, especially for premature babies and a temperature regulation 
system so that consumers will benefit more from the use of this developed product.

6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the data processing, the calculation of the gap value for each customer needs attribute was 
obtained. All GAPs were negative, which indicates that these attributes were still not in line with user expectations. 
Then, the design and prototype design were carried out based on the customers‚Äô wishes. According to the customers‚Äô 
wishes, a baby incubator was made with 2 doors (top and front doors) as seen in Figure 2.

Abstract 
 
B3 waste is waste that needs serious management by individuals, waste-producing companies and the government. In 
order to managed this waste, the first thing that must be done to determine the location of the waste management. This 
research discussed a feasibility of study related to the location of B3 medical waste treatment in Bangkalan Regency. 
The location selection in this research used several criteria that have been determined by BAPEDAL Decree No. 01 
of 1995 and eligibility based on SNI parameters. There were two alternative locations for chose a location for B3 
waste treatment. Based on the results of the assessment that has been carried out on alternative locations for medical 
B3 waste treatment, it can be concluded that the first alternative location has a higher feasibility than the second one. 
The first location meets various predetermined criteria. Availability of land for the construction and development of 
24,711 m2 medical B3 waste treatment in accordance with the criteria established by BAPEDAL's rule. The 
topography is relatively flat, and is not a disaster-prone area or a nature reserve. The existing access road already 
exists, it only needs to improve the quality of the road to the waste treatment location. Then, create a buffer around 
the location to maintain the quality of the surrounding environment that it does not decrease or be polluted.

1. Introduction 
The hospital is a health facility that provides health services for the entire community. Health services provided by 
hospitals include outpatient services, inpatient services, emergency services, medical services, and non-medical 
services. The Decree of the Minister of Health of the Republic of Indonesia No. 1204/Menkes/SK/X/2004 explains 
that the hospital, as a one of meeting point for sick and healthy people, is used by the community as a health service 
facility that allows the occurrence of disease transmission, environmental pollution, and health problems. All types of 
activities that occur in the hospital have a positive or negative impact. The positive impact given is the facilities for 
improving public health, while the negative impact is the presence of waste that requires special handling. One 
example of a hazardous hospital waste is a syringe which can cause infection with hepatitis B, C and also HIV. In 
addition, other hospital waste can also cause diseases, including cholera, typhoid, malaria, and skin diseases (Riyanto, 
2013). 
 
Around 70‚Äì90% of solid waste originating from health installations is general waste that resembles household waste 
and does not contain risks. The remaining 10‚Äì25% is considered dangerous, this waste can cause various types of 
health impacts. The production of solid medical waste in hospitals in Indonesia nationally is estimated at 376,089 
tons/day (Astuti, 2014). Hospital waste is generally divided into two groups, namely medical waste and non-medical

6. Conclusion 
Based on the assessment results of alternative locations for medical B3 waste treatment, it can be concluded that the 
first alternative location has a higher feasibility than the second one. The first alternative location is in Pangpong 
Village, Labang District, which is currently an unproductive vacant land. The distance to the nearest settlement is far 
enough so that it does not cause a significant social impact on the local community. Availability of land for the 
construction and development of 24,711 m2 medical B3 waste treatment in accordance with the criteria established 
by BAPEDAL's decision. The topography is relatively flat, and is not a disaster-prone area or a nature reserve. The 
existing access road already exists, it only needs to improve the road quality to the waste treatment location and create 
a buffer around the location to maintain the quality of the surrounding environment so that it does not decrease or be 
polluted.

Abstract  
 
 
 Business Process Reengineering (BPR) focuses on critically analyzing existing business processes in an organization 
and redesigning enhanced effectiveness and functional efficiencies. Although private sector organizations have widely 
adopted BPR, it has been observed that public sector organizations are less successful in utilizing this exercise to 
improve their processes. This paper aims to investigate and identify the critical success factors (CSFs) that impact the 
implementation of BPR in the public sector and develop a framework to support improving success rates. A critical 
review of the literature was conducted to identify CSFs and derived fifteen CSFs that influence BPR implementation 
in the public sector under five dimensions. According to findings, Management commitment, financial resources, 
organizational structure, Human resources, and IT infrastructure are the main five CSFs in public sector BPR 
implementation. CSFs of BPR are crucial for an organization to achieve the end goal or mission of the BPR project.

1. Introduction  
The reengineering of business processes is concerned with fundamentally rethinking and redesigning business 
processes to obtain dramatic and sustaining improvements in quality, cost, service, lead times, outcomes, flexibility, 
and innovation (Hammer and Champy, 1993). The BPR aims to dramatically improve organizational performance by 
enhancing the organization's efficiency and effectiveness of processes. BPR also involves redesigning associated 
systems and organizational structures, which plays a major role in driving the process changes within organizations. 
Costing millions of dollars to redesign business process procedures, BPR often reexamines and repositions corporate 
strategy (Hammer, 1990). Prominent examples can be found worldwide in industries relating to business process 
reengineering implementation. i.e., Ford's accounts payable system reengineering process, Xerox's inefficient office 
systems reengineering process, IBM Credit's inefficient approval process, etc. Implementing BPR can be successful 
with some modifications to the methodology, clearly assessing the impact, creating a plan for related people, 
processes, and systems. Also, communicating changes and the impact early, reviewing the process regularly as no 
initial designs are perfect, etc., play a critical role in improving success rates. 
 
Public service provides various services to the community in terms of education and learning, health and wellness, 
electricity, water, and local services, money, and taxes. So, the efficiency of the public service is a crucial factor, as it 
is the largest employer as well as a deliverer of public services in the country (Vishaka & Jehan,2020). It is vital to 
adapt modern solutions for processes in the public sector and deliver effective service to the citizens in the country. 
  
The BPR concept helps identify the present situation in an organization and provides necessary solutions to overcome 
identified issues concerning the organizational processes. Several studies come up with the gap between improvement 
rates before BPR implementation and after BPR implementation for their processes (Thong, Yap and Seah, 2000; 
Habib and Jamal, 2013).  When considering characteristics of the public sector, their processes have some special 
characteristics rather than the other private sector processes. Although many studies have been done on the private 
sector BPR implementation, there are fewer significant studies conducted focusing on the public sector. It is hard to 
locate any research done in an attempt to build a framework or model for BPR implementation in the public sector.

5. Conclusion  
The objective of this paper was to identify the factors of BPR implementation in the public sector and rank them in 
order of their appearing frequency in used researches. To increase cloud BPR adoption, it is required to understand 
and clarify factors that influence BPR systems implementation. We derived fifteen (15) factors from past studies and 
ranked them under organizational/management, Economic, Social, Technological, and political dimensions. 
Management commitment is the most crucial factor for BPR implementation in the public sector according to the 
result of the literature. Financial resources, human resources, organizational structure, IT infrastructure, and 
regulation and policies are the other main success factors that affect BPR's success in public sector organizations. 
According to the literature review organizational/management factors are the most crucial factors to the success of 
the BPR project. These identified factors help companies to move to the BPR implementation in the public sector. 
The study will evaluate the CSFs for implementing BPR through empirical research using the frameworks 
developed in future work. This research suggests that future research should pay attention to investigating the

Abstract 
 
Safety management of industrial fuel-fired thermo-processing equipment is important to protect workers, 
infrastructure and the environment. Potential risks include fire and explosions which can be catastrophic if 
not managed. Various regulatory agencies across the globe have introduced safety regulation such as NFPA 
86, EN 746 and SANS 329 to enforce combustion safety requirements. Like other regulations, these 
regulations are also experiencing resistance by firms. The main reason of resistance is the unjustifiable 
compliance costs. The aim of this study is to develop a customized model which can be applied to analyse 
the cost and benefits of fuel-fired thermo processing equipment safety regulations. The model consists of 
three components namely, process simulation, financial modelling and cost benefit analysis. Process 
simulation is used to observe the performance of the compliant and non-compliant system. A financial 
model is used to observe the effect of process alterations on the cash flow of the project over a period. Once 
all costs and benefits are projected a cost-benefit analysis can be performed to determine the net present 
value (NPV) of the project. If NPV > 0, it proves that safety regulation has financial benefit, and if NPV < 
0, the project must be rejected. When comparing different alternatives such as project A and B, if NPV(A) 
> NPV(B), project A must be chosen and vice versa.

1. Introduction  
 
Regulations, also referred to as administrative laws, are primary mechanisms by which many governments implement 
and enforce an objective conduct by individuals and mostly organizations (Dudley and Brito 2012). Blind (2012) 
defined regulation as the implementation and enforcement of rules by public authorities and governmental institutions 
to influence the market behaviour and private organizations‚Äô activities in the economy. Regulations are also used to 
safeguard the citizenry from engaging in hazardous activities. In this instance the regulating body has the responsibility 
to spread awareness and educate the public. Failure to comply with these regulations, affected parties may face from 
minimum to hefty penalties or even sanctions depending on the seriousness of the transgression. The level of 
punishment also differs from country to country and the sector in which they are operating. 
 
Regulations are very diverse and have a variety of objectives. These can include forcing corporations to take note of 
certain prices, to supply certain products, to ensure products meet the specified quality standard, to apply specific 
technology in the production process or to exercise minimum safety in the work place. Due to the nature of industrial 
activities, potential risks are often managed by safety standards to guarantee the protection of workers, infrastructure 
and the environment. These safety regulation standards provide the basis in which how systems and processes should 
be managed and operated. 
 
Safety standards often offer general direction and guidance based on the consensus work of experts but does not offer 
distinct solutions for a specific process or safety concern. Safety standards may be performance based or of 
prescriptive nature (Stavrianidis 2001). Stavrianidis (2001) further reported that safety standards are developed by

Table 2 shows an example of a case study using a MCDA to select which project should be preferred. The scoring of 
an MCDA is conducted by a panel of decision makers or an individual who is tasked to make the decision. A compliant 
system is scored higher on because the process is automated, it is safe, it prevents harmful emissions and therefore it 
protects the environment. This because of a ratio-controlled combustion which results in a complete combustion and 
higher efficiency. The computerized sequence of opening valves ensures that no fuel is wasted or released to the 
atmosphere. 
 
A non-compliant system is manually controlled there is a possibility of operating at an incorrect air-to-fuel ratio. 
Furthermore, the compliant system is easy-to-operate due to a burner management system which controls the sequence 
of the process while a non-compliant system does not have this feature. System reliability is tricky since addition of 
more instrumentation can result in a lot of failures which from a maintenance point of view, the compliant system 
might look unattractive. Therefore, a higher weighted average score of 9.15 indicates that a compliant system should 
be preferred. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Safety regulations are important to manage risks in industrial activities. Often, they face resistance due to unjustifiable 
high compliance costs and intense administration requirements. To curb this perception a CBA model can be used to 
analyse the benefits and educate firms.   A process simulation is a method which can be used to investigate the effect 
of the alterations that comes with regulation on the process.  This is a simple method to substitute very costly and 
timeous experimentation. Once all the alterations in the operation of process are know they can be translated in 
monetary terms using a financial model to investigate their effect on the cash flow of the firm.  
 
NPV, BCR and IRR are also useful tools to also aid in decision making process by investigating whether regulatory 
compliance is financially beneficial. If NPV>0, the project must be implemented, and if NPV <0, the project must be 
rejected. When comparing different alternatives, if NPV(A) > NPV(B), project A must be chosen and vice versa. Same 
applies to BCR, if BCR > 1, the project must be implemented, if BCR < 1, the project must be rejected. When the 
IRR, is greater than the cost of financing the project, the project should be implemented. MCDA is suitable to assess 
intangible benefits of different alternatives. An alternative with a higher averaged weighted score should be preferred. 
 
However, safety is considered a non-negotiable principle in a workplace.  Even if a CBA study can prove that a safety 
regulation is not financially beneficial to the firm, the regulation must still be complied with. However, management 
of firm will make informed decision and implementing safety project knowing exactly what to expect. The model can 
be useful as well to regulatory agencies to make their own assessment as well prior to releasing new regulation and 
enforcing.

Abstract 
 
Logistics and the supply chain performance is very important in the HAZMAT industry. The end customer of 
hazardous materials is a wide range of industries from aerospace, automotive, craftsmen, healthcare, food and 
beverage, pharma and energy. Effectiveness of logistics is crucial to the performance of the supply chain. Logistic 
costs in the chemical industry can be as high as 20% of the purchase costs due to the complexity and risks involved. 
Therefore, cost-effective supply chain decisions and policies are essential to a profitable business. The company under 
study is an industry leader in HAZMAT products, it produces and distributes them. The organization has three main 
business lines: wholesale, bulk and retail.  The corporation has presence in more than 90 countries. The research will 
be focused on the operations in North America and in the bulk business line. The bulk business line consists in tanks 
installed in different spots (customers) across the country and based on product consumption and telemetry readings 
the tanks are refilled by trucks. The tanks inventory is managed by the vendor under a VMI supply agreement. The 
logistics process consists in the following: [1] Each tank has a telemetry system that records the tank levels every hour 
and this information is available online. [2] The logistics planner checks tank levels and decides which customers need 
refill and plans routes for the next day. [3] The first step in all trips is to refill the truck with product. [4] Then, the 
product is in route to the customers. On average a trip has 2-3 deliveries and last about 2 days on average. [5] The 
driver closes each delivery through an app and the amount delivered is sent to the ERP for invoicing. It is important 
to take advantage of the wide range of existing degrees of freedom due to the nature of a VMI system, since the 
company decides when to deliver to the customer based on the level of inventory in the tank, how much product to 
deliver and how to combine the different customers to generate the route plan. For this research, three main areas were 
explored: reorder point, fleet sizing and routing. Currently all delivery points are set on a standard reorder point 
without taking into account the lead time and demand for each customer. So, an inventory policy with continuous 
review is proposed. Second, the company hires a third-party carrier and is able to set the number of base and spot 
vehicles rented per month. All base units have a certain number of kilometers as a take-or-pay, spot units pay only the 
kilometers driven. As the second solution, we present a formula to estimate fleet size based on the forecasted demand, 
round trip time and tanker capacity. Finally, all routing plans are done manually by the logistic planners. So, a 
simulation was done using a routing optimization model to minimize the total travel cost for a month worth of 
deliveries.

Abstract  
 
Small and medium-sized companies need to establish strategies that increase the life expectancy of companies and at 
the same time promote innovation and allow access to new opportunities. Therefore; It seeks to identify the factors 
that contribute to the sustainability of SMEs in the restaurant sector through a documentary research approach that 
allows the creation of a measurement instrument that will serve to collect data and identify the relevant factors that 
make up the sustainability of SMEs; Therefore, the most important findings of the present investigation fall on the 
measurement instrument, which is made up of six variables; one independent (SME sustainability) and five 
dependents; which are measured through various dimensions and that together make up the research model that in the 
future will allow to continue developing the research with the aim of increasing the scope of the research so that 
information can be collected from SMEs in the northern restaurant sector of Mexico and later the data will be analyzed 
by means of a correlation analysis and other inferential statistical methods that will allow to identify the existing 
relationship between the study variables.

1. Introduction 
In Mexico, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for 72 per cent of the country‚Äôs formal employment 
and the contribution of these enterprises is approximately 58 per cent of the Mexican economy‚Äôs gross domestic 
product (GDP), However, the situation of SME emerging economies such as Mexico is worrisome since about 80% 
of these companies usually end up in bankruptcy. So is necessary to know why SMEs often have the same destination. 
Therefore, it is an obvious problem to solve since it is necessary to identify the causes of the lack of sustainability in 
SMEs (CAINTRA, 2017).  
 
Researching the sustainability of small businesses helps to eliminate the uncertainty that 80% of SMEs tend to close 
their doors in such a short period of time. Therefore, it is important to identify the factors that determine the 
sustainability of small and medium-sized enterprises, in addition to theoretically contributing to the advancement of 
the topic and its definition in the administrative field, generating more information on sustainability and small 
businesses.  
 
In addition, in the economic environment involving SMEs it is necessary to create new strategies and mechanisms 
that support the private initiative segment in order to boost them to stay in the market therefore, a strategy is needed 
that facilitates and extends the life expectancy of companies while encouraging innovation and allowing access to new 
business opportunities contributing in this way to the growth of small industries in the state (INADEM, 2018). 
 
1.1 Objectives 
Develop a measurement tool to identify the factors contributing to the sustainability of SMEs in the restaurant 
sector.

Abstract 
 
Having a paid job is, for most people's work, a source of economic security, status, well-being and health. It gives 
meaning to their lives, but at times it can be a physical and / or mental burden, and a source of frustration, conflict, 
disappointment, physical and mental discomfort, and even death. These discomforts are sometimes referred to as job 
pressure, or better known as job stress. The purpose of this study is to build an instrument to measure the relationships 
of five specific organizational factors impact on the job stress of teaching staff in higher education institutions in the 
metropolitan area of Monterrey, which amounts up to 19,372 individuals. The variables we considered to be related 
to work stress are job insecurity, work overload, procedural justice, work-family conflict and insufficient rewards. 
The results that will be obtained from this research will serve the universities for the planning of strategies to prevent 
work stress, which has negative consequences at the individual and organizational level.  
 
Keywords 
Work stress, job insecurity, work overload, procedural justice and insufficient rewards.  
 
1. Introduction 
Certain occupations require an emotional element of work, which suggests that employees in these occupations are 
more likely to be vulnerable to job stress, one of these occupations is that of academics, which is commonly cited as 
one of the most stressful (ILO, 2016; Dicke et al., 2014; Gallup, 2014; Hakanen, Bakker, & Schaufeli, 2006; Roeser 
et al., 2013).  In addition to being an occupation (teachers) prone to cause work stress for those who exercise it, 
academic work around the world has undergone major changes in its financing, forms of remuneration, workloads and 
hours, forms of communication, role clarity, among other factors (Darabi, Macaskill, & Reidy, 2016).  
 
Work stress in higher education has been studied for decades in developed economies such as the United States, the 
United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, among others; and it has been shown how various factors in the work of 
academic staff can generate stress: ""The various roles and the existence of numerous factors that require attention 
produce a set of pressures on individuals in academic positions"" (Abouserie, 1996). According to the literature on 
work stress in academic staff, the factors that usually cause work stress in academic staff are the following: work 
overload (Guillespie, Walsh, Winefield, Dua, & Stough, 2001; Kinman, 2001; Idris, 2011; Bowling , Alarcon, Bragg, 
& Hartman, 2015); insufficient rewards (Kinman, 2016; Winefield et al. 2008; Guilespie et al., 2001; Daniels & 
Guppy, 1994; Gmlech, 1984); procedural injustice (Boyd et al., 2011; Judge & Colquitt, 2004; Winefield et al., 2002); 
job insecurity (Mudrak et al., 2017; Winefield et al., 2008; McClenahan et al., 2007) and work-family conflict (Lemos 
et al., 2019; Mudrak et al., 2017; Bell et al., 2010; Kinman & Jones, 2003).  
 
The importance of this study in the context of higher education is that universities have a role of great importance in 
the economy and social life of nations, since thanks to universities engineers, doctors, scientists and other professionals 
are produced, which produce most of the innovative research (Dollard, Winefield, & Winefield, 2003).

Abstract  
 
The objective of this study was to present some proposals for the building construction sector in Colombia that would 
mitigate the problems in this sector and reduce the possibility of building collapse in the country. The study carried 
out a literature review on the barriers and critical success factors (CSF) for the implementation of total quality 
management (TQM) in the construction sector in different geographical contexts. Based on the 12 barriers and 8 
identified success factors, the existence of these aspects was evaluated in the case of the collapse of the Space building 
located in Medell√≠n, Colombia. As a result, the importance and consequences, both positive and negative, of the 
implementation of TQM in this sub-sector can be particularly evidenced.

Construction, Total Quality Management (TQM), Barriers, Critical Success Factors (CSF), Space Building.   
 
1. Introduction  
Total quality management (TQM) is a management method to ensure customer satisfaction by implementing the 
concept of quality management in every area of organisations. In the construction sector, McIntyre & Kirschenman 
(2000) stated that contractors using TQM reported higher customer satisfaction, improved schedule performance, 
better relationships with architectural and engineering firms, and a reduction in rework. Jha and Iyer (2006) mention 
that the benefits can be cost reduction and improved job satisfaction of employees.  The repercussions and 
consequences of poor quality can be a loss of productivity, additional costs for rework and repairs, and loss of 
reputation, thus leading to a loss of market share and finally going out of business. 
 
In line with the above authors, Dilawo and Salimi (2019) pointed out that the poor performance found in the industry, 
such as wastage, rework and low levels of customer satisfaction, reveals the need for a practical method of self-
monitoring and the development of a quality culture. Another contribution made by these authors was showing that 
achieving stakeholder satisfaction and project completion within predefined time, cost and quality constraints is not 
an easy task (Al-Tmeemy et al., 2012).  
 
On the other hand, construction in Colombia has a high impact on economy and development, for example, the sub-
sector of building construction had a GDP growth of 7% in 2019 and the case of housing sales had a contribution of 
4%, being the fourth sector with the highest level of production of the 59 that make up the national productive 
apparatus representing 1 out of every 4 colombian pesos of investment in the economy (Public tender, IDU-LP-SGI-
029-2019). Despite its importance, the construction sector in Colombia has been marked by a low implementation of 
TQM, which is evidenced by deficiencies in the measurement of performance and productivity in the sector. This low

Use of new technologies and tools: In relation to factors 4 and 5 on continuous improvement and quality tools, 
it is proposed to use new technologies, such as the Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodology and Lean 
Construction, so that design projects, together with engineering projects, achieve the expected efficiency and 
fulfil their operational functions, without putting people's lives at risk. Likewise, the collapse situation presented 
in the Space building could have been mitigated if the Plan, Do, Check, Act (PHVA) cycle and cause/effect 
diagrams had been implemented from the first moment in which problems were identified, presented are analysed 
with, and corrections can be formulated at the appropriate times. 
 
5. Conclusions  
In general, in construction companies, the implementation of quality management and control aims to improve 
processes and results, in order to make them more competent and achieve a good economic performance and a high 
satisfaction of the actors involved, such as clients, suppliers and investors. For this reason, in addition to the ISO 9001 
certification, as evidenced by the methodology and results of the case in the Space building, it is essential that 
companies in the construction sector in Colombia are committed to the acquisition of knowledge, training and 
implementation of the CSF, which must be implemented throughout the entire construction process, from design and 
procurement of inputs and materials to the execution of the project.  
 
It is worth noting that most of the problems originated in top management: poor or deficient communication within 
the organisation, lack of control bodies to verify the quality of materials and finally the quality of the construction 
process. One of the possible solutions to all these events, as observed in the proposals of this paper, is the 
implementation of quality control and management methodologies. The lack of qualified labour requires continuous 
supervision. On the other hand, control by external agents is also needed, mainly from the curators who have the 
obligation to review all the plans, specifications, and calculations of the structure. It should be demonstrated that at 
least the approach of the work is complying with the current seismic resistant standard, to avoid catastrophes such as 
the one in the Space building. 
 
The lack of general and case studies and research on the construction industry from the TQM perspective in Colombia 
was identified. Despite this, the usefulness of this type of study for society in general was also recognised.  By making 
this type of situation visible, the learning generated can be shared with the interested public in the form of a final 
report showing the lessons learned from the work, together with the development of the solution that successfully 
overcame the situation presented. This is recommended for all projects, not only those that did not meet quality and 
service standards, but also those in which the difficulties were minor and had no major complications in their 
execution.

Abstract 
 
Supervised training of deep learning models has become a tool for resolving multidisciplinary issues for the 
different disciplines worldwide. The medical field is one of these areas where machine learning participates in 
medical image analysis to improve and support the existing medical instrumentation. Globally, different 
diagnostic tests for urinary tract infections (UTIs) are used in clinical practices. However, UTIs tend to be 
asymptomatic for people and cause complications over time because of late detection. In this project, we 
propose the development of an automatic urinalysis system for pyuria detection. For this, a convolutional neural 
network is trained and tested to identify White Blood Cells (WBCs). The automatic urinalysis system can detect 
and count the number of WBCs in a urine sample.

Abstract 
 
Makerspaces have been increasingly adapted for schools, libraries, social causes, private companies and many other 
stratums. Each of them counts with a very unique state of affairs that and specific outcomes. It is common to create 
makerspaces for specific purposes like entrepreneurship, research, creativity and innovation, or STEAM education to 
name a few, and find out that results do not flow as expected. To date there are no guidelines or identified metrics to 
build a makerspace with the right set of assets to achieve the desired goals. The objective of this study is to identify 
different types of makerspaces as well as the characteristics, goals and conditions required for their successful 
operation. We established the basic parameters to define a makerspace through a literature review of the terms 
makerspace, FabLab, and co-creation lab. Then, we interviewed ten makerspace representatives in order to analyze 
their makerspace environments and criteria of success. With this input, we designed a survey intended to recollect 
information worldwide from makerspace managers and users in order to identify the relationships between 
characteristics, operation practices and key metrics that make a successful makerspace.

Abstract  
 
The research includes the digital competences of university teachers, whose objective was to describe the level of 
digital competences of teachers of the universities of Cusco-Peru in times of Covid-19. The research method was 
quantitative approach making use of statistical analysis, descriptive scope for which the characteristics of the study 
unit were identified, of non-experimental design since the research was carried out without deliberate manipulation of 
the study variable, observing it in its natural and cross-sectional context as it is carried out in a specific time frame. 
The study population was made up of 2,740 students corresponding to the professional schools of Administration, 
International Business, Economics, Marketing, Accounting and Administrative Sciences of the universities of Cusco 
in the virtual modality, there is a representative random sample of 886 students with a level 97% confidence level and 
3% maximum estimation error, the research technique was the survey, the data collection instrument was the virtual 
questionnaire, and the SPSS statistical software was used for information processing.  The most significant and 
relevant findings in the research correspond to the digital competences of university teachers considered high with 
35.10% and very high with 32.10%, since professional commitment is relevant in the development of the teaching-
learning process with the use of digital resources, the digital pedagogy used by teachers in evaluation and feedback 
that allows to empower students and continuously strengthen students' digital competence. Another of the findings 
obtained in the research corresponds to the professional commitment, which is the digital competence developed by 
the teachers with 83% that is evidenced through the dedication and commitment in the development of their teaching 
work using digital tools. On the other hand, it is shown that the evaluation and feedback process is considered by 
72.50%, which is equivalent to a very low, low, and regular level, evidencing a low level of use of digital resources 
to innovate in the application of evaluations and feedback. The research is relevant as a contribution to further studies 
and to take corrective measures if necessary.

high in 67.2% due to the professional commitment during the development of the teaching-learning process in the 
professional training of students and the use of technological tools. 
 
It is concluded that professional commitment is high and very high in 83% according to the results obtained, since it 
allows teachers to use digital technologies not only at the University but also in their day to day, for their individual 
and collective professional development. 
 
Teachers within the variety of digital resources have selected what is best adapted for each subject they teach, each 
group of students and their teaching style. Likewise, they make use of the security regulations in terms of data 
protection and sensitivity of critical data when using shared files and in research topics in the same way they indicate 
to students respect for copyright. All this is reflected as high and very high with 72.7% obtained as a result of the 
study. 
 
Digital pedagogy corresponds to 78.6% according to the result obtained is high and very high, which indicates the use 
of technologies effectively during the planning and execution of the activities of the teaching-learning process. 
 
Regarding the evaluation and feedback, a 72.50% was obtained, which is equivalent to a very low, low and regular 
level, evidencing a low level of use of digital resources to innovate in the application of evaluations and feedback. 
Only 27.5% of teachers make optimal use of digital resources to innovate in the application of evaluations, although 
this is a critical point in the teaching-learning process, it must be complemented with individual or collective feedback, 
thus achieving better perception by students.  In the same way, in terms of empowering students in the use of digital 
technologies, a high and very high result has been obtained with a 52.1% response in the surveys, which indicates that 
not all teachers actively involve students in the use of technologies to create or explain a new topic or promote their 
transversal skills, being important that the participation of students can be promoted. 
 
Finally, we can see that facilitating digital competence in students is high and very high with 65.7% in the surveys, 
this being a transversal competence that teachers need to teach students the proper use of digital technologies: the 
creation of content, responsible use, digital problem solving, information literacy and digital communication; All of 
this will allow students to use digital resources effectively and efficiently.

Abstract 
This paper proposes a linear search Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm to 
maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) index in the least number of iterations and determine which succession 
measure converges and maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the least number of iterations. The analysis and 
validation are performed with experimental simulation and validated with four case studies collected from the 
literature. The case studies were evaluated in ten experiments with different combinations of the succession measures 
ùëéùëéùëòùëò and ùëêùëêùëòùëò.  The results show that the proposed SPSA is an iterative, efficient, and easy to use method to maximize the 
quality indexes of production processes, which is feasible to implement within the six sigma methodology. Also, the 
results show that experiments 3 and 5 converge to the best results in the four case studies analyzed.

1. Introduction
The Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm is an iterative optimization method for 
multivariate stochastic systems (James C Spall, 1992), of the Kiefer and Wolfowitz type, Wolfowitz is designed for 
stochastic problems (Lu & Zhou, 2019; Radenkoviƒá, Stankoviƒá, & Stankoviƒá, 2018) and has the advantage of not 
requiring extensive knowledge of the process being analyzed (Miranda & K Del Castillo, 2011), it can be used when 
the relationship between response variables and their controllable factors is unknown.

The results obtained in this research show that the difference between the results of each experiment is relatively 
small. Only in model 1 a significant change is observed between the results of ten experiments, which does not happen 
in the results obtained in the evaluations of models 2, 3 and 4 in which the maximum values obtained are practically 
the same in all 10 experiments. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This research proposes an SPSA algorithm to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (ùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜ
‡∑£) in the least number of 
iterations, and it is also sought to determine which of the succession measures cited in the literature of this algorithm

maximizes the (ùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜ

Another objective of this work is to improve by at least 10% the results reported by the authors of each case study 
analyzed. It is important to highlight that this objective was not achieved. However, there were improvements, greater 
than 2% for model 1, greater than 1% in model 3, and greater than 7% in model 4, only in model 2 there was no 
percentage improvement. 
Furthermore, the succession measures that converge on the maximum values of the variable (ùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜùëÜ

combinations of experiments of the succession measures for the proposed SPSA algorithm in the four case studies are

Finally, the results obtained show that the proposed SPSA algorithm is an easily implemented, efficient, and iterative 
method, which can be considered as an experimental tool for the improvement of quality indices that evaluate the 
aptitude of the processes within the Six Sigma methodology. 
Future research should propose a Stochastic Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm 
capable of working with discrete and mixed controllable factors, and that is robust to the process quality indices to be 
optimized with the succession measures evaluated in this research.

Abstract 
 
The cold chain logistics of fresh flowers in China has always been high, and Yunnan Province, as the largest fresh 
flower market in China, also has some problems. This research aims to study fresh flower cold chain logistics and 
rank the factors affecting the fresh flower cold chain logistics in Yunnan Province. Flower's cold chain logistics 
process comprises front-end logistics, mid-end logistics, and back-end logistics. This research analyzes the influencing 
factors through literature reviews and evaluates the factors affecting the cold chain logistics of fresh flowers in Yunnan 
Province with the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. It was found that degree of loss (0.57937) is the most important, 
followed by transportation system (0.23413) and wholesaler activities (0.18651). Moreover, perishable (0.32322) is 
the most important sub-factor and other important sub-factors are cold chain transportation equipment (0.15609), 
transportation time (0.15258), and professionalism of employees (0.13988).

1. Introduction 
With the continuous development of the Chinese fresh flower industry, China has occupied an important position in 
the world's fresh flower production. Fresh flowers have excellent ornamental and gift properties, making them more 
favored by consumers in daily life and special festivals. According to data, from 16.88 billion yuan in 2016 to 53.51 
billion yuan in 2019, the size of China's fresh flower e-commerce market has increased year by year. It is estimated 
that China's fresh flower e-commerce market will be 72.06 billion yuan in 2020 (Statista, 2020). The climate of 
Yunnan Province is unique and suitable for the growth of fresh flowers. The fresh flowers of Yunnan Province are 
also supplied to Asia and even exported to Europe. The fresh flower industry has become a very important industry in 
Yunnan Province. 
 
The fresh flowers themselves are perishable, so they have high requirements for storage, transportation, and other 
activities. A cold chain is used to preserve, extend, and ensure the shelf life of products, such as fresh products, 
seafood, frozen food, film, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products. Adequate refrigeration is especially important to 
prevent quantitative and qualitative food loss. The cold chain is a series of uninterrupted cold production, storage, and 
distribution activities, as well as related equipment and logistics, which can maintain quality within the required low 
temperature range (Wang and Zhang, 2008).  
 
The current Yunnan cold chain logistics system for fresh flowers is not perfect, and the logistics operation level is 
low. This has caused serious loss of fresh flowers, so the cold chain logistics of fresh flowers has been high, and the 
transaction price of fresh flowers will also increase. Therefore, it is particularly important to analyze factors of the 
Yunnan fresh flower cold chain logistics. 
 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a method for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, using math and 
psychology (Pagano, et al., 2021). It was developed by Saaty, (1980) and has been refined since then. AHP is a 
systematic analysis method that combines qualitative and quantitative. It can quantitatively analyze the weights of 
each influencing factor and various indicators of the overall goal. AHP and other methods can be used to analyze 
relevant data obtained from expert interviews.

5. Conclusion 
As China's largest fresh flower trading market in Yunnan Province, cold chain management is crucial to the sales of 
fresh flowers in Yunnan Province. It could improve the quality of the fresh flowers by prolonging the life of the fresh 
flowers and increasing the value of the fresh flowers. Flowers cold chain logistics process can be roughly divided into 
three stages, in turn: front-end logistics, mid-end logistics, back-end logistics. Among reviewed factors, degree of loss 
(0.57937) is the most important, especially on the perishable (0.32322) as the most weighted sub-factor. The flower 
industry in Yunnan Province needs to develop a diversified cold chain transportation system to solve the perishable 
problem. Moreover, fresh flower employees should be trained by foreign professional team to leverage skills.

Abstract 
 
The implementation of total quality management (TQM) has been widely adopted by several organizations of different 
sectors, with the goal of obtaining a competitive advantage in relation to their rivals. Likewise, higher education has 
grown the interest in adopting this methodology with the purpose of attracting increasingly more students for their 
institutions. However, after a literature review, several obstacles were revealed when trying to implement TQM in this 
sector, since some of its important concepts do not adjust to the specific requirements of the education sector. This 
document presents, on the one hand, a comparison between the countries with most ISO 9001 certifications and a 
world ranking of the best universities, proving that there is no relation between quality certifications and performance 
of the universities. On the other hand, quality tools are analyzed, and it is decided which of them could be used to 
create proposals for implementing, in a better way, the TQM in educational institutions and obtaining a real impact in 
their performance. 
 
Keywords 
Total quality management, higher education. 
 
1. Introduction 
Quality control and management comprise several strict practices that are usually associated with mass goods 
production industries, for example, automotive and metallurgical sectors, since people have a conception about quality 
which is heavily attached to standardization concept and products of the previously mentioned industries are true 
samples of standardized and standardizable products. Trying to understand the quality control and management role 
at less ‚Äútangible‚Äù industries (service industry) may be difficult, because in these sectors there are no physical products 
that undergo material strength tests or length measurements to compare with a reference model. One of these non-
tangible sectors is the education sector, which is fairly far from goods industries in various aspects. The main 
difference between education and goods industries becomes evident at the end of the ‚Äúproductive process‚Äù, as 
education industry produces no material goods in a direct way, but knowledge that is shared to the students. For some 
authors, students are not customers in the education system, although they are the ones who obtain the cognitive stock 
shared by teachers. Instead, the client is the productive system that the professional faces after finishing their career 
(Bailey and Bennett 1996). 
 
There are some different versatile tools in Total Quality Management (TQM) that are adaptable to different contexts 
as the education sector. The joint of tools such as Deming cycle or PDCA cycle (Plan, Do, Check and Act) and quality 
control and management formal practices has worked for other productive fields such as manufacturing and healthcare 
(Crawford 1994; Shortell et al. 1995; Schmele 1996). Regarding the education field, and specifically the higher 
education field, there are no mass antecedents about applying similar strategies, and one of the reasons is that there 
are multiple difficulties when implementing, since, as Cruickshank (2003) states, people often resist change, and in 
the academic field there is also a lack of credibility in methods even when statistics back them up. 
 
If education must be quality guarantor, and traditionally known practices of goods industry are not easily attachable 
to services sector, the need of reinforcing existing methods regarding quality management at educational institutions 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

842","as a safe investment for the client, who is understood in this context as the student. The main interested parties in 
guaranteeing a quality education (not just for certifications without typical practices of total quality management) 
should be the government administrations and companies, that is, the public and private sector, since the product of 
universities is the future staff that will dinamize the different productive sectors. For this reason, following proposals 
were made to ensure a total quality management in the education sector: 
 
1. 
Active participation of the private sector in building and development of the study plan: 
Continuing in the line of the productive sector as a client of education (Bailey and Bennett 1996), it must watch for 
good practices inside universities, therefore, it is suggested that entrepreneurs and directors of companies in the private 
sector of different economies have voice within the college councils as in the case study mentioned by Cruickshank 
(2003). Since this sector knows the needs of the productive system, when linked with pedagogical entities, it will be 
possible to design strategies for giving students useful tools for the job world, thus contributing to competitivity, in 
contrast with students from institutions that make no effort to implement quality. This proposal follows the 
appreciation of Harvey (1998), who talks about identifying the motivations of stakeholders to develop an effective 
long-term plan. 
 
2. 
Creation of a monitoring system for objectives tracked by entities in charge of national education:  
The beginning of quality management indicates that TQM requires active participation from all the actors that 
comprise the environment (Gutierrez 2010), therefore, it is suggested to include spokesmen of different parts that 
actively participate in the construction of a monitoring system of results obtained to adjust those aspects that do not 
contribute to significant areas to the project. To follow this process, it is possible to use tools like brainstorming, 
control cards for variables (following up data that relate statistics of dropout rates and academic success), among other 
tools of statistical management. 
 
3. 
Make the student an internal observer: 
Fendt and Vavrek (1992) affirm that the external inspections are only reviews that do not assure quality. This can be 
caused by the institutions that prepare for evaluation visits from the entity that certifies them, without making real 
changes in their practices. To strengthen the quality internalizing practices and concepts a feeling of belonging must 
be instilled in the student to the institution while he is aware that he is a client of a system (seen from an individual 
perspective), so that the student has the capacity to identify the daily practices that are inside the institution and that 
do not belong to TQM. This can guarantee some analog inspections to those made by academic peers but with greater 
rigor and during a continuous period, in order to prevent that institutions, prepare only for evaluation day without real 
internal changes, hence the evaluation would be permanent and from the inside. 
 
4. 
Identification and strengthening of the fundamental pillars of education: 
The contribution that the different parts of the educational system make to the system itself must be measured, in 
addition a diagnostic of the actual state in order to weigh and prioritize the strengthening of the areas that require it, 
thus ensuring an internal balance of the components of the educational system. As possible pillars suggested, we found 
the teaching, research, extension, and teaching methods (Hebert et al., 1995; Vazzana et al. 1997). 
 
5. 
Pedagogy certification required for teachers: 
One of the most important factors in education performance are teachers, owing to their role as ‚Äúknowledge 
facilitators‚Äù (Lovren V.O. 2017), then, it is important to guarantee that they are the most suitable people for this 
teaching job. Consequently, it is proposed that each teacher compulsorily has a pedagogy certification, since it is not 
enough for a teacher to know in depth any topic and/or being academically recognized if they do not know how to 
transmit all the knowledge to their students, which would mean that the person is not able for teaching. 
 
6. 
Periodical training about new teaching mechanisms:         
Teaching tools are constantly evolving as well as teaching methods, thus it is considered that teachers should have 
periodical training about new teaching ways, which we consider must be assessed for ensuring that the process is 
being useful for them and their students. This proposal obeys to the principle of continuous improvement in quality 
management (Gutierrez 2010). 
 
5. Conclusions 
In summary, it was found that counting with many quality certifications does not imply that a country has the best 
rated or recognized institutions in the world.  After checking how well positioned are the best universities of each of 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021
¬© IEOM Society International
848","the countries with high number of certifications (Germany, Italy, Spain, Colombia and India), it was found that only 
one of them has some universities within the first 100 positions, while the others are not close to this privilege. 
 
It is necessary to emphasize on the proposed tools to improve quality management, since they aim to attack the 
recognized problems in the literature review, especially as pointed out by Cruickshank (2003) about the inclusion of 
all the staff that comprise the higher education institutions. There exists a tool derived from the TQM techniques that 
fits ideally this issue: brainstorming, which integrates all the parts that compose the organizations of interest covered 
in this article and is also complemented by other practices like the Ishikawa‚Äôs diagram and the PDCA cycle to organize 
the obtained ideas and check the projects to implement. 
 
Finally, concrete proposals are presented covering from the design of study plans that fit the demand in the world of 
work by the same business to which future graduates will belong, to using the student to check that the objectives are 
achieved inside of academy and qualify the professors for the transmission of knowledge to be effective. What is 
expected from the graduates is to supply the needs of the professional world. Besides training in pedagogy for 
professors, it is important that they update their knowledge about new techniques and methods of teaching, always 
searching the best possible way for the training of students, thus guaranteeing the quality of institutions and satisfaction 
of both the graduates and the companies in which they will work. 
 
In conclusion, this article stands out for performing a literature review that helps to understand the real issues in the 
sector of interest (in this case, the education). Additionally, it exposes the insufficiency that quality certifications 
present, since they do not check the real performance of the institutions. It also shows how to attack those problems 
through checked and effective strategies to finally offer concrete and comprehensive proposals with clear objectives.

Abstract 
 
Agile methodologies center around the concept of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve as 
project advances in its development. The big advantage of agile development is that it allows teams to deliver value 
faster, with higher quality, predictability, and with a better ability to respond to change. Agile methodologies have 
been widely used in software industries where they have had proven results. However, development of new 
technological devices for the healthcare industry is traditionally a very long and arduous process that takes years from 
its conception to its market release. The use of agile frameworks has the potential to dramatically reduce the time to 
market for healthtech products as well as improve the final product. This thesis is a study of agile methodologies in 
the development of healthtech products. This involves a study of the current literature of how agile methodologies are 
currently applied and the application of said methods to the design and development of a new biotesting device by 
using SCRUM and agile digital boards. The result is the development of a UTI diagnostic device and a thorough 
analysis of the advantages and pitfalls that the use of agile methodologies had in the design and development of this 
new product.

Abstract 
 
Science fiction is an instrument for innovation. It has inspired generations to endorse the value of science and it has 
helped shape the future through the unceasing speculation of what it could look like. In recent years, science fiction 
has been employed as a tool for design. As a device to explore alternative future scenarios, it encourages developing 
solutions that require groundbreaking thinking. Additionally, it serves as a resource to discuss the ramifications of the 
technological innovations that it prompted in the first place.  Innovation is repeatedly labeled as the process that uses 
the current knowledge and technologies to create something new or improve something existing. However, the 
innovation process is fraught with uncertainty, mainly when dealing with sci-fi methods. The knowledge of the future 
will always be incomplete, and there will always be technologies that will remain undiscovered by the time the 
prototyping occurs. What if instead of trying to abate that technological and knowledge uncertainty, we could adopt 
them as agents of the model to create better futures? To date there is no standard approach that considers these two 
criteria of uncertainty as the vehicle to achieve different results. Moreover, previous research considers them as 
objectionable aspects. This paper proposes a new methodology based on the assumption that developing new products 
challenging the future and its unpredictability is possible. Furthermore, taking advantage of the uncertainty that this 
process inevitably involves, it is attainable to discover and build the path to the technological development of the sci-
fi ideated product. To construct and evaluate the usability of this tool it was necessary to: i) track the leverage of 
popular sci-fi technologies and its mutual influence in innovation, ii) review and synthesize previous studies and 
methodologies, iii) create a new methodology, iv) design a specialized workshop to test it, and v) map the path through 
which determined sci-fi ideas have the potential to become a reality.

Abstract 
 
The electronic components of electric guitars have a notorious influence on the sounds that can be produced with 
them. On the other hand, floating bridges allow the user to change the pitch by moving one end of the strings/varying 
the applied tension; floating bridges that work with springs located at the guitar rear are the most common. To improve 
the sonic capabilities of the guitar, it was designed an electronic swapping system that compatible with a rear springs 
bridge configuration. The design method used combined the Pahl & Beitz requirements approach with the Excitement 
Feature concept of the Kano model. This article presents the design of a guitar body with a side-removable module 
that contains the entire electronic system and can be swapped without removing the guitar strings.

1. Introduction  
The electric guitar is one of the most popular musical instruments nowadays. Several options in the electric guitar 
market offer aesthetic variety not only on the visual side of things, but in their sonic capabilities. Components such as 
the bridge and the electronics delimitate the sounds that can be generated with the instrument.  
 
The bridge is located at the guitar body, and it is the element that sets the vibrating lengths of the strings and -in most 
cases- secures the ends of the strings. It is possible to classify the bridges in two categories: fixed and floating (also 
referred as tremolo or vibrato). Whereas a fixed bridge has just the functions previously mentioned, a floating bridge 
allow the player to change the tension on the strings by using a lever, this changes the pitch (French, 2012). Floating 
bridges that work with springs located at the guitar rear are the most common.  
 
Speaking of sonic capabilities of the electric guitar, its electronics play a huge role in the electric signal that the 
instrument sends to the amplifier, and it is noticeable in the produced sound. There are commercial guitars that 
incorporate pickup swapping systems and others that swap the complete electronic system. On one hand, the Ampeg 
Dan Armstrong Lucite guitar allows the user to swap pickups and connect them to the rest of the electronic system; 
this guitar has an extended cavity for the pickups to allow a sideways swap. As can be observed in Figure 1, Relish 
Guitars allow to swap the pickups from the rear of the guitar body.

According with the previously presented studies, the proposed design is presented in Figure 6. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Proposed design render. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This design allows to easily swap the whole electronics system in a guitar equipped with the most versatile floating 
bridge configuration in the market, therefore, it combines in a single instrument feature that otherwise would require 
multiple guitars. The functional analysis of the body showed that each guitar body portion has its functions and ways 
to interact with the user. There is a specific portion that storage the electronics and supports the guitar when the player 
performs seated. The usage of just a metal box for portion C allowed to get a big empty space for the electronics 
system and provides electromagnetic isolation; this configuration is advised even for instruments that do not include 
an electronic swapping system.  
 
The electronics storage proposal has enough space behind the strings for up to four standard size humbucker pickups; 
additionally, the empty space in section C allows to place knobs and switches without interfering with the user 
plucking hand, as well as a 9 V battery and some active circuits.  
 
It is hard to say if the proposed design is compatible with sustainer systems. Although there have been guitars with so 
much aluminum that the circulating electrical currents were dissipated before they reached the bridge pickup (i.e. the 
sustainer driver), the usage of non-magnetic metals near the pickups is not recommended in guitars that include a 
Sustainiac (Sustainiac, 2018). Testing and simulations are requiered to determine this compatibility. 
 
For this particular design, it was considered to place the tuning elements at the guitar body (commonly referred as 
headless configuration), this configuration has been used in ergonomic instrument design (Genani, 2013). This 
disposal allows to reduce the guitar body weight easily than the traditional configuration. Future design iterations may 
consider the optimization of the aluminum frame, as well as the usage of other high strength materials. 
 
Finally, it is important to mention that there are floating bridges that do not obstruct the rear face of the guitar, but 
most of them are not as versatile as the rear springs‚Äô configuration. For future designs, it could be considered to 
combine a rear electronic swapping system with one of these bridges. Some examples are the Floyd Rose FRX, the 
Kahler, the Bigsby, and the Fender Jaguar bridge.

and Grade Level of Online High School Students

Abstract 
 
This project investigates the commonality and effect of imposter syndrome in the students of online high schools, 
using Stanford University Online High School (OHS) as a sample. Multiple scientific studies define imposter 
syndrome in similar ways, and it is estimated that 70% of people experience this phenomenon in their lives. However, 
imposter syndrome has rarely been investigated in such a young demographic before, nor in online school students, 
and therefore this project aims to spread awareness about the prevalence of imposter syndrome in online high school 
students. The variables include grade level, experiencing imposter syndrome, and where a student experienced it (at 
school, home, extracurriculars, etc.). The data sampled through an anonymous survey was investigated through 10 
statistical tests: 9 chi-square tests, and 1 Kruskal-Wallis test. OHS students, on average, are statistically significantly 
more likely to experience imposter syndrome than the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù person. However, the 7th and 8th-grade samples 
showed no statistically significant difference from the expected results. This data supports the alternative hypothesis 
that online high schoolers are more likely to experience imposter syndrome, which was reasoned to be due to the more 
difficult and higher amount of work, as well as the mounting pressure to achieve success.

1. Introduction 
Imposter syndrome: the feeling of being a fraud, or imposter, in your own skin. Many people, of any age and gender, 
struggle with the effects of imposter syndrome, also known as the imposter phenomenon. This term was originally 
coined by psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanna Imes in 1978, in their article The imposter phenomenon in 
high-achieving women: Dynamics and therapeutic intervention. While not recognized in the official Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), imposter syndrome is defined by Merriam-Webster as ""a 
psychological condition that is characterized by persistent doubt concerning one's abilities or accomplishments 
accompanied by the fear of being exposed as a fraud despite evidence of one's ongoing success."" 
 
Despite being frequently studied in adults, both young and old, and especially in the high achieving working and 
academic field, imposter syndrome is rarely studied in children and adolescents. As they transition from childhood to 
adulthood, adolescents face challenges in not only their physically growing bodies but also their developing brains. 
The effect of various factors on adolescent brains is often studied, such as social media, school, and more recently, 
the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected many people‚Äôs mental health. However, students of online high schools 
face a unique challenge as they adjust to the different learning environment and increased social isolation, compared 
to those in traditional ‚Äúbrick-and-mortar‚Äù schools. Therefore, this project sets out to study imposter syndrome in online 
high school students and bring awareness to the prevalence of this phenomenon which appears to affect so many of 
these students, even more than the average world population.  
 
2. Methods 
Background research was conducted into the definitions and previous studies on imposter syndrome to clearly define 
what behaviors the survey would look for in the students. An anonymous Google Forms survey was used to collect 
non-parametric, nominal scale data.  Null and alternative hypotheses were formulated to predict the results of the 
statistical tests.

866","Table 4. Showing the breakdown of the four most common answer combinations to the third question. 
4. Conclusion 
Overall, the students of Stanford Online High School demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the presence 
of imposter syndrome compared to the estimated average of 70% per population. When looking at the question of 
‚ÄúHave you ever felt Imposter Syndrome in your life?‚Äù, the positive ‚ÄúYes‚Äù answers across all grade levels, and the 
total, showed a statistically significant difference from the norm. The negative ‚ÄúNo‚Äù answers across the total and grade 
levels demonstrated a statistically highly significant difference from the expected results. From this, we can see that 
OHS students, on average, are much more likely to experience imposter syndrome than the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù person. This 
indicates that the null hypothesis can be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis accepted.   
 
However, once we break these results down by grade level, we see different results, some statistically significant and 
others not, a phenomenon similar to Simpson‚Äôs Paradox. The 7th and 8th-grade samples showed no statistically 
significant difference from the expected results. However, all the high school students‚Äô results (9th-12th grade) 
demonstrated a statistically significant difference from the expected results, as the observed number of ‚ÄúYes‚Äù answers 
were much higher than the expected rate of 70%.  
 
A conclusion can be drawn that OHS middle school students experience less imposter syndrome than OHS high school 
students, as being at OHS has not yet influenced their likelihood to develop those feelings. This supports the alternative 
hypothesis again and likely demonstrates that high schoolers are more likely to experience imposter syndrome, 
potentially caused by the more difficult courses and higher amount of work, as well as the greater pressure to achieve 
as they near adulthood. However, it may not show that the alternative hypothesis, that all OHSers are more likely to 
do so than the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù person, is more likely to be true. 
 
Additionally, the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was no statistically significant difference between how many 
students answered per grade level and the location they chose, based on the 4 most common combinations of answers. 
No matter where they have experienced the imposter syndrome, there is approximately the same number of people 
per grade level who chose each location. 
 
Because Stanford Online High School students demonstrate a higher likelihood of experiencing imposter syndrome, 
other online high school students may as well, and awareness about the prevalence of this issue in adolescents should 
be spread to help the students counteract and cope with the imposter syndrome.  
 
5. Future Research 
Finally, if this project was redone, several aspects would be changed to control more variables, as well as to run more 
statistical tests. First, all the survey answers should be from an average-workload period, perhaps across two weeks, 
so that there is not too much fluctuation in student‚Äôs emotions based on approaching finals or a recent break. Secondly, 
an even greater sample size would be gathered, especially of 7th-graders, so that the sample results may more 
accurately represent the whole population. Even within the three variables which were investigated in this project, 
there are many more opportunities to run statistical tests. For example, Kruskal-Wallis tests could be run to compare 
each grade level‚Äôs answers to ‚ÄúHave you ever felt Imposter Syndrome in your life?‚Äù, or even just between high school 
students or middle school students (Mann-Whitney for two samples). There were many other variables involved in 
my survey which were not subjected to statistical testing, such as the various causes and effects of imposter syndrome, 
as well as whether the student has found someone to help them cope, and who this is. A further investigation into this 
would be both interesting and beneficial to find the root of these issues and more effective ways to deal with them.

Abstract 
 
This document presents a research project that consisted of verifying the logistical viability of centralizing 
warehouses in a construction company called Vidusa. The project was carried out in stages, the first stage 
consisted in structuring the statement of the problem by collecting as much relevant information as possible 
through interviews, observation and historical data such as volume flow of building materials, the location of the 
warehouses, the home construction projection, etc. in order to understand the processes of the company and how 
it operates;  The next stage consisted in analyzing the information, first, to find out where to put the centralized 
warehouse, the median p model was used, which seeks to minimize the distance between warehouses taking into 
account the construction of houses per year in each construction site. This model was run in Python, in a Google 
library called Or-Tools, which allows to run Mixed Integer Problems (MIP). Once the location of the new 
centralized warehouse was selected, the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) was run to find 
out the route to follow to deliver the building materials to the construction site. In which the number of vehicles, 
the delivery time windows of each site, the daily volumetric demand and the volumetric capacity of the vehicle 
were taken into account. Restrictions were added so the model could decide whether or not to visit a construction 
site and for the number of vehicles to use. The model was also run in Python. Once done the analysis of the 
operations and the supplies used in the constructions of housing along with the results obtained in the mathematical 
model, the project proceeded with the design of the warehouse in FactoryCAD using as template an actual 
warehouse that Vidusa already owns. On this design were considered the changes the actual process will have, 
like the use of a loading dock for each of the routes the warehouse will have, this to facilitate the load of the trucks. 
Also, how the supplies will be transported and organized inside the warehouse. The feasibility of the project was 
determined by comparing the costs of the initial investment and the costs of the operations involved in the current 
situation versus the proposed solution. The costs compared were the price of the equipment required (e.g., 
cantilevers, vehicles, lift trucks, etc.), the maintenance, services, fuel, among others. The analysis was carried out 
by simulating 5 years of the two scenarios and verifying if the proposed solution would impact the operating and 
investment cost of the current situation by reducing them.

1. Introduction  
Vidusa is a Mexican company based in Monterrey that develops homes in economic segments (social interest or 
IS) and residential plus (medium interest or IM), throughout its history they have developed more than 88,000 
homes, its process begins with the acquisition of the land, development of the project, the construction, and the 
delivery of the house to the client. In each of the constructions, a warehouse is built to store and protect the 
materials or supplies that are required until they are used. 
 
Currently, the company has twenty-one warehouses and recognizes the need to improve inventory control, that is 
why is developing a project where the objective is to analyze the viability of the following points: centralization 
of warehouses, relocation of warehouses and reduce transfer times from warehouses to construction sites. Viability 
is defined in terms of cost reduction primarily. This document aims to formalize the investigation of the first point: 
the centralization of warehouses. An investigation is presented divided into stages where the problem statement 
is first presented, the current situation of the company is described and the problem is structured; theoretical

874","6. Conclusion 
The Dynamic Synthesis Methodology facilitated the process of analysis, giving the structure necessary for the 
project. In the first step the establishment of the objectives was crucial, this way the range of the project was 
delimited. Also, it was possible to identify where the problem was and be able to structure it. The second stage of 
the project consisted of analyzing the information collected and building the models in order to determine a 
solution proposal. The most important thing in this stage was the establishment of the assumptions since the 
solution depends completely on them. At this stage, all relevant aspects that affect the operation of the warehouses 
were identified and analyzed to obtain the cost of the current operation of the company, salaries, infrastructure, 
security, among others. The next stage is the design proposal, after several visits to warehouses and to Taller 
Mec√°nico, the best practices of each were determined to be replicated, a first sketch was worked which  began as 
a replica of the Taller Mec√°nico warehouse, during the process requirements were added according to the result 
of the models and the assumptions that were established. The most important part of this stage is to be able to 
design a proposal considering all the points of view, from the people who are on the construction site, the architects 
who plan the taks, the managers of the warehouses, etc. The first two objectives were accomplished in this stage, 
the centralization of warehouses allows the construction of houses in series and the replicable model was realized.  
 
Another important part is to verify the financial viability, the improvement should be reflected in an increase in 
profits, which in this case is due to cost reduction. In the financial analysis, all the factors that generate expenses 
were identified, either for initial investment or for operating expenses. In the end, the expenses per year are 
converted to present value in order to be able to be compared with each other and to determine a decision. The 
result of the simulation showed that the centralization of warehouses is feasible because there is a cost reduction 
of approximately 20%; This is based on the estimates described in the previous sections as well as the established 
assumptions. The last objective was accomplished, the implementation is feasible in cost-benefit terms. This is 
unique research because it involves multiple analysis, first the location-allocation model, then the VRPTW. It's 
important to mention that these models were run in python. And finally, a complete financial analysis in order to 
decide the best option for the company.

Abstract 
 
Tourism is industrial sector that has been strongly affected in the last year. Due to the new normal, and the needs to 
maintain the safety of visitors, restrictions especially for tourist trips have been decreased. Mexico is positioned as the 
sixth most important destination worldwide, concentrating a significant and growing number of visitors worldwide. 
(OMT, 2018). Tourism GDP for Mexico contributes 8.7% in 2019 on the economy of the country but during the 
second and third trimester of 2020 the indicator decreased 47%, which is complemented by the growth of the original 
GDP for the tertiary cluster where it shows a growth of 2.87% in 2019 and decreased in 3.4% during 2020. With these 
parameters the impact of the tourism cluster on the generation of income that drives economic clusters and revitalize 
society. (Datatur SECTUR, 2019). The present approach defines a strategic alternative on the execution of services in 
non-traditional clusters, being tourism a cluster with a new business vision and an alternative for local development, 
becoming an important axis that links industries and services energizing economy worldwide. Applying mainly 
Porter¬¥s models and tools to analyze and design a strategic initiatives and projects to revitalize the tourism in Mexican 
Southern area, and creating value chains to support and improve social development, is the main approach of this 
research. Using the Diamond model, five forces analysis, the cluster mapping and other significant tools, this paper 
presents a strategy to create a new growth model based on clusters development and the recommended creation of 
specific sub clusters. The results of the research are a long term plan and the proposal of new policies to keep growing 
in region.

Introduction 
The present work allows to define an efficient development alternative on the execution of services in non-traditional 
clusters, with tourism being a cluster that has generated a change in the business vision and an alternative of local 
development, it becomes an important axis that links to industries and services and energizes the economy worldwide 
Mexico is positioned as the sixth most important destination worldwide, concentrating a significant and growing 
number of visitors worldwide. (OMT, 2018). Tourism GDP for Mexico contributes 3.3% in 2018 on the economy of 
the country, which is complemented by the growth of the original GDP for the tertiary cluster where it shows a growth 
of 2.87% in 2018, with these parameters the impact of the tourism cluster on the generation of income in the financial 
movement that drives economic clusters and as a means of revitalizing society. (Datatur SECTUR, 2018).  
 
The regional clusterization of tourism in Mexico, shows that the third most visited destination after Mexico City and 
the Riviera Maya, is Cancun, currently represents the best tourist offer in Mexico, receiving both national and 
international tourists in a significant percentage.

Abstract  
 
The supply chain is a network that involves organizations, resources, activities and technologies in the creation and 
sale of products, from suppliers of raw materials to subsequent manufacturers to consumers through delivery. 
However, supply chains are often vulnerable to risk of uncertainty. Risk in the supply chain is the exposure to the 
occurrence of a loss or injury that would affect the overall supply chain of the supply chain. In this study, the supply 
chain is assessed through analysis of the risks occurring in the supply chain in the real industry. The purpose of this 
study is to identify the existing risks in the supply chain in the food manufacturing industry in Malaysia. This study 
was conducted through interviews and questionnaires. Information and data obtained are used for risk analysis to 
identify the types of risks encountered in the supply chain through the Analytical Hierarchical Process Technique 
(AHP) method. In conclusion, the risk analysis in the supply chain can determine the highest risk types in the supply 
chain which is the risk of competition among companies (53%) and factors that cause such risks are competition from 
other manufacturers (86%) as well as market entry (14%). Furthermore, measures to overcome and mitigate these 
hazards can be carried out once risks are identified.

1. Introduction   
According to Absi et al. (2013), current industrial growth is increasingly affecting the future sustainability of the earth 
and its natural resources and environment. To address such concerns, human beings should be responsible for 
developing environmentally friendly activities efficiently and effectively. SCM activities, which are a variable of 
social life today, are fundamental to that responsibility. This is supported by Heckmann et al. (2014). It is stated that 
supply chain management is aimed at planning, monitoring and controlling the organizational chain so that the various 
types of flows between the original producer and the end customer can be interdependent with each other. Next, be 
able to maximize profits through efficiency as well as customer satisfaction.  
 
However, today‚Äôs supply chains are increasingly vulnerable to potential risks in the supply chain (Son and Orchard 
2013; Zsidisin and Wagner 2010). Risks in the supply chain will become more frequent if not addressed and also 
involve high costs. However, by identifying the types of risks as well as risk factors, risk mitigation plans can be put 
in place to increase opportunities and reduce threats to SCM. According to Kamalahmadi and Parast ( 2017), one of 
the risk factors in SCM is that suppliers are interdependent with each other, where disruption in one provider can 
disrupt another active provider.   
 
Furthermore, the supply chain is more vulnerable to risk due to several factors namely globalization of resources, 
increased competitiveness as well as upon the occurrence of internal and external risk events such as material shortages

899","Supply risk is the second type of risk that impacts these food manufacturing companies where rising raw material 
prices are the highest contributing factor to supply risk followed by supply shortages and supply quality failures.  
 
Manufacturing process risk is the third type of risk that occurs in companies A and B. The factor that records a high 
value in this risk is the factor of employee safety because the food manufacturing process in companies A and B 
involves high temperatures that can cause injury to employees. emphasized and if workers do not wear safety 
equipment as directed and followed by machine breakdown.  
 
As for transportation risk, the factors that cause the risk are the increased cost of delivery, delivery delays which are 
often caused by bad weather and also delivery failure factors.  
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
There are several suggestions that can be made for the improvement of the study in order to obtain more satisfactory 
results. Among the suggestions that can improve the study is the study of mapping is more comprehensive by involving 
all products produced by selected companies. In addition, in terms of the construction of the questionnaire, some 
structures can be improved to be more in line with what is to be studied in the industry itself. This is intended so that 
the factors studied are more specific and accurate.  
 
In addition, the company as a respondent in conducting the study can be multiplied so that the study can be done more 
accurately and should be studied continuously in order to help the SME industry solve problems and also reduce the 
losses faced by them. This is in line with the ongoing knowledge building on supply chain development in the SME 
food manufacturing industry.  
 
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, supply chain analysis in the industry is important so that the journey of a company runs smoothly in 
producing quality products and can meet customer demand. This analysis includes in terms of studies on supply chain 
mapping as well as risk analysis occurring in the food manufacturing industry. Next, measures to prevent need to be 
taken and must be emphasized so that the risk can be reduced and in turn can be avoided from happening bear times. 
In this study, the objectives that have been set have been achieved. For the first objective, supply chain network 
mapping was done based on the selected companies where the mapping focused on one key product from that 
company. Furthermore, for the second objective, the type of risk that occurs in the supply chain and also the causal 
factors for each risk can be identified using data obtained during the visit, interviews conducted and also through 
questionnaires that have been distributed to companies. which is studied.

Abstract 
 
National culture affects the way managers and employees think, interact with each other and with people outside their 
organization, the way they make organizational decisions, and the way they react to actions of other organizations on 
issues affecting them and their organization. This study investigates the impact of the use of power on supplier 
integration at different levels of the dimensions of national culture. By discussing relevant literature, it suggests 
hypotheses that describe the impact of the interaction between use of power and dimensions of national culture on 
supplier integration.

Abstract  
 
The global pressure to generate a competitive advantage in manufacturing companies has led to a boost in continuous 
improvement, in which supply chain management is one of the main indicators, the variables Just-in-time (JIT) and 
total quality management (TQM) variables play an important role in the operational strategy of manufacturing 
companies. In this applied research, 68 manufacturing companies in the Monterrey metropolitan area were analyzed 
and the relationship between JIT and TQM and how they affect supply chain management is sought. The results found 
that the TQM variable has a greater impact on supply chain management performance than the JIT variable, and thus, 
confirming the framework.  Both variables forecasted 63% of SCM's behavior. 
 
Keywords  
Just in time, Total Quality Management, Supply Chain Management. 
 
1. Introduction  
The external factors impacting the Mexican economy in recent years have generated uncertainty and nervousness in 
the manufacturing sector. In Mexico, according to the World Bank, manufacturing contributed 18 percent of GDP in 
2019. Most manufacturing companies are located in the north of the country, the main states with manufactory 
companies are Baja California, Chihuahua, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Sonora and Nuevo Leon. 
 
Currently, there are paradigms and practices that have arisen in response to market pressures that have increased the 
need to improve processes, quality, reduce delivery times and lower costs. Due to the above, in academia and 
organizations, there has been a particular focus on just-in-time and total quality management. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
The objective of this research is to determine the possible relationship between just-in-time (JIT) and total quality 
management (TQM) and its influence on supply chain management to improve the operational effectiveness of the 
company. The study is based on a sample of 68 manufacturing companies. 
 
2. Literature Review  
Since the 80's there has been an increase in studies on JIT and TQM. However, no care has been taken to analyze both 
variables at the same time. In this study, a theoretical framework on JIT, TQM variables will be developed and the 
relationship between the use of these practices and their impact on supply chain management performance will be 
analyzed. (Cua, k. O, 2001)

Abstract  
 
Fleet managers state that fuel consumption accounts for 50% of the operating costs of their cargo and passenger 
vehicle fleets. Aiming to reduce these costs, transport companies contract telematics services to track their units 
and monitor fuel consumption along with other variables. The gathered information is used to alert managers on 
events like excessive fuel consumption, abrupt breaks and needs of mechanical maintenance. We propose the use 
of this information to determine the fuel consumption of cargo vehicles at each km of the main roads of a given 
region and the influence of altitude, road grade and vehicle age on it. As a case study we studied the fuel 
consumption in the main logistic corridor of Colombia which are characterized by having a highly variable 
topography. Toward that end, we compared the fuel consumption monitored by a telematic system on 46 vehicles 
of different cargo capacity with the estimated by an energy balance model and observed that they are highly 
correlated (R2>0.99). Then, we used the calibrated model to obtain the km-by-km fuel consumption. This 
information is used by authorities to obtain a close estimation of the cost of cargo transport, the greenhouse gases 
emissions, and to identify locations with unusual high fuel consumption.  Furthermore, the slope of the linear 
correlation (Cf) decouples the fuel consumption associated to driving style (human factors) from other influencing 
factors. Then, we observed that the effects of altitude and vehicle age on fuel consumption are negligible and that 
most of the vehicle technologies studied has not improved in practice their real energy performance during the 
last 20 years.

The volume and complexity of data have expanded while demanding the need for specialized data protection solutions 
for many data-driven enterprises. Personal data is the internet's new oil and the digital world's new currency, has a big 
impact on privacy and security. Various laws have been implemented in many nations to protect people's personal 
information. One of them is GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which is particularly relevant for EU data 
processing businesses. Though it does not apply directly to Sri Lanka, it is directly applied to European Union 
counterparties. To avoid losing business with the EU, Sri Lanka must also comply with GDPR. Although there aren't 
many resources for GDPR implementation guidance, the existing ones are not very comprehensive. To resolve the 
issue, we went through a series of processes to construct a comprehensive model, after which we were able to develop 
a data governance model to deploy. The data governance model provides extensive direction for data management. 
We established the indicators and drivers that must be observed while applying the GDPR principles through 
interviews with industry professionals and completing an extensive literature study. A data governance model is 
provided in this study for data-driven organizations to simply implement compliance. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
This is a study about the European General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation 2016/679) and how it can be 
adapted to Sri Lankan enterprises easily in means of a data governance model. The General Data Protection Regulation 
(hereafter referred to as the Regulation or the GDPR) is a European Union regulation that governs data protection 
(EU). The European Council enacted the Regulation in April 2016 and it went into effect on May 25, 2018. The 
Regulation has an impact on how businesses process and manage personal data, as well as increasing citizen privacy 
rights and control. This study will address the Regulation and its data processing principles along with the data 
protection procedures the businesses could adhere to for Regulation‚Äôs implementation. The Regulation received a lot 
of attention from the general public at the beginning of 2018. As the deadline for compliance approached, millions of 
businesses and organizations sent e-mails to their consumers and clients alerting them that their privacy policies had 
been revised to comply with the Regulation. Following the Regulation's implementation, websites hosted outside of 
the EU were temporarily prohibited from accessing IP addresses in the EU. The websites were non-compliant with 
the Regulation, and the website owners did not want to risk being sanctioned. Whether or not they are aware of the 
Regulation, they will be impacted by it during the implementation period. Whether or not aware of the Regulation, 
users were almost certain to be affected by it throughout the implementation period, especially if you used digital

920","model at the same time. Data Accessibility, Data Quality, Data Availability, Data Security, Data Consistency, and 
Data Auditability are the outcomes. 
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements 
Following the main data collection, which includes interviews, the data will be studied further to revise the conceptual 
model, and then the final model will be finalized. In this study, the Thematic analysis method will be used to analyze 
the collected data. The goal of thematic analysis is to find patterns in the interview material. This analysis necessitates 
a constant back-and-forth between the complete data set and the coded data extracts that we have gathered. The 
acquired data must go through four phases in this analytical method (Mortensen 2020):  
 
‚Ä¢ 
Familiarize yourself with the information gathered. For interviews by familiarize yourself with the audio 
recordings. Transcripts must be written, and then first thoughts for codes to describe our content must be 
jotted down.  
‚Ä¢ 
Generating initial code: Data is allocated codes here. The term ""code"" refers to a quick explanation of what 
is mentioned in an interview, which is relevant to your area of study.  
‚Ä¢ 
Searching for themes: Themes are used to interpret the codes after they have been highlighted. Themes will 
give the codes a more active meaning.  
‚Ä¢ 
Reviewing the themes: Themes will be reviewed and refined in this section. 
‚Ä¢ 
Defining and Naming themes: The identified topics will be given a name and a description at this phase. 
 
5.3 Validation 
The model will be validated while conducting interviews with professionals in the field. Along with their insights into 
the strategies they've used to incorporate GDPR principles into the data management process, the validation of the 
model will take place. 
 
6 Conclusion 
The study comes to a close with a general conclusion, followed by a discussion of the study's limits and contributions. 
The chapter comes to a close with research recommendations. Various measures have been used to apply the 
Regulation in organizations, depending on the terms of the Regulation, the organizations' starting circumstances, and 
their needs. The success of the implementation is determined by elements such as the amount of time and resources 
given to it, as well as organizational structures and the implementation of indicators precisely. Through the conducted 
interviews as well we intend to gather more indicators on how each principle could be incorporated to a data 
governance model. Incorporating, all these factors into a data governance model makes it more convenient for the 
organization to make themselves GDPR compliant. Either the organizations could adopt the model, else they can use 
the model as guidance for their compliance implementation by doing a gap assessment with the existing governance 
model. Based on the findings and limitations of this study, more research into how businesses align themselves with 
data protection and their data protection agility could be conducted. It may be advantageous to assess employees' 
understanding of data security and the threat it poses to businesses in the event of data breaches or other similar 
situations.

‚Ä¢ 
Data Acquisition A company's direct communication with the data subject occurs at this step. The stage at 
which data is collected is considered to be highly essential because more attention must be paid to elements 
such as transparency; the relationship between the data subject and the data controller; and purpose limitation; 
acquiring data solely for the purpose intended. 
‚Ä¢ 
Data Preparation This phase is in charge of translating data into a format that is safe to be processed. GDPR 
focuses on personal data, and it outlines the rules that must be followed while processing personal data. 
Integrity and confidentiality, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, correctness, and 
responsibility are the identified principles that must be followed. 
‚Ä¢ 
Data Processing The prepared data is processed in this step, and the processing must comply with the 
standards of transparency, integrity, and confidentiality, as well as accountability.  
‚Ä¢ 
Data Storage After the data has been processed, it is saved for future use or references. It must comply with 
principles such as storage limitation, data minimization, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability to keep 
the processed data in a safer environment.

Data Auditing After the data processing phase is completed, auditing is required to assess and monitor 
compliance. Principles such as accountability play a significant role in data auditing.

Abstract  
 
Hand made products (handicrafts) around the world are the expression of culture and traditions of the place where 
they are made; they have the characteristic of being hand -made and manufactured in small workshops. 
Commercializing these products stimulates tourism and provides of jobs to the local families that produce them. In 
our country and the rest of the world, these activity creates jobs in SMEs and there are organizations which support 
and promote the manufacture of handicrafts, through regulations and support programs that encourage product quality 
to internationalize them. In Nuevo Le√≥n, state near to the border, there is a region that produces citric fruits and its 
geographic location is an advantage. It is proposed that quality of the product, productive capacity, logistics and the 
knowledge of the external market, influence the internationalization of the SMEs that manufacture handicrafts in that 
region.

1. Introduction  
Nuevo Le√≥n, a northern state in Mexico, has a variety of economic activities such as mining, manufacturing, services, 
etc. Most of its population is in Monterrey metropolitan area, but in the south of the state, people have economic 
activities with potential of growing. 
 
According to the information provided by INEGI, population over 15 years old that receive an income over the 
minimum salary has increased from 124,090 in 2005 to 241,788 by the end of the first trimester on 2020. 
 
It seems that at least the essential economic activities can cross the borders of other countries, first because quality of 
the products satisfies the needs of the tourists that arrive every year to the region, they take with them products for

931","Avenda√±o and Silva (2018) say that logistics is a process to export following a series of activities that go from customs 
documentation to technical and legal aspects required in the importing country, having in mind customers‚Äô demands  
(Avenda√±o C√°rdenas & Silva Guerra, 2018) 
 
Gil Gayt√°n (2017) mentions Luraschi (2005) and says that some of the aspects that Latin American countries asses 
are the fact that not all of the countries of the region have moved forward in logistics to advanced levels; organizational 
culture lacks of a complete vision of the supply chain, transportation and storage are not very effective, etc. (Gil 
Gayt√°n, 2017). According to Kirby and Brosa (2011) the efficiency in the logistics of a region or country is conditioned 
by the development of its infrastructure, laws and regulations, quality of the logistic services and their studies say that 
Latin America has better rating compared to other emerging regions. (Kirby & Brosa, 2011). Sieso (2015) suggests 
that, for having good management of the logistics, it is necessary to identify costs and if they are affected by variables 
like location, or any other.  (Sieso, 2015) 
 
For this work, it is important the study of the logistics that handicrafts have to follow, because this is precisely what 
makes trading with other countries possible. 
  
External market for Westreicher (2020) represents the economic activities of a country with the rest of the world, 
including the purchase and sale of goods and services. (Westreicher, 2020). 
Hernandez Perales and Hernandez Diaz (2013) say that Mexican companies have a strong trade exchange with the 
United States of America, but it is necessary to know the perception that manager may have about trading with Europe, 
for example. (Hern√°ndez Perales & Hern√°ndez D√≠az, 2013). Elizabeth Meza says that foreign trade between Mexico 
and Europe grew from 80,000 million dollar by the end of 2018, this shows diversification of trading in Mexico, 
instead of just being centered in the USA.  (Meza, 2020). Mariana Ramos, says that The Mexican Online Sales 
Association, 54% of the local businesses have planned to expand through export, selling online; she says that Mexican 
SMEs can also think of other destinies to exports and that the beverages, textiles and food they produce, have to 
respond to regulations of the places where products will be received. (Ramos 2020). This work looks for the factors 
that affect in the internationalization of the artisanal SMEs from the citrus region so, the knowledge of the economic 
interaction with other countries is considered important for this research.  
 
3. Methods  
In this research, bibliography about has been recollected about the variables here presented, it is a documentary 
research because it shows bibliography of the variables and it is descriptive and explanatory to describe the variables 
and the relationship that they have. 
 
Central question: Which are the factors that help boost the internationalization of the SMEs in the industry of 
handicrafts in the citrus region of the State of Nuevo Le√≥n? 
 
Hypothesis: The organizational environment that help the internationalization of the SMEs in the citrus region in 
Nuevo Leon, are manufacturing capacity, quality of products, logistics and the knowledge of the external market. 
 
5. Results and Discussion  
According with the information that is here presented, the citrus region in the State of Nuevo Leon has cultural 
background that includes the manual production of certain goods that are being sold with the help of the touristic 
features. Families in the region are being benefited by this situation and the geographical location of the region can be 
helpful for the development of opportunities to export their product to other places where they are known (because of 
the tourists).  
 
If the challenges that the internationalization brings to SMEs are solved, this small businesses may have more sales 
and they also can grow to that point that enables them to meet the demand of the customers out of the country. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Derived from the analysis of the theoretical framework, the leading factors for the internationalization of the artisanal 
SMEs in the citrus region of the State of Nuevo Le√≥n and according to the most outstanding authors in the literature 
that has been analyzed so far, the important variables are: capacity of production, quality of the product, logistics y 
knowledge of the external market.

Handicrafts industry has its relevance in the world because those pieces are produced and sold and they have 
their origins in the traditions of the people who make them.  
‚Ä¢ 
The artisanal industry generates jobs for the families that produce them.  
‚Ä¢ 
Tourism promotes the consumption of handicrafts. 
‚Ä¢ 
In Mexico, artisanal industry is growing, some countries around the world receive Mexican handicrafts. 
‚Ä¢ 
In Mexico, handicrafts that attract tourism are produced and there is regulation to support the sector in 
different ways, it helps to the process of internationalization. 
‚Ä¢ 
SMEs should pay attention to the aspects related to quality of their products, because this can make it easier 
to access to the foreign markets.  
‚Ä¢ 
Logistic processes are expensive, so SMEs have to learn about it. 
‚Ä¢ 
Nowadays, exports are centered in the United States of America, but it is recommended to look for other 
places in the world. 
 
Quality of the product, capacity of production, logistics and external market have a positive impact in the 
internationalization of artisanal SMEs from the State of Nuevo Le√≥n.  
For future research, a measuring instrument will be designed, and a pilot test with the recollection of date will be used 
to confirm the factors that affect the internationalization of the SMEs  analyzed in the literature.

Abstract 
 
To improve working conditions at the welding station in a manufacturing company, the participatory ergonomics 
methodology was used to improve the working conditions of a manufacturing company. For its application, we 
used techniques such as observation and surveys. Relevant measures at the station that did not adapt to the 
anthropometry of the worker were identified, as well as risks, such as congested working area, inadequate work 
postures, highly repetitive tasks and uncomfortable chairs. The intervention demonstrates that the problems can 
be identified and solutions can be carried out by applying this methodology, due to the worker‚Äôs involvement in 
the process and the commitment of the top management to develop them. 
 
Keywords 
Participatory ergonomics, station analysis, musculoskeletal disorders, occupational health, prevention at work 
 
1. Introduction 
Participatory ergonomics is defined according to Haines and Wilson (as cited in Pinto, 2015) as ‚ÄúA strategy that 
involves people in planning and controlling a significant amount of their own work activities, with sufficient 
knowledge and power to influence both processes and outcomes in order to achieve specific goals, related to the 
control of ergonomics issues‚Äù. 
 
Rost and Alvero (2020) explain that there are unifying elements between participatory ergonomics and 
participatory safety management. Participatory ergonomics programs are a more effective means of eliminating, 
or redesigning, manual tasks with the aim of reducing the incidence of occupational musculoskeletal disorders 
(Burgess-Limerick, R. 2017). In order for participatory ergonomics to be executed, a prevention commitment by 
the company is mandatory (Garc√≠a et al. 2012). Participatory ergonomic intervention needs management support 
for its application to be successful (Anizar, Matondang, A. R., Ismail, R. & Nazaruddin, 2020). 
 
Garc√≠a (2009) establishes that this methodology empowers workers, because they are the ones who identify risks 
and injuries due to the work they do, and support the search for solutions without the use of complex technical 
protocols. Workers are encouraged to give their opinions, develop and propose solutions to identify negative 
situations (Castro & Paz, 2013). 
 
As Visser et al. (2019) indicate participatory strategies aim to stimulate the change of behaviour of stakeholders 
to increase the use of ergonomic tools, having the face-to-face interventions the same effect as by electronic 
means. 
 
An intervention carried out in Brazil by Dos Santos and others (2013), proposed a methodology for the design of 
nuclear equipment, applying the principles of participatory ergonomics. Bernardes et al. (2012) focused on the 
prevention of lumbar diseases and justified their investigation specifically into these diseases, arguing that more 
than 50% of them related to musculoskeletal disorders during the period of 2001-2003. 
A study in a Brazilian footwear company also demonstrated that the problems and solutions can be identified 
through this methodology, involving workers to achieve positive personnel, health and production (Guimar√£es, 
2014). 
 
Another intervention in a furniture factory aimed for the redesigning of the manufacturing process, obtaining a 
reduction in the operators‚Äô workload as well as seeking an improvement in the productivity of the process 
(Guimar√£es, 2015).

940","5. Conclusions 
The pilot intervention result was satisfactory. Through it, the management team learned about participatory 
ergonomics as an appropriate strategy to integrate occupational risk prevention in the workplace, agreeing to 
develop the proposed program on a larger scale. The opinion of the supervisors and the commitment of 
management in the improvement of working conditions, ensure the maintenance of the actions undertaken. The 
changes in the design of the workstation improve the workstation conditions, in this way the operator no longer 
bends down to pick up pieces, and no longer raises his arm to leave pieces in the containers or pick up other pieces. 
 
Workstations are in order, avoiding the loss of time in the selection of parts for assembly, as well having as greater 
fluidity of materials between positions. The participation of workers in the application of this methodology favours 
its implementation and maintenance accommodation time of the products in process, therefore, the reduction of 
lost time and improvements in working conditions increase productivity. The Kaizen as a methodology of 
continuous improvement implemented in the plant facilitates the adoption of participatory ergonomics, in this 
intervention it was confirmed that senior management gives permanent support to this type of improvement. 
 
Although from a better design of the work station, it has been possible to demonstrate the improvement of 
productivity, as well as a favorable opinion of the workers, the direct benefits such as the elimination of cumulative 
traumas, should be evaluated in the medium term. It is recommended to continue with the ERGOPAR program 
for the other workstations in the plant and from the results develop a methodology applicable to processes 
involving the work of man and machine. The possibility of a study supported by software such as the Motion 
Analysis System to systematize the quantitative analysis is also open. 
 
Recognition 
The work team thanks the company FACUSA (https://www.facusa.com.pe) for being able to carry out this pilot 
study of participatory ergonomics intervention.

Introduction 
Enterprising direction is viewed as a primary interaction of associations that add to organization endurance and 
performance. Pioneering direction is the fundamental angle in maintaining a business because the time spent 
reestablishing development can influence the organization's existence. With no organization adjustment, the 
organization will be affected by external changes (outer). Wood et al.(Wood et al., 2004) clarifying the direction of 
the business is the capacity to divert imaginative development in organizations that have more worth. To acquire a 
strategic advantage and accomplish better, organizations should have more ability to perform independence, 
advancement, hazard taking, proactiveness, and serious forcefulness. One of the numerous examinations that research 
the immediate impacts of each element of driving direction is on the exhibition of SMEs. Past research has tracked 
down that the commitment of each component of pioneering direction to corporate execution fluctuates, and indeed, 
the self-rule and forcefulness of cutthroat measurements don't connect at all with the organization's exhibition.(You 
et al., 2010)-(Kamukama et al., 2011) expresses that the upper hand affects the organization's presentation.  
 
Intensity can be accomplished when the organization has an optimistic mood of the business venture due to the 
significance of the capacity to deal with an organization well. Peteraf & Barney (Peteraf et al., 2003) clarified that 
organizations that enjoy had a cutthroat benefit could make monetary worth contrasted with contenders. Enterprising 
disposition and the results of conduct to development are firmly affected by the foundation of the administration that 
worries the experience of attempting to lead. The administration's capacity will impact the organization's disposition 
to focus on the organization's situation on the lookout. The pioneer becomes receptive to the organization, market

achieve higher performance, the greater the SME has the characteristic the more significant the performance of SMEs 
obtained. 
 
The results of this study are supported by the research of Fakhrul Anwar Zainol (2011), Sirivanh et al.(Sirivanh et al., 
2014). This means the performance of Amangtiwi SMEs can increase if Amangtiwi SMEs have an entrepreneurial 
orientation. The results of this study are in line with research conducted by Hafeez et al.(2011), which examined 398 
SMEs in Malaysia were. In one of the results of his study, entrepreneurial orientation significantly influenced the 
company performance. Similarly, research conducted by Mason et al.(Mason et al., 2015), who researched 300 SMEs 
in Udine Province (Northern Italy) and Kartner region (northern Austria), explained that entrepreneurial orientation 
significantly affects the performance of companies with age and size of companies as variable controls. In Udine 
Province, it was found that innovativeness, risk, and competitive indicators positively affect its performance. Still, 
there is also a negative and significant relationship that is on the aggressiveness indicator.  In the partner area, the 
cheerful hands significantly influential are autonomy and competitive. 
 
UKM Paguyuban Amangtiwi should be able to improve its performance by exploiting market opportunities and 
neutralizing threats. According to Peteraf & Barney(Peteraf et al., 2003), SMEs must create new value and superiority 
positions to deliver products or services with unique features and lower costs than competitors. SMEs can exploit a 
combination of valuable resources that competitors don't do. Therefore, the orientation of entrepreneurship as a 
method, practice, and decision-making style of managers using entrepreneurial actions is an effort from the strategic 
level to direct the resources owned to generate competitive advantage(Simamora, 2004). 
 
The last part is the competitive advantage reflected in the company ability to continue to innovate and, through 
competitive advantage, will trigger the creation of company performance. As Maydeu‚ÄêOlivares & Lado(2003) said, it 
results in a competitive advantage in using resources and generating satisfaction in a profitable market. Sustained 
competitive advantage (SCA) is achieved because market orientation requires complex organizational knowledge that 
competitors do not easily emulate. From the analysis of the path obtained the value of R square of 0.307 or 30.7%. 
This means that the company performance is influenced by 30.7% by competitive advantage. This significant 
influence indicates that if the competitive advantage is increased, it will be followed by improved performance. 
Therefore, to further maximize the company performance. 
 
This research is in line with Li & Atuahene's opinion(Li, H., & Atuahene-Gima, 2001), which realized that 
competitive advantage has a significant influence on SME performance as measured by sales volume, profit rate, 
and return on capital. Competitive advantage can be obtained from the company ability to manage and utilize 
its resources and money. These resources include SME-generated products and services. Chapman et al.(Chapman et 
al., 2002) also explained that competitive advantage is essential in making good performance. Amangtiwi SME 
Association agrees that SMEs should always be able to excel compared to other companies. It is necessary to look at 
unique product and service factors that are different from others, competitive prices, products that are rarely found 
and not easy to replicate or replace. These advantages include uniqueness that is different from other companies, 
competitive prices, products that are seldom seen and not easily imitated. These factors make SMEs can improve their 
performance. SMEs also need to develop expertise in creating products and acceleration as an essential indicator in 
triggering the creation of competitive advantages to strengthen the company performance. 
 
4. 
Conclusion 
This study shows that SMEs in Indonesia should improve their entrepreneurial orientation in developing their 
businesses. This is because it is known that entrepreneurial orientation has a significant relationship to competitive 
advantage and company performance. The results of this study are also expected to be the basis for future research 
that better discusses other variables that have not been discussed much, such as social capital, entrepreneurial 
education, culture, and consumer behavior in Indonesia as a developing country with a large population. In addition, 
this research has limitations in that research is only conducted in the SME sector of handicrafts, food beverages, and 
fashion. Further research can be expected to research other sectors such as large manufacturing companies or service 
and technology companies.

Abstract 
 
Within the transition towards the use of electricity as a power source in the automotive industry, this investigation 
aims to evaluate the acceleration capacity of a go-kart type vehicle equipped with an electric motor. Two types of 
battery were employed, Lithium-Ion and Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, each one combined with two different gear 
ratios. Two methodologies were used to obtain the acceleration capacity, a mathematical model using Simulink and 
track tests.   The best acceleration capacity was obtained with Lithium-Ion batteries and a gear ratio of 2:1. The 
difference between the model and on-track tests were 16.68%. The difference is higher with a 1:1 gear ratio.  was 
attributed to the initial energy requirement of the batteries when starting the vehicle to overcome inertia. 
 
Keywords: Vehicle dynamics, Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries, Lithium-Ion batteries, Go-kart, Acceleration capacity. 
 
1. Introduction 
The motivation for this article comes from the worldwide impulse for the development of electric vehicles. This study 
compares the go-kart acceleration capacity when its energy source is Nickel-Metal Hydride batteries and Lithium-Ion 
batteries, each combined with two fixed gear ratios. The importance of this research resides in quantifying the 
improvement that represents the application of one or the other battery technology, which is an important parameter 
to consider for future improvements of the vehicle in reference. 
 
1.1. Objectives  
- 
To evaluate the acceleration capacity of an electric go-kart with Nickel-Metal Hydride and Lithium-Ion batteries 
in an electric go-kart utilizing acceleration capacity tests. 
- 
To determine acceleration capability of the go-kart by applying the SAE J1491 test protocol with a 1:1 and 2:1 
gear ratio.        
- 
To evaluate the results of the track tests concerning the vehicle dynamics model. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The use of non-conventional energy sources for transportation is a topic of global interest. Although since the 
beginning of the automobile era, in the dispute between vehicles with combustion engines and electric vehicles, the

957","6. Conclusion  
The results of acceleration capacity tests obtained on track compared with those obtained from the vehicle dynamics 
model show that the model predicts the speed reached with a percentage variation of up to 16.68%. Therefore, 
corroborating that the most effective of the combinations is the one that uses Lithium-Ion batteries and a transmission 
ratio of 2:1. 
 
According to the bibliography consulted, the total transmission efficiency was 90%, assuming that this efficiency 
represents possible faults in the optimal alignment and assembly of the drive shaft sprocket concerning the driven 
shaft sprocket and generating undesired resistive stresses in the transmission chain.  
 
The results obtained in the tests and the simulation are higher in the 1:1 transmission ratio concerning the 2:1 
transmission ratio because it is attributed to the initial energy required to move the vehicle and overcome the inertia.

Abstract 
 
The advancement of digital technology in the industry is making it possible for products and processes to connect 
people, materials, energy, plant, and equipment efficiently. More productive business processes will have an impact 
throughout the economy and the environment. Connected products generate data that is being seen as a key source of 
competitive advantage, and the management and processing of that data is generating new challenges in the industrial 
environment. The work to be presented looks into the framework of the adoption of Artificial Intelligence and Machine 
Learning in the Industrial sector under industry 4.0 or smart manufacturing framework. This work is focused on the 
discussion around Artificial Intelligence as a driver for Industrial Process optimization and looks into its link with 
process operators and people in the shop floor, and IIoT. The paper includes a bibliometric analysis of the key topics 
around Artificial Intelligence under Industry 4.0 or Smart Manufacturing paradigm. The main findings are related to 
the importance that the subject has adquired since 2017 in terms of published articles, and the complexity of the 
approach of the issue proposed by this work at the industrial environment. 
 
Keywords  
Industry digitalization, Industry 4.0, IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things), AI/ML, Data driven culture. 
 
1. Introduction 
The fourth industrial revolution, commonly termed as industry 4.0, is not just about industry. It is about overall 
transformation of the industrial environment using digital integration and intelligent engineering. It is quoted as the 
next level of manufacturing where machines will redefine themselves in how they communicate and perform 
individual functions (Muhuri et al. 2019). 
 
Another point of view about Industry 4.0 is given by Ibarra et al. (2017), according to this work the new model has 
been brought into the manufacturing world by the increasing fusion of Industrial Production and Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICT). This phenomenon is making possible to connect information, objects and people 
due to the convergence of the physical and the virtual worlds in the form of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, 
it is enabling the transformation of factories into smart environments. 
 
Ruiz-Sarmiento et al. (2020) observe that a key principle of the Industry 4.0 paradigm is that processes and machinery 
must be networked as a collaborating community for the collection, exchange and analysis of data in order to predict 
future behaviors and pursue optimal solutions to possible problems. In the paper the authors consider that nowadays, 
this principle is beginning to be achievable thanks to the development of a number of promising technologies. One of 
these technologies is the so-called CPS. These systems are enhanced with features from the Internet of Things (IoT) 
technology, providing them with the ability to continuously obtain information from sensors or processes across the 
factory, and securely forward it to (generally cloud-based) data centers. This massive data production implies the 
development of new tools based on Big Data techniques, for storing, managing, and processing it. This set of 
technologies is completed with the Internet of Services (IoS), which takes the processed information from Big Data 
tools and deploys it at the right place and in the right form.

7. Potential Research Lines 
This work has been a good exercise to analyze the complexity that means involving IA/ML in industrial processes to 
optimize them. Some of the issues to continue looking into AI/ML in industrial processes are at first sight concepts 
like cybersecurity, complexity of deployment, and impact. 
 
One of the next step in this line of research is to advance in the way data through analytics will be merged in the 
traditional practices of the industrial Organization.  
 
Another item to continue exploring is the impact of AI/ML solutions on process operators or industrial engineers. 
The bibliometric analysis of this work has not given much clues about this issue, then it should be treated in future 
research. 
 
Finally, to continue with this work can be studied deeper the implications to the whole organization and 
management changes or alterations that produce the adoption of AI/ML under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. 
 
8. Conclusion  
The first thing to mention as a conclusion is the vast amount of information and the potential the subject has in the 
future. It can see that the concept has a long road to walk to mature and adapt to capture the attention of the industrial 
world massively. It can be observed that more than 50% of the papers that were highlighted in the last section, 8 out 
of 15, were published in 2020. 
 
On the other hand, it can be seen that the concept at the moment is well known and mastered by Researchers, 
Mathematicians, and engineers in software and operating research field, among others. A big doubt seems to appear 
regarding the knowledge of the concept and value that AI/ML can add in the shopfloor for the process operator. In 
this line, the work from Davenport (2020) gives some light about the knowledge of the subject by Managers.

977","Another finding from this work, is that both terms approached by this work regarding IA/ML and industrial processes 
optimization are not the most considered in the bibliometric analysis at SCOPUS Database, as it can be seen in the 
word cloud at figure 3.  
       
The complexity and the diversity of issues that involves IA/ML under Industry 4.0 model as a Process optimization 
driver. This observation comes after analyzing the five clusters of key words showed in figure 3. I can be seen that 
involves the integration between soft and technical skills to transform the traditional plant into a smart manufacturing 
site.

Abstract 
 
The effects of anhydrous ethanol (E) and castor oil (R) mixed with diesel fuel (D), commercially containing 5% 
biodiesel by volume, were researched experimentally to evaluate the combustion process and specific fuel 
consumption in a compression ignition engine, supercharged, six cylinders. In total, three mixtures were used, varying 
the diesel content from 95% (D95) to 80% v/v (D85), obtaining the following compositions: D95B0E0, D85B6E9 and 
D80B6.5E13.5. The experimental tests were performed in stationary conditions (1000 and 1800 rpm), two values of 
effective torque (80, and 160N.m) and two conditions of intake air pressure (100 and 80 kPa). The results obtained 
show that the mixtures containing ethanol and biodiesel lead to an early start of combustion at 1000 rpm and a delay 
at the start of combustion at 1800 rpm. The increase in ethanol and biodiesel over commercial fuel does not have any 
influence on specific fuel consumption; however, the altitude effect generates an increase in specific fuel consumption 
up to 11% and 7% at 1000 rpm and 1800 rpm respectively. The specific emissions of NOX, CO and CO2are increased 
with higher specific fuel consumption; in addition, the effect of simulated altitude allowed to verify that at higher 
altitudes there is a slight increase in sfc and EE of CO and CO2, together with a reduction in EE NOX. At 2000 m of 
simulated altitude (APCI = 80 kPa) the maximum increases of sfc, CO and CO2, with the mixture D80B6.5E13.5, 
were 5%, 122% and 18%, respectively. And the maximum reductions in NOX EE were also obtained with the 
D80B6.5E13.5 mixture, reaching decreases of up to 6%.

1. Introduction  
Alternative internal combustion engines have developed a very important role in the industrial development of society. 
Compression ignition engines (MEC) have better thermal efficiency compared to positive ignition engines (MECH); 
However, due to the higher compression ratio of MECs and the use of poor air-fuel mixtures, these are the cause of 
high emissions of nitrogen oxides, NOX and particulate matter, PM (Heywood, 2018). And as the altitude where these 
engines operate increases, there is a drop in thermal performance and they use emissions of carbon monoxide, CO, 
hydrocarbons, HC and PM (He et al., 2011). 
 
Regarding diesel fuel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) affirms that the world demand 
will grow faster than any other distilled product, towards the year 2030 (OPEC, 2019). Likewise, it is indicated that 
biofuels will have a greater demand as they form a volumetric part instead of diesel; A common blend of diesel with 
biodiesel and gasoline with ethanol is B20 and E10, 20% biodiesel replacing diesel and 10% ethanol replacing 
gasoline, respectively, in the US (Eia, 2018). 
 
In Peru, as in other Latin American countries, the fuel with the highest demand is diesel, representing, on average, 
53% of the fuel market since 2013, due to its great use in transportation, residential and other sectors. commerce, 
industries, mining, public, agriculture and fishing (GPAE, 2017). And due to the low quality of fuels, in Peru, since 
2018, the Euro IV, Tier 2 and EPA 2007 vehicle emission standards have been in force (MINAM, 2018). 
Furthermore, by national law, commercialized diesel and gasoline must not contain sulfur in a concentration higher 
than 50 ppm. In addition, diesel contains 5% biodiesel and gasoline 7.8%, by volume. But there is no projection of an

However, at 1800 rpm, this exchange does not stand out. Likewise, NOX emissions vary with the type of engine and 
working conditions (He et al., 2011).

5.4 Validation  
The global uncertainty of each parameter analyzed is associated with the quality of the measured data and the 
calibrated instruments used in this study. This uncertainty is quantitatively characterized by the standard deviation of 
the values obtained according to GUM (BIPM, 2008). The experimental works always present errors, which cause 
that there is a certain veracity in the values measured experimentally. 
 
According to the GUM, the uncertainty of the result can be decomposed into several parameters that are composed of 
a certain degree of error. The uncertainty analysis is based on its main error propagation equation (see equation 6); 
where the global uncertainty ‚àÜU, corresponding to the global parameter F(x), is estimated by the parameters 
ùê±ùê±ùüèùüè, ùê±ùê±ùüêùüê, . . , ùê±ùê±ùêßùêß, which have their own uncertainties‚àÜùêîùêî ùê±ùê±ùüèùüè, ‚àÜùêîùêî ùê±ùê±ùüêùüê, . . , ‚àÜùêîùêî ùê±ùê±ùêßùêß. These considerations were taken for the 
analysis of the parameters that link to the data collected by the sensors of the test bench. Likewise, when necessary, 
the statistical criterion for data discernment proposed by Chauvenet (Milosa, 2017) was used.

6. Conclusion  
Specific fuel consumption, net rate of heat released, and exhaust gas emissions were analyzed in a 6-liter compression-
ignition engine, operating at different simulated altitude conditions and using different blends of diesel, biodiesel, and 
ethanol. The commercial fuel is D95B5E0 and the alternative blends (D85B6E9 and D80B6.5E13.5) included 
volumetric percentages of up to 13.5% ethanol and, to a lesser extent, biodiesel. 
 
The specific fuel consumption of the engine is not affected by the use of ethanol and biodiesel, despite the lower 
calorific value of the alternative blends. The results of the net rate of heat released show that the mixtures D85B6E9 
and D80B6.5E13.5 slightly advance the start of combustion by 1000 rpm, with less intensity of the pre-mixed 
combustion phase. The opposite effect could be noticed at 1800 rpm, where a small delay in the start of combustion 
may occur due to the lower cetane number of the alternative mixtures; in addition, there is a greater intensity of the 
pre-mixed combustion. 
 
The specific emissions of NOX, CO and CO2 increase with the higher sfc. The CO2 EE decrease with the increase of 
ethanol and biodiesel in the fuel, because the OH radical of the oxygenated component would lead to a higher 
production of H2O. At 1000 rpm, CO emissions are related to observed trends in CO2; however, at 1800 rpm, CO EEs 
are increased with increased use of ethanol and biodiesel. These results are associated with the temperature levels

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for measuring the performance of logistics service providers 
(LSPs). The logistics literature was explored, and a set of articles and key performance indicators (KPIs) were 
derived. A network analysis of the identified articles was undertaken and revealed five performance themes. A 
conceptual framework was developed based on the systems model and was classified as input and output 
performance dimensions. The proposed conceptual framework was further validated with empirical data. The 
obtained data was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. Results showed that the input performance 
dimension had a strong and positive impact on the output performance dimension. The results indicated that LSPs 
were concerned on their service quality in terms of delivery in-full and on-time, and their cash conversion cycle. 
The framework contributes to the LSP‚Äôs performance measurement literature by proposing and empirically 
validating a performance measurement framework that is considered to be more comprehensive and suitable for 
the use in the LSP context. Given this framework, LSPs should be able to not only evaluate and monitor their day-
to-day operations but also develop strategic policy and action plans that may be used to improve and enhance their 
competitiveness in a competitive environment.

1. Introduction 
The service sector plays an important role in the economies of countries around the world, including the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). According to the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) 
Blueprint, the member countries under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services (AFAS) must have clear 
implementation plan, method and time frame (ASEAN 2015) for facilitating a trade negotiation on services. The 
main goal is to reduce and abolish the rules or regulations that impede service activities in 12 service sectors as 
classified by the WTO. Meanwhile, transportation and logistics service businesses are service sectors that needs 
to be liberalized under the AFAS, as it will allow ASEAN nationals to have up to 70 percent of shares in 
transportation and logistics services since 2013 (Banomyong et al. 2008). However, most of transportation and 
logistics service businesses are small to medium size firms with limited knowledge and competitiveness in terms 
of management, administration, marketing, technology, and skilled workers. This will make them to be less 
competitive within the globalization and competitive environment. 
 
Hence, it is observed that there is a need to measure and explore the performance of LSPs because it relates to 
their competitiveness. In order to enhance LSPs‚Äô competitiveness, the baseline of LSP‚Äôs performance must be

Abstract 
As the first step toward implementing strategies to improve mobility in urban centers, governmental authorities must 
assess their present situation in order to identify the most effective actions that should be included in their short and 
long-term plans. However, there is not a well-established methodology to carry out such an assessment. The already 
existing ones are subjective, incomplete, costly, and hard to implement, especially for the case of Latin American 
countries. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology to carry out this assessment. It uses recent advances in 
information technologies and includes the use of web map services, telematics data, and low-cost vehicle emission 
tests. The main purpose of the proposed methodology is to facilitate the identification of adequate strategies to 
improve sustainable urban mobility in a city of interest. This methodology is based on Fraunhofer-Morgenstadt City 
Lab methodology and results on urban mobility obtained by the City Lab team composed by the University of 
Stuttgart IAT, Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Engineering IAO, Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey, and the Municipal 
Planning Institute IMPLAN Saltillo in the city of Saltillo, Mexico. The methodology was designed to allow the 
participation of third parties that could not be well informed on the local particularities of the city. Therefore, this 
methodology includes the documentation of the current situation of the city on the many aspects connected to the 
mobility of the city. Thus, the proposed methodology is divided into three phases: i) Describing the region of study, 
ii) obtaining local data to evaluate a proposed set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and iii) performing a 
mobility assessment based on a benchmarking evaluation of the KPIs with comparable and/or reference cities. As an 
example of application, a mobility assessment was carried out for Saltillo, a medium-sized city in northeastern 
Mexico, which is considered a typical city in Latin American countries. Results indicate that this methodology can 
be replicated at a low incremental cost and that it leads towards the identification of the most sustainable (economic, 
environmental, and social) actions that should be implemented in these cities considering their local circumstances.

Abstract 
 
More than a year after the changes established in higher education in Mexico in terms of the way of teaching and 
learning, which arise from the spread of the COVID-19 virus throughout the world, it is necessary to evaluate students 
and teachers on their adaptation to change, to monitor their ability to adapt to the challenges presented by the non-
school modality. In this case, for the practical subjects of the Design and Manufacturing branch of the specialty area 
of the Industrial Engineering Administrator educational program, since some of these require a physical space and 
student-facilitator interaction, for example, man-machine and man-tool. A measurement instrument was designed 
which allowed us to know the level of adaptability of students and teachers in the practical learning units, results were 
obtained indicating the main challenges of both interest groups, analyzing the results, proposing recommendations 
and suggestions to improve the teaching, and learning process. The results are presented while the return to face-to-
face classes is normalized. Considering that people's health and well-being is the most important thing, the use of 
interactive software was proposed for these practical subjects, it could be the use of immersive videos, video games 
and / or augmented reality programs.

1. Introduction 
Traditionally, classes at the undergraduate level have been held in person; In the last decade, the curriculum of 
studying the degrees in a non-face-to-face way began to be developed, making use of the online platforms that are at 
hands reach, although more than 70% of the universities worldwide did not have that plan in development. Currently, 
changes in the ways of learning have been accelerated using online platforms to develop classes, all due to the health 
contingency of COVID-19 in the world. 
 
As a result of COVID-19, universities have tried to adapt in the most effective way possible so that students fully 
benefit from online classes, avoiding risking their lives and that of their families, because, due to Mexico‚Äôs healthcare 
system, face-to-face classes were prohibited because they did not want an agglomeration to exist, and the universities 
were not a source of infection. More than a year after the start of social distancing restrictions in Mexico, the need 
arises to evaluate the adaptability of educational institutions and their performance to establish optimal online classes 
so that they are beneficial for students and are carried out as expected with the educational program of each of the 
subjects. Above all, when it comes to practical subjects, particularly the Design and Manufacturing branch of the 
specialty area of the Industrial Engineering Administrator educational program, as there are many in the Engineering 
branch and which are affected by the impediment to being in face-to-face in laboratories, factories, business visits, 
etc.

6. Conclusion  
After analyzing the results, we conclude that the online mode for hands-on learning units is complicated but not 
impossible. Various suggestions and proposals for improvement aimed at facilitating adaptation in the teaching-
learning process of university teachers and students for better academic development are also considered, always 
ensuring the health and well-being of all during this pandemic. 
 
For example, in some practical matters a type of software, a program augmented reality, video games, among others, 
in order to meet the challenge of not performing physical practices that incurs the art could be used, whether the 
Immersive case Videos as in the case of matter Machines and Tools, where you work with lathe spindle, saw, etc., 
and fundamental part is the use of the 5 senses to better understand the use of these objects. 
 
It will always be a challenge to face what is not contemplated, in this case it was the COVID-19 pandemic. The fact 
that students and teachers prefer face-to-face classes and that both have gone through a process to adapt to this 
unexpected change could be considered as the common denominator between both groups. But also, the fact that they 
all demonstrate the ability to innovate themselves by not allowing themselves to be defeated by the adversities that 
occur in the non-presential modality, in this case, in the branch of Engineering. Despite the little or low interaction, it 
has been possible to specify the teaching of these practical subjects without the need to risk health, the entire class 
being online. 
 
Finally, readers are encouraged to continue acquiring knowledge of emerging technologies and to develop 
interpersonal skills, which have been rare and necessary throughout this pandemic. Without the certainty, it is 
visualized that the non-face-to-face modality will be implemented in the future of higher education. With all this, we 
are confident that humans will continue to adapt to the coming changes that occur in a new educational normally.

Abstract  
 
In today's digital age, education is in the age of knowledge (knowledge age) with the acceleration of extraordinary 
knowledge improvement. The acceleration of knowledge improvement is supported by the application of digital media 
and technology called information super highway. Education is becoming increasingly important to ensure students 
have learning skills, innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship as well as technology and information media skills and 
can work, and survive by using life skills. 21st century skills are (1) life and career skills, (2) learning and innovation 
skills, and (3) Information media and technology skills. The three skills are summarized in a scheme called rainbow 
21st century knowledge-skills rainbow. The scheme was adapted by the nonprofit P21 which developed the 21st 
century education framework worldwide through a www.p21.org site based in the Us state of Tuscon. The 
improvement of teacher professionalism starts from individuals studying teacher education or equivalent to 
undergraduate education. At this stage, they are equipped with knowledge and skills in the field of scientific substance 
and pedagogical substance. The implementation of teacher education must have a large portion in terms of pedagogical 
practice, which involves the ability to master material, chase, and technology. Higher education must now be able to 
facilitate all of these things and have an obligation to organize education in the direction needed. Innovations in the 
implementation of education have been widely done, from self-competency oriented to the development of learning 
infrastructure. The digital age has become a necessity of the community so that higher education must be able to adjust 
the learning process needed today. The general goal is to build motivation, engagement, and achievement in learners. 
If this can be realized, then the internal motivation of the individual to become a professional graduate is no longer 
limited to wishful thinking

Abstract  
 
This thesis is a development research of Indonesian language education. This development research was carried out 
because of school problems, namely the learning media applied were not interesting and boring for students, as a 
result, students concern to focus on other things, such as chatting with friends or even being sleepy in the classroom 
and the applied learning media were not integrated to Islamic values. This research is aim to produce interactive 
multimedia products based on android integration of Poetry Text material with Islamic values that are efficient, 
effective, and attractive to be used by teachers and students of class X MIPA Matholi'ul Anwar Simo.  This research 
and development are carried out by adapting and modifying the ADDIE development model through five stages, 
namely analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The results of this study are: (1) Android-
based interactive multimedia products intregation of Poetry Text material with Islamic values get the percentage of 
efficiency values from media experts at 97.7% and material experts at 96.8% with excellent categories. If both values 
are averaged, the result is 97.25% with an excellent category. (2) an interactive multimedia product based on android 
integration of Poetry Text material with Islamic values gained an effectiveness value of 93.7% with an excellent 
category. (3) an interactive multimedia product based on android integration of Poetry Text material with Islamic

I. Introduction 
One of the most important milestones determining the future of the nation is education. Education plays a vital role in 
building a nation's civilization. If the education system in a nation is weak, it will also be weak human resources. 
Moreover, in this sophisticated modern era, innovations in education need to be done by each teacher in order for 
education in Indonesia to be more colorful. According to The Great Dictionary of Bahasa Indonesia (KBBI edition 
V)(Kebudayaan, 2016), education is the process of changing the attitudes and behaviors of a person or group of people

Abstract  
 
This study aims to demonstrate the early stages of learning research for students aged 13-15 years. This study used a 
qualitative approach, while the data collection was through in-depth interviews, direct observation, and documentation 
of 240 students and 30 teachers who were randomly selected. The data analysis process was carried out using data 
reduction techniques and data presentation. Data validity involves credibility, transferability, dependability, and 
confirmation degree. The data collection process included participant observation (for three months, 3-4 days a week, 
and 3-6 hours per day). The results showed that (1) the discovery of the research learning environment of researchers 
aged 13-15 years started from peer motivation and reinforcement of material from teachers about scientific thinking, 
scientific behaviour, and research ethics; (2) the process of achieving ideas involves treatment to help students to be 
more sensitive to their environment as inspiration for their ideas and finding relevant reference sources of information; 
(3) young researchers are able to formulate research designs by making research schedules and logbooks as a reference 
for writing down all their research notes; (4) teaching research in secondary schools requires teacher guidance to help 
students achieve basic research competencies

Abstract  
 
At the beginning of the reformation, the political upheaval led to the formation of parties that were no longer 
monopolized by the political elites during the New Order era. Political culture development at the regional level is 
more dominated by political thoughts and behavior based on a mature political culture. The strengthening of the local 
political culture's penetration is increasingly unstoppable after the enactment of the era of decentralization or regional 
autonomy. The Mataraman community has a special characteristic in their political choices. The way the people are 
elected depends on their historical past patterns. This research is a descriptive qualitative case study, using the 
interview method and document analysis as a reference source. The subject of the study of political sociology includes 
the relationship between political issues and society, between social structures and political structures, and between 
social behavior and political behavior. The research results are that the people of Mataraman Kediri have a political 
synergy style known as the pyramid of political power, where the religious elite, entrepreneurs, and the government 
have the political synergy that can form a political map in the Mataraman Kediri area. This is because these three 
elements in the history of Mataraman are a manifestation of Javanese culture, where society is divided into three 
characteristics: santri with their religious-political paradigm, abangan, and priyai. They support political patterns that 
tend to be political elites and businessmen, so that the characteristic of Mataraman Kediri is pyramid politics.

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this research is to find out whether there is an influence of the Learning Model of The ‚ÄúRuang Guru‚Äù 
platform on student learning outcomes in Indonesian subjects. For the subjects in this study were students of grade XI 
IPA and XI Bahasa MA Raudlatul Mutaallimin Babat. While in the observation of the activity consists of 14 students 
of grade XI IPA and 14 students of grade XI Language. The result showed that There is no significant difference 
between students taught using the ‚ÄúRuang Guru‚Äù platform learning model and students taught using conventional 
learning models. However, when viewed from the results of the pretest and posttest values of the experimental class 
experienced a more significant increase compared to the control class. This proves that the learning model of the 
teacher space platform can influence the improvement of the learning outcomes of MA Raudlatul Mutaallimin Babat 
students. Based on the results of the calculation of average values there was a significant increase between the average 
pretest values of the experimental class which was initially lower than the control class. So it can be concluded that 
the learning model of the ‚ÄúRuang Guru‚Äù platform is better than conventional learning methods to improve the learning 
outcomes of MA Raudlatul mutaallimin Babat students

Abstract 
The transportation sector is one of the sectors with the highest energy consumption in Mexico, which produces 
large concentrations of pollutants that affect human health. The mobility laws of the state of Nuevo Le√≥n seek to 
increase the use of non-motorized means of transport, including bicycles. Therefore, one of the approaches to 
encourage the use of bicycles is the design and implementation of cycling infrastructure, i.e, bike paths. Hence, 
the objective of this project is to design a methodology for the layout of bicycle lanes in a university district, 
Distrito Tec, to satisfy travel needs with maximum energy as well as environmental benefits, this through a 
vehicular traffic model implemented in a simulator called Eclipse SUMO (Simulator of Urban MObility) on a 
microscopic scale calibrated from real-world measurements of vehicle flow, origin and destination surveys and 
transport characterization. The partial results show that in the current scenario there are 1% trips made by bicycle, 
7% in public transport ,71% in private vehicle and 21% walking. While the proposed bike path design scenarios 
increase the bicycle trips between 4% and 10%, reducing trips in private vehicles with a tentative reduction of 
CO2 emissions, allowing this way to select the optimum bike paths in Distrito Tec. These results could be 
considered for the establishment of public policy as well as intervention of infrastructure through civil works.

Abstract  
 
Comprehending text is the final goal of reading. To comprehend the text, learners can use many strategies based on 
the purposes of the learning process. This article examines Islamic elementary reading comprehension through 
SQ3R strategy, how this strategy can increase learners‚Äô reading skills. The method used is qualitative action research 
to know the process and solving the students‚Äô problems while learning the process of reading. The researcher uses 
both qualitative and quantitative data through direct observation in the natural environment. The result shows that 
the SQ3R strategy can increase learners‚Äô reading comprehension problems. It can be seen that learners can analyze 
the visual information, predict the content and improve their note-taking.

1. Introduction  
Comprehension is the final goal of reading because it is defined as learners‚Äô thinking. Everyone agrees that reading 
comprehension is not an easy matter of recognizing individual words, or perhaps of understanding every individual 
word as our eyes skip it (Nation, 2005). Because, all models of comprehension acknowledge the requirement for 
readers to make up a mental object of text, a method that needs integration across a variety of sources of data, from 
lexical options through to data regarding events within the world (Sabatini et al., 2019). Therefore, to understand 
text reading needs the language skills to create text conclusions. 
 
The nature and origins of reading comprehension difficulties, however, are not explicit. This article aims to know 
the SQ3R strategy can increase students reading comprehension difficulties in young learners. Reading 
comprehension is also the ability to recognize and understand the contents of something written. In essence, reading 
is the process of communication between the reader and the writer through the text he wrote. Reading is an associate

6. Conclusion  
Students‚Äô attitudes towards this intervention were positive and it can claim that SQ3R can use for improving the 
cognitive and affective skills of elementary school students who have trouble reading and comprehension. However, 
it ought to be taken into the thought that learners might experience some difficulties at some stages of this strategy. 
In this study, as an example, learners had some difficulties in the ‚ÄòRecite‚Äô stage. During this stage, learners had some 
issues once they tried to grant oral and written reports regarding what they had understood from the text. Educators 
and researchers planning to use this strategy ought to pay more attention to the current stage. Especially, educators 
must spend more time on various activities/exercises on developing and improving students‚Äô oral skills from the 
early school of elementary

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this development is to produce a package of learning information and communication technology 
subjects consisting of 1) teaching materials, 2) teacher's guide, and 3) student guides. The development model used 
is the Dick, Carey, & Carey model, which is modified based on development requirements. This model leads to 
efforts to solve learning problems and be programmed through systematic procedures or steps. The results showed 
that this learning package was able to improve student learning outcomes compared to previous conditions. It can be 
seen from the results of testing the effectiveness of learning using the t-test of the results of the pre-test and post-test 
given to students showing the value of tcount = 64,510 > t-table = 2,064 so that it can be said that this information 
and communication technology learning package is valid.

1.Introduction 
Learning is an effort to learn students(Meilantifa et al., 2019). Learning activities are an effort to develop student 
potential through a series of activities carried out continuously and continuously to achieve goals(Ardiyani et al., 
2018; Chi, 2009; Nguyen, 2017). Many factors can affect learning achievement, including the appearance of 
teaching materials(Hartini et al., 2018; Syafruddin et al., 2020; de Sena et al., 2020; Oliveira et al., 2019). The 
appearance of an exciting book or module can generate interest in learning(Prawiradilaga, 2015). Furthermore, 
Prawadilaga stated that teaching material in learning design is the only tangible form of an essential component of 
learning design(Muhid et al., 2020). To provide adequate teaching materials as an effort to optimize the learning 
process of ICT subjects, one way that can be taken is to improve the learning design by preparing ICT learning 
packages that are attractive, effective, and efficient(Divayana et al., 2021; Mantoro et al., 2017; Mooij, 2007; Mooij, 
2004; Rahmi et al., 2020; Putra et al., 2020). The selection of the Dick, Carey, and Carey (Dick et al., 2015) models 
in the preparation of ICT teaching materials for class VIII semester II has based on the thought that this model is

with an assumption: H0 : the difference between pre-test and post-test is zero (no difference) 
 Ha : the difference between pre-test and post-test is not equal to zero (there is a difference) 
Based on the data in the table above (Table 27-31) it is known that the value of tcount = 64,510 > ttable = 2,064  so that H0 is 
rejected and Ha is accepted. This shows that there are real differences between the results of the pre-test and post-
test so that it can be said that the learning package for information and communication technology in class VIII at 
MTs Puspa Bangsa Banyuwangi in 2011 is valid. 
 
9. Conclusion 
The development of this information and communication technology learning package uses the Dick, Carey, and 
Carey models in 2001, whose development process only reached the ninth stage. The results of the data analysis 
concluded that with a significance level of 0.05 in the pre-test and post-test analysis above the value of tcount = 
64,510 > ttable = 2.064 so that it can be said that the information and communication technology learning package 
class VIII at MTs Puspa Bangsa Banyuwangi in 2011 was effective.

Abstract 
 
Purpose Students‚Äô passive activities, such as reading and watching activity make learning process can't 
run well. Only active communication with their colleagues, facilitators, and other learning resources make 
process run well. In this case, we use gamification to improve student's learning motivation. This study 
used four scales to obtain consistent and measurable data. Scale 1 and 2 were to analyze the level of 
knowledge about gamification framework, Scale 3 for concept and effectiveness and Scale 4 for fun 
learning. In conclusion,  entrepreneurship courses through gamification run effectively because students 
are interested in gamification because it is new for them and able to establish good communication 
patterns as well as makes students more literate on technology. 
 
Keywords 
Gamification, blended learning, entrepreneurship course, achievement motivation, student learning. 
 
I. Introduction 
Education is a human need that must always develop according to the changing of the age. The growing 
development in the world of education and technology is very reference to the quality of education in Indonesia.  
This development took place quickly and continuously so that the Ministry of National Education (Kemdiknas) 
emphasized on the provider of the Prime service of national education to form Indonesia's intelligent comprehensive 
human beings.  Each innovation was created to provide positive benefits for human life (Nurdyansyah, 2017, 
Sinambela 2016, Sutirman 2015 and Wangi Wangi et al. 2018). Successful education will create appropriate and

Based on the results of data analysis and discussion, it can be concluded that several things as follows: 1) the 
learning process of entrepreneurship course through concept of gamification run effectively in which only 2 of 65 
students who did not get B; 2) students in learning process thought gamification concept are mostly interested 
because it is new for them; 3) as long as the concept of gamification is implemented in the classroom, the 
communication patterns among students can become more real again. the students are more literate towards the 
technology and the students' perception on the pedagogic ability and the lecturer's performance also increases; 4) 
there are some obstacles such as limitations in the internet connection owned by each student are different. 
furthermore, students' location also affect the internet network

Abstract 
 
Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a Business Model nowadays it is considered important to be mastered by students 
in entrepreneurship courses as a starting point to plunge into the world of entrepreneurship because in BMC a 
framework is explained in a simple way to present the elements contained in a business model. Although considered 
important, it is very difficult to find an assessment instrument for this aspect. Even if there is, it is not a valid and 
reliable instrument. This article discusses the design of assessment instruments for BMCs at the College Level. 
There are 9 aspects of assessment used by the author according to Alexander Osterwalder in his book entitled 
Business Model Generation which consists of 9 blocks of activity areas to map strategies to build strong businesses, 
consisting of Customers Segment, Value proposition, Customer Relationship, Channel, Revenue Stream, Key 
Resource, Key Activities, Key Partnership, and Cost Structure. To produce a quality assessment instrument, the 
authors tested the validity and reliability of the instrument. The current study authors involve expert 
entrepreneurship to examine the structure and substance of the assessment, also, the authors tested the instrument as 
a statistical test. This instrument is used to assess students' understanding of concepts in BMC. Based on the validity 
of experts Entrepreneurship and statistical analysis shows that aspects of assessment are appropriate to be used to 
test the ability to understand BMC concepts.

Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a Business Model that is currently considered important for students to master in 
entrepreneurship courses. BMC was first introduced by Alexander Osterwalder in his book entitled Bussiness Model 
Generation. BMC is a new method in formulating business concepts that are simpler than making ordinary business 
plans (Osterwalder et al., 2010).

Abstract 
 
Nowadays, organizations face an industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0. Since it is a fairly recent 
phenomenon, many companies wonder how to embark on these digital transformation initiatives and do it 
successfully. Information Systems (IS), already present in the vast majority of companies, are shown to be one of the 
most important pillars within the digital transformation. This work aims to explore the Critical Success Factors that 
may contribute to a successful implementation of IS within a digital transformation initiative, based on a practical 
case carried out in an automotive industry company, where a digital transformation initiative was followed. The 
results point to the existence of some key factors for the success of IS implementation within this type of initiatives, 
such as: the existence of reliable connectivity between devices, the involvement of users in each phase of the 
systems‚Äô development, the analysis of the existing processes, a good relationship with business partners that provide 
technological solutions and support them, and, also, the definition of strategic plans and roadmaps.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, our world faces a shift in the industrial context, to an era known as ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0‚Äù. This transition comes 
with its challenges and, as it can cause a major transformation in organizations, there are some points to be taken 
into consideration upon company changes. Organizations need to continuously evolve and innovate in order to keep 
a competitive advantage, retain customers and increase their profitability (Kir & Erdogan, 2021; Marques et al., 
2020). Like so, in the current manufacturing setting, marked by digitalization (Doyle-Kent & Kopacek, 2020), it is 
crucial to take advantage of new technologies along with existing and well-known organizational practices. One of 
those relevant business components are Information Systems (IS), essential in enterprises wanting to go digital 
(Salvadorinho & Teixeira, 2020). Companies capabilities are becoming  more dependent of its Information Systems 
(Laudon & Laudon, 2018). At the same time, enterprises are investing in new technological solutions that comply 
with the concept of Industry 4.0, making the work environment more flexible. Also machines are expected to 
become more autonomous and connected with each other (Oztemel & Gursev, 2020).  
 
Although a digital transformation (DT) is imperative for companies that want to stand out in this time, many are still 
struggling with how to do it effectively (Barthel & Hess, 2019).

1075",,"that the collected data is reliable. The user involvement in the development, implementation and maintenance of the 
systems is essential. Along with it, it should be emphasized the value of the new procedures, so the users are more 
prone to the changes. A process analysis prior and after the technological changes is also essential, as the integration 
and adaptation of the new systems in the already existing processes. Business partners and support for the 
technological solutions turned out to also be key for the practical case along with the definition of strategic plans, 
roadmaps. 
 
With the research findings, the literature around the success factors of IS can be strengthen and, ultimately, 
organizations can be more prepared for their digital transformations and with higher success rates. Though some 
limitations should also be acknowledged. First, for the classification of the key aspects as CSF, no framework or 
guidelines were followed. Therefore, the identification of the factors as CSF highly depends on the experience in the 
practical case and what was found as critical (either in a positive or negative perspective) for the flow of the project. 
Not only that, but other related limitations were also recognized previously regarding the CSFs. One other limiting 
point is the fact that the results presented solely reflect the findings from a DT in one organization only, which 
already possesses a greater digital maturity level than the vast majority. Therefore, the results may not be 
representative of every company. Additional studies in other organizations could be interesting to close this gap.  
 
Other future work can also be highlighted. It could be interesting to study in more detail some of the key factors 
uncovered. Also, the geographic setting, culture of organizations‚Äô workers would as well be an attractive subject to 
research as it can impact the way that the enterprise works and what it is given more attention to or not. It could also 
be appealing to do a deeper study around the success factors reached and the ones already present in the literature 
such as the example exposed. Lastly, a proper definition for what constitutes a critical success factor and/or key 
factor from the research findings should be reached. This can help define if aspects from different studies were 
found as key using the same criteria or not, to, ultimately, help in the definition of additional models around the 
subject.

Abstract 
 
This work introduces a new mathematical interpretation of the solution space for the Traveling Salesperson Problem 
(TSP); which is a combinatorial optimization problem that has applications in many fields, from logistics and 
manufacturing to design and configuration of products. The proposed interpretation shows that all solutions are 
contained on the edge of a sliced a spheroid. Thus, modeling the solution space from a novel perspective. The 
contribution of this paper is fourfold: First the development  of  a linear programming problem which objective 
function value leads to an upper bound on the Euclidean distance from a current feasible TSP solution to the optimal 
one; second, if the current feasible solution is optimal the solution of the later model will provide information that 
might aid in a further effort of confirmation;  third once the bound on the distance  is found the computer effort to 
achieve TSP optimally  is realized; and finally  a  set of heuristics which are  highly suitable for parallel graphical 
processing unit (GPU) computing are proposed. Numerical experimentation shows that the heuristics and the GPU 
implementation can efficiently find solutions with an average of 3.5% of the lower bound solutions for symmetric 
TSP, and an average of 4.15% for asymmetric best known benchmark solutions. In addition, the computer effort to 
achieve optimality is also shown for these instances.

Abstract 
 
Contractors‚Äô budgeted cost overrun is treated as a regular feature in construction projects. It was evident that the major 
impact for the contractors‚Äô budgeted cost overrun has happened with the material cost and labour cost. Hence, the 
paper aims to find common causes for the material and labour cost overruns as well as strategies to reduce the impact 
on the contractors‚Äô budgeted cost overrun. A comprehensive literature review along with the expert interviews under 
the qualitative research approach was adopted during the data collection. Subsequently, frequency analysis was 
adopted to analyse data collected through interviews. The study identified 10 and 12 common causes for material and 
labour cost overruns respectively which can influence the contractors‚Äô budgeted cost overrun. Further, 7 common 
strategies were identified to minimise the material and labour cost overruns under each category. As the next step, 
future research should aim to provide statistical methods to inspect and analyse the impact level of significant cost 
variables on the contractors‚Äô budget.

1. Introduction 
The construction industry plays a crucial role in the development of the economic growth of any country and it has 
been attested that the construction industry has turned out to be one of the leading industries inside the globe (Vaardini 
et al. 2016). Project completion within the budget can be regarded as one of the major forces for the successful 
performance of a project (Memon et al. 2010). Traditionally, the main stakeholders in a project such as the contractor 
and the client have more influence on the cost performance of any project (Deshmukh and Menkudle 2019). 
Accordingly, a predetermined accurate budget is essential for stakeholders of construction projects (Lim et al. 2016). 
Dakhli and Lafhaj (2019) stated that there is a considerable difference between contractors‚Äô budgeted cost and the 
actual cost at completion in many construction projects. Therefore, without controlling primary cost influencing 
factors, contractors will not be able to control their expenditures effectively (Cheng, 2014). On the other hand, this 
issue causes to increase in overall project costs and affect contractors' profit.  
 
However, if the contractors can identify and be familiar with causes for cost overrun by their perspectives, it will help 
to reduce the impact on the contractors' profit (Mitra and Shrestha 2017). Furthermore, researchers have found several 
factors that affect the construction cost and investigated the ways to minimise the cost overruns. According to Olatunji 
et al. (2018), there is a strong relationship between material price increments and cost overruns in construction 
projects. Further, when there are changes in material cost and labour cost probably there may be cost overruns in 
construction projects (Dominic and Smith 2014). In addition, Burke (as cited in Albtoush et al. 2020) stated that the 
cost of construction material and labour should control and manage well.  
 
Hence, this paper aims to find the common causes for material and labour cost overruns on the contractors and 
suggestions to minimise the impact from those causes. Accordingly, the paper is structured as follows. First, the 
literature review is presented on critical variables impact on construction cost. Then justification of research method. 
Finally, the results of the study with an outline of the implication for construction contractors.

Abstract  
 
Several previous studies on the problem of SMEs show that the use and utilization of technology is still a major 
problem for SMEs, one of which is technology to support transaction processes such as mobile payments. 
Unfortunately in Indonesia where SMEs are one of the important variables in a country's economy, but mobile 
payments have not been used optimally by SMEs. the purpose of this research is to help SMEs use m-payment using 
a technology acceptance model approach. The result of this research is the TAM m-payment model for SME

Abstract  
 
There are many benefits from the implementation of e-learning so that the implementation of E-learning has become 
a necessity for education in Indonesia, including at the school level, but the implementation of e-learning at the 
school level is constrained, one of which is due to the factor of the ability of teachers to use e-learning. The purpose 
of this research is to help teachers use e-learning as part of improving the quality of educators in using technology 
that supports online learning using the Technology Acceptance Model. The research method uses observation and 
interviews to obtain information related to teacher problems in using e-learning. The outcome of this study is the 
implementation of the Technology Acceptance Model to help teachers use e-learning in schools.

collaborate on learning with teachers who already understand e-learning. This step is more effective in 
increasing teacher knowledge about e-learning because it uses a best practice approach, meaning that 
teachers who don't understand will be taught step by step all the modules in the e-learning 
system.(Chong,2012),(Le,2018),(Hirsh,2019) 
iii. Self-learning is the next step to understand the system

then the teacher will use outsourcing to carry out learning activities with e-learning (Romero,2019).

Abstract 
SMEs as one of the economic sectors that make a major contribution to the country have many 
weaknesses and one of the weaknesses of SMEs is human resource management. Human resources 
information system is a solution for SMEs to manage their human resources, but cost constraints are a 
strong reason for SMEs not to use human resource information systems. This research aims to help SMEs 
apply human resources information systems based on open source and cloud computing. The research 
method uses qualitative data by conducting observations and interviews to get SMEs' needs for a system 
that supports human resource management. The result of this research is a human resources information 
system model based on open source and cloud computing for SME

Abstract 
 
The rise of COVID-19 changed the way how people work. Some are permitted to work from home, however, some 
workers are still required to always report. This increases the risk for COVID-19 infection. This study measures the 
risk level of employees for COVID-19 infection of workers in the government sector of the Philippines. The RIKA 
Assessment Tool was utilized to evaluate the different risk factors associated with the COVID-19 infection. Based on 
the results of the study, the researchers can conclude that the comparisons with a low significant relationship are the 
total risk score and comorbidities, total risk score and smoking habit, total risk score and anxiety, as well as the 
lockdown and compliance. For the comparisons with a moderately significant relationship are the age and 
comorbidities, total risk score and hand washing, total risk score and sanitizing, anxiety and government trust, total 
risk score and government trust, total risk score and residential, as well as the total risk score and lockdown. The 
comparisons with a highly significant relationship are the total risk score and travel history, as well as the total risk 
score and compliance.

1. Introduction 
The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has had a massive impact on workplaces all across the world. Many workplaces have 
been modified or closed as a result of the widespread viral infection, illness, and mortality, resulting in huge numbers 
of people being temporarily furloughed or unemployed. The elderly and physically vulnerable are the most exposed 
to the virus and its effects, but physical separation, stay-at-home orders, and isolation have had devastating social, 
economic, and health ramifications for employees of all ages, with a disproportionate impact on the most 
disadvantaged (Shaw et al. 2020). In connection to the aspect of the Government Employees in the Philippines, where 
they are also in charge of implementing precautionary measures and guidelines which the Inter-Agency Task Force 
for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) spearheaded, have also been challenged by the difficulty 
of the circumstances. Workplaces in every branch faced different dilemmas on how to provide efficient services to 
the people while monitoring the health safety protocols. 
 
According to the study of Lilja et al. (2018) Some of the challenges of inviting workers back to the workplace mirror 
some of the issues that we recognize as commonplace in the return-to-work and occupational rehabilitation literature‚Äî
the idiosyncratic nature of health and work, individual disease vulnerability, susceptibility to environmental hazards, 
the need for job flexibility and modification, and differences in work style, social capital, and organizational support. 
A recurring theme in the work disability literature is the heterogeneity of return-to-work outcomes for workers with a 
wide range of injuries, illnesses, and medical procedures (e.g., cardiac arrest, major trauma). Within medical 
conditions, this variation has been attributed to demographic and health variables (age, fitness, health status, 
anthropometry), workplace factors (e.g., supervisor support, ability to accommodate, physical demands), 
psychological factors (e.g., perceived impairment, job stress, coping, fears of re-injury or worsening health conditions, 
catastrophizing), and social factors (e.g., perceived impairment, job stress, coping, fears of re-injury or worsening 
health conditions), as the COVID-19 workplace opening process may also need to address this complexity of factors 
(Cancelliere et al. 2016, de Vries et al. 2018, Gragnano et al. 2018).

5. Conclusion 
In a comparison of the different chosen variables highlighted under Table 4. of the correlation analysis, the 
comparisons with a low significant relationship are the Total Risk Score and Comorbidities, Total Risk Score and 
Smoking Habit, Total Risk Score and Anxiety, and the Lockdown and Compliance. The reason why this is the case 
for the total risk score and comorbidities is that almost half of the respondents are in the lower risk areas of the scoring 
for the comorbidities factor under the health risk. For the total score and smoking habit, a large majority of the 
respondents do not smoke which therefore doesn't affect the total risk score under the health risk. For the total risk 
score and anxiety, based on the answers of the responses, a majority are very much anxious about the situation but 
because of that, they are more aware of the protection procedures that they need to perform and thus knowing how to 
keep safe. Also, this can be because there are more pressing matters or options that the respondents feel are more 
important than the anxiety factor thus there is a low significant relationship. For the lockdown and compliance, this 
has a low significant relationship because implementing lockdowns does not necessarily stop people from going out

1134","and staying at home to follow the rules because not everyone in the Philippines has the privilege to stock food at home 
as not everyone has the financials to support oneself or their family for a long period without going out to work.  
 
For the comparisons with a moderately significant relationship are the Age and Comorbidities, Total Risk Score and 
Hand Washing, Total Risk Score and Sanitizing, Anxiety and Government Trust, Total Risk Score and Government 
Trust, Total Risk Score and Residential, and the Total Risk Score and Lockdown. The reason why this is the case for 
age and comorbidities is that age does play a role in determining one‚Äôs ability to withstand and against any disease or 
any medical conditions that an individual has. The older someone is the harder it is for them to combat any 
comorbidities they may possess. For the total risk score and hand washing, this has a moderately significant 
relationship because a majority of the respondents frequently washes their hands, and a good amount under the second 
safest risk level for the washing of hands factor under the behavioral risk. And washing hands is one of the most 
important things to do especially when going out as it is really easy to not notice that you may have touched your eyes, 
nose, and mouth without realizing that you touched something before that could have any bacteria or viruses present. 
For the total risk score and sanitizing, a majority of the respondents do sanitize but there are a few that only perform 
the task of the second safest risk level. Sanitizing is crucial especially in the process of cleaning where this should be 
done before and after certain activates are done to make sure that everything is clean and safe. For anxiety and 
government trust, there are people out there that are anxious a lot of times if the government can provide them with 
the necessities needed to help them combat the COVID-19 virus during the pandemic. For the total risk score and 
government trust, almost half of the respondents do have trust and faith towards the government believing that they 
can help and provide for the people during these hard times. For the total risk score and residential, almost half of the 
respondents live in detached homes which are in the lowest risk areas of the scoring for the residential type factor 
under the exposure risk which indicates the lowest risk for exposure to the virus. For the total risk score and lockdown, 
the majority of the respondents are following the lockdown protocols, therefore, are in the lower risk areas of the 
scoring for the effectiveness of lockdown factor under the social policy risk. 
 
The comparisons with a highly significant relationship are the Total Risk Score and Travel History, as well as the 
Total Risk Score and Compliance. The reason why this is the case for the total risk score and travel history is that the 
RIKA risk assessment focuses or prioritizes the outgoing activities and their interactions when outdoors, therefore it 
will have a high relationship with the travel history. Where even when the majority of the respondents have no travel 
history, there are still quite a few that went to mass gatherings and have a travel history. As for the total risk score and 
the compliance, this comparison has a highly significant relationship because compliances are what help people take 
precautionary measures to protect themselves from the virus, and performing them is vital to staying safe not only for 
the individual but also for everyone around them. Where almost half of the respondents chose the option that is the 
second safest risk level for the community compliance factor under the social policy risk which is why this will affect 
the total risk score. 
 
6. Recommendation 
It is recommended for future researchers of the same field or topic to have a fixed source of the sector of respondents. 
It is better to have the respondents from one company or one sector only to have fixed and uniform data to have it 
easier in the classification of data. It is recommended to the respondents of the study to have the risk factors that can 
be controlled by themselves to be lessened. The safety and health protocols should be followed and try to avoid mass 
gatherings and travels. The vices should be eliminated like smoking and drinking, and exercise should be done always. 
No matter what we are feeling towards the government, we should follow the lockdown procedures and guidelines as 
much as possible. It is recommended to employers to always have their employees safe. The jobs and tasks that can 
be done at home should be done at home, and the frequencies of going to the workplace should be limited.

Abstract 
 
The primary objective of this study is to measure the risk levels of food delivery riders for COVID-19 Infection by 
looking into the health risk, behavioral risk, exposure risk, and social policy risk. The participants for the study were 
30 food delivery riders from the Philippines, and the RIKA assessment tool was utilized. For the statistical treatment 
of data, the researchers used descriptive statistics for the demographic profiling and correlation analysis for 
determining the significant relationship between different factors incorporated in the study. In the findings, for the 
health risks, the risk scale is low in age and comorbidities but high in gender and smoking habit. For the behavioral 
risks, there is low risk in handwashing, sanitation, social distancing, and trust in government, but the high risk in the 
use of face masks and anxiety. For exposure risks, there is low risk in residential type and travel history but a high 
risk in occupation. For social policy risk, the risk scale is low in the effectiveness of lockdown but is high in community 
compliance. In the correlation, it was established that there is a high correlation between total risk score and sanitizing. 
There were also moderate correlations between several pairs such as age and face mask, total risk score and age, total 
risk score and government trust, total risk score and residential, total risk score and travel history, and total risk score 
and lockdown. Other relationships either had minor or no correlation.

1. Introduction 
When COVID-19 came into view, the normal lives of society suddenly changed. Society and the economy have also 
been widely affected. People are forced to perform different activities and do their jobs inside their homes due to the 
risks posed by the virus. As the movement of people between places has been limited due to the lockdowns and 
community quarantine, the demand for delivery services has emerged. One of those workers who provide services for 
the convenience of many includes food delivery riders.  
 
Although ideally, people have work amidst the pandemic, it is still true that the risk for going outside to work is indeed 
high. They are prone to get infected by the virus because they are the ones doing all the interactions in the restaurant 
and also transporting it to the customers. They were out and about while the majority of people are contained in their 
houses. This study aims to assess the level of risk that food delivery drivers are facing just to earn a living in a deadly 
situation.  
 
1.1 Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to assess and measure the risk levels of food delivery riders for COVID-19 
Infection by looking into the health risk, behavioral risk, exposure risk, and social policy risk. The researchers also 
look into the relationship between the different factors that are incorporated in the study.

5. Conclusion 
As conclusions of this study, the researchers were able to do demographic profiling for the respondents in which the 
profile of the respondents was identified. It showed that more than half of the respondents were 21-30 years old. 90% 
of the respondents also were profiled as them having no comorbidities. The behavioral risks in risk assessment were 
also computed. Such findings say that more than half of the population of respondents use medical face masks in their 
delivery transactions. The majority of them very frequently wash their hands, sanitation before touching their face 
was observed by the majority, following social distancing was also done by the majority. More than half of the 
respondents say that they are experiencing anxiety because of the current situation due to the pandemic, and an almost 
equal distribution (yes, no, maybe) is observed when it comes to trusting the government measurements. In assessing 
the risk levels of the respondents gathered, 50% have a minimal risk level meanwhile the other 50% have a moderate 
risk level. This is because most of the respondents were young and did not have any comorbidities. Hence, for the 
health risks, the risk scale is low in age and comorbidities but high in gender and smoking habit. For the behavioral 
risks, there is low risk in handwashing, sanitation, social distancing, and trust in government, but the high risk in the 
use of face masks and anxiety. For exposure risks, there is low risk in residential type and travel history but a high 
risk in occupation. For social policy risk, the risk scale is low in the effectiveness of lockdown but is high in community 
compliance. 
 
Looking at the study in finer detail, the researchers also determined correlational relationships between factors that 
were important. In ranking the factors which got high correlation results, the Total Risk Score and sanitizing came 
first. Some factors had moderate correlations. Namely, Age and Face Mask, Total Risk Score and Age, Total risk 
Score and Government Trust, Total Risk Score and Residential, Total Risk Score and Travel History, and Total Risk 
Score and Lockdown. Other relationships either had minor correlation or no correlation at all.  
 
In conclusion, the data calculated from the statistical analysis can be used as a model in measuring the risk levels of 
food delivery riders for COVID-19 infections. The health, behavioral, exposure, and social policy risks are described 
by the different findings and therefore can be used in examining the food delivery platform during the COVID-19 
pandemic. 
 
6. Recommendation 
The authors of this study suggest management from the food delivery companies mentioned above that they use this 
model or perhaps improve this in their perspective to determine safety standards for their delivery personnel.  
 
The authors of this study also recommend that a long time would be required in gathering the data for this study to 
have more accurate findings. It has been a limitation that only 30 respondents were gathered in concluding the given 
data. For future research, it is recommended that being able to provide a greater number of respondents would give a 
better and accurate statistical result that can be used.

Abstract 
 
There is an interest in representing properly the driving patterns, energy consumption and vehicle emissions 
of a region. Driving pattern is understood as the way that people drive their vehicles. One of the ways to 
represent the driving patterns is through time series of speed, denominated driving cycles (DC). The 
duration of the DC is an important factor to define a DC. Short DCs tend to generate high fuel consumption 
and emissions results due to the vehicle operates primarily in its warm-up phase. Long DCs represent higher 
costs in the type approval tests. The time duration of each DC is unique since it represents local and 
particular operating conditions. However, there is no defined methodology to establish the duration of DCs 
based on the driving characteristics of a specific region. This study aims to study the effect of different time 
durations of the DCs on their representativeness. We used data of speed, time, fuel consumption and 
emissions of travels monitored for two months from a fleet of 15 buses operating in a flat and high traffic 
region. Using Micro-trips method, we built DCs with a time length of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, 60 and 120 
minutes. The results indicate that for having DCs with relative difference equal or less than 10% respect to 
the driving patterns, the DCs must have a duration of more than 25 minutes. This time length also guarantees 
the representativeness, in terms of energy consumption and tailpipe emissions.

1. Introduction 
Little by little, we have seen how new technologies have been gaining strength in recent years, facilitating 
communication and / or development of tasks and, why not, life. Likewise, companies, nowadays, are getting more 
involved because they know that, thanks to the digital era, the results obtained are positive, increasing their position 
within the sector in which they are. The world is facing a new industrial revolution, a process of economic, social and 
technological change consequences of technological and scientific advances that, due to their disruptive nature, are 
changing the rules of the game (Avenda√±o Ayestar√°n, 2016). Currently, the use of new technologies has been 
increasing thanks to the Covid - 19 pandemic and the effects it had (worldwide immobilization). By not having a way 
to communicate, technology took position within the interactions, either personal or work. With this, the economy 
was affected, but not completely. In the same way, Brazil has reached a turnover of up to 17 billion and Mexico more 
than 14 billion US dollars, evidencing its leadership within Latin America (Chevalier Naranjo, 2020). There are within 
Latin America up to 156 million online shoppers, according to a 2019 report. This number only represents 8% of the 
total number of digital shoppers worldwide (Saavedra, 2020). Only 57% of online purchases are made through the 
business website, Facebook is the platform through which 48% of these sales are made, while 42% are made through 
a mobile app (Datum International, 2020). 
 
On the other hand, due to the pandemic, many Peruvians lost their jobs. However, they managed to create their own 
businesses, some to the point of forming small companies and others making their half-business still ""have life"" in 
spite of the situation. For this, it was necessary that many have had to get involved in the digital plane with two options: 
The first is by getting involved to a creative team that could generate fixed costs of both human capital (equipment 
for the development of digital proposals). As for the second option, it would be outsourcing this service. With this, 
the costs involved would be clearly variable depending on the service required in its digitization plan. During the 
pandemic, 44% of Peruvians have developed their first online purchase in the last year (Think with Google, 2020). It 
is predicted that by the end of 2021, Peruvians will make half of their purchases online. (Datum International, 2020). 
It is observed that the new digital era has been very supportive to the point of becoming an opportunity for ""SMEs"" 
as well as new ventures that have emerged in the pandemic. In the last year, three out of ten people who did not see it 
viable to undertake a venture, decided to create a new business, considering the pandemic a driver of such initiative 
(Colledge & Martyn, 2021). Within Peru there are 59% of Peruvians who have created 1 or more businesses and 34%

Abstract  
 
This study presents the application of storage assignment and human error improvement model in warehouse 
management to the case study of automobile seat manufacturers. The objectives are to improve the efficiency and 
accuracy of the order picking (OP) process in companies. For improving the efficiency of the OP process, capacity 
decision analysis and an optimization method using linear programming are used to perform storage assignments of 
raw material in the warehouse. The human error improvement model is then used as an approach to reduce human 
error that occurs in the OP process and increase its accuracy. Three scenarios of storage assignment are analyzed, and 
all of them results in a better total OP time compared to the existing condition. Several recommendations of 
improvement actions are also provided to reduce the occurrence of human error in OP process. The contribution of 
this work is two folds; it provides a practical contribution to the case study, and it helps to enrich the literature related 
to the OP improvement strategy.

1. Introduction  
In the warehousing process, order picking (OP) is an important activity that supports the overall operational 
performance of the warehouse. OP is the process of retrieving items from their storage locations in a warehouse to 
fulfil customers‚Äô orders (Grosse, et al., 2015). OP is an activity that is significant to the overall warehouse operation 
because it consumes the largest proportion of costs. On average, the cost of the OP consumes 55% of the total 
warehouse costs (Tompkins, et al., 1996). The relation between OP and service level is determined by OP efficiency 
and accuracy (Burinskiene, 2010). Efficiency shows how quickly an order may be retrieved and how soon it is 
available for shipping to the customer (Koster, et al., 2007). The efficiency of an OP activity depends on several main 
factors such as the size of the warehouse, picking systems, storage strategies, layout strategies, and routing strategies. 
As for accuracy in OP, it relates to human errors that occur in OP, which depends on storage methods, picking methods 
and other factors. 
 
The case study used in this research is from a car seat manufacturing company in Indonesia. One of the problems that 
occur in this procurement process is the difference between the forecast given the day before, and the actual orders 
made using the JIT system. This has an impact on several aspects, one of the most significant is the level of inventory 
in the raw material warehouse. In this case, companies often experience warehouse overcapacity because the actual 
order is lower than the forecast. This condition causes the company to bear the risk of damaged goods because the 
goods are placed outside the warehouse area, which in turn can reduce OP time efficiency.  
 
The problem of inefficiency also occurs in the placement of raw material items in the warehouse. In actual conditions, 
the company has used dedicated storage as a storage policy. However, the placement of goods has not considered the 
frequency or throughput of each raw material item. This results in workers picking up raw material items that have 
high throughput at a longer distance, compared to raw material items that have lower throughput. The problems that 
cause inefficiency in the OP process also affect other problems that arise due to human error or also called inaccuracy.

1159","Figure 6 (a) Pareto of Improvement Action (b) OP time comparison between scenarios 
 
In overall there are two main proposed improvement for OP resulted by applied methodology. Storage assignment 
optimization with linear programming result in 3 possible scenarios to be applied. Figure 6 (b) shows the comparison 
between deployment scenarios for the storage assignment efforts. Reduction of OP time in the comparison between 
scenario 1 and scenario 2 resulted in a 31% reduction in OP time, while the comparison between scenario 2 and 
scenario 1 resulted in scenario 2 will have a 39% reduction of total OP time compared to the scenario 1. This shows 
that the implementation of storage assignment optimization can reduce the total OP time by at least 30%, compared 
to if no optimization is carried out. The comparison between scenario 2 and scenario 3 then gives a difference of 11% 
reduction in OP time for scenario 3. 
 
This fact can then be used as consideration for further decision analysis whether the costs involved in procuring racks 
or picking up goods using forklifts on an operational basis are proven to be lower. Compared to the benefits obtained 
by implementing scenario 3. These benefits include a decrease in total OP time by 11% when performing OP processes 
on internal and external warehouses. Meanwhile, the application of human error improvement model resulting 3 main 
improvement actions that could reduce human error with the lowest possible cost which are conducting spreadsheet 
training for data recording purposes, implementing a FIFO card system with different shelf lines for new goods and 
old goods, and making a large map of the position of the placement of goods and their route.  
 
5. Conclusion  
There are 3 comparison scenarios carried out on the implementation of the storage assignment optimization model. 
The first scenario is the existing condition of the placement of raw material items in the observed company, where the 
placement of raw material items follows the latest conditions in the warehouse. The total OP time obtained is then the 
product of the displacement frequency, the number of trolleys, and the time per pick for each position of the raw 
material item. The three scenarios of storage assignment results in the total OP time for one month in scenario 1, 
scenario 2, and scenario 3 is 417.9 hours, 288.6 hours, and 255.5 hours respectively. In the human error improvement 
model, the output of phase 2 will identify the improvement actions that are possible to be taken by the company to 
reduce human error. The three improvements that have the most significant impact in reducing human error based on 
the Pareto analysis are actions are conducting spreadsheet training for data recording purposes, implementing a FIFO 
card system with different shelf lines for new goods and old goods, and making a large map of the placement of goods 
after the addition of capacity.

Abstract  
SMEs are considered the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy, and e-commerce can be viewed as a ladder for 
business growth. Therefore, it is important for SMEs to adopt e-commerce. Studies show that Sri Lankan SMEs do 
not use e-commerce to its full potential. Therefore, before adopting e-commerce-based tools and technologies, it is 
essential for SMEs to consider their readiness to adopt e-commerce. The research is conducted through a systematic 
literature review using the PRISMA framework. This study has identified several main factors affecting e-commerce 
readiness: availability of knowledge and skills, human resource availability and compatibility, management 
influence, perceived benefits, finance management, organizational culture, availability of IT infrastructure, 
compatibility of business processes, and organizational governance. The availability of IT infrastructure was the 
most considered factor, where organizational governance was the least considered factor compared to other factors, 
when assessing e-commerce readiness and adoption.

1.  Introduction  
According to Mesenbourgh (2001), Electronic commerce (e-commerce) is the value of goods and services sold over 
computer-mediated networks. An e-commerce transaction is considered completed when the two parties, the buyer 
and the seller come to an agreement regarding the ownership of the goods, rights, or services.  
 
Even though e-commerce was initially identified as a means of buying and selling goods and services, it is now 
evolved as a medium for information exchanges. E-commerce is identified as processes and activities involved in 
exchanging both financial and non-financial information using an electronically mediated environment with 
different stakeholders via computer networks (Govinnage and Sachitra 2019). 
 
E-readiness is defined as the availability of the ICT resources, the accessibility of the ICT resources to the people 
and the organizations, and the effectiveness of the regulatory frameworks regarding ICT, such as the e-governance 
policies (Averweg 2009). E-commerce readiness is a measure that indicates the ability of a person or a community 
to use the internet, and IT resources for online transactions, which are buying, selling, and payments. According to 
the definition, there is a similarity between the idea of e-commerce readiness and e-readiness. (Kamel 2010).

Abstract 
Transport planning is a challenging topic to be addressed in urban areas in order to create sustainable cities, due to the 
adverse health effects, noise and congestions generated by the transport sector. Therefore, policymakers require 
technical tools that allow to take regulatory transport decisions, considering environmental and health impacts. This 
work presents the development of an integrated and comprehensive tool to assess urban mobility strategies called 
MAITec. The methodology includes the implementation and application of specialized software to estimate health 
impact by transport emissions. The tool was implemented in a university district in Mexico. Results indicate that in 
the base scenario, people are exposed to high pollutant concentrations in some sectors of the district, where traffic 
pollution claims approximately 9 lives every two years. MAITec was implemented in a free online platform and shared 
with local governments for its application.

Abstract 
 
E-commerce is revolutionizing the way we buy and interact with brands, with advantages in saving time, access to 
exclusive promotions and automatic payments. For their part, companies have an alternative to achieve greater user 
loyalty. SMEs and large companies are offering their products and services through these platforms, allowing business 
development in increasingly globalized environments. With an increasingly strong presence of the internet in everyday 
life and the security that the banking sector has generated for conducting electronic transactions, people see e-
commerce as the perfect option for convenience and time savings. 
 
Keywords 
E-commerce, Purchase Motivation, Perceived confidence, Online store and Consumer  
 
1. Introduction 
E-commerce is considered as the production, advertising, sale and distribution of products through 
telecommunications networks (Gonz√°lez, 2020). It consists of the purchase and sale of products and / or services, 
where consumers obtain the information, specifications, characteristics of the product/service and can acquire them 
through electronic means (Mercado, Perez, Castro, & Macias, 2019) (Hoose, 2018).  
 
The E-commerce can be also be defined as all aspects of business and market processes enabled by the Internet 
(Mohd Satar, Dastane, & Yusnorizam Ma'arif, 2019). They give a broader meaning to the term, by not only limiting 
it to commercial but also financial transactions developed between companies, consumers or organizations through 
an electronic communication infrastructure (Corrales Li√©vano & Gil Herrera, 2018) 
 
The E-commerce becomes a viable option for SMEs and entrepreneurs to compete alongside large industries. In this 
research, we seek to propose a methodology so that SMEs and entrepreneurs can increase sales through purchase 
motivation, achieving greater brand recognition and customer loyalty (Perdig√≥n Llanes, Viltres Sala, & Madrigal 
Leiiva, 2018).  
 
Alzate and Restrepo (2016) mention that despite the potential of e-commerce, the lack of consumer confidence 
hinders purchases through electronic channels, which means that the use of the internet as an alternative to increase 
sales and distribution of products does not develop in the expected way.

6. Conclusion 
According to the observed results, the proposed Model 4 with a ùëÖùëÖ2 of 0.593, as seen in Table 5, the variable that has 
the greatest weight in terms of its beta, in the explanation of the purchase intention is the Discounts and promotions. 
The results are in line with previous research findings that demonstrate the positive effect of sales promotions on 
consumer behavior (Alvarez & Casielles, 2005; Gupta, 1988) as well as strengthens the theoretical assumptions that 
the sales promotion is an important element to influence purchasing behavior of a customer (Blattberg & Neslin, 
1990). 
 
 Second, it is the Online store design. Third, it is the delivery time, from when the purchase was generated, until the 
delivery of this. Finally, it is the Perceived confidence by the consumer towards the e-commerce platform. Equation 
(1) represents the model of multiple linear regression obtained in this investigation.

This research recommends, as we verified statistically, that e-commerce platforms should focus in the investments 
of agile, feasible processes and pay attention to promotional events, payment facilities; as well as a fast, secure and 
traceable shipment. These factors can be of great help to increase your sales and income. 
 
One drawback of this study is that we have only used online store design factors as antecedents of trust.  Jarvenpaa 
and Tractinsky (1999) had conceptualised that there are other factors such as vendor repute and vendor size that 
affect purchase intention. Tan et al. (2007) had shown empirically that external and internal norms affect purchase 
intention.  
 
For future research the exploration of in depth online store design will provide more data on how to make an 
attractive and more user friendly platform to increase the online purchase intention to increase online sales. Also an 
important research to be made in the near future is to expand this study to different consumer cultures, other 
demographics to compare and get more knowledge on this topic.

Abstract 
 
The supply chain involves all the processes from the purchase order request to the delivery to the final customer, 
however, there are factors such as the health crisis that make organizations vulnerable if they do not take full advantage 
of their resources. Also, these changes cause the world to think seriously about the sustainability of manufacturing 
and services considering the characteristic of resilience which is the ability to overcome difficult circumstances and 
reverse logistics, which is related to strategic planning. However, they are also considered strategies that allow 
companies to jointly face market volatility and changes in demand without affecting the organization's economic 
barriers. 
 
Keywords  
Resiliency, Reverse logistics, Supply Chain, Supply Chain Strategies, Economic barriers. 
 
1. Introduction  
Health crises have a negative impact on the daily life of individuals, organizations, nations, due to labor and social 
conditions, unemployment and low income, social insecurity, as well as poverty. It is precisely in these conditions that 
companies need to organize themselves to make the most of their resources and avoid making their products more 
expensive. One of the most representative costs associated with the companies is the logistics cost, which represents 
up to 25% or more of the total cost of the product. (Mauleon, 2006). This cost is implicit in the supply chain processes, 
which is defined as the design, planning, execution, control and monitoring of the activities that generate value in the 
supply chain. (Association for supply Management, 1998). Cooper (1997) defines the supply chain as the integration 
of business processes from end users to suppliers of products, services and information that add value for customers. 
Tang (2011), indicates that these crises or disasters have revealed the vulnerability of supply chains, which in turn led 
to studies that analyze supply disruption and perform supply chain risk analysis. Other authors mention that the 
emergence of a new changing economic order has also made companies around the world think seriously about the 
sustainability of manufacturing and services. Global markets and operations have led companies to review their 
corporate, business, and functional strategies, in addition to focusing on outsourcing, virtual enterprise and supply 
chain management (Ageron, Gunasekaran , & Spalanzani, 2011). Mariadoss indicate that supply chain management 
should focus on the management of material, information, and capital flows, as well as cooperation between companies 
along the supply chain, taking into account the objectives of the three dimensions of sustainable development, i.e., 
economic, environmental and social. In addition to the three dimensions, it is proposed that there are five pillars to be 
sustainable, which are mentioned below: product design, technology selection, reversal of its operations, network 
capacity, as well as the integration of operations with the environment and social factors (2016) (Tang & Zhou, 2012) 
(Hagelaar & Van der Vost , 2002) (Ashby, Leat, & Hudson, 2012). Due to the above mentioned, it is necessary to 
develop models to observe and predict the behavior of the supply chain over time, these models help specially to 
calculate the impacts on supply chain performance disruptions under conditions of dependent changes in its 
environment over time (Ivanov, 2020) .

6. Conclusion 
The pandemic (COVID-19) has shown that Supply Chains are exposed to be affected if they do not have a plan to 
react to the effects coming from the external market. In this study, a literature analysis was carried out in which the 
variables that according to the literature have an impact on the formation of resilient supply chains in other parts of 
the world were considered, as could be observed in the theoretical framework. The variables considered were the 
following: reverse logistics, economic barriers, supply chain strategies, collaboration between supply chain 
participants, and finally, data available for decision making. The study was applied to the automotive industry, as it 
contributes a large percentage of the country's exports and imports. The measurement instrument used was a survey 
containing items for the evaluation of the independent and dependent variables, the result of the application of this 
yielded two models, considering that the one with the greatest impact is the second one with an R2 of .857, which 
indicates that this model represents 85.7 the research problem. Regarding the statistical results of the independent 
variables of this research problem, the independent variables that were found to be significant are the economic 
barriers, as well as the strategies focused on the supply chain with betas of .478 and. 307 respectively; these results 
indicate that the organizations in this line of business in the state of Nuevo Leon consider that to be resilient they 
should focus their actions on having a supply chain strategy; the organizations consider that the actions taken by 
governments directly affect their processes, and mention that in this area they have no control; in the case of supply 
chain strategies, the questions that had high results were planning in the selection of suppliers, planning objectives 
and having a strategy focused on risk management. The results of this research indicate that the organizations in the 
study do not consider reverse logistics, supply chain collaboration and data analytics to have an impact on the 
formation of resilient supply chains. Despite this, it is recommended that the non-significant variables be explored 
further in future and larger scale studies.   It is worth noting that this research proposes that organizations focus their 
supply chain strategies on exploring the risks they are exposed to considering their geographical location and the 
relationship of the consequences of having suppliers or their customers in other locations where there are borders 
between countries.

Abstract 
 
For decades, data-driven decisions have become the core of quality improvements. A new paradigm has been 
introduced for the digitalization of quality management with ‚ÄúQuality 4.0‚Äù. Automatic data and information exchange 
are the essential steps of the Quality 4.0 paradigm to achieve automation of the manufacturing systems. The goal of 
this paper is to design and manage the database of the automated system as the first stage of data preparation for 
quality management. For this stage, we use the Entity Relationship (ER) modeling technique to develop conceptual 
and logical models. This technique is used in a real case study to organize and manage the database of inspection and 
repair processes in aerospace manufacturing. The real merit of the developed models is to create a well-structured 
database that describes the system‚Äôs data flow with high data quality.

1. Introduction  
Quality 4.0 paradigm is a new concept introduced under the general approach of Industry 4.0. Quality 4.0 represents 
the digitalization of quality management where it monitors and controls the quality of the process and/or product 
(Bauchi 2020) (Jacob 2017). Data and information exchange are the cornerstone of the Quality 4.0 paradigm to achieve 
high reliability in the automation of the manufacturing systems (Jacob 2017). In such systems, a large amount of 
information flow between sensors and controllers independently of continuous interaction with humans, which poses 
some challenges for existing traditional systems regarding their ability to handle and manage the sheer amount of data 
and information due to the lack of the necessary tools and infrastructures (Lucas-Stan 2018). A clear example of such 
a challenge can be found in the aerospace domain in which visual inspection is the main method for inspecting parts 
(See 2012) (Rice 2018). Since this process is carried out by talented and experienced human inspectors, it is still prone

5. Conclusion 
Quality 4.0 anticipates the digital transformation of quality management will improve the process and/or product 
quality and will increase productivity. Data automation supports the vision by monitoring the processes and collecting 
the necessary information. When the data management process is improved, it will be possible to identify the process 
variables that are required to be monitored by quality tools, for example, the control chart. ER modeling technique is 
widely used to design a data model that represents the data of the system in entity sets and describes their relationships. 
Moreover, it provides the key performance indices for quality to detect any anomalies during system operation. In this 
paper, we developed the conceptual and logical ER models for the SARA system which is an automated inspection 
and repair in the aerospace maintenance and repair domain. These models aim to organize the data in the system by 
identification of nine entities that represent the process, and their relationships with each other and their attributes. 
They characterize and control the information generated by the SARA system. Consequently, the data flow along the 
SARA model is visually represented and easily understood. The models favor accessibility, traceability, and 
reproducibility for better communication between inspectors and design specialists and tracking relevant information. 
 
For future works, we will convert the logical ER model for the SARA system to a physical model that is implemented 
in the system. The physical data model represents the actual database design according to what is carried out in the 
logical one. The physical model defines the data types; numeric, string, date, or time, etc.; the foreign keys that link 
the entities, and the necessary constraints. It is used to support the implementation of the database using DBMS 
software. It provides a Data Definition Language (DDL) file, which is generated by MySQL Workbench software that 
will be implemented in the SARA system. Consequently, the automation of inspection and repair in the SARA system 
allows to enter the data that are defined in the model automatically, and provides the information that each stakeholder 
is interested in. After data preparation, we are targeting the implementation of the Quality 4.0 aspects. By providing 
the key performance indices for quality of inspection and repair actions, the information‚Äôs variability of inspection 
and repair processes will be monitored by quality monitoring control tools based on machine learning and statistical 
control chart. This tool assesses the quality of the repair process based on the confirmation rate of the repaired parts 
to be within pre-specified limits. When the repair quality gets beyond these limits, the tool does not only detect 
abnormal behavior in the process but also, it determines the root cause of that out-of-control process. Then, corrective 
actions are taken to avoid several reworks of repair and maintain the repair process within the quality control limits.

Abstract 
 
This study aimed to look into the impact of production planning practices and techniques as a fundamental role 
of product management in a manufacturing organization's operational costs. The study takes a closer look at the 
production process in manufacturing organizations in Johannesburg. The following objectives were listed: (1) to 
determine the outcomes of the organization's production planning practices and techniques, and (2) to evaluate 
the techniques of production planning execution on organizational efficiency, and lastly (3) to investigate the 
impact of production planning on the organization's productivity. The research followed a quantitative approach 
from a case study. Data was gathered using questionnaires that were administered to operational staff, 
supervisors, and middle management employees in the Company understudy. The study population included all 
production planning employees and their supervisors and managers in one of the South African manufacturing 
industries. The study's findings revealed that the practices and approaches were applied and significantly 
impacted the overall outcome. Although the results indicated that the production department was efficient, not 
every department area was efficient.

1. Introduction 
Hamzeh (2009) states that production planning is the act of creating a roadmap for the design and production of 
a product or service. Production planning aids businesses in making their manufacturing processes as efficient 
as possible. It is the only aspect of production that addresses the fundamental principles of what will be 
produced, when, and how much it will cost to make it (Bendul and Blunck, 2019). Production planning is 
critical because it establishes an efficient production process that is tailored to the needs of customers and 
organizations. It improves customer-dependent procedures like on-time delivery as well as customer- 
independent methods like production cycle time. Production planning must be effective as ever for a 
manufacturing business or organization to be successful (Schuh et al., 2017). Regardless of the structure, a lack 
of an efficient production planning strategy will make production impossible. In general, the production 
planning 
process 
entails 
creating 
a 
plan 
that 
satisfies 
customers 
to 
result 
in 
a 
profit.

1214","important it is to use time and date when planning a product's manufacture. As a result, these findings are 
consistent with those in table 2. 
 
4.3 Proposed Improvements 
4.3.1 Organizational setup 
The study's overall findings reveal that all of the participants support the firm having an organization setup 
designed to prepare plans and policies, which is excellent because the organizational setup serves as the 
foundation for all of the Company's plans, including production planning. So, because the organization is 
performing so well in this area, the only advice is to keep upgrading the plans and rules and communicating them 
to the rest of the team. 
 
4.3.2 Staff training 
According to the data, most respondents believe that training for manufacturing procedures and techniques is not 
usually provided to employees. This is bad for business because corporations place a higher emphasis on 
training, people need to be trained more frequently to accomplish their jobs correctly. As a result, the following 
suggestions can be implemented: a) Hold a quarterly training session for the entire team; b) Include the 
appropriate experts in those training sessions. c) Everyone involved in large-scale production activities must be 
capable and well-trained. 
 
4.3.3  Scheduling Technique 
Almost everything that has to be done requires careful planning. With production planning being one of the most 
important aspects of production, the study demonstrates that the production department has a well-planned 
schedule that provides for a seamless flow of operations. As a result, the following suggestions can be 
implemented: a) Assist in the communication of accurate plans and schedules throughout the production 
department. b) Prior to the operation, plans and production schedules must be prepared. c) Appropriate 
communication about planned schedules between middle management and supervisors. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this study looked into the function of production planning procedures and methodologies in 
improving or influencing company performance in terms of operational costs in the Johannesburg manufacturing 
industry. Production planning approaches and techniques were discovered to have a significant impact on 
company performance metrics as well as total operating costs. The study's findings revealed that the practices 
and approaches were applied and significantly impacted the overall outcome. Although the results indicated that 
the production department was efficient, not every department area was efficient. The findings of these studies 
depict the general perspective of production planning in manufacturing companies in South Africa; as much as 
change may be challenging to adapt to, it is recommended that companies should put in place measures to 
improve their production planning procedures to remain competitive.

Abstract  
  
This study aimed at analyzing the impact of TQM in SMEs' daily operations. The following objectives have been 
identified in the study: (1) to foster an understanding on the effects of TQM adoption on the performance of SMEs; 
(2) Clarify the extent of TQM adoption by South African SMEs; and finally (3) Outline an understanding of the 
TQM principles which enterprises in South Africa consider important. The study followed a quantitative approach 
with a purposive sample of 210 SMEs located in the Maboneng district in South Africa was studied. Data collection 
was done using questionnaires while data were analyzed using SPSS 25, where measures of central tendencies such 
as the mean and the average were calculated. Fundamental descriptive analysis has been used to portray the findings 
of the study. Results showed that many SMEs adopt TQM as a production philosophy even though not all 
components of TQM are appropriately applied. However, most companies do not see the need to involve the 
employees in all aspects of the production, especially if they do not understand the production process. Thus, this 
Practice is contradictory to the philosophy of TQM.

1. Introduction.  
Organizations operate in a competitive environment; adopting the Total Quality Management (TQM) approach is 
fundamental to staying in the game Rexhepi (Veland and Ratten,2018). TQM is characterized as an administration 
reasoning driven by top administration with worker support, incorporating all aspects of an association to deliver 
items and administrations that address customers issues such as their needs and wants (Njenge,Vermeulen and 
Pretorius(2015). The central concept behind TQM is to make quality everyone's priority in the organization. The 
initial quality assurance practice was that organizations used to have a particular department in charge of quality 
assurance. This practice was good but was not enough to reduce defects. Thus, TQM was introduced; This study 
aimed at analyzing the impact of TQM in SMEs' daily operations.

TQM is a comprehensive and moral methodology of the organizations to constantly work on their administrations or 
cycles, including all partners, to fulfill their clients and further develop execution and supportability. The outcomes 
showed that TQM practices further develop all exhibition means of an organization. The involvement of employees 
does not affect the performance of the business however, it does affect the performance with their work. This is 
supported by the results of Saleh and Rateb (2018). Constant improvement of cycles and practices further develop 
employees' assurance, independence, nature of items or administration, market, and monetary execution. successfully 
preparing works on operational execution, worker execution, and client results. It has been discovered that 
entrepreneurs or pioneers who further develop social obligation additionally have better market deals or efficiency.

Abstract 
 
Companies have been facing many changes over the last decade related to the Digital Transformation, associated with 
Industry 4.0. Thus, it becomes a need to follow this trend by implementing standards that improve efficiency and work 
conditions. These improvements can be achieved through several ways, whereas management approaches such as 
BPM and Lean, often supported by technologies, may represent possible ways, thus contributing to organizational 
competitiveness. This paper presents a study developed in a company which is currently putting a lot of effort in 
standardizing its business processes and achieving higher maturity levels of I4.0.  The main objective of this study is 
to illustrate how BPM can help companies prepare for the challenges of Digital Transformation. With the 
implementation of this work, it was possible to standardize a major process, which facilitated the execution of the 
tasks of the department‚Äôs workers, giving them some of the tools they need to work consistently and less prone to 
errors or delays. The results of this study also proved that companies need to invest in business processes so that they 
can more easily implement I4.0 initiatives, namely those that interfere with the Human Factor, in waste-free 
environments.

Digital Transformation, Industry 4.0, Business Process Management, Lean  
 
1. Introduction 
Nowadays, the challenge faced by organizations is centered on digitalization, which consists in the usage of new 
technologies to transform business processes, in an attempt to create significant additional value (Antonucci et al., 
2020), thus emerging a new paradigm known as Industry 4.0. The challenges promoted by this new paradigm are 
strongly related to globalization (Xu et al., 2018) and seeking solutions and mechanisms to help organizations 
surviving highly competitive environments, while improving their adaptability and responsiveness to changes in their 
market (Marques et al., 2020; Uriona Maldonado et al., 2020). 
 
However, it is not uncommon that the new technologies and trends provided by I4.0 and associated with the Digital 
Transformation (DT) might be implemented without the organization being ready to take full advantage of their 
benefits, i.e., without sufficient digital maturity to support this implementation (Machado et al., 2020). In order to 
contribute to overcoming this gap, some studies defend that these practices must be sustained by three important pillars 
- people, technologies and business processes - and must be implemented in waste-free environments, improved 
through Lean practices.

1233",,"Thus, it would be relevant to analyze this kind of approaches in environments without Lean practices to see if different 
difficulties were felt. It would also be interesting to focus more on the Human Factor as a pillar to determine the 
adequate profile of people more prepared for the Digital Transformation. 
 
Overall, the findings of this study are considered to be relevant for all organizations intending to implement I4.0 
initiatives. Therefore, it is expected that this work can be used to support other similar situations in companies that 
want to reach higher levels of maturity of Industry 4.0 and increase their standardization, through BPM and Lean 
techniques. However, the presented information cannot be entirely generalized since it is a single practical study.

Abstract  
 
New Smart Warning System (SWS) that use to send a warning level report about the machine components failure 
behavior via distance is proposed in this article. The data were collected from the experimental setup to enhance the 
maintenance strategies. The new warning system uses the collected data to build a Probability Hazard Model (PHM) 
that computes the warning level to give the decision- making team the advice about component replacement. The 
proposed system uses cloud computing technology to connect between the physical world and the remote main hub 
of SWS which receives the monitored signal to compute the warning level and warning level of the machine element. 
In this article, a novel SWS is built to reach the near-zero breaks down. Also, the system sends a warning alarm 
through E-mail to the decision-making team to follow the failure behavior of the monitored parts. In this article, the 
run to failure data of 8 identical belts is collected from an experimental setup that simulates the operation condition in 
the real factory. The proposed system gives the industrial processes the time to complete the required tasks with near-
zero breaks down. This paper presents a simulation of a new smart monitoring system by using a new methodology 
in the context of Industry 4.0.  Section building the SWS illustrates the schematics of the proposed system. Finally, 
current and future smart monitoring systems in Industry 4.0 are discussed.

1247","In our study, part(1) is the belt drive vibration signal data sets that were sent to the Cloud file in the Dropbox  
application via part (2) as infrastructure as a service (IaaS). That is the gateway used to send and receive the signals 
and the generated warning level from the cyber-physical center via the internet as an email to the decision-making 
team to give a clear view about the failure probability of the monitored belt drive. The function of Cloud  
computing is to be the bridge between the monitored machine part and the cyber-physical SWS and between the SWS 
and the decision-making team. It supports communication protocols like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. For this case study, we 
used a Wi-Fi gateway. The benefits of using this gateway are: high scalability, lower costs, reduced telecommunication 
cost, and mitigate risks. The built governing code runs every certain time to analyze the received data and compute 
the warning level of the monitored component. For this case study, the software works every 100 seconds, and the 
period can be adjusted according to the application. In our case study, the failure probability automatically sends an 
alarm report by secured E-mail to the decision-making team. The generated decision is sent back to the machine 
controller via the gateway carrier. The historical data is then stored in the Dropbox file to improve the offline governor 
patterns generation accuracy. The generated report, which is sent to the decision-making team, is provided with a 
better understandable failure probability as a result of the proposed methodology. The proposed system limitation, is 
the dependence on the internet service that make the communication as a heart of the system, the delaying due to data 
transfer decrease the SWS possibility of the real-time, continuous monitoring of the vibration signal of the rotating 
machine components that can cause a time delay and data loss due to big data. On a different note, the anti-hacking 
and security of data technologies are important in the communication field to avoid any unwanted interface. Also, the 
automatic update of the software by using the stored historical data without an unwanted offline update is an important 
limitation  
 
6. Conclusion  
In this paper, a novel smart warning system is proposed to achieve near-zero breaks down. The proposed system 
computes the failure probability of the machine part. This work transforms the traditional machine to the I 4.0 age. 
Our system is based on using the run to failure data of the machine part to build the PHM which is used to predicate 
the warning level of the part. The warning level calculation saves the machine from running without sudden breaks 
down.  
 
The wide use of belt drive pushes us to use the proposed methodology to find its governed equation that explains the 
behavior of its failure model. The proposed methodology is applied on the v-belt drive in G.U.N.T. machinery 
diagnostic system (PT 500). The study starts with the collect accelerated run to failure of eight belts. After that, we 
collect the time to failure data used to build the Cox model as shown in the modeling developing section. After that, 
we use the generated PHM to build the Smart warning system which consists of three layers as shown in the Smart 
warning system. The proposed SWS simulation is illustrated in the building SWS section. Figure (7) illustrate an 
example for the SWS results. The SWS gives the operating team a clear view about the failure behavior of the rotating 
machine parts. Also, the limitation of the proposed system is illustrated. 
 
For future research, we work on enhancing the proposed methodology to work with controllable variables such as 
rotating speed and tension force. Also, the applying of multi-machine parts monitoring is the future of the proposed 
methodology. Also, build a prototype of the proposed system will be our task to deal with the real-time complications.

Abstract 
 
Industry 4.0 paradigm calls for responsive scheduling and production control systems. Feedback loops incorporated 
to these systems allow decision making updates based on the real-time shop floor state. The bond graph approach 
enables the simulation of production control with feedback loops, but previous research with this theme is scarce. In 
the existing models, the buffers are modeled with infinite capacity, causing the effort variable to become zero and 
introducing a non-linear function that cramps the design of controllers. We propose modifications to an existing model 
in order to overcome this limitation, and simulate a 4-station shop floor as a proof of concept. With an optimal control 
approach, the rate of the material sources could be adjusted to keep the work in process at desired levels. The approach 
contributes to the literature with a model with more realistic assumption (limited buffers) and with the design of 
responsive production systems, addressing a research thread that is relevant to recent digitization trends.

Introduction 
Competitive forces have been increasingly demanding flexibility and responsiveness from services and production 
systems. Recent trends of digitization aim to meet this demand. The paradigm of Industry 4.0 implies a higher level 
of automation and connectivity to enable high customization and flexibility whilst simultaneously sustaining high 
levels of productivity and operational efficiency. More flexible and reactive control systems are based on the 
cooperation and autonomous decision of agents, which is enabled by connectivity and data analyzing capabilities 
(Derigent et al. 2020). In the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), feedback loops coming from physical processes provide 
information for carrying out control actions. Thus, systems with these feedback loops, i.e. closed-loop systems, are an 
essential element of CPS. The vertical integration of the different elements within a factory is also a relevant feature 
of a flexible/reconfigurable manufacturing system (Wang et al. 2016). This greater flexibility requires the production 
scheduling and control systems to be dynamic (for examples see (Sagawa and Nagano 2013)). The production mix 
and rates have to react to disturbances and be based on the real-time shop floor state. In this paper, we propose a 
responsive closed-loop model of a shop floor based on bond graphs. Bond graph is a modeling technique based on the

1259","6. Managerial Discussions  
From the production control perspective, the model proposed here resembles a pull-system, since it limits the WIP in 
the system. This WIP limit brings relevant benefits, highlighted in the literature (Hopp and Spearman 2004), namely: 
(1) reduced manufacturing cycle time/lead time, based on Little‚Äôs Law, i.e. a more responsive and flexible shop floor; 
(2) smoother production flow, since fewer fluctuations in WIP level lead to a more predictable output stream; (3) 
improved quality, because less WIP and smaller lots expose quality problems and allow earlier detection of errors; (4) 
reduced cost, since problems such as long set up times and uncoordinated part supplies for assembly show up in the 
form of blocking and starving of the machines and, once tackled, cost is reduced. 
 
Other contributions are highlighted as follows: 
‚Ä¢ In many production systems, buffer capacities are restricted by economic factors, products‚Äô obsolescence or 
limitations in the storage area. The proposed modification in the model allows to incorporate this restriction; 
‚Ä¢ The elimination of non-linear functions (e.g. the function min) eases the design of controllers; 
‚Ä¢ The modularity of bond graphs enables to combine the production stations and junctions to depict different 
production configurations, and the corresponding state equations can be derived from the pictorial representation; 
‚Ä¢ The model can be used to study the dynamics of production control systems such as Workload Control, which relies 
on the limitation of order release, i.e. input control. 
 
7. Conclusion 
In this paper, we modify an existing bond graph model of shop floor dynamics by defining buffers with limited 
capacity and by eliminating the source of effort that coupled buffer and machine. As advantages, the proposed model 
supports a more realistic assumption, relevant in practice, and respects the power transmission principle of the bond 
graph approach.  
 
The LQI controller implemented for WIP control was able to track the desired (non-zero) values for the buffers. This 
WIP control produces practical benefits, as already highlighted in the literature. The simulation of the model may 
provide directions to managers on how to respond to disturbances in the shop floor without an excessive cushion (since 
excessive WIP leads to long manufacturing times). The modularity of bond graphs allows modeling production 
systems with different configurations. 
 
There is a gap concerning closed-loop models for production control; the studies are even more scarce when bond 
graph models are considered. This study addresses this gap and contributes to the Industry 4.0 context with a model 
of a responsive shop floor. As future research, optimization approaches could be used to better define the parameters 
of the model (machine processing rates and buffer capacities). Also, Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) can be 
proposed using the canonical state-space model or nonlinear approaches can be implemented using the nonlinear 
model, which has not been explored in this work.

Abstract 
 
The growing competitiveness of the markets, combined with technological advances resulting from I4.0 increased the 
need for work associated with the digitization of processes, as well as the digitalization of management tools used in 
shop floor contexts. Thus, this paper reports a practical case in a Portuguese company, in which the objective was to 
create a digital continuous improvement system, which promotes data access while simplifying the current process 
existing in the company under analysis. For this purpose, Microsoft SharePoint¬Æ was used, which enabled the creation 
of a technological solution, allowing the introduction of improvement ideas, while speeding up the process of 
analyzing and validating them, using visual management mechanisms combined with notification systems. It should 
be noted that the methodology adopted was based on an iterative and incremental approach, following the principles 
of design thinking, in a collaborative environment and with the involvement of users. The results of this project point 
to the growing need for tools that already exist on the shop floor, mostly lean, to be updated from a technological 
perspective. The dynamic character that information and communication technologies give them, allows for greater 
involvement of staff, as well as more prompt decision-making.

1. Introduction  
The growing competitiveness of markets, combined with technological advances resulting from the fourth industrial 
revolution, increased the need for work associated with the digitization of processes and creation of tools at all levels 
in large companies (Telukdarie et al., 2018). Trends such as internet of things (IoT), big data (BD) and data analytics 
are completely revolutionizing the way organizations operate in terms of production automation, supply chain 
management, lean production and quality control of their products (Kristoffersen et al., 2020). These technologies 
leverage several benefits for organizations, promoting the collection and processing of data in real time and enabling 
instantaneous adjustments according to the problems detected by the systems and production needs.

Abstract  
 
When we talk about Servuccion, we refer to systems of manufacture of services of very high complexity where there 
is usually direct interaction of the client, his need and the production process through the human agent or personal 
contact, as it happens in the processes of external consultation, in which the doctor specialist patient relationship 
determines the success of the act of production of health services. Based on this premise, this work seeks to describe 
a conceptual proposal based on Lean Healthcare and Personnel Scheduling Problem criteria, which optimizes the 
assignment of shifts of medical personnel in external consultation service systems in the case of a clinic that 
manufactures health services in the specialties of allergies and respiratory diseases,  which today given the COVID 
19 pandemic, and the proliferation of other environmental vectors that generate this type of disease have taken on 
great relevance in terms of opportunity in the allocation of appointments to reduce the harmful effects on human health 
and with this generate positive impacts in terms of the opportunity of treatments.

1. Introduction  
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health is the state of physical, mental and social well-being of 
an individual or community, that is, not only the absence of infections or diseases.   The health of all peoples is a 
fundamental condition for achieving peace and security, and depends on the broadest integration and cooperation of 
individuals and the state.  Health is considered a constitutional right of the people or inhabitants of a nation so it is the 
duty of the State to guarantee its provision, for which in the case of Colombia the General Social Security System is 
developed (Gonzalez Castro, Moreno Martinez, & Castro Monsalve, 2009).  Derived from the above premise, it should 
be considered that in Colombia there is the policy of provision of health services, which was established by the 
Ministry of Health and Social Protection with the aim of establishing the strategic guidelines on which the actors that 
manufacture and offer health services in Colombia must operate and function.  The fundamental purpose of this policy 
is to guarantee access, optimize the use of resources and improve the quality of health services offered to the 
Colombian population, for which it establishes (3) three axes, as well as (Ministerio de Protecci√≥n Social, 2005): 
 
‚Ä¢ 
In the access axis, strategies for consolidating health service delivery networks, improving decision-making 
capacity in the provision of low-complexity and emergency services, and increasing insurance coverage for the 
poor and vulnerable population stand out.

5. Conclusions  
‚Ä¢ 
Outpatient services are wide and varied in the context, which allows us to establish that the problems around 
the opportunity in the assignment of appointments are common aspects in this type of services, which opens the 
possibility of replicating and validating this study and contributing to the improvement of quality levels in terms of 
health services and regaining confidence in these that they are so fundamental to the well-being of a nation. 
‚Ä¢ 
To guarantee the quality and availability of sufficient resources in outpatient services, it is necessary to 
standardize such systems through the elimination of waste and only in this way will productive, quality and profitable 
systems that guarantee the well-being of individuals in a context be guaranteed. 
‚Ä¢ 
The development of a conceptual model for the assignment of shifts to medical personnel specialized in 
outpatient services opens the possibility for future work focused on the development of technological applications that 
facilitate decision-making in these contexts and guarantee the full satisfaction of customers or users of such systems. 
‚Ä¢ 
In the case of Colombia, the health sector offers a diverse range of possibilities for improving its processes, 
so industrial engineering and operations research become strategic allies in reference issues such as process 
standardization, elimination of waste, quality management among other competences of these disciplines and that the 
health sector is requiring it with haste in the framework of innovation processes.

Abstract 
 
A medical device company had areas opportunities for improvements to production and labor utilization. The 
objectives were to increase the production by 10% to 20% and an improvement in the labor utilization of 5% to 10%. 
Some of the challenges identified included the need for standardization, reduce waste (Muda), and redundant 
operations. After performing a historical data and root cause analysis, several alternatives were recommended. The 
selected alternatives result in coils electropolishing capacity increase of 8%, coils grinding, and sandbar increase of 
12%, with a scrap reduction from 15% to 3%. In the process of passivation, the expected capacity increase is about 
3%. These improvements will allow the company to gain a competitive advantage.

1. Introduction  
With over twenty years of experience in the medical device industry as a third-party contractor, Medical Device 
Company (MDC) has produced millions of precision parts for over 100 active clients. By mid-2020, the daily 
production target in the miscellaneous department could not be reached. When evaluating their operations, it was 
observed that production processes weren‚Äôt standardized. Additionally, an analysis of non-value-added activities was 
required to achieve proposed objectives and gain much-needed production capacity. The findings will be further 
analyzed with the application of root cause analysis and based on these results, solutions to these problems will be 
recommended. To complete the project, we will review the benefits and percentage of objectives achieved.  
 
1.1 Objectives  
The project team established two objectives: 1) increase the production by 10% to 20%,  from 2,800 to 5,600 parts 
and 2) improvement in the labor utilization of 5% to 10%. Statistical analysis will show if changes made were 
statistically significant. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The literature review will focus on some background on the need of improving medical devices manufacturing 
industries, defining some medical device terms related to this project, and finally, describing the process analysis tools 
such as time studies, work-sampling, ergonomics, and standardization. As Niebel (1988) states, a business can only 
be profitable when productive, this mindset must include all business operations, including sales, finance, and all other 
non-production activities.  
  
2.1 Medical devices industry and the need for process improvement 
Despite a -3.2 percent drop in 2020, the literature suggests that the medical device sector will rise at a 4.4 percent 
compound annual growth rate in 2021, according to Kluwer (2019). Traditional business drivers, continue to be 
critical, including product quality, innovative designs, competitive price, and on-time delivery. As manufacturing 
evolves, new technical challenges become part of the equation, efforts to keep up with these advances, cannot cancel 
out the need to add value to customers (Abdullah, 2003). Quality is directly correlated to business gains in many 
companies (Elshennawy,1991). Quality improvements can also be correlated with increases in workflow and 
productivity. (Feigenbaum, 1991).

1295","Similarly, the base standard time calculated for the passivation process was 2,900 seconds, which was improved to 
2,842, for a 2% improvement. Lastly, the baseline standard time calculated for the grinding and sandbar process was 
55 seconds, which was improved to 35 seconds for a 36% reduction. The paired t-test sample is a statistical test to 
show no difference between two corresponding sets of observations (Montgomery,2011). The paired test was 
conducted to validate that there are changes in terms of time in the process. The change, in this case, was to reduce 
the duration of the task and eliminate non-value-added activities.  A statistical test was performed to compare the 
actual time means and improved meaning. The hypothesis formulated is: 
‚Ä¢ 
Ho: There isn‚Äôt a difference between actual mean and improved mean: ¬µi=¬µk 
‚Ä¢ 
H1: There is a difference between actual mean and improved mean: ¬µi‚â†¬µk  
Table 9 shows that in each process there is a time improvement, but in this case, the most significant is the passivation 
process. Since the p-value is>0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected. For the process of electropolishing and 
grinding/sandbar, there is an improvement, but the difference isn‚Äôt great, meaning even that the process was improved 
the alternatives presented didn‚Äôt achieve a greater difference in times.

6. Conclusion  
This paper demonstrates the process that using industrial engineering and process tools in the medical device industry 
can result in significant improvements to its operations. After the analysis made for the process of grinding, sandbar, 
electropolish, and passivation for the Miscellaneous Department and selecting the best alternative for each process, 
an improvement was made to each process in some like electropolish and passivation the goal of 10% for capacity 
wasn‚Äôt achieved and 5% of utilization for coil wasn‚Äôt possible. Table 10 presents an overview of the achievement of 
this project. The objectives that weren‚Äôt accomplished, were due to limitations and availability that presented in the 
course of this project, but there are opportunities identified that can be improved, such as redesign (updated) the whole 
process for coils, which involves conducting a study to determine is cost-effective and feasible to bring the entire 
production to this facility; passivation the is opportunity to reduce the time that parts are in the nitric or citric acid 
tanks, in this case, more expertise in the chemistry area is required since the materials of the parts and temperatures 
(higher or lower) can reduce the time of 30 minutes that parts are submerged in the acid.

Abstract 
  
The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a platform that allows devices to connect, discover and remotely control 
through the internet. This work aims to develop an Internet of Things-based system for an oil company's laboratory. 
It is intended to monitor its environmental conditions and parameters through air quality sensors, thus providing 
intelligent monitoring and greater certainty of working conditions. The system development utilizes ESP8266, 
Arduino UNO processor, solid-state relay, and sensors. The proposed work monitors the air quality, humidity, and 
temperature of the laboratory environment. It included an active air exhaust control system. A database has been 
created with the purpose of data analysis and access to status history. As a result of this system implementation, it 
is expected to improve laboratory management and occupational health and hygiene.

1. Introduction  
In our country, many systems are disconnected and do not share data with each other or with the cloud. One of these 
technologies that facilitate interconnection is the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things is a communication 
paradigm, which refers to the idea of connecting everyday objects to the Internet (Chen Qiang et al., 2008).  These 
objects are assembled with microcontrollers and transceivers to enable communication and are configured with 
protocols that will perform interactions between objects to achieve common goals without human intervention. This 
paradigm gains power by interacting with a variety of devices, such as: robots, drones, heating and air conditioning 
systems, security alarms, home appliances, power generation systems, office equipment, etc. These devices generate 
large amounts of data to provide people and new services provided by the public and private sectors. As the industry 
develops year after year, new management issues and management problems have emerged. This has become a real 
problem. The supervision and control of the workspace is also a major shortcoming. In addition, when the number 
of people using the space exceeds a manageable threshold, it can become tedious to coordinate the personnel 
involved in the daily activities of the laboratory. Another problem is energy management.

6. Conclusion  
Supervisors and managers in laboratories need an inexpensive, reliable, and affordable data acquisition system for 
air quality detection and monitoring. Existing data acquisition systems are based on licensed and cabled software, 
which are expensive and not easily accessible. They are either continuously connected to the network or manually 
controlled. Some wireless data acquisition systems exist, but they rely on license-based software and cloud services.  
There are very few wireless data acquisition systems using freely available software, which monitor and record 
fewer parameters at a very high cost. These problems can be eliminated using the proposed data acquisition system 
based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed data acquisition system is based on open access software and 
cloud service. This paper presents a design of a cost-effective data acquisition system to collect operational data 
from the air quality monitoring system for evaluation purposes with ubiquitous access. The test results revealed that 
the suggested data acquisition system is appropriate, reliable, cost-effective, and suitable for harsh outdoor 
conditions for monitoring and collecting operational information of the system. This system used provides a more 
affordable method for sensing and monitoring systems in the field of domestic and industrial standards to upgrade 
the IoT. The following conclusions have been drawn.  
 
‚óè 
The proposed data acquisition system provides a cost-effective method for sensing and monitoring air 
quality system for laboratory personnel.  
‚óè 
The proposed data acquisition system can be controlled (ON/OFF) by using the Wi-Fi enabled switch 
according to the requirement. In this way, we can not only save the lifetime of the sensors.

Abstract 
 
Company internationalization drives the search for competitive foreign suppliers. Therefore, this study aims to 
determine the factors that boost processed food imports for large Mexican food companies. We collected data through 
a 55-question survey applied to major large companies of Northern Mexico. The results of the multiple linear 
regression model show that international price, required quality, international availability of the product, knowledge 
of customs clearance procedures and company logistics capabilities explain 66.4% of import drivers. They also 
confirm that there exists a negative relationship in logistics capabilities. This study is unique in that it shows imports 
can provide a competitive strategy, using five key factors.

1. Introduction 
One of the most important company challenges is to develop strategies that achieve competitive advantage. Therefore, 
for company internationalization, food industry entrepreneurs, managers, buyers and importers should consider 
importing as an option and should also analyze and assess the significant factors in the import purchasing process. 
 
First, we analyze the context of processed food industry in the world, in Mexico and Nuevo Leon, to show the 
importance of this sector in the economy. Second, we review the existing theoretical models that describe import 
process factors, thereby creating a reference framework for selecting the set of factors considered to boost imports. 
Third, we present statistical results obtained by applying the quantitative measurement instrument to the selected 
population and significant variables and last, we explain the importance of this study in the discussion and conclusion 
section.  
 
In Mexico, the manufacturing industry consists of 21 subsectors important for the country‚Äôs economic growth. The 
most significant subsectors are the food industry, the beverage and tobacco industry, and the manufacturing of 
machinery and equipment industry, among others. The food industry is particularly relevant to this nation, since it 
represents just over 35% of manufacturing companies nationally (DENUE , 2017) and because it contributed 22.7% 
of the manufacturing Gross Domestic Product in Mexico in 2016 (INEGI, 2018). Food production is classified as both 
manufactured and unmanufactured industry and in this study manufactured foods are considered exclusively for 
human consumption and understood as ‚Äúsubject to an alteration of the original state with respect to their components, 
easy to consume and keep in containers‚Äù (Secretariat of Public Education-Secretariat of Health, 2014, p. 88). 
 
The production of processed food worldwide was 5.069 billion dollars in 2015 and the following three countries 
produce almost 50% of the global total (ProM√©xico, 2015): China with a 28.9% share, United States with 16.1% and 
Japan with 4.7%. The major processed food importing countries in 2015 are the United States (11% share), Germany 
(7.2%) and China (6.1%). Thus, the following companies stand out worldwide: Pepsico, General Mills, Mondelez 
International, Mars, Kellogg‚Äôs, Kraft foods, Unilever, Associated British Foods PLC, Nestl√© and Danone (Hess, 2014;

5. Conclusion 
This explanatory framework emphasized the global economic importance of the processed food industry in Mexico 
and the State of Nuevo Leon, regarding production, consumption and imports and it also emphasized the importance 
of food safety. This industry is particularly important since companies strive to continuously improve the supply of 
processed food either domestically or internationally, mostly for two reasons. Firstly, they intend to keep production 
lines supplied in order to meet the market‚Äôs food demand. Secondly, they aim to achieve a competitive advantage 
through product differentiation. Using the theoretical analyses performed, we selected the factors considered to drive 
imports and the results show that the international price of the product, the required quality of the product, the 
international availability of the product, knowledge of customs clearance procedures and the company‚Äôs logistics 
capabilities explain the 66.4% variation in the drive to imports. 
 
Therefore, based on these findings that show the significant variables in accordance with the literature analyzed, in 
this section we propose strategies that will help Mexican large food companies increase their imports and become 
more competitive. In this sense, we will briefly discuss the results of each of the proposed variables or factors. First, 
the product international price has always been a key element in international purchasing, generally assessed along 
with other factors that help the entrepreneur make a purchase decision. In this regard, companies analyze the prices of 
those products that meet the requirements agreed with the foreign supplier from the start and enable them to have 
competitive prices in the domestic market. Thus, the company‚Äôs ability to negotiate the price in international trade 
transactions confers it another advantage related to imports. However, we should not forget the Dumping issue where 
several countries practice price discrimination by subsidies granted to particular industries, or companies that sell at 
less than normal value, engaging in unfair foreign trade practices regulated by Article 28 of the Foreign Trade Law 
(Laguna, C.E., 2002).  
 
Furthermore, the product required quality is a variable that allows companies to produce unique foods in order to 
compete in the marketplace. Companies report that they would import products at the required quality even if at a 
higher cost than those found in Mexico. Thus, importers that pursue strategies to enhance their competitiveness may 
consider importing as a means to purchase, produce and sell quality processed foods. Besides, providing quality 
products entails product differentiation, since these products may have a specific quality, and as they are products or 
raw materials sometimes only available abroad, these companies may manufacture products difficult for competitors 
to imitate. Thereby, they ensure that they will keep up with consumer preferences for longer. 
 
The information gathered from these 2 variables shows that companies should identify the strategy they will use to 
compete in the domestic or international marketplace, whether they will maintain their leadership position by low 
prices or by quality products, as this will determine the significance assigned to each factor upon making an import 
purchase decision. 
 
Another significant variable was the product international availability that respondents consider important since food 
companies use it as a resource to access new supply sources without disregarding the supplier‚Äôs commitment toward 
timely delivery of processed foods. A low level of product availability may impact on sales results, but a company 
that counts on a product almost exclusively available may monopolize the niche market and get ahead of the 
competition.Furthermore, respondents consider the knowledge of customs clearance procedures to be particularly 
relevant since experience is required to achieve more flexible food imports with less extra costs, as confirmed by 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

1319","Saleh, Ali and Julian (2014). This variable shows that companies should train employees and seek proper advice from 
import logistics providers, thereby creating synergistic communication with employees and ensuring operational 
efficiency. 
 
The last significant variable, the importing company‚Äôs logistics capabilities had a negative relationship. This is an 
important finding showing that a reduction in direct import logistics activities entails an increase in company‚Äôs 
imports. The large companies surveyed explained that they achieve greater advantages, cost savings and faster imports 
when logistics services are partially or totally provided by expert third companies. Thus, companies should adapt their 
logistics strategy in order to boost their imports. 
 
As regards the trust toward international suppliers, we found that is not statistically significant for large companies 
due to several factors. First, companies mostly import products from the United States, due to geographic proximity, 
and given their regular business operations, companies are accustomed to dealing with these suppliers and do not 
assign any importance to this factor. Second, as they are large companies, they usually depend on the intra-firm supply 
or international suppliers approved by the parent company‚Äôs supply policies, and thus suppose that trust has no 
inference in the import process, being already validated by the parent company.

Abstract 
 
This article analyzes the factors that generate low productivity in the sugar cane juice extraction area of a sugar mill 
in northern Peru. It focuses on determining how the production process is being carried out and the time wastes that 
generate economic losses. The objective is to determine the overall efficiency of the equipment and apply 
improvement strategies to increase the availability, efficiency and quality of the process. The company is currently 
grinding an average of 3603 tons of cane per day, but its installed capacity is approximately 4800 tons of cane per 
day. The cane juice extraction area is the starting point for the sugar plant to achieve the best yields within its 
manufacturing process. The strategies applied in the cane juice extraction area allowed increase the sugar production.  
 
Keywords  
Productivity, availability, efficiency, quality, production. 
 
1. Introduction 
The juice extraction area is responsible for preparing the cane for milling, but there are always stops during the process. 
These stoppages are due to a lack of cane for milling and lost time in the extraction process, such as derailments in 
the feeder table, failures in the conductors and in the chains that feed the cane to the conductors. There are also 
problems in the transmission belts. The shredders have hammers that help break up the cane; these hammers also 
suffer damage when a metal piece passes through the cane or when stones are present. The mills also break down 
when metal debris is inserted into the extraction grooves, causing the mills to shift off-center and causing stoppages. 
Even with these failures and stoppages, the company only applies corrective maintenance and stops the entire process. 
All these failures and breakdowns reduce extraction efficiency or productivity. The sugar cane juice extraction area 
has a production capacity of 4800 tons. The extraction system has an extraction mill consisting of a tandem of 7 mills 
(the 5th mill is currently cancelled). Each mill is driven by a variable speed DC motor. The design speed of the mills 
is 54 ft/minute. The extracted juice is sent to the elaboration area following the sugar elaboration process, the by-
product bagasse is obtained and used in the power plant to generate steam and electricity for the agro-industrial plant.

1322","In the three months the accumulated failure hours in the cane transport is 57.41 hours and in the rest of the machinery 
is 93.97 hours. Consider that we are only taking into account the failures of the main equipment and based on this, 
implement improvement strategies. 
 
The first action was to select qualified personnel to operate the machinery and equipment. Then the selected personnel 
were trained in the 5's methodology, machinery operation and maintenance.  
 
Maintenance training was carried out with personnel specialized not only in technical-operational aspects but also in 
promoting teamwork and multidisciplinary work (Foon; Terziovski; 2014). As a result, multidisciplinary work made 
it possible to star solving and eliminate the root causes of the most representative failures in the process. In that sense, 
technical training, teamwork, motivational workshops and the use of 5¬¥S as a basic lean manufacturing tool increase 
productivity related to an improvement of the levels of the OEE. With the improvement objectives focused on the area 
with the longest downtime, the OEE value has been increased by up to 85% (Table 1).

Abstract 
 
The use of bicycles has increased 221% since March 2020, creating a positive outlook in the adoption of 
bicycles as a sustainable means of transportation. The use of bicycles represents a direct impact on 
environmental management. Likewise, it is important to mention that the impact of the bicycle is 
conditioned to the physical capacity of the cyclist and the ability to provide the energetic effort required to 
reach the destination. Therefore, technological developments have allowed the creation of different 
proposals of models that fit according to the needs of users presented above, creating a positive outlook in 
the introduction of electric bicycles within the framework of citizen mobility. Two commercial electric 
bicycles, one with a front wheel and one with a rear wheel, were evaluated to compare the energy 
consumption in different static and dynamic conditions. The energy consumption was similar for all 
conditions except for the conditions where there was traffic and inclination, the bicycle with front wheel 
had the lowest energy consumption due to traction system. Additionally, the design of a BLCD type electric 
wheel-motor is proposed. It was found that the energy performance of the bicycle with the front wheel is 
15% lower when developing circuits with traffic compared to bicycles with rear wheel. When comparing 
the bicycles in other circuits, no significant difference in energy performance was found. As further work 
remains to evaluate these same characteristics with the motor-wheel designed in this work.

Abstract 
 
Growing demands for globalization, integration, consistency, innovation and efficiency alongside digital technological 
developments have drastically increase the interest in business processes. In this field, Business Process Management 
(BPM) emerged as a tool to facilitate the standardization in digital transformation methods, as it helps to clarify new 
processes and, consequently, to propose technology-based solutions. In this paper, a conceptual framework on 
business process management that culminated in the development of a digital tool to support digital transformation in 
an industry-specific context is presented. The proposed solution contributed to an increase in processes‚Äô 
standardization, monitoring and interconnection, making processes more efficient and with high levels of 
communication, performance and transparency.

1. Introduction 
In recent decades, the industry has undergone changes at all levels of action. New processes and product technologies 
emerged, management methodologies were reinvented, customer expectations and needs were modified and the 
quality and quantity of suppliers in the market increased (Ahuja et al., 2006). In addition, the global market has become 
highly competitive and getting the right product, at the right price and at the right time is not only the basis for 
competitive success, but also a necessity for survival (Aitken et al., 2002). This forced organizations to analyze their 
processes (internal and external) to detect problems, waste and activities that do not add value.  
 
In order to improve their processes, organizations have found the need to move towards a digital transformation 
through the implementation of new innovative business models, optimizing operations and applying digital 
technologies such as cloud, social media, embedded devices, mobile, analytics and Internet of Things (Brown & 
Brown, 2019; Dumas et al., 2012; Scholz et al., 2018; Von Rosing & Etzel, 2020).

4. Conclusion 
This paper has presented a conceptual framework on business process management that culminated in the development 
and implementation of a digital tool to support the organization‚Äôs transition from a traditional to a digital mode of 
operation.  
 
The study focused on the problem caused by the vast amount of data stored in various documents without any specific 
organization or easy access. The proposed solution has the capacity of analyzing data and increases the amount of 
available information. It was developed in Power Apps, a low-code Microsoft software, and involved the use of other 
support software, such as SharePoint, Power BI and Outlook. 
 
The use of the UML notation was essential for the development of the system, helping to present the tool specification 
from different functional points of view. Complementing the UML notation with the BPMN notation, it was also 
possible to map different information flows, which contain the identification of the actors involved in the process, 
their responsibilities and, in certain cases, the different steps to be followed, which can serve to ensure the 
sustainability of the tool.  
 
During the development of the project, BPM was a critical tool since it facilitated the understanding of the system 
and, therefore, leveraged a successful digital transformation. 
 
There are several positive results arising from the implementation of this digital tool, among which the improvement 
of information management, which is now centralized and formally structured, the creation of new key performance 
indicators (KPIs) and the increase in employees‚Äô satisfaction. The centralization of data that was previously recorded 
in different places and in different formats allowed to improve, not only access to information, but also its quality, the 
crossing of data and the speed of communication between different actors. Analyzing the consequences of the 
implementation of the information system in a broader scope, it is clear that the correct use of information systems is 
essential for an organization to remain competitive, efficient and in continuous improvement of its processes. 
As future work, it would be interesting to develop the application in a mobile phone format and to add new features 
with the aim of continuing to facilitate the access to and the understanding of quality and pertinent information by 
users.

Abstract  
 
Nowadays, markets are characterized by their complexity and unpredictability forcing organizations to adapt quickly 
to enhance their processes and achieve competitive advantage. To achieve these goals, the knowledge from each 
employee is fundamental because they know the process better than anyone. Thus, convert individual knowledge into 
collective knowledge is considered a key strategic resource for organizations to obtain long-term sustainable 
advantage, making evident the importance of investment in Knowledge Management (KM). Although companies are 
increasingly able to compete based on their ability to effectively manage knowledge, there are still several challenges 
in this area, particularly in the ability to capture the knowledge present in the employee's minds (tacit knowledge) 
incorporating it into an effective and efficient management system that enables the retention and transmission of core 
knowledge in a long-term period. This paper presents the results of a practical experience in a multinational company 
implementing a KM solution to identify, capture and transmit knowledge. Based on the best experience practices and 
on the SECI Model developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi, a new Model for Identifying, Capturing, and Transmitting 
Knowledge was developed and proposed. In general, the results indicate an improvement in the preparation of those 
responsible for conducting this type of work, an increase in the efficiency of knowledge capture and transmission, as 
well a positive involvement of employees in the organization's knowledge management culture. It is expected that 
these results can contribute as a tool to support other initiates in this area by organizations wishing to implement KM 
initiatives.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, markets are characterized by their complexity and unpredictability forcing organizations to adapt quickly 
to enhance their processes and achieve competitive advantage (Jakelja & Brugger, 2019). Organization‚Äôs ability to 
become and remain competitive is closely related to their internal capacity to optimize their processes and 
consequently reduce waste (Paschek et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2021). However, not all the wastes are easily quantifiable 
and tangible. Gay (2016) defines the eighth lean wastes as not specific to a production process and therefore, liable to 
be classified as intangible. This element of intangibility is known as employee talent and is considered a waste when 
organizations do not ensure its full usage to its benefit it. The employee‚Äôs talent is often related to their ideas and 
agility to perform certain tasks, however it is the knowledge they possess that enables them of such characteristics and 
make them elements of extreme importance for organizations (Gay, 2016). This knowledge emerges from the daily 
acts that an individual performs, being, therefore, a core resource for organizations to optimize processes, reduce

6. Conclusion and Future Work 
The success of KM in organizations involves sustaining initiatives and methodologies aligned with their objectives, 
being flexible to current and future needs, as well as subject periodic evaluations of the results obtained (Mohanjan, 
2019). This paper suggests a new agile methodology for identifying, capturing, and transmitting knowledge that could 
be adapted to organization‚Äôs objectives through detailed methods and tools. From the methods proposed, we highlight 
the initial steps in the preparation of those responsible for this type of initiative, which are sometimes undervalued 
factors for the efficiency and quality of the final work. It should be noted that this preparation allowed to finish the 
capture phase 2 days before the initial plan. Furthermore, the identification and capture of knowledge based on 5 steps 
allow researchers to understand the big picture (macro processes) and, subsequently, to intensify efforts at the 
individual level (micro-processes) increasing the ability to identify and capture relevant knowledge. 
   
The conversion of tacit knowledge into knowledge that is easily understood by the target audience in words is one of 
the main challenges for any researcher in this type of KM initiative, given the complexity, individuality, and 
sometimes interculturality associated with this type of knowledge. With this study, it was concluded that the 
documentation by macro processes of the data, information, and knowledge captured with a simplified structure based 
on processes descriptions, objectives, and critical points optimize and speed up the task because the researcher focus 
centers on the most important: ""What is the Process?, What is it used for?; How it works? and What are the variables 
that influence its performance?‚Äù. Furthermore, the simplification of language and the use of short sentences and 
illustrative images/schemas are guidelines that contribute to the clarity desired in knowledge manuals/repositories. 
The model presented also contributes to mitigating some of KM barriers indicated in the literature, particularly with 
the possibility of encouraging the dissemination of KM culture as a ‚Äúno extra load‚Äù for employees through diversified 
capture and validation plans, the possibility of reducing costs with travels to increase documents veracity and 
robustness, and the development of dynamic and interactive training based on the employee‚Äôs real needs.  
 
Finally, this paper highlights the possibility of adapting the SECI Model as a model for the creation and conversion 
of tacit and explicit knowledge in an industrial context different from the Japanese. However, to address some 
limitations to leverage future work it is relevant to mention that the model was implemented in an industrial context 
of an organization where the KM culture is present. So, in the future, it would be interesting to measure its impact in

Abstract 
 
Reverse spherification is a process of molecular gastronomy in which science to culinary practice is applied. In 
many of the high level gastronomy restaurants that count with Michelin stars is a current challenge to improve 
this process. Reverse spherification consists in the use of two liquid substances with specific concentrations and 
temperatures so that solid exterior layer and liquid interior food spheres can be made. One of these substances 
must be abundant in calcium while the other substance must be a gelling agent as sodium alginate. Having these 
two substances what has to be done next is to pour the gelling agent in the abundant in calcium substance so 
that spheres can be formed. After a few minutes, these have to immersed in water for the excess gelling agent 
to be removed. One of the mayor problems with this method is to achieve an specific consistency in the outer 
layer and interior of the spheres. The outer layer has to have a certain hardness able to store food and certain 
softness able to break when consumed. The food must remain liquid so that it can‚Äôt be mixed with the gelling 
material which is not pretended to be consumed. Nowadays, the reverse spherification process is patented, 
however there is no patent that indicates the exact quantities neither of calcium chloride or sodium alginate. All 
of them mention quantity ranges that makes this method a process of prove and error. In our work we look 
further to stablish precise and optimum quantities and temperatures to make of reverse spherification a 
standardized process.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this work is to develop a process that improves Hypalon abrasion resistance. This compound 
is mainly used in automotive industry for the making of pinch valves and rubber sleeves, as well as in steel 
industry for the making of steel rollers. Nowadays the wastage of this product is 100 mg of lost material per 
second and is pretended to reach 50 mg. Hypalon is long aging synthetic rubber with strong resistance to 
hydrocarbon solvents and temperatures between -95¬∞F and 284¬∞F. Finally, it presents good resistance to flame 
and is self-extinguishing. The experimentation consists in the measurement of various characteristics including 
abrasion resistance, its deterioration to the exposure to diverse chemicals and the maximum temperatures it can

Abstract 
 
The objective of the present work is to offer to the wine industry production methods of wine with frozen grape 
that has the same characteristics as produced wine with defrost grapes. The grape that is harvested in the grape 
harvest is not completely used due to the process plant incapacity. This can lead to several economic lost hence 
we propose to freeze the unused grape. Subsequently, it is defrost to be fermented and variables are adjusted to 
even its original properties so that shrinkage costs can be reduced in the fabrication process. A comparative 
study between traditionally produced wines and frozen grape wines will be made. These grapes are specifically 
of mexican production. During the experimentation variables as temperature, pH, sugar content and alcohol 
degree will be measured. Mentioned measurements will be made in two different wine productions to make 
comparisons so that the wine produced in both processes have the desired characteristics.

Abstract 
 
Multi U-V Layer Magnet of Permanent Magnet Assistant Synchronous Motor (PMa-SynRM) has been 
implemented for electric vehicle applications due to their high torque and output power. There is a research of 
permanent arrangement of IPM and PMa-SyRM in V-U-‚àá "" Inversive delta"". However, multi-layered U and V 
structures have several advantages such as easy assembly and robustic structure it can avoid to be damaged or 
deformed by centrifugal forces of permanent magnets. The four-layered U-V magnet PMA-SYNRM machine has 
been investigated because they are enough space for optimal magnet arrangement. Moreover, the total harmonic 
distortion of air-gap density and back EMF can be adjusted by the changing angle of V magnet layers. Finally, an 
PMA-SYNRM machine with U layered magnets rotor is prototyped to verify the analysis.

Introduction  
The performance of PMA-SYNRM machines is significantly affected by the magnet rotor topologies. Many multi-
layered magnet layers rotor topologies have been reported in the literature for EV application in Hyunwoo Kim 
2020. The multi-layered PMA-SYNRM machine with double V and V-I shapes is proposed for EV applications 
in Cheng Gong 2021. A multi-layered PMA-SYNRM machine with 2V and VI shapes is proposed for EV 
applications T. Huynh 2017. Five rotor design topologies for an interior permanent-magnet machine for a hybrid 
electric vehicle have been analyzed in Shushu Zhu 2020 but the double V and VI flat are potential candidates, and 
they are suitable design for punching mud when manufacturer will carry out mass production. The interior 
permanent-magnet motor (PMA-SYNRM) is selected for EVs because they have torque and power densities in 
very high speed. However, there is a high magnitude of back emf due to the strong permanent magnets and high 
speed which is higher the DC link voltage. It is difficult to keep constant torque in overall speed. Therefore, the 
winding configuration and magnet design is important to get the desired characteristics. Different 4U and 4V type 
of magnet configuration were used for PMa-interior permanent magnet design. In this paper, the back EMF 
waveform are verified and compared. The torque harmonics have been compared with different topologies. Finally, 
an PMA-SYNRM machine with 4 layered U and V magnet rotor is verified finite-element analysis (FEA). 
 
1a) Pma-Synrm ROTOR STRUCTURE 
The proposal PMa-SynRM is designed based on an existing PMA-SYNRM with 100 kW peak power at 6000 rpm, 
as shown in Fig. 1. with 8 poles, 48 slots, and PM in delta arrangement. However, the target SynRM was designed 
with four flux barriers per pole to minimize torque ripple, maximize reluctance torque. The main specifications of 
the original SynRM (without PMs) is shown in Table 1.

1359","The peak torque and power versus speed characteristics of VI shape PMA-SYNRM machine have been verified at 
12000 rpm. With the increase of phase current density up to 14 A/mm2, the peak torque and power are 245 Nm 
and 152 kW. The torque and power performance of designed PM machine shows that, when the speed is less than 
4500 rpm, the PM machine works on the region of constant torque. Also, the output power reduces greatly at 8000 
rpm when the terminal voltage is given as a constant value of 375V. It can be concluded that the designed PM 
machine is operating under poor flux-weakening performance.  Maximum torque and power performance of 
designed PMa-SyRM vs speed up to 15000 rpm are 350N.m and 150kW with 375VDC/210A (11A/mm2). 
Maximum efficiency loop is 98%.  Total losses of iron cores, copper windings have been applied to thermal 
simulation and temperature results as figure 6. 
 
 
Figure 6. Temperature values of PMa-SynRM 4U 
Temperature distribution of stator, rotor, winding and magnet were calculated in figure 6. Maximum temperatue 
of winding is 123oC lower than isolation class H (1800). It is acceptable. 
 
4.Conclusions 
This paper has analyzed and compared the electromagnetic performance of three multi-layered PMA-SYNRM 
machines for EV applications. The four-layered rotor structure with U shape has the lowest volume of magnets 
due to closer to airgap and high torque and power density. The 4U- PMA-SYNRM machine has the lower torque 
ripple and core loss because the harmonics of air-gap density are reduced by the increase of magnet layers. To 
verify the proposed design, a detail design of a 3-phase 48-slot and 8-pole hybrid rotor PM machine is established 
and verified torque, power, and efficiency performances. Harmonic orders of the back EMF have been analyzed 
based on the FEA modeling.  Thermal simulation was implemented to validate overheat capacity.

1. Introduction 
Remote Radio Unit-RRU 5G Heatsink systems are using natural convection cooling due to some outstanding 
advantages such as low cost, high reliability, noiseless operation, and hard environment operation in S. Shinjo, 
K 2017. However, some main disadvantages such as a relatively low heat transfer and low heat dissipation 
density are to be solved by optimal heat sink fin design. The RRU 5G -8T8R, 16T16R, 32T32R, and 64T64R 
normally have big losses, sizes, volumes, and complexities. Thermal management cannot be neglected due to 
the reduced feature size and the increased power levels in J. Curtis 2013 The total power of PFGA ICs in RRU 
5G is from 800W to 1000W, most of the input power will be converted to heating losses S. Chen 2016. Total 
heat losses of RRU 4G FPGA and PA is about from 240W to 300W based on operation modes. In order to 
control the overheat temperature of PA transistors and ICs, a heat pipe and vapor chamber is designed to 
dissipate the heat loss to air in different cases to avoid overheating. This paper describes an optimal heatsink fin 
profile design with V shape angle to maximize natural cooling for Active Antenna Unit-RRU 5G. The RRU 5G 
cooling system is composed vapor chamber and heat plate passive cooling system. Temperature measurement 
results were carried out to validate the industrial lab experiment.  This paper also shows an optimal calculation 
of RRU 5G  housing heatsink fin to minimize manufacturing and material cost of RRU Housing. 
 
2. Thermal simulation  
The 3D model and material parameters have been designed to determine the temperature distribution of the 
RRU heatsink in figure 1. The hotspot is located in the center of heat sources. The maximum temperature must 
be lower than the temperature limit of IC PA transistor, modeling steps is shown in Figure 1.

Abstract   
  
This work provides a physical simulation scheme for a camless engine. The system is composed by a four stroke spark 
ignited cylinders and a hydraulic system which control the position of the intake/exhaust valve. The main purpose of 
the work is to provide a tool to analyze the mechanical behavior of the engine components and the directional valves 
and double acting cylinders in charge of the opening of the intake/exhaust valves as well as the control algorithm. The 
simulation is useful to define the dimension of the hydraulic system parameters depending on the mechanical 
characteristics of the engine.

1. Introduction   
Automotive industry is important in a worldwide economic context. Currently, the demands on the automotive industry 
to keep fuel consumption low and emissions regulations constantly updated have caused this sector to be in constant 
search of alternative solutions to maintain its competition in the market. The growth of the production of hybrid and 
electric vehicles in recent years is noticeable, but currently the internal combustion (IC) engine is still the predominant 
mechanical power source for commercial vehicles. Moreover, it is important to analyze the entire production chain to 
reach the conclusion that such development is not enough, since the production of both of alternative vehicles as well 
as the electrical energy they consume depends on processes with highly polluting emissions, [IEA, 2020].  
  
In an effort to hold the arising constraints related with emissions of vehicles, the increasing price of fuel and the 
alternative energy comp, producers are continuously developing technology advances to improve the performance of 
IC engines. For instance, the carburetor has been replaced to fuel injection technology in order to give control to the 
fuel distribution and to optimize the engine operation to different load and speed conditions, [Gillella and Sun, 2011].  
  
Air management plays an important role in the improvement of fuel consumption and control of emissions of an IC 
engine. The conventional intake/exhaust valve actuation is made by means the camshaft which is connected directly 
to the crankshaft. Despite of being a simple and reliable mechanism, it does not offer flexibility in its operation, 
[Heywood, 2018].  
  
Variable Valve Actuation (VVA) can be realized based on camshaft modifications allowing improvements on the 
performance and efficiency of the IC engines by means of the variation of the valve lifting, duration, time of operation 
or a combination, [Gillella et al., 2014]. In [Jankovic and Magner, 2002], a review on the modeling and control 
algorithms for Variable Cam Timing (VCT) is provided.  
   
Different VVA techniques such as Variable Valve Timing (VVT), Variable Valve Duration (VVD) and Variable Valve 
Lift (VVL) with their actuation variations are studied in [Lou and Zhu, 2020]. Improvements to the VVT techniques 
are analyzed in [Ganbold et al., 2010], a multi-parametric model predictive control for VVT‚Äôs is proposed in [Lee and 
Chang, 2017]. In [Pournazeri et al., 2018], a VVA technique based on genetic algorithms is proposed to improve the 
energetic efficiency of a IC engine. However, all the improvements mentioned before have a limited flexibility since 
they are constrained by the camshaft position.

Conclusion  
A useful tool to simulate and analysis of the mechanical response of IC camless engines. The open-loop simulation 
provides an activation of the hydraulic actuation system based on the current position of the crankshaft. The main 
variables of the engine and the hydraulic system are presented in the work but the simulation is able to give 
information of a wider set of variables (volumetric flow, flow velocity, valve velocity, etc.). Moreover, the effects of 
changes on the dimension of component of the hydraulic actuation system or parameters of the IC engine can be 
analyzed by means of the simulation.  
  
Future work on the topic can be to include the thermodynamic behavior in the combustion chamber for its analysis. 
Also, the use of closed-loop control strategies dedicated to obtain an improved performance and efficiency of the 
engine can be studied by means of the proposed simulation. Cylinder de-activation schemes can be simulated to 
improve the fuel consumption when the engine is working on different conditions, [Corno et al., 2019], [Strange and 
Chen, 2020].

Abstract 
 
An increasingly common practice among retailers is the creation of their own brands. The so-called private labels 
allow them to compete on price to attract new customers. The goal is to offer a quality similar to that of the 
traditional brands but at a lower price range. In this research, clustering algorithms based on machine learning 
techniques are applied to carry out a behavioral customer segmentation for private labels. 
The research has been completed in four stages: analysis, design, development, and discussion. During the analysis, 
1.073 customer loyalty surveys are preprocessed and analyzed. During the design, 23 questions are selected to 
design experiments. The clustering algorithms used in the investigation are Simple K-Means Algorithm (SKMA) 
and Expectation-Maximization Clustering (EMC).  
Experimental results reveal clear differences in the performance of the selected algorithms. For example, when 4 
clusters are predefined, SKMA distributes the instances according to the following proportions: 43%, 26%, 15%, 
and 15%. EMC, instead, distributes the instances in 18%, 23%, 31%, and 29%. 
In conclusion, the results show that both algorithms, SKMA and EMC, are effective and useful to segment 
customers based on their preferences. However, the peculiarities of their clustering strategies gives rise to 
significantly different clusters.

1. Introduction 
As a result of the recent coronavirus crisis has accelerated the digital transformation in many companies making 
business environment more complex than ever before. The incorporation of new technologies and process 
digitization has increased the competitiveness in every aspect and across different industries. Nowadays, knowing 
and understanding customers has become crucial to survive in this new post-pandemic era. The first step to build a 
successful relationship with customers is characterizing them according to specific criteria. Thus, by means of 
gathering basic information about them it would be possible to develop marketing strategies that are more focused 
and personalized, and consequently, more effective. Currently, there are informatics tools and algorithms that can be 
used to accomplished the customer characterization. 
According to Kotler (2001), companies must identify the most attractive market segments to design and carry out 
effective marketing campaigns. They also have to consider that customers have specific needs, desires, attitudes, 
purchasing power and practices. Kotler (2001) states that market segments can be discovered by means of analyzing 
the attribute hierarchy that consumers employ when choosing a given brand. 
An appropriate segmentation might lead to the right customers for the company. In other words, those ones that can 
help produce more profit. Focusing on profitable customers is an effective manner to optimize the resources 
allocated for attracting, retaining, and regaining customers (Khajvand et al., 2011). In particular, behavioral

6. Conclusion 
Different from demographic segmentation where differences between groups or clusters are evident, behavioral 
segmentation demands a more extensive analysis to characterize the difference between market segments. This 
investigation is based on an extensive supermarket customer survey carried out in Temuco (Chile) to establish a 
market segmentation using the well-known SKMA and EMC clustering algorithms. 
Clustering algorithms are widely used to identify pattern and classify unlabeled data by means of grouping similar 
data points in clusters that shares some degree of similarity.  
Both SKMA and EMC are iterative optimization methods to cluster data points. Depending on the needs and the 
number of iteration is possible to determine the optimal number of clusters. Although it might not be the most 
practical approach, especially when the number of clusters is too big. In this research the optimal number was found 
to be 12 clusters, from which only 4 concentrates mora than 10% of the data points. Instead of that, a fixed number 
of clusters, from K=2 to K=4, was analyzed. In the case of four clusters. While SKMA cluster sizes are 43%, 26%, 
15%, and 15%., EMC cluster sizes are 218%, 23%, 31%, and 29%. 
An additional analysis was carried out to determine whether the question of each domain had an influence on the 
cluster scheme. The difference in the sizes of the resulting clusters confirms that the segmentation depends 
significantly on the nature of the questions taken into consideration. 
In conclusion, both clustering algorithms SKMA and EMC can help segmenting customers based on their behavior 
and preferences towards private labels. However, behavioral segmentation requires an additional work to 
characterize properly the found segments.

Abstract 
 
Clustering is a machine learning technique to analyze data and to discover groups that share some similarities or 
closeness. It is useful for marketing segmentations because it allows classifying customers into groups based on 
certain characteristics. In literature, the most commonly studies segmentation types are: geographic, demographic, 
psychographic, behavioristic, volume, product-space, and benefit segmentation. This research is focused on 
behavioristic segmentations for supermarket chains. 
Behavior patterns are the core of the behavioristic segmentation. It considers customers‚Äô attitude toward brands, the 
knowledge of brands, purchasing habits and frequency. The segmentation related to loyalty is crucial to identify 
loyal customers and to focus marketing strategies and tactics. The revenue depends greatly on that segment. 
The research has been carried in four stages: analysis, design, development, and discussion. During the analysis, 
1.073 customer loyalty surveys are preprocessed and analyzed. Two algorithms are employed during the 
investigation: Simple K-Means Algorithm (SKMA) and Expectation-Maximization Clustering (EMC). 
While SKMA cluster sizes are 27%, 15%, 15%, 26%, and 17%, EMC cluster sizes are 2%, 29%, 24%, 32%, and 
13%. In conclusion, both SKMA and EMC help segmenting supermarket customers based on their behavior. 
However, behavioral segmentation requires a deeper analysis since the cluster boundaries are not evident.

1. Introduction 
Market segmentation is one of the most relevant part of the marketing strategy. It was first introduced by W. Smith 
in 1056 and it has been deeply analyzed ever since. The objective of segmentation is to find a set of variable which 
allow identify homogeneous groups within a heterogeneous market to help focus the marketing strategies and 
tactics. To accomplish it, a variety of models and techniques have been developed and used thru the years, from 
simple statistical models to algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Mckechnie, 2006). Nowadays, the 
availability of new technologies makes possible to access customer data to be analyzed quickly.  In the retail 
industry, for example, point of sales (POS) already allow apply data mining techniques and AI models. 
Customer segmentation can be carried out following different criteria. For instance, it can be based on  
demographics (age, sex, income, occupation, social class, stage of life, Internet access and use), geographical 
(country, region, city, rural, density), behavioral (frequency of purchase, loyalty, where you buy, quantity 
purchased), purchase occasion (routine, special, hours or days of purchase, fixed place or while traveling), 
psychographic (lifestyle, personality, needs, values, attitudes, motivations), benefits (comfort, quality, economy, 
ease, speed, etc.), beliefs and attitudes (towards brands, products, purchase channels) (Tynan and Drayton, 1987; 
Rayport, 2001; Wyner, 2002; Kotler et al., 2009; Villarreal, R., 2014).

6. Conclusion 
Behavioral segmentation, different from other types, is not so evident and usually requires a deeper analysis to 
establish the difference between segments. This investigation takes advantage of an extensive supermarket customer 
survey to outline a segmentation based on the well-known SKMA and EMC clustering algorithms. 
Clustering algorithms are a special case type of machine learning algorithms used to classified unlabeled data by 
means of grouping data points having similarities or some degree of closeness with each other. 
Both SKMA and EMC are iterative optimization methods. Depending on the circumstances and necessities it might 
be possible to find the optimal number of clusters or define a given number that is more practical. Experiments 
revealed that the optimal number of clusters for the dataset is 16. However, only between 2 and 4 clusters 
concentrates more than 10% of the data points. A collection of small clusters or market segments might complicate 
excessively the design of an effective marketing campaign. Instead of that, a fixed number of clusters, from K=2 to 
K=5, was analyzed. In the case of five clusters, while SKMA cluster sizes are 27%, 15%, 15%, 26%, and 17%, 
EMC cluster sizes are 2%, 29%, 24%, 32%, and 13%. 
An additional analysis was carried out to determine whether the nature of the survey‚Äôs domain has an influence on 
the cluster definition. The difference in the sizes of the resulting clusters confirms that the segmentation depends, up 
to certain point, on the criteria being applied. 
In conclusion, both clustering algorithms SKMA and EMC can help segmenting supermarket customers based on 
their behavior. However, behavioral segmentation requires a deeper analysis since the cluster borders usually are not 
evident.

Abstract  
 
The key purpose of this study is to explore the supply chain logistics industry by focusing on the challenges existing 
in this industry together with the available technology innovation solutions to potentially address these challenges.  
To this aim, the paper systematically reviews the literature available in this industry, uncovering research strengths 
and limitations and discussing future research recommendations.  The review was conducted by a key word search 
from selected databases.  Overall, 34 relevant papers were identified through the inclusion and exclusion review 
process.  After providing the review method, the paper introduces two main concepts, challenges and innovation 
technology in supply chain logistics.  The literature review results relating to the two concepts are presented and 
principle findings are discussed.  Based on reviewed literature, this study can be of value to future related studies in 
establishing the relation between existing challenges in supply chain logistics and available technology innovation 
solutions.

1. Introduction  
International business has been experiencing a period of significant transformation.  Trends towards globalisation, 
integrated logistics and the development of information and communication technology are all re-shaping the world‚Äôs 
trading patterns and subsequently physical trade flows (Vasiliauskas & Jakubauskas, 2007).  To be internationally 
competitive, industries organise strategic worldwide networks that can deliver efficient and high-quality responses to 
demand from any part of the world market.  The effective and integrated organisation of such activities has often been 
referred to as global logistics or supply chain management (SCM), and it has become the core of global competitive 
power (Vasiliauskas & Jakubauskas, 2007).  SCM is a multi-faceted process with many stakeholders and even more 
moving parts.  Modern supply chains are often very complex, spanning multiple countries and involving many steps. 
 
Supply chain management plays a significant role in the success of any company‚Äôs operations and has a direct impact 
on its bottom line.  More importantly, supply chain management processes play a big role in customer satisfaction, 
which is more important than low product costs.  The improvement of SCM has been the main source for businesses 
to make new profits and sustain competitive advantage.  SCM processes involving relations between humans, nature, 
technology and resources are more and more complicated every year.  Take for example, logistics processes have to 
change with all the changes that happen in the continuous improvement context such as lean, total quality management, 
agility, etc. (Nilsson, 2006).  This means that there are more opportunities for errors than ever before, and in today‚Äôs 
world, errors disrupt the supply chains.  There are also numerous cases where the SCM systems have been the origin 
of bottlenecks in a firm‚Äôs general management (Nemoto & Koichiro, 2007).  The elimination of such bottlenecks has 
potential to reduce total cost and to improve the quality of services provided to clients.  From a social viewpoint, a 
competent logistics system can offer opportunities to reduce road congestion and environmental pollution, which 
could result in improved economic productivity (Erkan, 2014). 
 
Several innovations have been developed to advance the logistics and supply chain systems.  These innovations may 
be widely grouped into innovations to improve individual processes of logistics and supply chain, and innovations to 
improve the logistics and supply chain system wholly.  SCM and Third-Party Logistics (3PL) have had innovations

1401",,"may have been published in other languages.  To work with manageable data, the search was conducted from a limited 
number of databases, there may be other databases with additional information related to the research topic.  
 
6. Generalisability and Managerial Implications    
The results of this study are generalised across different countries and industries within supply chain logistics.  Though 
most identified challenges may be applicable to several organisations across different countries and industries within 
supply chain logistics, it should be noted that some of the identified challenges may not be viewed as challenges in 
other organisations.  This is because some of the challenges may have been challenges for certain companies in past 
years and measures have since been put in place to mitigate or resolve these challenges.  
 
With regards to the available technology innovation solutions within supply chain logistics, care should be used when 
interpreting the results to applicable solutions in organisations.  Since the literature studied is limited to secondary 
studies and discussed solutions may be outdated, considering the rate at which technology and innovation is advancing 
in recent years, this kind of work may need to include primary studies.  
 
7. Future Research Recommendations   
Based on the conducted review, as a recommendation, future research should focus on primary research obtained by 
an in-depth interview process conducted from leading global logistics companies such as DSV Global logistics and 
DHL.  Considering the research methodologies used by the authors from the reviewed literature, it was noted that 
most authors‚Äô findings were based on questionnaires completed by managers.  A global company would be ideal as it 
will include different countries where the company operates in different scales.  It would be beneficial to study both 
the international and country specific issues experienced by different branches within the same company.  The 
interview process must be conducted on a group of diverse respondents from different countries where both 
management and general workers are offered an opportunity to be interviewed.  In addition, literature can be reviewed 
to identify the gaps between what has been published and what is currently happening within supply chain logistics.  
Future studies should consider including articles published online by logistics companies as I believe there are much 
more technology innovation solutions that exist in present times but have not been reported on in existing academic 
journals. 
 
 8. Concluding Remarks   
The reviewed literature related to technology innovation proves that many companies agree that technology and 
innovation is essential in creating and attaining a competitive advantage; however, majority of the authors focused on 
the adoption of technology innovation and have not given much attention to the variety of available technology 
innovation solution and how they assist in addressing current challenges in the supply chain innovation.    
 
This paper forms part of the early stages of identifying challenges and technology innovation solutions within supply 
chain innovation as it is based on secondary studies.  Future studies should consider exploring both existing challenges 
within supply chain logistics and technology innovation using a combination of secondary and primary studies.  This 
will offer a better presentation of current challenges and technology innovation solutions within this industry and 
positively contribute to research focusing on the application and adoption of technology within the supply chain 
logistics industry.

Abstract  
The South African railway industry is in the process of replacing its rolling stock fleet to keep up with technological 
advances. The paper presents the findings of reliability analysis, failure costs, and factors influencing the performance 
of the electric locomotives that run between Kimberly and Swartkops. Secondary data for the study was gathered 
through field reports and financial reports. According to the findings, the fleet had an average reliability of 71%, and 
there was a direct correlation between the number of failures and the size of the fleet. The results show that the 
locomotives have a high number of failures in the early days of operation and that this number decreases over time. 
The accidents were identified as the main drivers of the maintenance cost, and the cost of quality accounted for 17% 
of the total cost of maintenance over 17 months. The environment where the locomotives were operating was identified 
to have the highest impact on fleet reliability. The research recommended improvements in the commissioning system 
to include the process to provide feedback to the production line. It is also recommended that the case study company 
should initiate regular inspections to identify damages due to environmental factors.

1. Introduction 
South African railway operators are modernizing their rolling stock fleets (wagons, locomotives, and coaches) to meet 
technological and economic demands. The new fleets are expected to reduce maintenance costs, reduce delays, and 
stimulate economic growth in South Africa. The cost of maintenance is determined by the system's dependability and 
the organization's maintenance policies. According to the literature, reliability is defined as the failure of a system to 
perform its intended function (Andrzejczak, 2015). Failure in this study refers to the inability to perform the intended 
function as expected. Normally an engineering system can be in two states which is fail or normal state. During the 
warranty period, the system is expected to remain in its normal state and perform the intended function without any 
failure. In practice, this is not always the case. The system fails due to a range of factors which include poor design, 
poor quality of the production processes, improper operation, and operating environment (Weckman et al., 2001). 
Failure of the system during the warranty period creates frustrations for both customers and suppliers. Also, both 
customers and suppliers suffer from opportunity costs and reputation.  Hence, it is important to understand the failure 
pattern or the reliability of the system during the warranty period and the cost associated with the inability of the 
system to perform the intended functions. From the literature reviewed, very little is known about the reliability of the 
locomotives, and the failure cost during the warranty period in South Africa. Hence, the purpose of this study was as 
follows: 
a) To model the reliability of the locomotives working between Kimberly and Swartkops during the warranty 
period using the Non-homogeneous Poisson Process. 
b) To determine the trends of failure cost during the warranty phase of the locomotives,  
c) To determine the causes of locomotive failures during the warranty period. 
 
The remainder of the paper is divided into five sections, with section 2 covering the literature review and section 3 
covering the research method and data collection. Sections 4, 5, and 6 cover the study's findings, recommendations, 
and conclusions.

1414","mode.  Overall, the fleet performance was identified to be mainly affected by the environment where the fleet was 
operating, quality problems and human behaviour. 
 
5. Recommendation for future work and Limitations  
As a result of the experiences and observations during the current research, the investigation into the following aspects 
is recommended:  
‚Ä¢ 
Future research should develop a model to predict the reliability of the asset based on the operating environment 
and interaction with other systems  
‚Ä¢ 
Assessment of quality management maturity of the South African railway sector  
‚Ä¢ 
The use of the internet of things devices as a possible solution for earlier fault detection on locomotives during 
the warranty period.  
 
In interpreting the research result, it is important to note the limitations associated with the research. The first limitation 
of the current research relates to the research strategy. The current research only analysed secondary data which do 
not provide the benefit of the primary data from people‚Äôs experience. The second limitation relates to the study setting; 
the current research only analysed data from the single fleet operating in one area. Hence, the results of the research 
cannot be generalized across different fleets during the warranty period.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The South African railway industry is in the process of replacing its rolling stock fleet to keep up with technological 
advances. According to the reviewed literature, very little is known about locomotive reliability and failure cost in 
South Africa during the warranty period. The following were the study's primary objectives: a) Model the reliability 
of locomotives operating between Kimberly and Swartkops during the warranty period using the Non-homogeneous 
Poisson Process; b) Determine the trends in locomotive failure cost during the warranty period; and c) Determine the 
causes of locomotive failures during the warranty period. The study used secondary data analysis as the research 
method. According to the findings, the locomotives had a high number of failures during their early days of operation, 
with an average of 71% reliability `monthly. The current research identified a mismatch between the 90-day 
maintenance cycle of the locomotives and the IQR 63 days. It was recommended that as more information becomes 
available, the organization's plans must be adjusted. Because of the environment in which the locomotives were 
operating, the research recommends that the locomotives' condition be assessed regularly.  
 
The research identified the poor cost of quality to be trending at 17% of the total costs of maintenance. The cost of 
incidents had the highest average of 43% of the total cost over 17 months. The planned maintenance activities had an 
average of 40% of the total cost. The financial result also shows the need for investment in prevention actions like 
training, testing and technology integration processes to combat the failure cost. The panto-graph related failures, loss 
of communications, collision, brake-related failures, no-operation and not starting were identified to be the most 
dominating failure modes. The cause and effect diagram provided the ability to assess the root cause of the top 20 
failure modes responsible for 80% of the failures. The researchers found loose catenary wires, stuck AC/DC switches 
and overhead stabilizer arms to be the main causes of pantograph-related failures. Communication failure mode was 
mainly from radio malfunction and loose wires. The result shows that communication failures were due to quality 
issues. Hence, the research recommends the focus on communication systems to reduce the poor cost of quality. The 
study identifies roaming animals as the main cause of collision-related failure. The result shows that the environment 
where the locomotives were operating harmed the fleet performance. Brake mal-function was identified to be the 
leading cause of brake-related failures. No-operations was mainly due to operator behaviour. Defective contactors and 
power off were the main causes of not starting failure mode.  Overall, the fleet performance was identified to be mainly 
affected by the environment where the fleet was operating, quality problems and human behaviour.

Abstract  
  
The study investigates how six sigma was implemented in a South African municipality. Six sigma was selected 
to provide the case study company, tools to improve the quality of service. In recent years, the company or section 
has received an increase in the number of complaints from the general public about the state of road infrastructure 
and endless projects that cause traffic congestion. Six sigma is based on a structured and systematic methodology 
known as define, measure, analyze, improve, and control (DMAIC) steps. The issue of using which tools during 
which steps of DMAIC is systematically addressed to realize cost savings and improved quality in the South 
African municipalities. The study employed both qualitative and quantitative research methods to gain a thorough 
understanding of six sigma implementation in the case study company. The questionnaire was distributed to 100 
participants in the case study company using online platform google forms. In total, 79 responses were completed 
and analysed. The information for this study came from two main sources: secondary data and primary data. The 
primary data was gathered using questionnaires. The secondary data was gathered using the operational report 
analysis. The expected outcomes most often evaluated the implementation of six sigma project. This study results 
are expected to benefit the employees, students and researchers by providing an understanding into the 
implementation of six sigma in South African municipalities. The major constraints of the study were the number 
of employees measured as well as time and cost.

Introduction  
Six sigma is a technique for improving strategic planning, product development, and the development of new 
services. To significantly reduce customer dissatisfaction, the method employs statistical and scientific approaches 
(Hakimi, Zahraee and Rohani, 2018). The six sigma methodology has been used globally for more than 27 years 
with success, allowing both large and small businesses to save significantly (Gijo, Bhat, and Jnanesh, 2014a). It 
can be used in any type of organization, from production to transactional, and from product to service (Gupta and 
Kumar, 2014a; 2014b). This problem-solving strategy requires full confidence and dedication in management, a 
well-trained and professional project management team to serve as an agent of change, and a committed and 
knowledgeable multifunctional team to ensure successful implementation (Marques and Matthe, 2017).  
  
The six sigma process emphasizes listening to the customer's voice to determine needs and translate them into 
service or product design requirements that can be tracked and calculated (Mohsen, Isa, and Usmen, 2015). Six 
sigma implementation has a positive impact on several quality indicators, including cost, service quality, and 
customer satisfaction (Jin, Janamanchi, and Feng, 2014). Many organisations have successfully adopted this 
strategy to enhance their performance (Jirasukprasert, Garza-Reyes, and Kumar, 2014).  
  
The most extensively utilized continuous improvement technique is six sigma. particularly in government and 
industry (Albliwi, Antony, Lim, and Wiele, 2014; Krueger, Parast, and Adam, 2014; Bakar, Subari, and Daril, 
2015; Thomas, Francis, Fisher, and Byard, 2016). The goal of this study was to investigate the critical success 
factors and strategies for implementing Six Sigma in a South African municipality. The study provided answers 
to the following questions:   
‚Ä¢ 
What are the critical success factors in six sigma adoption in a South African municipality?  
‚Ä¢ 
What are the recommended strategies for the implementation of six sigma in a South African 
municipality?

in the number of quality activities within the case study company. In addition, the data showed that the number of 
defects decreased at an exponential rate year after year. There had been no evidence that the company was linking 
six sigma projects to business strategies, and there had been no proof that the suppliers were included in the six

fundamentals of Six Sigma, and steering committees to track the progress of six sigma projects. There was also 
evidence that the company did not have a six sigma champion, did not use black belts while putting six sigma 
projects into action and that there was a disparity in the allocation of funding for six sigma training, resulting in 
insufficient training for members of the team to be involved in deploying six sigma projects. It was recommended 
that the company creates a clear link between six sigma pro-jects and business objectives and that six sigma 
projects be managed by black belts who understand the business processes. The six-sigma champion should be 
appointed to manage the organization's six-sigma deployment, provide re-sources to sixsigma projects, collect 
lessons learned, and improve the deployment.

Abstract  
 
Company X, based in South Africa, has noticed an increase in the number of Body in White (BIW) assembly defects 
from year to year (2017-2020). A review of historical operational data records revealed that most of the defects 
recorded were related to BIW dimensional management. The goal of this study was to investigate the theoretical 
strategies, systems, and success factors for managing BIW dimensional quality and to identify gaps in Company X's 
BIW dimensional quality management systems and strategies. This study chose a case study as the appropriate 
research strategy, and questionnaires were developed and distributed to participants from Company X for data 
collection purposes. For data analysis, descriptive statistics were used in this study. The primary data indicated that 
there was a good understanding and adoption of BIW quality management critical success factors in the case study 
company. However, secondary data showed that the number of defects per unit was increasing, with geometric points 
out of specification, incorrectly built parts, and measurement errors accounting for 80 per cent of the defects affecting 
BIW quality management. It was recommended that future research compare BIW quality management in the South 
African automotive industry to that of global car manufacturers.

1. Introduction  
Car manufacturing and automotive factories use innovative manufacturing techniques to meet and exceed their 
customers' expectations while also delivering the requisite production volume (Hasic 2006). The highly competitive 
market growth of the automotive industry has put automobile manufacturers under pressure to provide reliable and 
high-quality products to maintain their competitiveness (Shalash, 1996). Body in White (BIW) is the most significant 
process in the automobile production process, as well as the most expensive component of the car because it dictates 
the overall aesthetic of the vehicle (Enriquez, 2016). Since BIW is the structure before all of  hang-on and fit-on panels 
are installed, it consists of body openings that must be geometrically exact during the BIW building process to obtain 
appropriate fits (Shalash, 1996). These geometrical apertures are crucial in the construction of BIW structures since 
any inaccuracy on them might result in costly stoppages, ‚Äî in other words (Strapping Vehicles on Wheels) (Shalash, 
1996). 
 
 The BIW dimensional quality of the vehicle shell assembly process must be understood and regulated (Brown et al., 
2002). The BIW assembly procedures and geometrical quality are key operations that must be strictly monitored for 
automobile manufacturing plants to achieve their ultimate goal, which is to reduce the time it takes to create and 
deliver a good quality car to its customers (Shalash, 1996). This also necessitates monitoring of the subassemblies that 
are installed in BIW assembly and require geometrical quality management throughout the phases of the automotive 
production process (Enriquez, 2016). Managing BIW geometrical dimensional variation in the automobile 
manufacturing process is critical for the plant to maintain manufacturing competitiveness because excessive variation 
in BIW geometrical dimension quality affects product quality, time to market, and product development cost (Shalash, 
1996). Managing and understanding the influence of BIW process inputs on dimensional quality as early as feasible

Abstract 
 
Indonesia's oil production from year to year has decreased. The decline was because around 90% of the total oil 
production was produced from fields that were more than 30 years old, so a large investment was needed to contain 
the decline. The Java Sea Block is one of the oldest major blocks supporting Indonesia's oil and gas production with 
the production of 32,000 Barel Oil Per Day (BOPD) of oil and 167 Million Metric Standard Cubic Feet Per Day 
(MMSCFD) of natural gas, which has been operating since 1971. ZU Flowstation is one of the production fields that 
has been operating since 1984 with a production of 2000 ‚Äì 2300 BOPD, has 24 artificial lift / Electrical Submersible 
Pump (ESP) wells with different characteristics. Production results fluctuate every year. This is due to the age of the 
old wells so they are not able to produce more oil. This study aims to maximize production results on the operating 
system by adjusting the frequency of the Variable Speed Drive (VSD) automatically. The approach used is the 
Optimization with Binary Programming method. The results showed an increase in production from 24 wells by 356 
BOPD or 3.56%.

1. Introduction 
Currently, the growth of petroleum energy consumption in Indonesia is an average of 7% in the last 10 years or it can 
be said to have decreased. This is evidenced by the depletion of oil reserves from year to year, on the other hand 
natural gas tends to increase (can be seen in Figure 1). According to the Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas 
Business Activities, the decline was due to around 90% of the total oil production in Indonesia being produced from 
fields that are more than 30 years old (Migas, 2021). This has an impact on unstable production results (Ohiorenoya 
et al., 2016).

5.2 Practical Implications 
Most of the oil and gas industry has developed into a large industry. Every production process needs to be improved 
continuously to run optimally. This case study has provided great results and impact for the Offshore Platform 
industry to achieve a competitive industry. This case study will guide similar industries to achieve a competitive 
advantage. In addition to obtaining the optimal model, the implications of this case study are determining the 
combination of optimization wells, overcoming fluctuating annual production, energy efficiency and increasing 
production capacity. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results of research conducted on optimization of production in oil wells resulted in several conclusions, among 
others, based on the developed binary programming model, it can determine the combination of optimization wells 
to obtain the most optimal production benefits from each well with predetermined limits. Parameter changes in oil 
wells greatly affect the amount of oil production on the combination of wells, because the decisions are most 
optimal and influenced by changes in these parameters. The results showed an increase in production from 24 wells 
by 356 BOPD or 3.56%. Further research, the optimization system can be developed into the software with a good 
user interface, so that it can facilitate the decision-makers when there are changes in the parameters of the 
production process.

Abstract  
  
Special relevance is given to achieve passenger comfort in ground vehicles, and the suspension system is a key element 
involved in this objective. The contribution of this research is the modeling of a quarter vehicle as a 7-DOF system 
composed of a 4-DOF biodynamic model and a 3-DOF one-quarter of vehicle (QoV) suspension model. Moreover, a 
skyhook control strategy is being developed with the purpose of improving passenger comfort. Performance indices 
in the frequency domain are applied to validate comfort for the passenger and road holding. The theoretical work in 
this research is supported by simulation work, in which numerical values were taken from experimental work. The 
herein reported results hold importance for the advancement of suspension studies and set precedence for work on 
similar systems with other control strategies towards half and full vehicle suspensions.

1. Introduction  
Automobiles are the preferred mode of transportation for mankind. Due to this, the control of vehicle‚Äôs suspensions to 
ensure both passenger comfort and vehicle stability is a hot topic in companies and research centers that seek to 
improve these performance indices (Milliken and Milliken 1995). Over the years, attempts have been made to improve 
these areas to provide more comfort and safety to the passengers, and considering this requirement, active and 
semiactive suspensions have given better results than passive suspensions.  
  
Passive suspensions are composed of springs and dampers. Springs to reduce impact received by the vehicle body and 
dampers to reduce oscillations more quickly. Semi-active suspensions make use of a combination of actuators, springs, 
and dampers (Wong 2001), whereas active suspensions make strict use of some form of actuator instead of springs 
and dampers. Due to the type of actuators in their systems, active and semi-active suspensions require a controller to 
regulate the actions of these actuators. For this reason, they are considered intelligent suspensions, since they do not 
depend solely on the road profile but are instead controlled and regulated by a more complex system that adjusts 
constantly, in contrast with passive suspensions which are purely reactive (Pauwelussen and Pacejka 1995).

6. Conclusion and Future Work  
A suspension model was obtained to study the vertical dynamics of a one-quarter vehicle. This model allows to analyze 
in more detail the vertical dynamics of different parts of the body of a seated passenger, the seat frame, and the chassis. 
The simulations allow to detect differences between the masses of the system and not perceptible dynamics are 
highlighted in a 2 or 3 DOF model. According to the degrees of freedom, using the 7-DOF model provides an 
advantage since it has more masses to study in more detail the effects of the road disturbances on: head, chest, stomach, 
and pelvis-legs. It is a model that represents more aspects of vertical dynamics, but that avoids the complexity of other 
models reported with up to 10 or more DOF.  
  
It was also demonstrated that the suspension model developed is control-oriented, stable, and that it allows to continue 
investigating ways to improve passenger comfort and vehicle stability. With the obtained results in the frequency and 
time domain, it can be observed that an active approach contributes to a better passenger comfort, in terms of the 
performance criteria, in comparison to the passive suspension.   
  
Finally, to improve the 7-DOF model, more studies with different disturbance signals such as random profiles, are 
contemplated to be studied. Comfort for the passenger and vehicle stability are also consider for future work via the 
application of another control approaches, e.g., Groundhook or Hybrid (Groundhook + Skyhook) approaches. 
Moreover, this study could be extended towards half and full vehicle, vertical dynamics.

Abstract  
 
Engineering megaprojects are multifaceted and dynamic in nature and thus the project management aspects of them 
tend to be more complex than with smaller engineering projects. Large engineering megaprojects are more susceptible 
to risk and this can be mostly attributed to the complexity of their nature as well as the many interfaces present in the 
project. The research was set out to determine the types of negative risks that can be faced by engineering companies 
when undertaking on mega engineering design projects as well as to determine the different risk management 
techniques used by engineering companies in order to reduce the probability of project failure. From the research it 
was seen that all engineering design megaprojects experience risks. Most engineering companies do have standardized 
procedures available for risk management and that the most frequently used risk management techniques are 
brainstorming, root cause analysis and expert judgment. Not all engineering companies keep a risk register or produce 
risk reports for their projects. After risks are identified, the majority of engineering companies assign risk owners to 
their identified project risks. Risk mitigation is the most used negative risk response strategy adopted by engineering 
organizations in their design megaprojects.

Abstract 
 
Grocery stores are primary establishments where people purchase food, supplies, and household items. Most stores 
are open daily, and some even for 24 hours. Customers enter Rodamel Grocery Store in Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, 
during the operating hours to buy goods. To ensure public health safety, there is a need to measure/analyze the IAQ 
of the Rodamel Grocery Store and compare the gathered data to existing IAQ standards. For three consecutive days, 
air quality monitoring devices were used to measure the ventilation, temperature, humidity, also the concentrations of 
CO2, formaldehyde, and particulate matter such as PM2.5 and PM10. Bioaerosol samples were also collected and 
grown using a process called Growth Culture Analysis to qualitatively identify how much is inhaled depending on the 
grocery shopper‚Äôs exposure time. Based on the results, only the temperature and the humidity did not meet the 
acceptable ranges from the standards, exceeding the maximum of 27ÀöC and 60 respectively. For the bioaerosol 
sampling, all the 18 samples show a relationship that the longer the shopper stays inside the grocery store, the more 
bioaerosol exposure is experienced. Further recommendations are also given to the Rodamel Grocery Store to address 
their indoor air issues.

1. Introduction 
Groceries and supermarkets are usually populated places since goods and commodities were commonly purchased in 
this kind of place. These were the heart of shopping centers in Italy since other activities such as cooking and food 
preparation are being carried out within the establishment (Santana et al., 2018). The said phenomena are pretty 
evident here in the Philippines nowadays, which causes people to stay longer and increasing the establishment's 
population. 
 
Since these types of establishments are enclosed spaces, excellent and adequate ventilation is a must for the health 
and safety of the occupants within these establishments. Inadequate ventilation could cause Sick Building Syndrome 
(SBS), Building-Related Syndrome (BRI), and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) due to the concentration of 
pollutants within (TSI, 2003). Moreover, occupants within the establishment may be at risk of having Infectious 
Diseases, Respiratory Illnesses, and even Cancer due to the bioaerosol particles suspended in air (Douwes et al., 2003), 
especially during this time of pandemic caused by COVID-19. This recently discovered airborne virus can be present 
in the air for 3 hours (van Doremalen et al., 2020).

5. Conclusion 
Based on the findings and analysis of the researchers, most of the parameters passed the standards except for the 
temperature and the humidity within the establishment. The moisture in the grocery dramatically exceeds the 
maximum humidity level imposed by DOE, which is 60%. At the same time, even though the evening data shows that 
it is mainly on the top level of 27ÀöC, this study was conducted during colder months of the year. Therefore it would 
be expected that the temperature in the establishment would be higher during the summer seasons. 
 
As for the pollutants, all of them are within standard limits imposed by ASHRAE, and most of them are in the ""Good. 
The Air Quality Index"" of the AQI, except for CO2, falls into the ""Moderate Air Quality Index."" Most of the statistical 
parameter correlations conducted were expected except for the case of the CO2 since it was affected by the frequently 
opened doors of the establishment, and for the possibility of PM10 and PM2.5 because of the clothing of the occupants 
and the biological agents, they expel via desquamation or scratching of the skin.  
 
For the Bioaerosol qualitative analysis, it was concluded that the microbial accumulation increases over time, mainly 
due to the accumulated microbiota from the occupants and the surrounding environment of the establishment.

Abstract 
 
The use of electric milking devices is used in several developing countries. It is expensive, high maintenance, and has 
high electric consumption. Small-scale farmers cannot accommodate these variables. Therefore, the researchers design 
a human-powered vacuum system for Milking Carabaos and Cows, which the farmers can utilize. This research 
intends to fill the market gap between the electric milking device and the traditional hand milking technique. 
Moreover, to yield more milk in a short period compared to hand milking. The system showed a slight difference 
concerning the milk output volume compared to using an electric milking device under the working pressure of 40-50 
kPa. Comparisons between the designed prototype and different milking processes were tested, and therefore, the 
objectives of this study were attained.

1. Introduction 
Extracting milk has provided the needs of many people. Also, these domesticated animals like Carabaos and Cows 
were used in doing this. Through the advancement of technology, mechanical devices were used to nurture milk 
(Swart, Blignaut, and Jooste, 2018). These devices were also utilized for mass production and the progress of the study 
of pasteurization. Thus, milking machines were highly favored compared to the traditional hand milking technique. It 
was preferred due to the demands of yielding milk effectively. 
 
The Philippines is an agricultural country, use of these animals, especially the carabaos and cows, were widely utilized. 
(Bondoc, 2018). These animals were used for farming and to supply their by-products, especially their milk. The 
production of extracting milk of carabaos and cows is different depending on many factors. But the usual yield range 
would be 4-7 liters of milk per session. Farmers used this for their utilization and sometimes sell for profit. There is 
also nourishment advantages comparing the milk of carabaos to cows (Que, 2018). 
 
Having a milking machine have its advantages and disadvantages. A farmer in the Philippines owns an average of 
three cows or carabaos. Most of them resort to manual hand milking instead of the milking machines readily available 
in the market, for they do not find milking machines practical due to their high cost. Manual hand milking is an 
outdated technique that is deemed inefficient. The researchers made a system in which milking would be more efficient 
but still cost-effective at the same time by solely utilizing human power and no other energy resources.

5. Conclusion 
The study concluded that the system is safe to work with both carabaos and cows. It showed that a human produces 
enough energy that can sustain a pressure ranging from 40-50 kPa vacuum under an operating time of 10 minutes. 
Adjustments to the pump and vacuum sealing were made, leading to better pump milking time. Fine-tuning of the 
prototype helped in maintaining the sustained pressure measured at the system accumulator. Moreover, the addition 
of lubricant to parts in contact assured smooth flow of operation of the machine. Attaching the cluster through the 
sides of the animal was found to be the safest and most efficient way in milking the animal since it can easily access 
its four teats, wherein each cup of the cluster was fitted well. The materials utilized in this system were chosen for 
their availability, cost, and ease of manufacturing, making it cheaper than the commercial milking machine available 
in the market. It was also found out that factors such as environment, milk-let down, food, and routine of milking 
contribute to the amount of milk yielded by the animal. Comparison with the automatic milking machine results in a

1490","slight difference in milk yield volume when using the prototype. The prototype is better than the traditional hand 
milking in terms of work, time, and efficiency. A single person can operate it, and when the user uses a vacuum 
pressure of 45-50 kPa, the time for the milking session can be lessened. Improvements in the design can be achieved 
if a pneumatic check is used wherein less air leakage from the pump can be attained. Designing a smaller frame or 
choosing lighter materials for the whole system is recommended for ease of transport. A pedal mechanism instead of 
a pumping system can decrease the workload of the user. Designing a new cluster system is also recommended to 
prevent leakage. Lastly, the application of ergonomics will significantly aid in the design.

Abstract 
 
People are aware that outdoor air pollution is harmful to their health, but indoor air pollution can also cause serious 
health complications. This study aims to determine the indoor air quality of modernized jeepneys to identify the best 
solutions to eliminate harmful emissions and provide comfort and good health for the occupants. The researchers 
conducted an IAQ assessment, including the following concentrations: carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, PM10, PM2.5, 
formaldehyde, temperature, and relative humidity. In addition, a correlation of the parameters with the number of 
passengers and the cycle of opening-closing of the door were identified. A survey was conducted to explain the 
sampling results further. Based on the results, PM2.5 and PM10 were the only contaminants that appeared to be within 
the standards. Temperature and carbon dioxide both have a relationship with the number of passengers. Carbon dioxide 
and PM2.5 both have a relationship with the cycle of opening-closing of the door. The rest of the results and 
recommendations drawn based on these results are discussed in the latter part of this paper.

Indoor air quality, modernized jeepney 
 
1. Introduction 
Jeepneys are part of every Filipino's daily life and serve as one of the primary means of transportation to the public. 
As time passes, the jeepneys that represented the Filipinos undergo modernization. Jeepneys are now equipped with 
an air conditioning system to comfort commuters (DOT, 2020). Along with the urbanization, rapid increase in the 
demand for infrastructures, and the increase of vehicles, commuters are exposed to health risks due to a significant 
amount of air pollutants. Traffic problems are not only resulting in economic losses but also causing health sickness 
to motorists and commuters. Vehicles stuck in traffic are also a great contributor to air pollution (CDC, 2016). The 
short- and long-term exposure to air pollutants can cause a range of adverse health effects on commuters (Wong et al., 
2018). This IAQ management will involve controlling air pollutants and maintaining temperature and relative 
humidity within the acceptable standard.  
 
The increase in the use of motor vehicles has resulted in a wide variety of dangers among the motorists and the 
commuters' health and environmental welfare. Poor indoor air quality could cause adverse effects among commuters 
(Chan, 2005). Most people know that outdoor air pollution is harmful to their health, but indoor air pollution can also 
cause detrimental health effects. There are not enough data provided regarding the level of pollutants in vehicle cabins. 
Consequently, there is an evident lack of priority towards actions about the proper maintenance of IAQ (Barnes et al.,

1492","4.5. Proposed Location of the Roof Vent in the Modernized Jeepney 
 
 
Figure 10. Proposed Roof Ventilation Fan Location 
 
The researchers designed the proper placement of the vent in the roof of the modernized jeepney wherein the fan is 
between the two evaporators (front and rear A/C system) to maximize its functions, to provide fresh air to occupants 
and to dilute CO2 and air contaminants. The proposed roof ventilation fan location is shown in Figure 10. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the IAQ assessment, PM 2.5 and PM 10 were the indoor contaminants that appeared to be within the 
standards; the rest of the included parameters exceeded the guideline values. On the other hand, based on the statistical 
analysis, temperature and carbon dioxide have a significant relationship with passengers. Also, PM 2.5 and carbon 
dioxide have a substantial connection with the cycle of opening-closing doors.  
 
Results revealed that the temperature level inside the modernized jeepneys involved in the study is higher than the 
baseline range. It may have been due to high heat gain since it was mostly partly sunny throughout sampling, which 
subsequently causes higher ambient temperature compared to the temperature inside the modernized jeepney. The 
concentration of relative humidity in modernized jeepneys exceeded that standard range; when this happens, it may 
trigger unnecessary fungi and mold formation that can cause harmful damage on both humans and the car. The 
concentration of carbon dioxide in the modernized jeepney involved in this study is not acceptable based on the 
standard comfort value. This may have been affected by various factors such as air exchange outside the vehicle, 
ventilation mechanism of the vehicle, travel route took during each ride and the movement of the commuters inside 
the vehicle. The carbon monoxide concentration gathered during the assessment was beyond the standard values; this 
may have been affected by the number of hours spent by the jeepney on traveling. 
 
On the other hand, the concentrations of particulate matter 2.5 and particulate matter 10 are acceptable based on the 
standards. This may have been due to t6he controlled number of people inside the modernized jeepney and because 
the jeepney has a Euro IV engine. Lastly, it appears that the concentration of formaldehyde in the modernized jeepney 
involved in this study is also higher than the standard value. The formaldehyde concentrations are mainly due to the 
emissions coming from various interior materials found in the compartment, upholstery, ceiling, and other parts since 
formaldehyde is one of the components used in manufacturing these interior materials.   
 
6. Recommendation 
To regulate the in-cabin temperature of the modernized jeepney, the researchers endorse an air-conditioning system 
with a more flexible capacity since a load of passengers tends to vary throughout the route trip. Based on the results, 
the modernized jeepney has a high concentration of carbon dioxide, so it may benefit from having high-efficiency 
particle air (HEPA) filters or air cleaners to improve the CO2 engagement inside the vehicle. The researchers suggest 
proper monitoring for any possible leakage in ducts and pipes; this may allow the gas from the exhaust to enter the 
vehicle if leakage occurs, and management of the modernized jeepney should also consider replacing air filters and 
regular, thorough cleaning to alleviate such undesirable results. The jeepney drivers should opt to close the door when 
traveling through polluted areas such as tunnels and congested zones. Through this, there will be an adequate control 
on the concentration of the PM2.5 and PM10 inside the modernized jeepney. To further improve and maintain this 
comfortable concentration of PM10, modernized jeepney regulators may consider upgrading the air filters installed in 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

1500","the vehicle and imposing a regular schedule for overall cleaning of the vehicle. Also, the driver and conductor of the 
jeepney should always make sure that the engine inside the vehicle is wholly sealed and adequately closed; this can 
also control the concentration of particulate matter 10. Lastly, for monitoring formaldehyde concentration, 
implementing source control can benefit modernized jeepney since it is an effective measure that focuses on 
monitoring and reducing emissions coming from the materials used in the vehicle's structure. In addition, the vehicle's 
interior materials should be pre-baked in an oven for 5 hours at 70 degrees Celsius to ensure that the amount of 
formaldehyde concentration of the modernized jeepney is safe for everyone inside it. 
 
For the modernized jeepney in the study, installing a roof ventilating fan will serve as the fresh air intake for the 
vehicle to dilute a high concentration of Carbon Dioxide and unnecessary air contaminants that could lead to poor 
IAQ. HEPA Filters installed in the roof vent would reduce the air contaminants such as CO, PM2.5, and PM10 up to 
99.5% entering the vehicle due to the possible infiltration through the new ventilation fan installed. It is recommended 
to turn on the newly installed roof ventilating fan using the remote every hour for 15 ‚Äì 30 mins which are enough to 
replenish the needed fresh air for the passenger. The reversible switch for the exhaust fan would serve as an exit for 
fumes and unpleasant odor.

Abstract 
 
Taho is a delicacy made of fresh tofu commonly retailed in the Philippines, where vendors are usually forced to empty 
their supply in a few hours as the quality of taho deteriorates due to uncontrolled heat transfer and vibration-produced 
during peddling. This study aims to construct a prototype that will minimize quality deterioration of taho as well as to 
provide ease in retailing of taho. Carts are the usual vehicle for street vendors. Consequently, the prototype is loosely 
based on the design of the carts readily available in the market with key improvements such as coil springs on the 
auxiliary wheel and the addition of polyethylene foam for heat insulation. The results show that the cart design appears 
to have small fluctuations of temperature than manual operation. In contrast, the vibration frequency seems to be 
minimal throughout the assessment. In contrast, the quality of taho in terms of physical appearance is comparatively 
similar to both strategies due to it being beyond the study's scope. The prototype exhibited comparatively better results 
than its manual counterpart, alleviating the payload from tension, which creates a higher tilt and movement readings 
in terms of frequency and acceleration while achieving temperature being preserved throughout the interior of the 
system.

1. Introduction 
Taho is made from fresh tofu, usually mixed with highly concentrated brown sugar or vanilla syrup and paired with 
gelatin-based edible pieces known as ""sago."" It is typically retailed using an aluminum container with ropes tied 
around it that act as support when carried by the vendors daily. This delicacy often energizes the consumer due to its 
sugar content that provides a unique taste similar to drinks such as coffee. However, tofu is a reasonably sensitive 
ingredient whose quality can quickly deteriorate, so vendors are forced to empty their daily supply in less than a few 
hours as soon as they start peddling. This is seen as the tofu excretes a liquid extract that resides at the top of the edible 
material. The quality of the tofu also relies on the ambient temperature of the surroundings (Kong, Chang, Liu, & 
Wilson, 2008). This implies that as the ambient temperature increases, the quality of the tofu decreases. The taho being 
peddled will depend on its quality, as most consumers prefer a gel-like texture. Vendors are forced to toss the liquid 
extract before serving their taho to cater to the consumers' liking.  
1.1. Objectives 
With these factors in mind, researchers conducted this study to prolong the timeframe of peddling taho before its 
quality completely deteriorates and improve the ergonomics and comfort of the vendors. This research will cover the

1502","The system consists of two 320mm coil springs at the auxiliary wheel located at the right side of the cart. The spring 
system carried the impact force of the cart when driving, especially when encountering speed-decreasing elements 
such as speed bumps and potholes. The output of the proposed cart design was in direct relation to the inclusion of 
coil springs for the system. Based on road selection, the road was purely asphalt filled with few amounts of gravel, 
including speed bumps and potholes. The payload weighs fifty (50) kilograms, whereas including the vendor's weight 
and other auxiliary elements would total one hundred and forty (140) kilograms. This translates that the springs should 
support up to the same amount of the load or higher. Based on the springs' specifications, a single 320mm coil spring 
can carry an average load of 300 kilograms. The cart design proposes using two coil springs at the auxiliary wheel 
where it dissipates the load of the system. The dimensions also suggest that the track of the design is kept at a minimum 
for it to avoid deflection along with the point where the load is placed.  
The road selected is within the limits of the testing. Based on the data, both manual operation and the use of the 
proposed cart design were operated under the same conditions. 
4. Conclusion 
The objective of the research is to design and fabricate a taho cart with key improvements such as a vibration damping 
system to reduce the vibrational effect to the product and a heat insulation system to reduce the effect of ambient 
temperature on the product as well as to improve the ergonomics and safety of the vendors. 
 
The researchers observed two parameters that were discussed in this study: temperature and vibration. Based on the 
prototype, the fabrication techniques were adequate in accommodating the payload and cruise through a usual route 
traveled by the vendor. The researchers adapted the widely-used cart design by street vendors, adding key 
improvements to accommodate the given parameters. Cost-effectiveness was also prioritized by utilizing the available 
aftermarket parts such as coil springs and the cart itself to alleviate the vibration-induced road conditions. Using a 
double-walled cylindrical aluminum container alongside polyethylene foam covering the whole interior of the cart, 
heat transfer due to ambient temperature changes was minimized. The data presented in this study is sufficient to 
assess the difference between manual-operated and cart-operated methods properly. Based on the data acquired, the 
manual-operated method produces higher fluctuating values than the cart-operated method. The accelerometer graphs 
show that the cart-operated method has minimal vibrational frequency mainly due to the added key improvements 
such as shock absorber. The temperature graphs show that the prototype cart achieved higher temperature readings 
which means that heat was preserved through an extended period while achieving lower values in terms of tilt and 
movement inside the system. The prototype exhibited comparatively better results than its manual counterpart, 
alleviating the payload from tension, which creates a higher tilt and movement readings in terms of frequency and 
acceleration while achieving temperature being preserved throughout the interior of the system.

Abstract 
 
In addressing poverty, proper poverty alleviation programs must be identified. Analyzing the multidimensional aspects 
of poverty will lead to data-driven decision making. This study aims to analyze poverty conditions in a community in 
the Philippines using data mining and clustering algorithm. The model resulted in clusters described in this paper as 
Stable, Critical, and At-Risk clusters. Among the clusters, the Critical cluster has the highest incidents of poor 
conditions. In the cluster analysis, poverty alleviation programs where the household clusters should be prioritized 
were suggested based on the poor conditions in each cluster. The clusters analysis is intended to provide insights for 
use in the community‚Äôs planning and program implementation.

1. Introduction 
Addressing poverty is a significant task of several countries. This makes research on poverty alleviation important 
and necessary (Niu et al., 2020). The research on poverty created awareness of its multidimensional nature, that is, 
focusing on factors other than income. (Shuhong et al., 2019). Lack of access to basic needs like education, food, 
housing, security, and basic health care indicates poor conditions (Talingdan, 2019). In reducing poverty, economic 
growth must be sustained and inclusive (NEDA, 2017). Data mining plays an essential role in explaining patterns in 
data and serves a decision support tool as complexity develops and the amount of information available increases 
(Naviamos & Niguidula, 2020). Many organizations have adopted data mining as a decision support tool (Talingdan, 
2019). The results of this study may be used by government and non-government organizations in identifying and 
implementing poverty alleviation programs in a community in the Philippines. 
The subject of this study is a community in the Philippines where the average household size is four (4) and the 
average monthly income per household is PhP6,238. This is below the 2015 poverty threshold at Php9,452 per month 
for a family of five (5) indicated in the Philippine Statistics Authority‚Äôs Special Release dated December 5, 2019. 
Six hundred thirty-one household members are employed receiving salaries and wages while some 116 received cash 
receipts, support, assistance and relief from domestic sources. The data with 2,502 respondents who are members of 
the 606 households in the community revealed that 90% of residents aged 5 to 20 years old are in school. 98% of those 
aged 10 and above can read and write a simple message in any language or dialect while 51% of residents who are 20 
to 80 years old worked for at least an hour in the past week. Figure 1 shows the demographics, literacy rate, educational 
attainment, and employment in the community per age group classification.

1511","In further studies, data mining and clustering algorithm may be applied on census data for other areas or communities. 
Recommendations may differ based on the focus areas and household cluster profiles in these communities. Data on 
the available resources in the community or specific advocacies of organizations may also be used as considerations 
as to which programs should be prioritized.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Using clustering algorithm, poor living conditions of households in the community were analyzed and prioritization 
in implementing socio-economic programs in each household cluster was recommended in this study. Aside from 
income, key variables from the data were identified to address multidimensional aspects of poverty and develop 
comprehensive strategies for the community.  
Data mining and cluster analysis were used as a decision support tool to obtain data understanding and describe the 
profiles of the household clusters in the community in terms of the significant socio-economic indicators present in 
the data.  
To organize the complicated data relationships presented in census data, cluster analysis was used in this study. The 
households in the community were grouped into three (3) clusters described as the Stable Cluster, Critical Cluster, 
and At-Risk Cluster. Focus areas were identified based on the cluster profiles. These were used as basis in 
recommending programs that would address the most pressing poor living conditions in the clusters.

Abstract  
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way the world operates, forcing nations to adopt new procedures to combat 
the spread of the coronavirus while concurrently maintaining economic activity. During the pandemic, several 
countries implemented systems and processes to screen travelers who legally entered their borders before allowing 
them to intermingle with the general population. The Caribbean, which depends heavily on tourism, is no exception. 
While the primary goal of a screening process is to protect the local population from disease spread, a secondary goal 
should be to ensure traveler satisfaction in terms of timeliness, accuracy, agility, and cost-effectiveness of the logistics 
of the process. This paper primarily addresses the latter goal by proposing a multidisciplinary approach to improve the 
logistics of a COVID-19 screening process in a small island state. The recommendations are based on the absence of 
key disciplinary areas and perceived skill gaps between the professional cadre and workforce, and the computer and 
digital literacy of the nation. A lean six sigma framework is used to demonstrate how a structured methodology can 
be applied to implement the potential solutions.

1. Introduction  
Passenger mobility is vital to the economic mainstay of many countries, particularly small island states that depend on 
tourism for a substantial portion of their domestic product. Few countries can afford to prohibit entry of visitors or 
residents on a long-term basis despite the threat of an ongoing global pandemic. This reality has been an immense 
challenge for governments, health and medical professionals, tourism executives, airport managers, and other 
stakeholders, who recognize the need to manage the health risks associated with incoming travelers, while 
simultaneously ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of the control processes.   
  
Efficiency and effectiveness are two words that are often used interchangeably but which have very different meanings. 
According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, efficiency refers to ‚Äúthe ability to do something or produce something 
without wasting materials, time, or energy‚Äù, while effectiveness is ‚Äúthe power to produce a desired result‚Äù.  From these 
definitions, it is clear that it is possible to have an effective system that is lacking in the area of efficiency or vice versa.  
For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many Caribbean islands developed screening protocols to check 
incoming air passengers for potential signs of infection before allowing them to mingle with the general population. 
Not only were these systems unique to each island, but the degree of efficiency and effectiveness varied among the 
islands. Among these, Dominica was effective in the early identification of incoming infectious cases to prevent 
disease outbreaks and community spread within the local population. The island registered only 197 COVID19 cases 
and zero deaths over the first 18 months of the global pandemic (Johns Hopkins University and Medicine, 2021). 
However, less attention appears to have been paid to developing the processes to meet traveler satisfaction.  
  
1.1 Logistics  
Logistics is about managing the flow of resources efficiently and effectively. Regardless of the number of incoming 
passengers on a flight, travelers expect the screening operations to be expedient, state-of-the-art, lack redundancy, and 
result in accuracy. A well-designed and managed logistics system will facilitate the rapid movement of products and 
information to the correct locations in the shortest possible time. Recognizing some of these issues during the

to unauthorized personnel, users should be trained, verified, subjected to double authentication, and required 
to change passwords frequently.  
(b) Bar Codes / QR Codes for Rapid Data Retrieval: Barcodes offer a condensed visual format for labeling and 
tracking an item by scanning with a machine. Several bar code types exist, including the Universal Product 
Code (UPC), International Article Number (EAN), and 2-D Data Matrix used to trace retail products. 
Increasingly, however, Quick Response (QR) codes are becoming popular in many domains to provide more 
extensive information on an item via a web link to a database. Applications have been found in art galleries 
(e.g., to provide information on an artist or work of art), marketing (e.g., to provide information on supplier 
sustainable practices), and restaurants (e.g., to replace paper menus with electronic menus in a post-pandemic 
world). A QR code attached to a travel authorization letter could also be used to expedite the health screening 
process for arriving passengers at the airport or health facility/hospital by eliminating manual re-entry of data 
and allowing rapid retrieval of a passenger‚Äôs record. QR codes could also potentially help to prevent possible 
identification fraud that could result from falsification of names on printed letters of authorization to travel.  
(c) Other Tracking Systems for Data Retrieval and Security: Another technology worth considering is 
blockchain, a distributed digital ledger that provides a transparent and secure transaction between two entities. 
A transaction in this case could be defined as the exchange of information between a passenger and the 
Ministry of Health; passenger and airport; passenger and hospital; or passenger and laboratory. Blockchain 
is currently being used in various supply chains to monitor contract compliance, improve the flow of items, 
and trace and verify the authenticity of assets. The advantage of this technology is that transactions are 
permanent and immutable and are verified by multiple entities. Furthermore, any attempt to alter a traveler‚Äôs 
data would trigger an alert to all entities in the network. Thus, for example, a COVIDcertified facility with 
access to a passenger‚Äôs record would be unable to edit the passenger‚Äôs information without alerts being 
generated to other parties in the network.   
(d) Other Electronic Systems: The development of custom applications (apps) that can be launched on mobile 
devices to provide information would be useful in providing a more integrated experience. As a last resort, 
email and fax can still be used to rapidly communicate laboratory results to hospital and quarantine facilities.  
  
5.3.5 Management:  
(d) Management by Exception: Time is of the essence in a modern world. Management by exception is a 
philosophy that empowers employees to make autonomous decisions on matters pertaining to their work, 
with management intervening only when there is a significant deviation (evident in the data) from the ideal 
or desired outcome. This implies that in screening arriving air passengers, designated laboratory personnel 
could be given the responsibility and accountability to communicate negative COVID test results directly to 
the quarantine facilities, thereby allowing eligible travelers to save several hours of unnecessary quarantine 
confinement. The current process involves the physical transportation of laboratory test results back to the 
facility where the swabs were taken, prolonging the time for release of the traveler. Furthermore, a medical 
practitioner‚Äôs intervention is required to contact the quarantine facility. It would be more efficient if this 
intervention was reserved for situations in which COVID test results are positive, in which case a new 
protocol for monitoring and treating the infectious traveler would be triggered. This approach would not only 
empower lower-level staff to be more invested in their duties but would also allow health professionals to 
focus their efforts and talents where their professional training could be more appropriately applied.   
  
6. Conclusion  
This paper applied a multidisciplinary approach within a lean six sigma framework to show how an existing COVID19 
screening process for arriving air passengers to a small island state could be improved. Ideally, these dimensions 
should be addressed from the outset under the direction of a capable project manager and a competent and highly 
experienced team representing each of the five disciplinary areas. However, the goal of this paper was not to change, 
but to improve, a current system that handles low volumes of incoming passengers. An experiential observational 
approach was used to gather the data for the study. This method has its own limitations as extraneous factors, which 
the researcher might be unaware of, could impact the data collected. While the study represents an actual experience, 
the reliability of the data needs to be further improved by extending the study to cover a longer period and a larger 
sample of passengers. Future research could, however, focus on studying the implementation of the recommended 
strategies to determine the impact on performance. Another opportunity is to re-engineer and optimize the processes 
by making appropriate tradeoffs between efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, consideration could be given to 
use of automation and the redesign of spatial layouts and workflows to facilitate a faster flow of passengers and data.

Abstract 
 
The researchers sought to create an Information System Plan for Chew & Brew, a milk tea franchise shop based in 
Pampanga, Philippines. Started by Flava and Karlo Esmas, Chew & Brew currently has two branches. The current 
strategy of Chew & Brew is to innovate new products and make use of the service of food delivery couriers to entice 
customers to order. Chew & Brew uses Gmail, Messenger, and Facebook for communication and advertising purposes 
regarding its computing environment. The researchers made use of various methods to create the Information System 
Plan. They utilized a TOWS matrix, a Value Chain Analysis, Gap Analysis, Porter's Five Forces of Competition, Pain 
points and Failure points, Criteria Analysis, and Scoring Model and created a Proposed Process Flow. Ultimately, the 
researchers recommend that Chew & Brew opt for making a full-fledged website as its advantages are per the 
objectives of the business.

1. Introduction 
Chew & Brew Milk Tea Station is a milk tea franchise shop in the retail food industry. The franchise is based in 
Pampanga, Philippines, with two branches in Angeles City and San Fernando City. Flavia and Karlo Esma's started it 
in San Fernando City, where it began as a small shop that sold selected menu items with NYC Graham Cream Cheese 
and Dulce De Leche Cream Cheese as the best sellers. Due to the continuous support of their customers, Chew & 
Brew managed to expand enough to have three branches. The business also has a partnership with multiple local food 
courier services, such as Mangan or GrabFood.  
 
The organizational structure of Chew & Brew is straightforward. The head is the CEO, backed by the consultant. 
Directly below the CEO is the Store Operations Manager, who is on the same level as the Accountant, the Commissary 
Supervisor, and his assistant. Below the Store Operations Manager are the store supervisors in charge of the 
employees, including the cashiers and the staff. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The Filipino people are fond of milk tea, ranking second among the countries with the most significant number of 
bubble tea drinkers in Southeast Asia in 2019. Due to this, a lot of milk tea shops were established across the country. 
According to ""Consumer Preference Analysis on Attributes of Milk Tea: A Conjoint Analysis'' (2021), it was 
concluded from a Conjoint Analysis approach that Milk tea had been one of the most popular beverages from 2011 
and to the present. A similar study 2014 from SPUQC (St. Paul University Quezon City) discusses the trend of how 
milk tea beverages seem to capture the attention of the Filipinos, in particular, the youth, due to their desire to find a 
cold area to relax with an equally cool beverage in hand. Despite this, milk tea may be replaced by other products. 
According to IMARC Group (2021), the coffee and tea capsules market will continue to grow from 2021-2026. 
Popular brands such as Coffee Planet LLC, Nespresso Philippines, and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf may pose competition 
for milk tea shops.

Figure 3. Proposed System for Chew & Brew 
Figure 3 illustrates the proposed system for Chew & Brew. The customer can access the new website of Chew & 
Brew. With the website, they can access the menu, and they can choose what order they want; this covers a pain point 
wherein they need to wait for the store to contact them when they have an inquiry about the menu; the website will 
also show if a product is available or not, this covers another pain point wherein it consumes time for both the customer 
and the staff to see if an item is available or not. After seeing the menu and the product that they want, the order will 
be processed to the branch that they have chosen; the payment method will then be decided by the customer, whether 
online or through COD (Cash on Delivery). After being finalized, the branch will create the customer's desired order 
and then be handed to the delivery courier that is available for delivery. The whole process ends when the customer 
has received the delivered item. 
 
6. Conclusion 
After thorough data collection and Analysis of Chew & Brew's essential information, the researchers utilized the said 
information and applied it with the research framework involving Internal and External Business Analysis. Several 
strategies were then formed from the said Analysis of Chew & Brew, which were then translated into a scoring model 
to decide which project or recommendation would be feasible for the business. Due to limited funding and being more 
aligned to current business goals, a website was selected to entice investors further and make it convenient for other 
people to know more about the business. The same strategy introduces a better way for Chew & Brew to expand since 
it can also entice franchisors and strengthen its social media presence.

Abstract 
 
This project is focused on the problematic situation that exists in the plant of Ficosa North America, S.A. de C.V. 
in Salinas Victoria, Nuevo Le√≥n, specifically in the DS Mirrors production line of Ficosa‚Äôs client Stellantis, which 
was solved using the DMAIC methodology, part of the Six Sigma philosophy, with the objective of achieving a 
80% of OEE at the release of the DS Stellantis Mirrors production line by increasing its three main indicators, 
these being Efficiency, Quality and Availability. Throughout the document, all the phases of the methodology are 
shown, which are Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control, along with the tools that were used in each 
stage, as well as the statistical analysis accomplished, the improvement proposals and the implementation of these 
within the organization to achieve the established objective. 
 
The existing production line now in the Ficosa‚Äôs Salinas Victoria plant was a transfered project from the plant of 
the same company in Cookeville, Tennessee, this due to the global situation of the pandemic and the fact that it 
was established a legislation where any American citizen who is unemployed can receive financial support in 
between 800-1200 dlls per month, equivalent to the salary of a base operator in Ficosa Cookeville. This generated 
that the resignation rate increased up to 41%, directly affecting the breach of the stipulated rate, which is referred 
to as the pieces produced per hour, with that in mind the organization saw the need to pay extra work hours to 
satisfy their customers needs, causing that the availability, efficiency and quality of the line constantly changes, 
affecting the OEE indicator therefore decreasing to an average of 62.7%.

Abstract   
  
Hydroxyapatite is the inorganic material with formula Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2.  It is one of bioceramic was used for one 
repairs, fixing defects of filing voids in biomedical fields. The use of chicken eggshell is one of the natural sources to 
obtain the calcium phosphate compounds. The main objective of this study is to synthesize the hydroxyapatite by 
precipitation method from eggshell. The raw eggshell was calcined at 850¬∞C for 2 hours following by grinding for 16 
hours. The HA powder was synthesized by wet chemical method, using eggshells and phosphoric acid (H3PO4). X-
ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy 
(EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to characterize the morphology, composition and 
distribution of the particles. The Thermos gravimetric analysis (TGA-DTA) was also carried out to evaluate the 
stability of the synthesized HA powder. The particle-size distribution (PSD) of the powder was determined by the 
laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer. The results showed that the sintered at 1000¬∞C of HA powder 
resembles the feature of pure and single apatite phase having favorable Ca/P ratio.

1. Introduction  
  
Calcium phosphate biomaterials are widely used in the medical field due to their resemblance to bone matrix (Jordan 
et al. 1998). To become an interesting bone substitute, calcium phosphates must have certain biological properties, 
themselves closely dependent on their physicochemical characteristics (Orlovskii et al. 2002).  
 
Hydroxyapatite (HAp) is one of the most common forms of calcium phosphate with the chemical formula Ca10 
(PO4)6(OH)2 with a theoretical mass composition of 39.68% Ca, 18.45% P , and a Ca/P molar ratio equal to 1.667. 
This HA Ca/P ratio reveals excellent biocompatibility (Itoh et al. 2001, Smolen et al. 2013) and bioactivity (Noh et al. 
2010, Fathi et al. 2008). It is used for filling lesions in bone tissue or as a covering. Many efforts have been made to 
produce good quality HAp with adequate biocompatible properties, while seeking economical and non-polluting 
methods (Huang et al. 2011, Sadat-shojai et al. 2013). It is characterized by its biocompatibility, non-toxicity and ose-
integration (MohdPu'ad et al. 2011). This apatite can be produced by chemical or synthetic method or from natural 
waste.  
 
Hydroxyapatite (HAp) can be synthesized using a variety of techniques, classified into: dry, wet and high temperature 
methods. The most usually used methods to obtain HAp are chemical precipitation (Dhang et al. 2014, Stipniece et al. 
2014, Kimet al. 2010), biogenic sources (Huang et al. 2011, Kamalanathan et al. 2014); among others. Each of these 
methods results in different sizes and morphologies, as well as different crystal phases of calcium phosphate in addition 
to pure crystalline PHA. Therefore, these characteristics influence the bioactivity, mechanical and biological properties 
of PHA (Cahyaningrum et al 2018). Many apatite synthesis methods are proposed in the literature. Among them, two 
main categories stand out: synthesis by the dry route (Arcoset et al. 2004) and the wet route (Raynaud et al. 2002, 
MohdPu'ad et al. 2020). Knowing that the properties determine the application, it is interesting to develop synthetic

In the present study, the synthesis of hydroxyapatite powder by the precipitation method using phosphoric acid from 
the eggshell has been investigated. The main results were summarized as follows:   
  
ÔÇß Eggshell was once found to be a suitable calcium source   
ÔÇß Biogenic sources present sources without any type of contamination which allows to obtain HA powderwith high 
crystallinity and respectful of the environment    
ÔÇß The properties, phase purity and particle size distribution from a natural resource source (eggshell) obtained by 
different experimental techniques (DRX, FTIR, MEB, ...) confirmed the synthesis of hydroxyapatite  
ÔÇß Hydroxyapatite HA prepared by precipitation method from the eggshell is of interest for biomedical applications.

Abstract  
 
Various research areas use models to aid business decisions, but what is done less frequently is investigating and 
determining what business considerations should be used in building those models and why. Therefore, this paper 
focuses on discussing considerations that can have a potential impact on the medium to long-term business decisions 
made in the financial industry, with specific regards to Independent Financial Advisors (IFAs) in South Africa. 
Preliminary considerations are identified from literature including interviews with industry experts, business and 
academic literature as well as regulatory requirements. The preliminary considerations are tested and validated by four 
Financial Services Providers that differ in their business considerations.  From the initial consideration, 11 primary 
and 8 secondary considerations were identified and discussed. Secondary considerations were identified as part of 
future research opportunities on the topic that can be completed when more quantitative data-gathering is completed.   
This study provides new academic insights into the complexity of the financial industry and the opportunities it holds.

1. Introduction and Objectives  
The financial industry globally has seen various cycles over the past several decades, with the impact of globalization 
more evident than ever before. Therefore, it is crucial to make sure that decisions are made based on the best 
information available. 
 
With financial crises in other parts of the world influencing local markets, such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis 
causing market unrest in the US, over the past several decades the devastating effect that the financial industry had, 
has become clearer to all global citizens, not merely to the affluent individuals of the world. This has led to an 
incredible push toward global regulatory standards in the finance industry in particular (Swart and Lawack-Davids, 
2010, MacNeil and O'Brien, 2010, Mahavadi, 2013, Ugeux, 2014, Allen et al., 2018, Price, 2018, Tarullo, 2019, 
Truby, 2020, Yadav, 2020).  
 
Globally it is clear that in some cases there is a disconnect between the problems as perceived by academia and the 
problems that are perceived by industry, the effect of not having proper alignment with industry could have led to 
lower levels of adoption. With the increased use of software systems over the past two decades there were other 
interesting findings. A study by Kim et al. (2012), found that 70 per cent of organizations that invested in CRM 
adoption projects, experienced an unnoticeable improvement in their business performance (Pedron et al., 2016). 
  
The financial industry is faced with some general yet unique challenges when it comes to developing a strategy for a 
specific corporation. While it is crucial to understand the problems that the business currently faces, there is a 
fundamental problem that is introduced when possible future developments in an industry are not considered. 
  
Topics such as FinTech have become increasingly more popular over the past couple of years. However, while 
FinTech 3.0 was primarily focussed on money transfer and automation of essential services, there is a new 
development in the Financial Industry related to regulatory technologies or RegTech (Barefoot, 2018, Arner et al., 
2017a, Arner et al., 2017b). In most cases, FinTech start-ups focus on areas in the financial industry that provide them 
with the most promising opportunity that have less complicated regulatory requirements and fewer barriers to entry,

1558","5. Conclusion and Recommendations  
This research focused on discussing and evaluating what the current businesses environment for FSPs looks like in 
the South African financial industry in specific. What was found is that the considerations as identified from literature 
and previous studies do provide valuable feedback in understanding the business environment and why these 
considerations are applicable. It was also found that the initial considerations that were identified are applicable across 
different IFA businesses and that these considerations assist in understanding what needs to be accounted for in models 
for the financial industry related to the strategic decisions that are made related to the future of the FSP. 
This research works towards finding agreement and consensus between academia and the industry regarding what the 
primary considerations are that can be used in the future, to provide guidance to FSPs in South Africa and possibly 
towards understanding it on a global level, given the global push towards global financial regulatory standards (Ugeux, 
2014). 
 
The study gained insight from past research, regulations, legislations, and business literature as well as current and 
future developments in the financial industry, which is deemed crucial as any future research on this topic will be 
heavily reliant on this foundational research. 
From section 1, the main objectives of the research were, providing an overview of considerations that could be 
extracted from existing literature, which was completed in section 2 as well as enhancing the list of considerations 
and their impact, via expert interviews with FSPs as completed in section 4. 
The primary considerations that were found was: 
‚Ä¢ 
Number of IFAs 
‚Ä¢ 
Number of representatives 
‚Ä¢ 
Number of administrative staff 
‚Ä¢ 
The average administrative staff salary 
‚Ä¢ 
Monthly turnover  
‚Ä¢ 
Focus area(s) provided 
‚Ä¢ 
Total number of clients 
‚Ä¢ 
Targeted client segmentation 
‚Ä¢ 
The information system currently being used 
‚Ä¢ 
Whether business continuity planning is internal or external to the organization 
‚Ä¢ 
How long an FSP is planning on staying in the industry before selling the business 
 
The following were deemed as secondary considerations that can be useful in future research: 
‚Ä¢ 
Percentage commission split for IFAs 
‚Ä¢ 
Percentage commission split for representatives 
‚Ä¢ 
Whether the compliance officer is internal or external to the organization 
‚Ä¢ 
The adoption rate of technology of the FSP 
‚Ä¢ 
How long the FSP has been in the industry 
‚Ä¢ 
Daily available working hours 
‚Ä¢ 
Focus area(s) that clients require 
‚Ä¢ 
Average time that the focus area(s) require 
 
The primary considerations should aid in understanding the business environment of an FSP before moving to 
secondary considerations that can be used to extend future research into the topic of model building in the financial 
industry. 
 
The next phase in this research will be to use the feedback from the IEOM conference participants and perform an 
additional round of validation with the use of surveys, including more than 500 FSPs in South Africa as participants, 
ranging from size and focus area, to reach a point where there can be reasonable assurance that the most critical 
business considerations have been identified and agreed upon. Thus, academia, as well as a larger sample of 
participants, will validate the findings during a second data-gathering cycle, with multiple organizations that have 
preliminary agreed to assist in this process in distributing the survey to their relevant employees and/or members 
where applicable, such as the Financial Intermediaries Association (FIA), which is the most prominent voluntary 
associate in South Africa of its kind.

1568","The considerations are not only important to the FSPs internally, but they can also assist regulators in understanding 
the business environments of the FSPs before new regulations are imposed. In some cases does not seem to be tested 
in the industry and how it will be implemented by the FSPs before the introduction of new regulations as well as a 
lack of best practices from the regulator that smaller FSPs can use as a guideline to assist in the introduction and 
adherence to new regulations (Barefoot, 2018). While regulations are crucial to the financial industry, there is a need 
to critically look from the regulators‚Äô side where preventative regulation is required and, rather than imposing 
regulations as a reactionary measure by possibly having collaboration between industry leaders, academia, and

Abstract  
 
Innovation is becoming more and more a decisive engine of development and economic growth. It impacts the 
economy on different activity scales: (i) at the micro scale (internal business innovation, business creation), (ii) at the 
meso scales (development of new activities) and (iii) at the macro scales (employment and growth). Aware of that, 
policy makers, all over the world, emphasize innovation as a key driver of prosperity and progress in their countries. 
The purpose of this study is to help identify features that can explain variations in the intensity of innovation between 
countries. To better understand national innovative capacities, this study proposes identifying distinct groups (or 
clusters) of countries using their innovation performances. So, available innovation data is used to classify countries 
with common characteristics into meaningful clusters. Then, these clusters are analyzed and new information that 
explains the variation of innovation performance between countries is extracted. To this aim, data representing 121 
countries and 49 indicators are investigated over a period of 5 years. Unsupervised and supervised data analysis models 
are applied using the 2015-2019 GII data. This analysis allows the classification of countries and the clustering of 
those progressing in the same way in terms of innovation. Therefore, 4 major clusters of countries are defined. Another 
important outcome of this study is the identification of key innovation determinants, or key indicators, with superior 
effect on innovation outcomes. The analysis emphasizes distinctly the ‚ÄúUniversity/Industry research collaboration‚Äù 
and ‚ÄúInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT) use‚Äù as the two most important indicators enhancing 
national innovation performances. Four cases studies are also illustrated in this study representing the four innovation 
clusters, namely for the USA, Morocco, China, and Brazil. This study‚Äôs results can assist countries in planning their 
mid-term innovation strategies by providing: (i) a reduced number of relevant determinants to improve, and (ii) a 
focused set of prospective countries for potential benchmarking either intra- or inter-cluster.

1. Introduction  
Innovation has been established as a driving force of growth and economic performance of countries. Therefore, many 
nations facing increased competition have realized the pressing need to innovate (Bhand & Goel, 2017). To improve 
their nation‚Äôs innovative capability, governments often set up different strategies and policies (Porter, 1990, Porter 
and Stern, 1999). In order to monitor and assess the effectiveness of each government‚Äôs intervention in enhancing a 
nation innovation climate, various national innovation performance measures and indexes have been developed 
(Mahroum & Al-Saleh, 2013, Omer et al., 2020). 
 
Measuring innovation at a macro level has evolved through the years. In the 1950s, the focus was on input indicators 
such as R&D expenditure, capital, and science and technology personnel. In 1970s, emphasis was placed on output 
indications such as patents, publications, products and quality change. The third generation followed in 1990s with a 
growth in innovation surveys and benchmarking activities. The fourth generation of innovation measurements turns 
to the process indicators that can be applied at firm and sectoral levels (Godin, 2006, Gault, 2013, Lizuka and 
Hollanders, 2017).

For Brazil, as clearly shown in figure 8, the 3 most important variables are X19, X41 and X3 which all have a negative 
impact. The nature of Brazil's investment in the most important innovation indicators, as defined by our analysis, does 
not allow it to achieve objectives.

5. Conclusions 
The innovation system approach has proven useful in explaining the mechanisms behind varying national economic 
performance. By using GII data over the period 2015-2019, and employing machine learning techniques in the analysis 
of the innovation performance measures, this study offers an explanation of features clarifying variations in the 
intensity of innovation between nations. Proceeding by categorizing countries (121 countries used in our analysis) 
into 4 groups evolving in the same way, we highlight the common characteristics that allow a country to belong to a 
given group. 
 
Among the 49 innovation input indicators analyzed in this study, a subset of indicators, of which the importance and 
the impact on the national innovation system are the highest, is proposed. This subset of key indicators enhancing 
national innovation performance, contains mainly the ICT use, the University/industry research collaboration, the 
government effectiveness, the Logistics performance and the Gross Expenditure on R&D performed by business 
enterprise. 
 
To illustrate and better understand the impact of the proposed subset, the cases study of the USA, Morocco, China and 
Brazil is presented. The analysis allows to understand how the NIS‚Äô key elements influence belonging to a given 
group, and highlight the features that positively or negatively impact the outcome of the efforts made by the country. 
Further analysis is needed to deeply explain and customize innovation indicators especially for countries performing 
below expectations for level of development.

Abstract  
 
The West Corner hotel (WCH) is located in downtown Olongapo city, at the center of the city. The Hotel has 68 
adequately furnished rooms complete with amenities for travelers. This paper aims to create a conceptual model or an 
applicable information system strategy to improve the use of information at the hotel staff‚Äôs disposal. The paper 
utilizes porter‚Äôs five forces of competition to analyze the external factors affecting the Hotel. The current strategies of 
West Corner are Technology as a tool, Staff Training, Budget-Friendly, Accommodations, and Location Strategy. 
Their computing environment includes Wi-Fi, local area network, and their Hotel Management System software: A 
custom-built software. They also utilize Facebook and Google mail to communicate with customers. This paper has 
found that West Corner is underutilizing their technology and the papers recommends to improve their Facebook 
Page‚Äôs messaging bot to improve their communication between customers and staff. The paper concludes that utilizing 
the Facebook Messaging Bot through their Facebook page would be able to improve the Hotel‚Äôs day-to-day functions.

1. Introduction  
Economies today are primarily based upon information technology. Considering that IS/IT strategy provides and 
defines the business needs, it is crucial for hospitality industries to plan and implement these strategies to provide 
general guidance on building and developing future data information systems. Vicente Teng Gui (Owner) came up 
with the name ""West Corner"" because it is located in the West District and corner of the street. West Corner Hotel is 
a newly built five-story budget-friendly travelers' hotel strategically situated in the heart of downtown Olongapo City. 
Being at the city's center, public transportation, fast food, recreational facilities, shopping malls, and tourist attractions 
are easily accessible. The hotel has 68 adequately furnished rooms complete with amenities for travelers. The hotel is 
also five minutes away from Subic Bay Freeport Zone, which is convenient for travelers. Managed by experienced 
hoteliers, West Corner Hotel was established on July 11, 2014, to meet the demand for convenient, comfortable, and 
budget-friendly accommodations in downtown Olongapo City. West corner Hotel is a 2-star hotel, and it started 
because some hotels near the bus terminal (Victory Liner) offer a high price, and they rarely offer wash-up. As a result, 
some preparation is required to integrate IS strategy with West Corner's Hotel business activities. Hence, this paper 
aims to create a conceptual model or an appropriate information system strategy to improve the documentation, 
processes, storage, and use of information at the hotel staff's disposal. This system would be based on the requirements 
that West Corner will ask of as well as improvements that may be found possible through this paper's analysis. The 
objectivesos this paper is to create a detailed analysis of the current status of West Corner‚Äôs IT/IS technologies and to 
To propose a model, strategy, or system that provides more uses for West Corner‚Äôs collected data, and or information, 
from their current IT/IS system in accordance with their customer‚Äôs needs. 
 
2. Literature Review  
Google Duplex is an innovative application of AI chatbot, which can create any reservations over a phone call, wherein 
a client may not notice that they are already engaging in conversations with a bot. Instead of giving direct interaction 
with an individual, the ChatBot program is utilized for communicating via online chat via text or text speaking. But a 
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) ChatBot is a web bot or helpful program to answer some of your customers' most 
commonly asked concerns (Sethi 2020). A novel architecture for recruiting chatbots was described in Vakili and

6. Conclusion 
After a thorough analysis of the current state of the Information Systems and Information Technologies of the West 
Corner Hotel, it was found that the hotel is underutilizing the technology that is currently at its disposal. The paper 
utilized the frameworks of internal and external business analysis in creating a report within this paper, which was 
used to develop several strategies in line with West Corner‚Äôs Mission and Vision. The project that scored the highest 
and recommended by this paper would be pursuing Project 3: Facebook Frequently Asked Questions chat robot 
programming. This project achieved the highest score because it has various utility functions and low initial and 
running costs. Aside from answering customer‚Äôs questions, the bot could also be pre-programmed to show other 
information related to the hotel. Such as the hotel‚Äôs address and location on a map, give customers some 
recommendations for facilities to use in the hotel, and show previous ratings from old customers. In addition to its 
very low initial and running cost, short project development time, and potential customer satisfaction, this utility 
makes it a project that could be initiated immediately without spending too much investment. Programming or setting 
up the messaging bot is relatively easy due to Facebook‚Äôs user-friendly integrated development environment. If an 
FAQ bot was finished, then the next course of action would be the creation of a membership system that would allow 
the hotel to provide member only services for its customers, thus increasing the incentive for customers to keep 
utilizing the services of the hotel and reducing the risk of customers looking for substitutes. Lastly, if the hotel would 
opt for both the above strategies and would want to add more as their business grows, the proposed project would be 
the creation of a website for the hotel: this website could be made by a professional, with the owners and managers 
providing the website requirements, or be created by the hotel‚Äôs staff themselves reducing the potential cost. This 
website would then be used as an online front desk for the hotel and could be used as a central hub for members and 
staff where member only announcements, offers, and deals could be presented. A FAQ bot could also be integrated 
and programmed into the website in order to gain the benefits of the FAQ bot project.

1. Introduction  
The rapid growth of the milk tea industry in the past years has introduced more competition in the market. With the 
industry costing around $2.4 billion in 2019, businesses are looking for ways to tap into the market. Companies create 
their own version of milk tea to better separate them from competitions. La Teacia Artisan Milktea is a small company 
located in Cainta, Rizal. There are a total of three employees that are in charge of the day-to-day operation of the 
business. The business has different types of beverages, but the main product that they sell is milk tea. They focus on 
the affordability of the drinks while maintaining the quality of each of their drinks. The business has a lot going for 
itself, preparing beverages is the main source of revenue for the company. Halting or postponing the production of 
beverages is a major concern for the company. Problems like no steady supplier, bad inventory management, and 
wrong orders are major issues that the company needs to address. The objectives of this research that will help La 
Teacia Artisan Milk tea achieve their own objectives is to ensure that all flavors of the different beverages are available 
at all times. Secondly, to provide excellent and swift service to the customers. Lastly, support or improve the business‚Äô 
current strategies which are the following, product differentiation, improving customer retention and satisfaction, 
marketing strategy, manual accounting, and manual managing of inventory. The goal of this research is to provide 
support for the rapidly growing business that can avoid negative feedbacks from customers and receive more positive 
feedbacks that increase the sales of the business.

With the completed Decision Analysis presented in Table 7, the Inventory Management System project addresses 
the problem of La Teacia Artisan Milk tea currently more than the 2 other projects based on the criteria. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Aligning the inventory management system with the business strategies, how can this inventory management system 
project help the business achieve their objectives with their current strategies. First is customer satisfaction and 
customer retention, one way to satisfy your customers is to provide them a complete menu when they are ordering and 
make sure that the drinks, they usually order, which are the best sellers, are available. If there will be instances that 
they lack supplies or ingredients to be able to make their milk tea, frappes, coffee, and food, this can affect their 
relationship with their customers, and they might lead to ordering from the business' competitors. With this project, 
this can improve their current product differentiation, marketing strategy, and their manual managing of inventory. 
This can improve product differentiation because they can make new flavors by mixing the complete ingredients that 
they have that might produce a drink that will be loved by their customers. This can improve their marketing strategy 
by offering more drinks and exhibiting their whole menu every day because they are all available. Lastly, this will 
improve their manual management of their inventory and will lessen the chance of overlooking the lack of certain 
supplies. 
 
This will help the business in achieving their objectives, specially the second objective which is to provide the whole 
menu for the customer to choose from. This also has an impact on the third objective because the delays in preparing 
their orders will be lessened because the problem about insufficient management of inventory levels is eliminated. 
 
Looking at the cost and how the inventory management will be implemented, the business will be investing in a system 
that can last until they grow more or expand. This costs more and is harder to implement, but the effectiveness and 
efficiency that the system can offer is the investment that the business currently needs based on the problems that they 
are facing today. Knowing that La Teacia Artisan Milk tea is a small business that is rapidly growing, especially in 
the Rizal area, the inventory management system can support its growth and be utilized in the long term.

Abstract 
Determining, resolving, and eliminating weak points in a business is integral for it to succeed. Hence, this gives an 
utmost significance to the existence of proper Information Systems Planning. This paper is a case study for the small 
pizza franchise based at the locality of Pampanga: RS Top Pizza. Although not officially huge and established, it 
consistently competed with its contenders for the past ten years and grew to have multiple branches across the 
province. This paper utilizes several ISP techniques to analyze the processes of the business, determine its possible 
weaknesses, and recommend strategies to eliminate and resolve said issues. These strategies include but are not limited 
to: the utilization of industry analysis (Porter‚Äôs Five Force and External Force Model), business analysis (value chain 
and mapping of BP), synthesizing SWOT and TOWS matrices, creating a Gap Analysis, and IS/IT strategy 
recommendation. Using the strategies mentioned, a new Financial Management System is recommended to improve 
the restaurants' current system as its more inclined with the businesses‚Äô current needs.

1. Introduction 
Competition in the fast-food industry is tight, especially since it‚Äôs one of the fastest-growing industries in the market. 
Each business utilizes different strategies to gain an edge against the competitors, with leading brands operating on 
massive scales. Despite that, smaller companies still attain a significant part in the market share, with customers 
constantly looking for newer and better options, with preferences varying for each person. But fast-food innovation 
does not strictly pertain to having a unique food menu. The utilization of information technology is still integral to 
making the business process flow seamlessly (ERP systems, financial recording system, etc.) and establishing a better 
reputation for the business (marketing, promotions, etc.). 
Rosana Sanchez (RS) Top Pizza is a pizzeria restaurant with multiple chains located around the province of Pampanga. 
Apart from various pizza flavors, they also offer other Western-appealing food on their menu, including burgers, 
salads, fries, tacos, and baked mac. The restaurant was first founded on July 19, 2011, by Mrs. Rosana Sanchez. Their 
first branch was established on Stall 9, 10/27 Gas Station, Juan Luna Street, Barangay Minane, Rosepark 2316 
Concepcion, Tarlac.Currently, the pizzeria has multiple chains scattered around Pampanga, namely in Apalit, Arenas, 
Capas, Concepcion, Balibago, Lakandula Dau, Hensonville, San Antonio Mexico, and in 13 more locations. Mrs. 
Rosana Sanchez was a former Shakey‚Äôs employee. This became the inspiration of her partaking in the pizzeria business 
venture, which had eventually succeeded and grown as reflected by its current state. What made the pizzeria business 
so appealing to the mass is its affordability. RS Top Pizza attempts to create a menu specifically catered for the 
common mass, at a price-point less than the value it offers. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
This study aims to understand and assess the current IT/IS situation of RS Top Pizza and its business process and give 
recommendations for improvements. Specifically, the researchers are aiming to: 
‚Ä¢ 
Analyze the current business process, objectives, organizational structure, and restaurant's current IT/IS situation. 
‚Ä¢ 
Determine the best strategy for improvement and propose a new system to RS Top Pizza.

financial data. This will help the business owner with collecting necessary data from each branch without having to 
contact each franchisee owner and lessen the problems caused by the dissemination of information. Both parties 
will now only have to message or contact each other when there is a problem with any inputted data in the financial 
system or with any other business meetings. With this proposed system, both problems mentioned in the gap 
analysis as well as the failure points will be lessened. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Through the utilization of different strategic planning tools, the team was able to come up with the proposed 
projects that aim for the betterment of the current status of the company‚Äôs information systems. Although not 
everything cannot be implemented immediately, it could be done in a sequential manner once the company has 
attained enough resources for the implementation of these projects. RS Top Pizza is still a growing business with a 
lot of potential to expand to a greater scaler. With the integration of proper information systems as outlined by this 
research project and an appealing business model under the fast-food industry standards, its goal of expanding to a 
nationwide scale may be realized sooner than it anticipates.

Abstract 
 
The coronavirus pandemic affects almost all countries with an unknown duration and the activities of Peruvian 
universities have had to adapt to non-face-to-face education, having emerged new demands that are reflected at the 
level of the processes. In this sense, in the field of university training it is important that teachers acquire mastery in 
the application of relevant methodologies and tools for the remote adaptation of academic activities and the evaluation 
of learning that ensure results equivalent to those achieved with the evaluation face-to-face. For this purpose, it is vital 
to check the effectiveness on the learning evaluation side. Considering, given the continuity of the health emergency, 
that the institutions must maintain the educational service they provide to society and, at the same time, be able to 
ensure compliance with the accreditation criteria, it is proposed to ensure educational quality through a systemic 
approach to identify the components involved and their implementation considering the teamwork of teachers and 
authorities. The authorities have to lead the project in a participatory way and incorporate the best practices that 
demonstrate its effectiveness since there are no previous experiences.

1. Introduction 
Since 2020, as is known, the country is in a health emergency motivated by the coronavirus pandemic that has 
significantly altered the lives of citizens and the various activities in all sectors of society, including those that they 
are developed in the university higher education institutions. 
 
In Peru, by means of a Presidency Resolution of the National Superintendency of Higher University Education-
SUNEDU (2020), the criteria for the supervision of the adaptation of non-face-to-face education were approved, on 
an exceptional basis, of the subjects in the different Faculties and Graduate Schools, as a consequence of the health 
emergency measures in the country; constituting the legal framework that allows the temporary development of non-
contact classes, exceptionally, in university academic programs. 
 
In this context, the Ricardo Palma University has had to implement the non-face-to-face teaching modality whose 
activities are carried out online or synchronously and offline, that is, asynchronously, meaning a new situation to 
which our academic community has to adapt and the institution itself is also responsible for strengthening the culture 
of evaluation of its administrative and academic management as postulated in the work of Aguilera (2017). 
 
So far, the problem is clear. Now the topic focuses on the possibilities as alternative solutions. With this purpose and 
from the outset, the demand for training that has been taking place since April 2020 has been experienced, to which 
the majority of teachers have reacted favorably, showing not only their institutional identification but also their 
commitment to provide a better education in unexpectedly different circumstances, which implies at the same time an 
unexpected renewal of the profile of university teachers. On the other hand, as a characteristic that should be 
highlighted in today's youth, students are close to new information and communication technologies as part of their 
environment, which significantly facilitates their adaptation.

1621","4. Conclusions 
‚Ä¢ The quality assurance of professional training will depend on the systemic approach applied to the remote adaptation 
of educational activities, considering all the factors or components involved and their implementation considering the 
teamwork of teachers and authorities. 
 
‚Ä¢ The multifactorial nature of educational processes is confirmed, in whose systemic approach, elements such as 
periodic surveys for teachers and students must participate as part of the monitoring mechanisms, norm as mandatory 
the use of online questionnaires as part of the instruments of periodic evaluation of learning, supervising the teaching 
tasks directly and randomly by sampling the total of teachers in each semester. With special emphasis, it is 
recommended to consider a training program that includes evaluation for teachers to deepen the use of methodologies 
and tools for teaching and evaluating non-face-to-face learning, trying to generate an environment of collaboration 
and support between authorities and teachers, which form the basis for ensuring quality professional training. 
 
‚Ä¢ The management in charge of the authorities has to lead the project in a participatory manner and incorporating the 
best practices demonstrate their effectiveness, considering that we are facing an uncertain situation, there are no 
previous experiences and there are growing needs and expectations in society.

Abstract 
 
Supply chains face challenges associated with operations natural conditions and products characteristics. There is a 
growing trend in the new risk identification that may be associated with public health, socioeconomic and 
environmental factors, which condition productive activities planning and execution. SCRM aims to identifying, 
measuring and mitigating the risks in organizations. We developed a raw material supply methodology that allows 
defining material flow management policies (MTS, MTO), considering operating risks and costs. We identify risks 
and inventory positioning criteria with experts help. Subsequently, we measure risk through a system dynamics 
simulation model and mitigation actions, through valorized scenarios that produce the raw material supply 
configuration with a short shelf life. This methodology was evaluated in a Colombian meat products company. We 
compared the MTO, MTS according to DDMRP and MTS according to coverage, under nine scenarios where demand 
and production sources were varied. Operating costs results to MTO methodology are better, with 48% decrease 
compared to MTS according to DDMRP, and 28% compared to MTS according to coverage. In terms of service level 
and robustness, the MTS methodology according to coverage has a slight advantage with 99.62%, compared to MTO 
and MTS according to DDMRP, with 99.49% and 98.71% respectively.

1. Introduction 
In recent decades, there has been evidence of alterations due to climate change effects, high pollution volumes and 
progressive biodiversity loss, as reported by the World Economic Forum (WEF, 2020). This constrains the production, 
storage and transportation processes in supply chains, increasing the possibility of generating differences between 
planning and result of all their activities. Organizations dedicated to food handling and transformation face risk factors 
generated by the material perishability that requires reconfiguring their processes according to the product 
requirements to increase the material shelf life and this increases the company's operational costs due to the waste

orders in the processing plants are also created daily. Dimensional consistency allows the conservation of matter in 
the system (Sterman 2000), (Mohapatra et al. 1994), which can be seen in the parameter analysis, the model structure 
and the results shown in the previous chapters. Finally, the validation of the behavior was carried out by means of the 
appreciation of the experts, to whom the logic of the exercise and the results delivered were explained, obtaining a 
favorable response to the reality representativeness. 
 
6. Conclusions 
Inventory positioning criteria must be taken into account when setting up a SC. This work shows the importance of 
including the characteristics of the products that are transformed throughout the operations in the SC. The shelf life 
creates an important restriction in this definition. The loss of the cold chain, impact by information disseminated in 
the mass media and uncertainty in the acquisition costs of RM and supplies are recognized as the most relevant risks 
in operations. Its materialization generates product loss, greater variation in demand or supply. Modeling the SC with 
a shelf life restriction in your products, allows you to link the largest number of process variables and evaluate the 
cost and risk of operations, and the appropriate configuration to manage inventories in each link. In this particular 
case, where the MRM has five days of shelf life, of which two are consumed in logistics operations, it is recommended 
to activate the productive nodes according to the MTO methodology. When inventory positioning is generated, either 
under DDMRP or under coverage, total costs can increase by 48% and 28% respectively. The costs of operations are 
highly sensitive to few changes in demand or production. Controlling the product flow using MTO, throughout a SC 
with a strong shelf life restriction, increases its robustness, by controlling the risks of expiration of its raw material. 
This without significantly affects the service level, which stands at 99.48%. Research on new performance measures 
for this type of SC is considered future work, accompanied by the need to model new instances, such as the 
coordination of activities when there are non-working days that consume the shelf life of the product. Additionally, 
the complete link of the financial chapter, by including the generated income and indicators such as EBITDA margin 
or ROIC, can provide a greater understanding of the full impact on the SC.

Abstract  
 
The occurrence of long dwelling times, lack of investment to support port sustainability, environmental pollution, 
and the lack of advanced technology used are still common in Indonesia. Developing comprehensive port 
performance is essential to boost the results. This study aims to model an integrated framework to boost port 
performance. The design conceptual framework integrates performance measurement using the BSC and PESTLE 
methods with the concepts of sustainability, smart and green port. The BSC method is used as a measure of the 
company's overall performance but focuses more on internal, while PESTLE is used as a measure of the external 
performance of ports. Based on the literature study result, these methods are proven to be used as a port performance 
measurement tool, so they need to be integrated because the company must be in a competitive position with the 
required internal and external information. Therefore, the conceptual framework is expected to boost port 
performance in a complex manner.

1. Introduction 
Port is one of the maritime sector's leading facilities, which has functions related to loading and unloading of goods, 
arrival and departure of ships, storage of goods, and others. In recent years, all world regions mostly carry out the 
process of exchanging goods by sea (Siroka et al. 2021). The port is a complex entity that faces several problems. 
The first problem faced by Indonesian ports is long dwelling time, which affects port operating costs such as 
increased inventory costs and shipping uncertainty. Per 2018, Indonesia has a dwelling time of 5.08 days. This 
number is higher than neighboring countries such as Singapore, which has a dwelling time of 1.5 days, Malaysia has 
a dwelling time of 4 days, and Thailand has a dwelling time of 5 days (Hassan et al. 2020). According to Ministerial 
Regulation No. PM 116 in 2016, international ports in Indonesia have a maximum dwelling time of three days 
(Utami et al. 2020). It shows that Indonesia's dwelling time is still below the standard of the Ministerial Regulation 
that made. Therefore, ports must strive to reduce dwelling time to improve their performance so that ports can 
continue developing and competing with overseas ports. 
 
Second, port development is profitable for investors as well as regional economic development. However, 
unfortunately, the investment provided has not met the funding target needed to support port sustainability (Aurora 
et al. 2020). On the other hand, significant infrastructure development can have adverse effects on the environment. 
One of the most significant environmental problems that ports need to pay attention to is the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions (Christodoulou and Cullinane, 2019). Air pollution caused by greenhouse gas emissions 
harms human health and the environment in the port area. Other impacts arising from greenhouse gas emissions are 
flooding, famine, and economic instability that can even lead to global warming. Based on the explanation above, it 
is known that environmental problems need to be considered because they are related to sustainable port plans and 
port growth.

Familiarization training of first responders in metro subways is quintessential for strengthening their occupational

effectiveness of the line‚Äôs fire life safety systems and facilities on responders‚Äô familiarity training on the aspects of 
cognitive fluency, prototypicality, and habit. It was established that the fire safety tools, facilities, and technologies 
employed along the line have the potential to provide responders with immersive - interactive/engaging learning that

Fixed guide way transit and passenger rail systems are efficient means of transporting a large population of passengers. 
Codified fire safety standards specific to fixed guide way transit and passenger rail systems, however, are less than 40 
years old (Devlin, 2014). 
 
Subway systems in Boston, New York, London, and Paris have been in continuous operation for more than 100 years. 
The metro is currently constructing an extension of the 16 station Purple Line from Wilshire/Western (Figure 1) to 
the Westside of Los Angeles, terminating at Westwood/Veteran‚Äôs Administration Hospital (Figure 2).  The nine-mile 
extension will include seven stations and is expected to begin its revenue operations in 2023. The Purple Line project 
is fitted with advanced fire life safety systems, technologies, and facilities which ultimately give it a competitive edge 
over other lines in terms of fire mitigation, effectiveness and efficiency of emergency evacuation, and familiarity 
training of responders. The line has not experienced any fire safety system activation incidence since it 
operationalization. However, it offers responders a new platform for familiarity training and advanced preparation for 
fire evacuation. This study explores and analyzes how the fire safety tools, technologies, and facilities installed on the 
Metro Red Line/Purple Line enhances the familiarity training - cognitive fluency, prototypicality, and habit - of the 
first responders compared to the older lines.

1654","13. Conclusion 
Fires, derailments, physical rescues and other types of emergencies in the metro rail subway systems present a 
significant challenge to first responders. The type and severity of an incident could range from smoke on a train with 
no casualties, to a crash and derailment with multiple victims. Due to the significant depths of some areas of the 
subway system as well as issues with access, communications and ventilation, responders must have familiarity with 
fire/life safety features and their functions and engage in a coordinated response to incidents occurring in stations or 
tunnels to reduce loss of life.

Abstract  
 
Supply chain management has evolved from local and regional purchasing and supply activities prior to the industrial 
revolution, to the current form of technology-led, data-driven, collaborative, and global supply network. Adoption of 
contracts among the channel members enables optimization, coordination, and decision-making. Through literature 
reviews based on sourcing, production, logistics, and others areas within supply chain are rich in their respective areas, 
systematic analyses of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) are lacking. We examine studies on CLSC to discover the 
knowledge and direction of researches through systematic bibliometric analysis. We adopt citation, co-citation, and 
co-occurrence of closed-loop supply chain research articles from 2001 to 2021 using data obtained from the SCOPUS 
database to identify and validate the themes and sub-themes in this research area.

1. Introduction  
Recently, there is an increasing concern regarding environmental pollutions such as electronic waste (e-waste). In this 
regard, many countries have considered various measures for intensifying legislative efforts such as Extended 
Producers Responsibilities (EPR) regarding the protection of the environment and resources (Hammond and Beullens, 
2007). These initiatives lead to the adoption of practices like collection and remanufacturing of used items (Paksoy et 
al., √ñzceylan, 2011; Kuo, 2011) directly by companies or indirectly through partnerships around the world. 
 
Electronics giants such as Samsung, Brother, Apple, Hewlett-Packard, and Kodak have collection programs for used 
products. These programs promote social prestige of the organizations and also benefits them through manufacturing 
cost reduction (Guide et al., 2003; Zhang and Ren, 2016). The collection and remanufacturing of used products 
(closed-loop supply chain (CLSC)) reduces both the raw material requirement and the amount of waste produced and 
contributes to the development of economy and the environment. Companies like Croma, Apple, Panasonic, and LG 
adopt incentive schemes for consumers to exchange the old devices. Through such initiatives they create awareness 
on e-waste and help in reducing hazardous waste flowing into the earth from e-waste dumping. Apple currently uses 
100% recycled rare earth and tin in its new iPhones and iPads, LG engages only with recycling companies that do not 
incinerate, contribute to landfill, or export hazardous waste to developing countries and runs an ‚ÄòExchange and Take 
back‚Äô program, Panasonic and Chinese phone maker Xiaomi engage the youth for creating awareness on 
environmental issues related to e-waste.  
 
Companies like Kodak, HP, and Canon focus on reverse logistics to obtain used products from customers, which helps 
in generating more profits (Savaskan and Van Wassenhove, 2006). There are various ways of returning/collecting 
used items from the end customers in CLSC are studied in literature. These are manufacturer direct collection, the 
retailer or a third-party collection, and dual-channel where both the manufacturer and retailer/third party or a retailer 
and third-party collection, etc. In this regard, contract mechanisms such as revenue-sharing, wholesale price, two-part 
tariff, reward-penalty, etc. have been developed and studied to collect and recycle the end-of-use and the end-of-life 
products for different situations (Wang et al., 2018; Taleizadeh et al., 2018).  Studies have shown that adoption of 
such contracts in CLSC can help achieve higher overall supply chain profit (Chang and Zhang, 2008; Bellantuono and 
Pontrandolfo, 2011; Paksoy et al., 2011; Zunya et al., 2016; Feng et al., 2017; Zou et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2020; 
Hosseini-Motlagh et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021).

3.9 Bibliometric analysis of Keyword analysis  
Further analysis was carried out on the corpus to obtain insights on the different themes that are studied by different 
researchers. VOSviewer (Version 1.1.15) was used to obtain the keyword map consisting of different clusters of keywords 
(Figure 5).  A minimum of 9 occurrences of the keywords was used which resulted in 24 relevant keywords. These 25 
words were automatically classified into four clusters by the software. Some of the words that are most repeated in each 
cluster were: 
ÔÉò Cluster 1: Sales, competition, pricing 
ÔÉò Cluster 2: Remanufactured products, closed-loop supply chains (CLSC), sustainable development, supply 
chain 
ÔÉò Cluster 3: Reverse channel, optimization, used product 
ÔÉò Cluster 4: Quantity-discount contracts, channel coordination, whole-sale prices 
 
 
From the most occurring words we can summarize that cluster 1 mostly focuses on optimal pricing, cluster 2 on 
sustainability, cluster 3 on reverse channel optimization, and cluster 4 on different contracts. 
 
4. Conclusion and Future Research 
Recently, there is an increasing concern regarding environmental pollutions such as electronic waste. Many 
researchers have been focusing on the adoption of contract mechanisms among the channel members to reduce e-
waste and to optimize the profitability of the supply chain members. Due to the increasing concern for environmental 
degradation and focus on reducing the sources, many studies are carried out. In this regard, this study considers a 
bibliometric analysis approach to quantitatively analyze the literature on closed-loop supply chain with contracts. This 
study aims to identify the extend and the areas of study. The data for this study was extracted from SCOPUS database, 
and the first study was found to be published in December of 2001 making the corpus consisting of two decades of 
research. All the tables and figures are obtained by analysing the corpus in VOSviewer. Different analyses carried out 
in this study indicate that most of the work are concentrated or limited to few researchers, countries, and journals 
indicating that there is scope for further studies. From the co-occurrence analysis, we can summarize the themes that 
have been studied as price optimization, environmental sustainability, reverse channel optimization, and adoption of 
contracts.

we used data obtained from SCOPUS database. In future research, it will be useful to add more keywords and do the 
analysis in the corpus obtained and/or use data from other database like Web of Science. Second, we used different 
combinations of keywords to identify and extract data for analysis. This search is based on our review of the literature 
and our understanding of the area. However, this set of keywords can be different as well. If different keywords are 
used, it may result in a corpus that is different from what we obtained. Third, this study employed only citation, co-
citation, and co-occurrence analyses. Other methods such as factor analysis, cluster analysis and principle-component 
analysis can be used to identify and complement the findings. Fifth, apart from the analysis we have performed, 
thematic analysis can be used to classify and understand the themes of research. It will be useful to employ thematic 
analysis to cross-validate the themes we identified through co-occurrence analysis.

Abstract 
 
 
Permanent magnets are one of the supporting materials for components in electronic equipment. In particular, 
NdFeB magnets are usually used in low-speed generators. Another alternative that can be used is BaFe12O19. A 
study has been carried out using the sintering process to obtain the value of the magnetic energy of BaFe12O19. The 
magnetic energy data obtained were processed using Multiple Linear Regression Analysis to examine the 
relationship between the sintering process and magnetic energy in increasing the magnetic properties of BaFe12O19. 
The predictor variables are temperature, T (deg C) and time, t (hours), and response variable is magnetic energy. The 
temperature levels are 750 deg C, 800 deg C and 850 deg C and the time levels are 8 hours, 10 hours and 12 hours. It 
was found that there was a very significant relationship between the sintering process and magnetic energy in 
increasing the magnetic properties of the permanent magnet BaFe12O19 (p-value > 0.01) and R2 = 83.61%. The 
resulting model can be used to predict the average value of magnetic energy if the sintering process is carried out at a 
certain temperature and time. If the temperature is 900 deg C and the time 10 hours, the predicted mean value of 
magnetic energy is 113.611 T.kA/m.

1676","In the third prediction, the data used are the temperature and time values of the sintering process, not the data used 
to construct the model. This can be seen in the prediction output (highlighted in yellow). Using this model, we can 
predict that if we take a temperature of 900¬∞C and a time of 14 hours, we get an average value of magnetic energy is 
113.611 T.kA/m. 
with the value of R2 is 83.61%. 
This means that for every 1¬∞C increase in sintering temperature, the average value of magnetic energy (ME) will 
increase by 0.3874 T.kA/m and for every 1 hour increase in sintering time, the average value of magnetic energy 
(ME) will increase by 8.09 T.kA/m.

Abstract 
 
The paper explores and reviews the mathematical optimization models that have been developed seeking to 
incorporate Light Electric Vehicles (LEV) for urban load distribution in logistics distribution models. This exploration 
is done through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with the purpose of making a deep understanding of the 
optimization functions, the decision variables, and the parameters that have been used in the reviewed research. In 
addition, this study investigates the attention that this issue has received in recent years in different optimization 
approaches such as distribution time, greenhouse gas emissions, or operating costs. Furthermore, this paper highlights 
the relevance of in-depth research that allows the development of new mathematical models that make evident the 
viability of the implementation of eco-friendly cargo vehicles in Latin American cities‚Äô distribution systems in terms 
of costs, and the need for a replicable model-construction methodology in locations with similar characteristics. The 
novelty of this paper, therefore, relies on the specific exploration of mathematical model-based publications, and deep 
analysis and comparison of their variables, parameters, and restrictions. This paper identifies the five different 
optimization approaches that have been used globally for the incorporation of LEV in urban logistics and compares 
the 25 main parameters and 7 main variables used among these models.

1. Introduction 
Population growth in large cities is not a new issue, as well as the migration of thousands of people from rural areas 
to cities in search of greater opportunities, better quality of life and greater security, among other reasons. Currently, 
55% of the population resides in urban areas globally, and this percentage is forecast to increase to 70% by 2050 
(United Nations, 2020). These numbers may not have a big impact at first glance, but when translating the percentages 
into number of people, this increase would represent approximately 2.5 billion more people living in cities, bringing 
with them multiple implications.  
 
This trend can be clearly observed in the cities of Latin America, where today it is estimated that 80% of the population 
lives in urban areas. However, this percentage is forecast to rise to 86% in 2050 (United Nations, 2019). With this, it 
is very clear that more and more challenges are approaching in large cities, and one of them is related to mobility and 
transport because, in the words of Juli√°n Sastre, consultant on transport and city issues, ‚ÄúUrbanism and mobility make 
up an inseparable binomial‚Äù (Sastre, 2017).  
 
It is estimated that the transportation industry generates 24% of CO2 emissions worldwide. This is due, in large part, 
to trucks and other large cargo or transport vehicles, which highlights the need for international interest and focus on

as this is the first document that evaluates and concentrates the different optimization models for the introduction of 
LEV in urban distribution models, considering their mathematical construction process. Future research should focus 
on the creation of a mathematical model of cost optimization, with its corresponding sensitivity analysis, that allows 
to identify the ranges of the parameters under which the use of LEV in last-mile urban distribution models is profitable.

ABSTRACT 
 
There is lack of solar power improvement and the early failing of solar panels make solar to be unsustainable in 
the region of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The article focuses on ensuring the important role solar plays as it shows 
capabilities for replacing fuel energy. Research analysis demonstrated the high level of unsustainability which led 
to an early failure of a solar system. New project implementation comes with high financial commitment for the 
success of the solar project. However, this article focuses on what causes early failure which reduces the trust on 
the solar power system to many potential  
 
customers and the interested parties. This article adopts root cause and statistical analyses to reveal the major 
challenges to analyze the solar challenges in the region. An improvement and sustainability of solar power can 
come very handy in reducing the electricity demand in KZN. Results show that solar particles deteriorate due to 
high energy consumption. A necessary step will be guided by the recommendation made in the study that analyzes 
all the contributors. Solar Technology transformation throughout the region needs to be researched further to 
address less technical challenges.  
  
Keywords:  
Solar power, contributors, unsustainability, Implementation.   
   
Introduction   
Solar power is the next promising energy provider because of its response to the environment and its capability 
(Han, Sun, & Wu, 2020). In the current years, energy is vital for numerous activities which include household 
consumption. Solar power sustainability becomes the major part in transforming energy supply in the region of 
KZN. Virous studies found that KZN region has diversified renewable energy like solar, wind, geothermal and 
hydropower among others (Mutombo & Numbi, 2019).  
 
In South Africa, majority of electricity is generated from coal and in recent years this type of energy generation 
showed some side effects to the environment and to the life span of human being. Renewable energy was then 
discovered as the reliable alternative to deal with issues of high CO2 production from the fossil fuel energy.  Based 
on historical information, local government emissions such as the eThekwini Municipality account to almost 6% 
of the total eThekwini emission which was found to be 27 067 912 tCO‚ÇÇe (Municipality 2015, 2016). The research 
reveals that 8.5-kiloWatt peak is the most viable size per day to the grid solar system in terms of economy in one 
day.  
 
The diagram presented in figure 1 clearly demonstrates the growing energy consumption in South Africa. If in 
1990 there was a demand of almost 10000 TWh per year and 30 years later there is almost 25000 TWh, it is clear 
that soon the demand will double itself if potential renewable energy is ignored.

1698","During the root cause analysis of solar power in the KZN region, the process of implementation was also discussed 
in detail. A financial analysis was also used to indicate the cost effectiveness of all the processes. However, a 
process flow did not form part of the study analysis.  
 
A conclusive analysis is that interjoining of all contributors should be created with equal approach as they interlink 
to each other failure rate.   Solar power failure is due because of numerous contributors mentioned in the study. 
Therefore, the authors fully support the technological analysis and implementation. This will ensure a different 
mechanism from the coal energy.   
  
CONCLUSION  
The importance of solar power sustainability in the region of KwaZulu-Natal, is the major contributor in dealing 
with renewable energy in the region. The growth of solar power depends on its sustainability. The outcome of this 
solar power unsustainability investigation was highlighted, among other things, a lack of education on solar power.  
The root causes of solar power unsustainability were discovered in the region of KZN using the special tool for 
determining the root causes. There are indulgences (such as the solar power policy gap) that are hindering 
implementation of solar power in the region that eThekwini municipality needs to deal with. According to the root 
cause outcome, solar power sustainability relies on solar power (SP) policing, SP financing, SP technology 
controlling and understanding. Monyei et al., (2018) agreed that some solar power problems exist because of 
policy fall-out.  
 
The solar power root causes concluded that solar power installation was not growing as in other provinces such 
as the Western Cape. Financial support appeared to be the main obstacle to solar power installation as was outlined 
in the study. If solar power continues to be unsustainable in eThekwini municipality, the well-known impact will 
be increased energy demand and lack of sponsors to give financial support. The solar power financing will 
continue to depend on governmental support. As solar power implementation is not trusted by many citizens of 
eThekwini region, marketing of this commodity needs to be vastly improved. Strategic marketing will lead to 
improved solar power education.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this paper is to determine the current methods and data sources used to model mode choice for 
transportation of the population in universities and urban areas. We performed a systematic literature review to 
compare the different methods, techniques, data sources, and metrics used to model mode choice behavior and evaluate 
its performance. A mode choice model is a discrete choice model, which predicts a choice in a set of discrete 
alternatives; it describes the selection of a transportation mode from an individual, in disaggregated models, or a 
percentage of a population, in aggregated models. We collected a total of 60 primary studies after searching on 
different databases from 1982 to 2021, most of them being published in journals. The studied areas range from small 
regions, such as universities, to wider regions, like metropolitan areas. As most of the models in the studied research 
papers used data collected from surveys the authors created for that specific research, we advise to ensure that the data 
sources for the model training contain the required sample characteristics and variables. If such database is not 
available, performing a survey as an initial data gathering phase is recommended. Another finding is that mode choice 
models can be categorized as econometric, in which parameter estimation is interpretable, and black box models, in 
which parameters are not explicit, therefore practical interpretations about the relation of each variable with the mode 
choice probability cannot be made. We conclude that applying econometric models is still recommended for initial 
experiences developing discrete choice models, as they continue to be widely used. Given that they are composed of 
a utility function, followed by the application of a model, such as the Logit and its variants, a recently used option 
consists of incorporating black box algorithms for the utility calculation, enhancing the quality of predictions, and 
then applying econometric models to keep parameter interpretability. The study and application of mode choice 
models have increased, having a growing number of publications in recent years. Additionally, applied algorithms 
have evolved and range from specialized artificial neural networks such as the deep neural networks, to classification 
algorithms, such as the random forest classifier. Therefore, we expect the relevance of this research area to continue 
growing as technology and new methods develop.

Abstract 
 
Product testing is vital when buying a cosmetic product to ensure it fits or looks good on someone's skin tone. In 2020, 
the world was hit by the Covid-19, a deadly and contagious virus because it spreads when a person inhales an aerosol 
or droplets containing the virus. Usually, cosmetic products are being tested by buyers through mall testers. Mall 
testers have disease-causing bacteria that can lead to a skin infection. This study aims to assess a mobile application 
design that uses augmented reality and artificial intelligence to be a virtual consultant and skin analyzer. This study 
uses a survey questionnaire based on six thinking hats to gather data and SWOT analysis to analyze the data. Based 
on the collected data, the researchers conclude that a virtual try-on is effective in trying a cosmetic product and will 
be patronized by makeup enthusiasts and artists. For women in their late adolescence or early adulthood, The Perfect 
Shade has a lot of appeals. According to the findings, the group should market the product by micromarketing to 
beauty gurus online. Investing in a robust AI algorithm will increase the product's security against security concerns.

1. Introduction  
Makeup testers are used in physical stores to see what product would complement their skin tone and look. Richard 
Khaw, the deputy of director of the School of Chemical & Life Sciences at Nanyang Polytechnic, said that makeup 
testers that are high in moisturizers, liquid foundations, and vitamin-infused face masks could contain lots of disease-
causing bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus that leads to skin infections and the acne-causing Propionibacterium. 
These bacteria that can be found on the testers come from the shoppers themselves (Khim, 2021)   
  
Knowing there are sanitary dilemmas in the old way of testing makeups, consumers greatly acknowledge the solution. 
A consumer study showed 63% of consumers would no longer use the traditional form of testing makeups. Not only 
do the consumers benefit from the application from being safe from being in contact with germs and diseases, but they 
will have the liberty of trying out a variety of products and colors, with the same confidence of either buying or not 
buying the product (Perfect365, 2018).  
  
A mobile application that will utilize Augmented Reality product visualization will be the solution to minimize the 
usage of makeup testers and lessen contracting a disease from these testers, as seen on Figure 1. AR allows the users 
to interact with the makeups virtually and immediately see the results in just a few seconds. Artificial Intelligence will 
also suggest which shade of the product is the best for the user's skin tone. This will help the users make decisions and 
reduce their time thinking about what's the right shade.  
  
Also, the developers added a skin analyzer feature wherein the mobile application will be suggesting a makeup or a 
product that is perfect for the skin tone of the buyer by using Artificial Intelligence. In this innovative way of choosing, 
buying, and trying makeup, makeup enthusiasts don't have to worry about those contractible diseases, and makeup 
brands don't need to spend money every month for their makeup artists in their boutiques.

1708","as AI and accurate try-on, and good valued suggestions for makeup. An application that gives important suggestions 
and is reliable in trying various products. in terms of marketing, the application is in line with the current generation 
being molded with technology. Also, in having various brands occurring left and right, the application enables fair 
advertisement where they are shown equally and by their suitability to unique skin types and color. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The researchers were able to collect data that encapsulates the preference of the users and reveal areas of improvement 
by using the six thinking hats strategy. The six thinking hats strategy effectively dig deep into the user's thoughts and 
develop a marketable version of the service product. The design effectively revealed what the service product should 
retain, improve, and how it should market. The Perfect Shade has high marketability for women in the late adolescents 
or young adulthood stage. The group is found to be conscious both in their appearance and the application's potential 
benefits in their daily life.  
 
The researchers discovered that the marketing, use of innovative technology, and safety are the strategies that should 
be further improved and developed to ensure the marketability of the application. Based on the research, the group 
should market the product by appealing to beauty guru's online through micro marketing. Beauty gurus are vital to 
making human connections and utilizing their influence on those who watch them. The effect of these micro 
populations would impact the potential buyers, assuring them that the product is worth the use because beauty gurus 
have a positive review on them. The study showed that the use of innovative technology delivers convenience to its 
customers. It enables them to do things at a click of a button. As technology continues to evolve, the possibilities our 
mobile phones bring become limitless. To improve the product's safety against security issues, investing in a good AI 
algorithm that won't collect any data from the device after the user permits the application is better. Also, the mobile 
application should provide a pop-up message that will notify the users that it will need permission to get the photo 
that the users want to edit.

Abstract 
Emergencies happen at an unexpected time and usually requires immediate action. SAFE is a mobile application for 
Android phones that aims to be a tool that the community can use when reporting an accident that needs medical 
attention. Medical responders will also be using this application but will be registered on the rescuer side of the 
application. The application will have features like the navigation system and the chat support that the users can use 
for faster relay of information and communication. This will benefit both the hospital and the patient in terms of the 
emergency responders quickly providing medical attention to the situation, patients are easily located by the medical 
emergency responders because of the GPS provided, and efficiency in time which is critical in terms of emergency 
response.

1. Introduction  
Accidents are an event which humans cannot evade. In a variety of accidents one type of accident is the road accident, 
which occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other stationary 
obstruction. Metropolitan Manila Accidents Reporting and Analysis System (MMARAS) reported that 109,322 
accidents happened from January - December 2016. These resulted in 426 fatality accidents, 16,416 nonfatal, and 
92,480 incidents of damage to properties. In today‚Äôs world there is no application or system invented to avert accidents. 
Most of the time the life of the victim depends upon the mercy of other people. In the meantime, the victim left his/her 
last breath, because the victim cannot reach the hospital timely. The researchers are trying to solve this problem. A 
system using Internet of Things (IoT) by which a witness will report an accident that happened. Nearest rescue team 
will also be notified through the application with location from where the accident occurred. By giving the right 
procedures on applying the first aid to the injured or ill person from the accident may prolong his/her chances of 
survival while waiting for the rescue or ambulance. The succeeding chapters will tackle the state of the Philippines 
when it comes to its preparedness and rapid response on accidents. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
 
General Objectives   
 The researchers aim to create and develop a smart application for emergencies that people could use for medical 
emergencies, and they need medical responders on the scene of the incident.

We observed from the overall rating on figure 8 that some of the respondents are neutrally satisfied, 10% are very 
satisfied, but majority of the users are mostly satisfied with the SAFE mobile application to help them report and 
receive notification of an accident. 
 
Figure 8. Overall Rating of UAT for SAFE 
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements  
The researchers recommend doing actual test runs for both the user side and the rescuer side. All the testing for both 
sides that have been done are online due to the pandemic. The researchers also recommend doing more tests for both 
sides to see if the response time can still be accurate in different situations.  Adding more features to the application 
was also recommended by the researchers. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The researchers aim to create a mobile application that can be a tool that the community can use in times when a 
medical emergency response is needed. SAFE ‚Äòs target users are the people in the community. Medical emergencies 
can happen at an unexpected time and place, with this app, people can easily call for help from medical emergency 
responders.

1727","SAFE has different features that people can use in terms of easy profile identification, fast communication with the 
medical emergency responders, and a live location sharing for both the users and the responders. According to the 
results of the survey that the researchers have done for both the rescuer and the user side, these features can all be seen 
and used in the application easily and the users will be able to use them without any struggles. 
 
Currently, the tool used in the Philippines for emergency response is through a hotline that can be accessible to both 
landline and mobile. With the help of SAFE, the application serves as another tool that people can use in order to 
report and accident and request for medical response. It can help both the emergency reporter and the emergency 
responders to connect to each other until the accident reported is attended to.  
 
Some improvements were suggested by the researchers to improve the application‚Äôs usability. The suggestions given 
are the following: 
‚Ä¢ 
Categorizing the emergency to respond to. 
‚Ä¢ 
Identifying what kind of emergency responder is needed.

Abstract 
The outpatient department (OPD) of a hospital provides diagnoses for non-urgent patients that do not require them to 
be admitted for long periods. The department has multiple physical facilities and medical equipment with several 
doctors and consulting rooms, each is an expert in a specific field. This study aims to create an online scheduling 
system for the outpatient department of a hospital. It will be an online system that will assist the appointment system 
of the outpatient department of a hospital. This will benefit not only the hospital but also the patients in scheduling 
their appointments as the patient can check the doctor‚Äôs availability. The waiting time of the patient will be lessened 
since the patient will only go to the hospital at their specified scheduled appointment. The list of appointments can 
also be viewed by the doctor to check how many patients are currently scheduled within the day.

1. Introduction 
In special situations like a pandemic, there will be a lot of limits and regulations, especially during an enhanced 
community quarantine period. The country will be on lockdown during the said occasion, people will not be allowed 
to go outside unless necessary as mass gatherings and crowded places will be prohibited. Social distancing will be 
implemented that urges people to maintain a one (1) meter distance from each other. The project would provide 
improvement to the outpatient department of the hospital. Most especially during extreme situations where there are 
a lot of limits and regulations that urge people to stay indoors unless necessary. The senior citizens would be able to 
have a diagnosis and will be able to avoid exposure in crowded places. They would also be encouraged to use the 
appointment system since they do not have to wait for long queue times. 
 
The common problem among many hospitals is the long waiting time particularly in the outpatient department which 
makes the waiting area congested. This is because of the traditional falling in line done by patients. In addition to that, 
there is also a scenario where the doctor arrives late, and some consultations are longer than the others. This causes 
the patients a lot of their time, that is why most of the patients usually go early in the morning because they believe 
that the earlier you arrive, the quicker your appointment will be done (Panaviwat Chalita 2014, Lohasiriwat Haruetai 
2014, Tharmmaphornphilas Wipawee 2014). This results in congestion even before the service hour starts. 
 
In light of the recent pandemic that shocked the world, every nation studied and analyzed how to prevent and lessen 
the spread of an infectious disease. The government then decided to release strategic guidelines to fight infectious 
diseases. 
 
One of which is the restriction regarding the age, some people can go out but all persons under the age of twenty-one 
(21), elderly who are sixty (60) and above, and people at health risks cannot leave unless necessary. There were also 
requirements to which include a face mask to prevent the inhalation of the virus and quarantine pass to determine 
where they live and the age of the person. Mass gatherings were also prohibited during these times to prevent the 
spread. The reality is that most of the senior citizens and some infants also have other illness to overcome that is why 
the online scheduling system is an opportunity for them to take advantage because both of which are very susceptible

The questions asked in the form were based on the System Usability Scale (SUS), which contains 10 items, half-
positive and half-negative. The odd-numbered questions are categorized as positive tone, while the even-numbered 
are categorized as negative tone. According to J. Sauro, Ph.D., there are two major reasons why the questions in the 
form were in half-positive and half-negative tones. The first one is Reducing Acquiescent Bias which means to avoid 
participants from giving the highest rating automatically without reading all the questions that were asked. The second 
one is Reducing Extreme Response Bias, also related to the first reason, but the latter avoids either all high or all low 
rating responses. Because of the stated reasons, respondents are then required to analyze each question and potentially 
have a more thoughtful answer which can eliminate a bias response. 
 
The participants of the testing were asked to answer a form after using the website to measure the reliability of the 
system. A total of 15 responses were recorded. Each response was computed according to the computation. As shown 
in the table, the total sum of the SUS scores is 1,192.5 with a Mean (Average) of 79.5 since there were 15 participants. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Compared to the manual appointment system that is currently being used by the hospital, the website will improve the 
appointment system of the outpatient department. According to the hospital, patients can schedule an appointment by 
calling or through walk-ins as long as there is an available doctor. With the website, patients can easily view all the 
available schedules of doctors and set an appointment. In terms of payment, the patient can pay on the day of their 
appointment or pay in advance through GCash or PayMaya. The website also sends an SMS notification to remind 
patients about their scheduled appointment. It reminds them of their appointment a day before and on the day itself. 
 
Following the website‚Äôs evaluation, the calculated average SUS score of the system is 79.5. Which is equivalent to B 
according to the SUS Score Guideline table. In terms of adjective rating, the system is rated as Good which means 
that the website is usable. After testing, the doctor and hospital staff gave feedbacks about the website. They have 
mentioned that the flow of the website is nicely done and it was easy to use. The expected patients who have tested 
the website says that they have not seen anything that could potentially confuse users, it is very well made, and does 
not limit those who are not tech savvy. 
 
The doctor has also mentioned that the History of Illness and Personal History should also be added in the medical 
records section of the patient. These features were added after the testing. The researchers have also asked the doctor 
and hospital staff if the system will help in reducing the waiting time inside the hospital. They have mentioned that 
the system will help especially during a pandemic since everyone needs to adjust to the new normal. Aside from that, 
the hospital staff said that it will be less hassle for them, and it would be much easier since they do not need to manually 
count how many appointments are scheduled within the day.

ABSTRACT  
This paper presents a simple procedure for acoustic noise reduction in switched reluctance 
motors (SRMs). Radial forces between rotor and stator teeth cause a vibration of stator 
laminations and windings. The vibrations lead to acoustic noise. The radial forces can be 
determined by the two-dimensional finite element method (FEM). The magnitude of the 
acoustic noise at any operating speed is calculated by an analytical model which depends on 
the radial forces and circumferential deflection. The calculation, simulation, and measurement 
results are useful to improve stator and rotor poles with acoustic noise reduction. Moreover, 
the SRM needs to avoid the mechanical resonant frequency. If the electric frequency equals 
mechanical resonant frequency, the vibration and acoustic noise are extremely high and destroy 
the mechanical structure of the high-speed motor.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
 
The SRM has been used as a starter/alternator for more electric aircraft in Song Shoujun 2009. However, torque 
is maximized to speed up in starting mode, and efficiency is maximized at higher speed by torque per RMS current. 
The torque-speed characteristics are functions of the reference currents, turn-on, and turn-off angles in Mohammed 
Elamin 2017. They were determined by a dynamic SRM simulation in different speeds and control modes in Jacob 
Bayless 2016. In over a wide range of speeds, the maximized torque control can be achieved by the current 
controller and optimization of choosing to turn on-off angles. At low and medium speeds, the phase currents are 
controlled by discontinuous conduction mode DCM and at higher speeds by continuous conduction mode (CCM) 
to maintain torque values.  
  
 II.  IMPACT TEST  
Every electric motor has its natural mode frequencies. They depend on the stator shapes, mass, and material. The 
SRM stator is composed of silicon steel lamination, aluminum rings, and copper windings. To investigate the 
frequency, an impulse excitation by a hammer impact was used to measure the natural frequencies of the motor 
in figure 1.

 VI.  
CONCLUSION  
The acoustic noise level has been measured with speed up to 47,000 rpm and the noise spectrum frequency was 
analyzed for different speeds. To improve the acoustic noise performance of the SRM, there were some proposals 
of changing the shape of the stator or rotor teeth. To reduce the radial force, the corners of the stator teeth have 
changed to a round shape to decrease the radial force. The stiffness of the stator yokes was increased to reduce the 
deformation of the stator. Due to the rotor has salient poles, the air gaps between rotor teeth and slots are not equal 
and the high velocity of the air blocks in rotor slots can create the acoustic noise significantly. To reduce this part 
of the acoustic noise, a tapped-shoe rotor pole can be designed to improve acoustic noise and vibration problems.

Abstract 
 
A baseline in fuel economy is the indicator from which to start to evaluate consumption and raise awareness of the 
current state. Since what is not measured cannot be improved, the determination of a baseline helps to locate a starting 
point to establish further goals and best practices based on actual behavior. This paper explores and reviews the studies 
for fuel economy to determine the measurement and analysis methods that aim to the construction of fuel consumption 
and/or gas emission baselines by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR). The overview of literature published 
globally in the last ten years shows hardly any research focused on HDVs, as well as few investigations reporting 
gross and load weight values. Studies committed to measuring fuel consumption and/or gas emissions show small 
sample sizes due to limitations in scope related to the methods used, explaining the tendency to make estimates through 
statistical and estimation tools. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that by abounding in the methods and the 
literature itself, the recent interest in expanding the sample sizes in line with the precision of the data, has presented 
new techniques for the measurement and estimation.

1. Introduction 
The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) is implementing a new transportation project which aims to 
promote a global transition to a low emission mobility that improves air quality and mitigates climate change. To 
achieve this objective, countries and cities are supported to develop and implement transportation policies and 
strategies looking out for three main results: a regional change to more efficient vehicles (including electric mobility), 
a national change to cleaner fuels (low-sulfur content in fuels) and standard vehicle emissions, and a regional or 
national take into action by developing and implement policies that prioritize walking and biking infrastructures.   
 
Fuel consumption baselines explain the fuel economy for a certain population of vehicles in a certain region, which 
allows a deeper analysis of the vehicular fleet and its significant factors. By understanding this, it is possible to position 
the fuel consumption and gas emissions in contrast with historical data or even other regions, making it possible to 
develop best practices and transportation policies. Around the world, more than ten countries have determined a fuel 
consumption baseline for passenger and light duty vehicles (LDVs) with at least six years of fleet inventories, but no 
region has worked on the development of a fuel consumption baseline for heavy duty vehicles (HDVs). The UNEP 
has supported the Latin American and Caribbean region since 2009 to adopt cleaner and more efficient fuels and 
vehicles, and now the objective is to determine the first fuel consumption baseline for HDVs in the Mexican region.

1751","4. Conclusions 
The literature reviewed is mainly interested in vehicular emissions with a preference in measuring to aim for real 
behavior results. Nevertheless, limitations present on measuring techniques due to time, costs, and scope, have 
presented a recent trend (since 2018) on testing unconventional methods and techniques. Likewise, estimation models 
have been type-casted to the same common models until 2017, when new tool start taking place and studies attempt 
to combine estimation model with measured data instead of studying inventories alone. Limitations from both 
measuring and estimating methods are summed-up on costs, time, reliability of the data, sample sizes and significance 
in comparison with real behavior data. The purview of this methods presents an opportunity to choose unconventional 
geolocation tools along with new proposed estimation models for the determination of the fuel consumption baseline 
for HDVs in the Mexican region for the new UNEP‚Äôs project.   
 
4.1 Further research 
Measuring techniques with specific data outputs limit sample sizes and analysis for high variety of factors, pointing 
out how geolocation tools and simple measurement related ones have a greater area of opportunity for the project 
purposes. For estimation models, to bet for programs used to extrapolate or even estimate for massive sample sizes 
applied is more promising than limiting to basic statistical analysis. With this being stated, further research is expected 
for innovative methods and their availability on the studied region to make possible the determination of the fuel 
consumption baseline for HDVs in the UNEP project.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to investigate the mediating effect of financial performance on the effect of green innovation on 
firm value. This study uses secondary data, namely data on manufacturing companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange (IDX) during 2015-2020. The sample in this study was 222 data obtained from 37 companies during the 
research year. The data analysis technique of this research used partial least square (PLS) analysis. The results of 
this study indicate that financial performance partially mediates the effect of green innovation on firm value.

Table 1.4 above shows the calculation of the Variance Accounted For (VAF) of this research hypothesis. 
The table above shows the steps for calculating the indirect relationship of green innovation (GI) to firm value (FV) 
through financial performance (FP) of 0.109. Then the table above also shows a direct calculation between GI to FV 
of 0.12. In this FAV method, to find out which research variables can mediate or not, the indirect and direct 
relationships must first be summed so that it becomes a total relationship. The VAF value is obtained by dividing the 
total indirect relationship by the total relationship so that the value becomes 0.48. 
Based on the Variance Accounted For (VAF) test results above, it can be seen that financial performance 
partially mediates the effect of green innovation on firm value. This shows that the green innovation variable can 
affect the firm value directly or through the financial performance variable. Green innovation is a plan that can be 
used to increase firm value by using new techniques, systems, practices, and production processes or something 
changed to reduce the impact of damage to the environment (Dewi & Rahmianingsih, 2020). In addition, Green 
Innovation can be implemented in all business processes regularly so that it will improve the company's financial 
performance, thus indirectly increasing the value of the company. The company that implements green innovation 
financial performance will increase, because the application of green innovation eliminates raw materials harmful in 
the production process, saving energy by using fuel result of waste that is processed or energy sources that are 
environmentally friendly to minimize costs and increase your profits which in turn will improve financial 
performance. The results of this study are in line with research conducted by Prena & Muliyawa (2020), Akmalia et 
al., (2017), Anugraini & Khusnah, (2019), Sholikhah & Khusnah, (2019), Khusnah et al., (2019), (Satria., Sunaryo., 
and ABS. 2017). 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study aims to investigate the mediating effect of financial performance on the effect of green 
innovation on firm value. The results of this study indicate that financial performance partially mediates the effect of 
green innovation on firm value. Based on these results, it can be concluded that green innovation can increase firm 
value directly or through financial performance.

Abstract 
 
Company X‚Äôs Engineering Department had seen complexity overtime in regards with monitoring each engineers‚Äô 
tasks and activity. If not properly executed, this could lead to several operational issues like aircraft-on-ground 
situations (AOG) or regulatory non-compliance caused by delays in response, and inefficient ways of updating 
activities. Using manual spreadsheet is inconvenient to some. From Engineering who is the main stakeholder, the 
Production Control, Purchasing and Materials who receives the information and/or instructions, and to management 
who tracks KPI. The need for automation aims to change not only the medium or system, but also the process flow of 
for the engineers.  The implementation of this project needs to also consider the requirements of the regulatory body 
Company X is under. The system design will be able to manage requests from other departments to Company X 
Engineering, with following subsystems included: monitoring, request receipt, report generation, case assignment and 
case update. Also, the reports can be generated with only putting the necessary details. No need for the engineer to do 
formatting of such documents as it will be taken care of automatically by the system. With the help of all the data 
obtained from system analysis, design, and evaluation, the system will provide long term benefits not only to Company 
X‚Äôs Engineering Department but also to other departments that require engineering assistance.

1. Introduction  
For most instances, the technology used on aircrafts are quite ahead of the average commercial industry. Some of 
these examples includes, but not limited to, GPS tracking, satellite communications, and anti-collision system. One 
thing Company X‚Äôs Engineering department had ever since and was not changed since they receive their first aircraft 
is the use of manual monitoring for technical requests or assistance. The global technology already advanced wherein 
an average citizen is already using an electronic device for most of their daily task, but Company X‚Äôs Engineering 
Department still use spreadsheet and print outs to monitor and update tasks. 
 
1.1 Company Background 
Company X‚Äôs vision keeps changing every 2-3 years, and the reason behind that is they always seem to achieve the 
goal in their vision statement and aspire to higher goals to achieve in the future. This year‚Äôs vision is to achieve 20 
million passengers per year. The company‚Äôs mission is to sustainably deliver superior services in a cost-effective 
manner. Figure 1 details Company X‚Äôs organizational chart. The Chief Operating Officer or Senior Vice President 
directly reports to the Chief Executive Officer. For this study, the focus will only be geared towards Maintenance and 
Engineering, as there are other departments within the company like, but not limited to, Flight Operations, In-Flight 
Services, Ground Operations, and Safety. A Vice President oversights the whole Maintenance and Engineering, which 
are further divided into different sections like Contracts, Materials, Maintenance, Engineering, Compliance and Lease. 
For quality management, QA is also linked with VP of Maintenance and Engineering but directly reports with COO. 
An M&E Coordinator serves as a liaison officer for all sections under this department. Depending on the section it is 
further divided into manager, supervisor, or executives.

of such documents as it will be taken care of automatically by the system. The current system does not provide 
incentives to the performance of engineers as the KPI cannot be measured directly. With the new system, management 
will have solid data for them to base their appraisal or evaluation on specific engineer. 
 
5. Conclusion  
With the help of all the data obtained from system analysis, design, and evaluation, the author was able to conclude 
that the system will provide long term benefits not only to Company X‚Äôs Engineering Department but also to other 
departments that require engineering assistance. The workload of every engineer will be lessened, and they can 
allocate the manhour freed to other issues that may require their attention. Author is open to the idea that this research, 
specifically for Company X, can be improved provided that more data and period is allocated. System design can be 
improved to be more specific and may address all other issues not yet discussed her. Overall, implementation of this 
research is still recommended if everything else will be considered with the current system Company X‚Äôs engineering 
department is using.

Abstract 
 
Preschool education provides various types of benefits such as curriculum, environment, teacher‚Äôs performance and 
services that could contribute to unstandardized standards of education. Thus, identifying the ideal criteria of preschool 
preferences amongst parents will help the preschool management to reconstruct the criteria based on the finding. The 
seven criteria selected from the previous study are, provide teaching in English, religious value, safety and security, 
curriculum and facilities, brand image and fees, quality of teachers and operation hours and location. 102 parents in 
Klang Valley, Malaysia, rural and developed areas with variety rages of family household income participated in the 
survey. The data was then analyzed using Best Worst Method (BWM). The result shows that the ideal criteria in 
selecting preschool is ‚Äòsafety and security, meanwhile ‚ÄòBrand image and fees‚Äô is the least important criteria. 
Furthermore, parents in both developed areas and rural areas also choose ‚ÄòSafety and security as the most important 
criteria. In addition, the preferences of preschool based on gender, generation, area of residence, occupation and 
household incomes are also reported in this paper.

1. Introduction 
Early education plays a crucial role in learning self-care skills as well as in creating healthy individuals for their mental 
and communities that provide their safety (Aydos and Tugrul, 2015). Preschool education consists of many elements 
that will influence the factor of choosing the preschool, and each has the weighting of its importance. Many problems 
emerged when each preschool provides various types of benefits such as curriculum, environment, teacher‚Äôs 
performance and services that could contribute to unstandardized standards of education (Ismail et al., 2018). 
Choosing the right preschool for children is important to make sure the children received basic education of knowledge 
and social before entering primary school. Furthermore, in Malaysia, each child must enter preschool before starting 
primary school. Thus, to achieve a quality preschool, assessments are needed to acknowledge academic, social-

is ‚Äòbrand image and fees‚Äô, which score the highest percentage in the least important criteria and are selected 
insignificant by all demographic variables. Even though brand image and fees help develop the identity for those 
unfamiliar with that preschool and match up with parents‚Äô specific objectives, it seems that many parents are willing 
to pay extra to ensure that their child has the best quality of education, including both forms of educational and 
lifestyles, which they could not experience in their student days (Vijaindren, 2017).  
 
The outcome has implications for preschool providers to ensure a quality enhancement for their services. Moreover, 
the ideal criteria may provide some guidance for the government on the aspects that should be emphasized especially 
on demographic and social-economic.  
 
Since the study is focused on parents in the Klang Valley, the finding may not be reliable for other states and cannot 
be generalized to the Malaysian context. In addition, convenience sampling applied in data collection has a higher 
degree of bias creates incapability of generalizing the population as a whole and has a high level of sampling error.

Abstract 
 
The online food delivery (OFD) application is the software application that connects the restaurants and customers 
through online. in this pandemic Covid-19, the OFD app makes food selection and purchases become easy. As a result, 
the purpose of this study is to determine customer preferences in OFD apps using the Best Worst Method (BWM). 
The selection of customer preferences criteria consists of price, design, convenience and time. The quantitative method 
is applied by disseminating a survey to OFD apps customers in Parit Raja, Malaysia through WhatsApp medium 
within two months. Based on the convenience sampling method, 112 surveys were received, however, 11 surveys 
does not meet the requirements. Therefore, only 101 surveys were analyzed using BWM. According to the findings, 
pricing is still the most essential factor for customers, followed by time, convenience, and design. This article also 
includes recommendations for OFD providers to improve their services.

1. Introduction 
According to Yeo et al., (2017), E-commerce is one of the platforms that customers prefer as a buying medium since 
it allows them to shop at their leisure and in their very own comfort zone.  The growth of online retailing demonstrates 
that consumers have access to an almost limitless variety of goods and services. , and convenient delivery. The food 
business is one of the retailers that benefit from the use of e-commerce as a platform to better serve customers. E-
commerce, as a shopping medium, allows users to conveniently shop, compare products and prices, and schedule 
product delivery swiftly (Suhartanto et al., 2018). Customers can order food through restaurant websites or online 
food delivery services like FoodPanda, Halo, McDelivery Malaysia, and Pizza Hut Malaysia, thanks to the availability 
of online restaurant technology. The rise of e-commerce is both an opportunity and a difficulty for restaurants, as it 
creates rivalry among businesses and increases profitability by attracting loyal consumers. E-commerce, according to 
Rahmaningtyas et al., (2017), allows users to purchase items and services conveniently while also lowering operating 
and marketing costs for businesses. Customers, on the other hand, were not interested in purchasing internet food due 
to product characteristics and uncertain product quality. To attract customers, internet food should have a 
distinguishing trait that sets it apart from other suppliers.  
 
The food delivery application in Malaysia comprises two types of distributors who provide OFD services (Yeo et al., 
2017). The first group includes retailers such as McDonald's Malaysia, Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) Malaysia, and 
Pizza Hut Malaysia. The second category consists of numerous restaurant intermediaries who provide delivery

The value of consistency ratio is near 0, which indicates that the correlation is extremely accurate and reliable. The 
accuracy and consistency of each pairwise relation for each criterion are examined and analyzed using a pairwise 
comparison between criteria. The most important criteria, as shown in Table 4, is 'price,' which received the most 
weight in comparison to the others. Then comes ‚Äòtime' and ‚Äòconvenience,' with ‚Äòapps/website layout style' receiving 
the least weight, indicating that it is the least relevant factor in OFD app user preference.  
 
5. Discussion and Conclusion 
In conclusion, despite Alalwan's (2020) finding that there is no substantial association between price and customers' 
intention, pricing remains an important criterion for OFD app customers. The price value is important for customers' 
OFD apps for a variety of reasons, which support the claim by Prasetyo et al., (2021). To begin with, the price listed 
in ODF apps is slightly more than conventional restaurant costs, and it varies by provider. In addition, delivery charges 
and tax fees are included in the total amount and the delivery rates range amongst OFD suppliers as well. However, 
the meal pricing for Foodpanda differs between delivery and pick-up choices, with pick-up being somewhat less 
expensive. Nevertheless, certain OFD providers, such as GrabFood and Foodpanda, offer discounts for specific 
restaurants, including free delivery, hot deals, promotions, and vouchers that contribute positive perceptions to 
customers as mentioned by Prasetyo et al., (2021). The customer's preference for the second criterion is time. Since 
the OFD applications are primarily designed for people who do not have time to go to a restaurant, it has created a 
new expectation among customers that their meals would be delivered within a specified time frame. To address this, 
certain OFD apps show the status of meals being prepared and delivered once payment has been made, and customers 
can even contact the rider through the OFD app. The customer's third selection criteria is convenience. The OFD apps 
have features that make it easier for customers to use the apps, such as a favourite button, a list of prior orders, a 
reorder button, a preorder function, notification, a chat support button, live meal preparation and delivery status, and 
the ability to contact the rider. Aside from that, the OFD is aided by a variety of alternatives payments. Finally, the 
design of OFD apps contributes less to client preferences, even though the apps/web must provide a user-friendly 
experience to match customer expectations (Yee et al., 2018). 
 
Based on observation, some suggestions for improvement to the OFD provider include the ability to upload a picture 
of the meal for information sharing, the extension of feedback comment periods, and an enhancement in the 
notification of minimum purchase rules. By uploading a photo of the food being delivered, customers will have access 
to preliminary information such as the portion size, a comparison of the actual food to the published menu, and a price 
and food comparison. Meanwhile, feedback comments are critical for OFD providers and restaurants to improve. 
Customer feedback is currently unavailable for Halo app; however, for Foodpanda, the feedback form only appears 
before subsequent orders for a limited time, allowing users to score the rider, packing, and punctuality of the entire 
ordering process. Meanwhile, there are two types of feedback for GrabFood: one for rider ratings and another for 
ordering food ratings. Interestingly, minimum purchase rules set by OFD providers for specific restaurants result in

recommended that the OFD provider improve their modus operandi on alerting customers.

Abstract 
 
Today, intense competition environment, more frequent changes of product mix, seasonal demand variables, 
etc. situations push companies to make various efforts to reduce production costs. One of these studies is the facility 
layout study, which is very effective on costs due to the material flows. Facility layout is the problem of arranging the 
facilities in a way that will minimize material movements within the facility and ensure continuous flow. With the 
facility layout, minimum cost facility locations can be determined by considering material movements. In the dynamic 
facility arrangement problem, the aim is to determine the material flow, demand variability, product mix changes, etc. 
in periods. It is the redefinition of the facility layout according to the changes caused by the circumstances. The 
dynamic facility layout problem considers material handling costs and department relocation costs simultaneously 
across the planning horizon. The most significant parameter in this problem is to determine the demand or material 
flow requests during planning horizon. Therefore, this study aims to predict the in-bound material flow accurately that 
will occur in the future periods. In this context, in-plant material flows were predicted by Linear Regression, 
Polynomial Regression, Random Forest Algorithm, and Prophet Algorithm. Then the performance of these algorithms 
was evaluated with Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error. Thus, the predicted inter-departmental material flows in the future periods can be used in the solution 
of facility layout problem.

Abstract 
 
The present paper is a case study based on a retail painting company (SME: small and medium-sized enterprise) 
located in Mexico that built a Central Warehouse to save money by improving its inventory management. The Fermat-
Weber facility location problem was studied and applied to obtain the optimal location for the mentioned warehouse. 
The proposal was validated throughout the ROI methodology to ensure necessary financial results achieving a cost 
reduction and investment return within the first year of operation of the new warehouse. It is paramount important for 
current SMEs to apply exact methodologies to improve their cash flow and promote their existence among other 
companies in such a competitive business environment.  The authors' primary purpose is to use an existent model in 
a real case that can be replicated by any retail SME obtaining cost improvements.

1. Introduction  
In general, warehouses are created to cover different roles in the supply chain, such as the safeguarding of raw 
materials, product in process, or finished goods. They can have different functions, including consolidation centers, 
distribution centers for order processing, and other activities, and are operated by the company or subcontracted by 
third-party suppliers (Richards, 2014). They must be designed to meet the specific requirements of the supply chain 
of which they are a part (Rushton, et al., 2014) 
 
Some operations are common to most warehouses, and these tend to apply whether the warehouse is manual with the 
reasonably necessary equipment or highly automated with sophisticated storage and handling systems (Rushton, et 
al., 2014). 
 
Small warehouses are different from large ones in different ways. The most relevant to this context is that small 
warehouses are usually managed at the (stock keeping unit) SKU level, and their density is high; capital investments 
are low, they do not invest in warehouse management, and there is little or no automation (Lim√®re & √áelik, 2011). 
The company's supply chain under study is a SME dedicated to purchasing and selling coatings and light building 
materials that operate with five peripheral warehouses located in each group‚Äôs branch. However, to reduce the working 
capital and be more efficient at the service level, a central warehouse is sought. It will play the main warehouse's role 
to supply the peripheral warehouses, which are defined as a location shared by a central warehouse, used for direct 
distribution of materials to customers. Its main intention is to ensure higher quality in customer service (Ghiani, et al., 
2004).  
 
Understanding then, a central warehouse as the primary location for the supply of peripheral warehouses both owned 
and rented (Drezner, et al., 2003).

The 45% ROI (Equation 8) is interpreted for each dollar invested; the company will receive USD 0.44. Therefore, it is 
considered that the implementation of a central warehouse is feasible since there is a tangible improvement in economic 
and operational terms by simplifying the company's logistics functions. 
 
Another possible conclusion on the results is the possibility of improving the company's cash flows through the 
establishment of the central warehouse, which will, in the first instance, represent an additional income to the company 
by establishing inventories adequate to the actual demand to meet the cost of the proposed investment. At the same 
time, the obsolete or slow-moving inventory will be converted into liquidity for the company, as a single occasion, 
given the opportunity to significantly increase the turnover of its stocks that will be reflected as an increase in profits 
by considerably reducing the investment stationed for long periods and costs associated with this activity. 
 
By applying the Lean philosophy of an industry that involves a ""pulling"" methodology, it is considered that the proposed 
facility will allow branches to order material only when it is required for sale. By modifying the current practices in 
which we seek to push material that is lagging by having over the inventory of specific goods. 
 
It is also necessary to emphasize the importance of measuring the proposed warehouse's operation by using performance 
indicators as a future proposal to identify improvements, and action plans are suggested for those aspects that require 
it. 
 
7. Conclusion  
As exemplified during the development of this case study, there are many methodologies for improving supply chain 
processes. However, SMEs‚Äô suitability is a branch of knowledge little studied in an approach such as the supply chain 
and specifically the warehouses as a tool for cost control. 
 
Adapting existing methodologies to a real case within SMEs' context represents an opportunity to increase their 
competitiveness in today's markets, which are becoming increasingly professional, since knowing how companies 
create and manage a competitive advantage represents a fundamental element in strategic management.  
 
One of the intentions set out before developing this case study was to provide a tool for other SMEs to improve their 
operational and strategic processes. This goal was achieved by proposing generic models that can be replicated with 
moderate adjustments according to each company's nature, processes, and specific needs. 
 
The study shows that, although there are many case studies focused mainly on large supply chains, little is said about 
their application to smaller companies, whose impact can generate a significant economic benefit by implementing 
changes within the traditional operational form of these companies. These models can provide a high utility for the 
development of logistics projects, considering measuring their effectiveness based on the improvements' profitability, 
as was done in this case study where one was obtained with an ROI of 44%. 
 
This study continues to be developed on great relevance when considering the economic context in which this work 
has been carried out. Since there are a large number of companies that meet these characteristics, generating 72% of 
employment and 52% of Mexico's GDP (S√°nchez, 2020), so the implementation of a project like a case study can 
develop a more significant opportunity for success within the market not only to continue operating but increasing 
their chances of growth, which will generate new opportunities for expansion and employment generation.

Abstract 
 
The last mile delivery volume has been gradually increasing worldwide, and in particular, the volume trend is expected 
to accelerate dramatically due to COVID-19. Furthermore, the expansion of the last mile delivery market negatively 
impacts social and environmental issues (urban traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.) owing to the 
delivery system employing internal combustion engine delivery trucks in metropolitan areas. Therefore, mobile 
centers for the last mile delivery have been studied to solve the previously stated issues. That is because mobile centers 
can enable the active use of eco-friendly transportation, be easily relocated, and be installed in empty spaces in the 
city. In this study, we consider this problem as the multi-period multi-depot location-routing problem to operate a 
mobile center efficiently. We present a 2-phase method for the addressed problem and develop a heuristic algorithm. 
The first phase of the proposed method is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming model for the multi-period 
locating problem, and the second phase is constructed as a mixed-integer programming model for the multi-depot 
routing problem.

Abstract 
 
Digital technologies have been bridging the gap in terms of convenience, reliability, and timeliness on these current 
settings (Kapur 2006).  It is extensively used by majority of  individuals due to its technical functions n wide array of 
transactions. Like in education, the use of digital technology is imperative aspects that has gained more prominence due to 
global pandemic. In Philippines, Digital technology has been adopted by Department of Science and Technology through 
its Science and Technology Academic and Research-Based Openly Operated Kiosk Station or STARBOOKS. The latter 
is primarily developed to share digitized resources of S&T library materials specifically to marginalized populations all 
over the country. This study aims to test the framework of Technology Acceptance Model or TAM feature of DOST-
STARBOOKS such as Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) towards the users in identified sites 
in the Philippine countryside. There were one hundred seven (107) total respondents of the study from University of 
Southern Mindanao (USM), ‚Äì Kabacan Mindanao State University (MSU) ‚Äì General Santos City, Sultan Kudarat State 
University (SKSU) ‚Äì main campus, and Notre Dame Hospital and School of Midwifery (NDHSM) ‚Äì Cotabato City.  
 
The study reveals that there is a significant difference among groups (age, sex, and school) with regards to Perceived 
Usefulness (PU) of STARBOOKS and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) STARBOOKS based on One Way Analysis of 
Variance or ANOVA Based on the findings generated from Exploratory Factor Analysis is acceptable with a determinant 
value of 0.005 that is higher than 0.001. This interpret that the respondents‚Äô answer data is free of multicollinearity issues. 
All of the variables are significant, according to research hypothesis testing based on regression weights using CFA results. 
The study concluded that undergraduate students found STARBOOKS as a useful (PU) and user-friendly (PEOU) mode

1. Introduction  
The use of digital tools has set a technological platform and brought significant impact on learners in multiple ways. The 
reason behind shifts traditional libraries to adopt innovative methods to disseminate digital format information while 
creating free access to what is available on the World Wide Web. Digital libraries (DLs) can be defined as sites and software 
dedicated to creating and preserving electronic book collections and other kinds of materials without users' need to 
purchase materials to read (Kapur, 2018). According to Higgins, Xiao & Katsipataki (2012), digital technology is 
effectively and widely used from nursery to university level which can be done in groups and pairs.  Generally, Digital

greater than 0.90 is acceptable; the RMSEA was 0.0391 which is less than 0.08 is acceptable. This reflected that the 
models of user acceptance factors (see figure 1) could be considered a very good fit for the observed data.  
 
6. Conclusion  
This research assesses the Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) of STARBOOKS among 
undergraduate students.  The study concluded that undergraduate students found STARBOOKS as a useful (PU) and 
user-friendly (PU) mode of technology most especially for feasibility study and thesis purposes. Specifically, the study 
concluded the following:  
1. 
Perceived ease of use is a significant predictor of DOST STARBOOKS' perceived usefulness.

Abstract 
 
During the coronavirus disease of the 2019 pandemic, there was a shortage of ventilators to meet the medical demands 
of the United States hospitals. Coronavirus patients with severe conditions lose the ability to breathe by themselves 
and require a ventilator, which pumps air in and out of the lungs. The response to the ventilator shortage created many 
situations: Automakers started to manufacture ventilators to help the medical device companies grow ventilators 
production. Additionally, engineering students at different U.S. universities invented low-cost ventilators in university 
laboratories, and three-dimensional printed ventilators started to be manufactured. These solutions would be helpful 
in the long term. However, the urgent need for ventilators necessitates strategies for allocating these minimal available 
ventilators to assist the decision-makers and healthcare providers in U.S. hospitals. To compensate this challenge, 
proper resource allocation of ventilators makes the best use of these available ventilators to increase society's economic 
and ethical benefits. In this paper, two models of resource allocation will be studied: 1) A smart resource allocation 
advisor using the cost-benefit-analysis to allocate limited ventilators in a specific hospital, and 2) a stochastic 
optimization model for allocating and sharing ventilators among the states.  
 
Keywords  
Ventilators Shortage, Resource Allocation, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Stochastic Optimization. 
 
1. Introduction  
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a very deadly 
disease triggered by a virus exposed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and it has transmitted around the world 
([CDC], 2021). If the lungs of the patients with COVID-19 have been severely impaired, they might need ventilators 
to help their respiration and oxygen supply. Mechanical ventilation is a very important service for patients with severe 
respiratory failure. Recent estimates show that the United States is one of the countries that may not have the required 
number of mechanical ventilators for all the patients who require this device for COVID-19 illness treatment (Dos 
Santos et al. 2020). In response to a national survey on coronavirus preparation, eighty-five percent of U.S. mayors 
reported they did not have enough ventilators for their hospitals (Auckland, 2020). As a result, an urgent need to 
increase ventilator supplies in different hospitals across the country became a priority.  
  
Many responses originated to face the problem of ventilator's overwhelming shortage. The United States Government 
directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the Defense Production Act to prioritize federal contracts 
for ventilators (DeBord, 2020). In response, General Motors replied that it will start building ventilators at a company 
located at Indiana in cooperation with Ventec Life Systems (DeBord, 2020). The two companies decided to expand 
their production capacity in excess of 10,000 critical care ventilators per month with planning to increase further 
based on demand (DeBord, 2020). Furthermore, engineering students in different U.S. universities invented low-cost 
ventilators in university laboratories. For example, two biomedical engineering students at the University of 
Cincinnati, Ohio (U.C.) developed a low-cost ventilator. The students worked under the supervision of a professor in 
the biomedical engineering department at U.C. and in partnership with the Venti-Now Company in Ohio. The students 
produced a ventilator design suitable for temporary emergency facilities and meets the ISO standards (Washington, 
D.C 2020). In addition, 3D printed ventilators were another solution to meet the urgent need of ventilators during the 
pandemic. Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, improved a design of a 3D printed ventilator.

1827","The results researchers obtained show that the percentage of currently available ventilators that would be used by non-
COVID-19 patients has a significant effect on state and national capacity to accommodate COVID-19 patient demand. 
The national stockpile is adequate to satisfy demand as more than 40% of the current inventory is eligible for COVID-
19 patients. If, on the other hand, less than 25% of the current inventory is available, the existing national stockpile 
and expected production may not be adequate (Mehrotra et al. 2020). 
 
5.4 Proposed Improvements of the Stochastic Optimization Model 
The results obtained are based on some assumptions, and the forecasts used may have some errors which may make 
the usage of this model to be limited. The ventilator allocation problem can also be expressed as a time-dynamic 
multistage stochastic program, in which the decision maker can make resource decisions as time passes based on the 
knowledge currently available on stochastic demands and previous decisions (Mehrotra et al. 2020). 
 
5.5 Validation of Research Contribution or Findings 
The results and research have validated that there is a significant issue with how resources are used, utilized, and 
shared in the United States. But not only does this show there is an issue with how resources are shared and utilized 
within the United States but potentially all around the world. The pandemic has shown that the US medical system 
needs to address these issues to improve their utilization and resource accommodation. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this paper, two models of resource allocation of ventilators during the COVID-19 pandemic were studied. The 
algorithms used, experiments implemented, limitations, and future work for the cost-benefit analysis-based model and 
the stochastic optimization based-model were explained. These models helped in the distribution of ventilators among 
the U.S. after the shortage happened in the COVID-19 pandemic. There are many other models available in research 
for resource allocation in healthcare facilities during disasters. Operations research played a role in creating these 
models. Operation research is a discipline that brings together expertise from various fields, including applied 
mathematics, computer science, and systems engineering to help in the decision-making process (Vieira et al. 2016).

Abstract   
 
In this paper we present a report on the performance of two black-box mathematical models of COVID-19 prediction. 
The models are the growth equation models: modified Verhulst Logistic Model and the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin 
(MMF) Model. Both models predict the cumulative numbers of infected people using the COVID-19 Data of Indonesia 
from begining day of the infection to end of September 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic data in Indonesia from the 
Worldometer website (Worldometer 2020) will be used as the underlying data for the curve fitting to those two models. 
We use the time series data of the total confirmed cases and the daily new cases to fit to the model models. We used 
the data starting on 2 March, the official first day of the reported pandemic cases in Indonesia, up to 30 November 
2020. We used the models to fit the time series of the total confirmed cases by minimizing the minimum root of the 
mean square error (RMSE) to obtained the parameterized models. After a year has been lapped, we compare the 
prediction from those parameterized models to the actual number of infected people for the same country, from the 
beginning of epidemic to 30 August 2021. The results show that for certain condition (different assumptions of the 
two models) the models could predict the number in a relatively good accuracy, at least qualitatively could portray the 
shape of the cumulative number of infected people curve.

1. Introduction   
COVID-19 appeared as a pandemic is only about two years  ago officially. However the impact is very devastating to 
almost all aspect of human life. It is a very dangerous new disease in terms of health impact, economy, and other 
human aspects. As a new disease it is already has been declared as a Pandemic by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) on March 11, 2020. This disease is caused by the Corona SARS-2 virus and is thought to have originated in 
Wuhan, China. At that time, more than 118,000 cases were recorded in 114 countries with 4,291 people losing their 
lives (WHO 2020). To see the widespread of the disease, we note that as of April 11, 2020, the figure has increased 
dramatically with a total number of more than 1.5 million cases of infection and more than one hundred fatalities and 
at the end of July 2020, there were 16,839,692 recorded positive cases of infection with 661,379 deaths, and even 
currently those number have reached to nearly 27 million and one million, respectivelly (Worldometer 2020). COVID-
19 so far is still regarded as a disease that difficult to understand, let alone to control, due to several reasons such as 
lack of data and confusing report (Caudill 2020). This is among the reasons why so far most infected countries still 
struggling combating the disease.

1837","Total Coronavirus Cases (a) and Daily New Cases (b) in Indonesia pandemic data fitted by the MMF equation. The 
data used to parameterize the equation are taken from the beginning of the disease to (2 March 2020) to 30 
September 2020 using Method 2. In (a), the thin black curve is the predicted cases and the red circles with black 
boundary is the actual cases (appeared as a thick black curve), while in (b) the black curve is the predicted  cases and 
the blue bars is the actual cases. 
 
6. Conclusion   
We modeled the pandemic data of Indonesia (the total/cumulative confirmed cases data) from the Worldometer 
website (Worldometer 2020) using two growth functions: the original logistic function and the modified logistic 
function. The results show that the logistic function fails to estimate the carrying capacity K of the total confirmed 
cases data. The model shows that, in terms of total confirmed cases pandemic data of Indonesia, at this date the disease 
should have already reached the carrying capacity K, which is in fact untrue. The inaccuracy becomes apparent when 
we plot the daily new cases which clearly depart form the observed data. Meanwhile, the results also show that the 
modified logistic equation is able to estimate the carrying capacity KŒ± of the total confirmed cases and produces curve 
that satisfactorily fits the data. However if we look at the result for the daily new cases, the model also shows that at 
this date the disease should have already reached the carrying capacity KŒ±, which is also untrue. This concludes that 
while the modified logistic model is able to mimic the total confirmed cases data, it still fails to fit the daily new cases 
data. Further refinement of the model still need to be done. This is currently under investigation. There is some reasons 
why the logistic growth model does not fit for COVID-19 data. One of them is when it is applied too early in which 
the disease still in the exponential growth phase, such as in the case of Indonesia COVID-19 data 
(https://www.researchgate.net/post/Logistic_Growth_Model_Is_it_suitable_for_COVID-19). The process of the 
logistic model refinement above bearing a good pedagogical example in teaching mathematical modeling.

Abstract 
 
A lease contract (LC) model for a fleet of dump truck with availability target is developed in this paper. Under 
this LC, the lessor provides a full maintenance service during the period LC. To sustain high performance of the 
fleet, we proposed an availability target as performance of the LC. In addition, the lessor gives some incentive in 
term of a price discount if the lessee leases more dump trucks.  The optimal decisions from the lessor‚Äôs viewed 
point (maintenance policy i.e number of periodic maintenance, maintenance level, pricing policy) are to 
minimize the total cost. The decision problem for the lessee is to select the best option suitable to its 
requirement.  We provide numerical examples for illustrating the optimal decisions for the lessee, and the lessor, 
which maximizes the expected profit for each party.

1. Introduction 
Maintenance in lease contract is among important topics in Industrial Engineering and it has increasingly received 
attention from researchers.  Initial investment concern, flexibility on the upgrading of the equipment, and the  
reduction of maintenance cost, as well as inventory are the main motivations of acquires equipment through 
leasing rather than purchase it (Jaturenonet al. 2006). Some examples include (Jaturenonet al. 2006; Murthy et al. 
2014, Pongpeh et al.  2006) which provides a comprehensive review of LC for new item. The authors in 
(Pongpech et al. 2006; Yeh et al., 2011)  investigated the lease contract associated with used equipment whilst 
(Aras et al. 2011)  considered lease options for  equipment resulting from remanufactured items. These authors 
mentioned that the study can be done from both sides: the lessor‚Äôs perspective or lessee‚Äôs perspective. There are 
two levels of decision problems, that can be viewed from the lessor‚Äôs perspective as a main concern, i.e. the 
strategic one and the operational one. In the strategic level issues relevant such as type and number of equipment 
lease, upgrade options to compensate with technological obsolescence, etc. And the issues of operational level are 
dealing with consisting of maintenance servicing, spare part stock, crew size, etc.).  For the case where the study 
is done from the lessor and lessee point of views then a game theory formulation is needed to modelling the 
decision problems (Bhaskaran 2000, Iskandar 2015) ). 
 
In many cases, many mining companies used their  equipment intensively. It is indicated with high usage per unit 
of time. The excessive usage affects significantly the deterioration of the equipment. This indicates the need to 
consider age and usage in the lease contract which involves two parameters ‚Äìi.e. age and usage limits (called a 
two dimensional lease contract). We are aware only the works by Husniah et al, 2018 belong to this group. In  the 
period of the contract is always the same with maximum usage rate whilst (Husniah et al. 2018, Hamidi et al. 
2016 ) consider a two dimensional lease contract for maximum  (age) or  (usage).  
 
As the equipment wear out with age and use, a powerful support of maintenance is expected to keep them in a 
working condition which thusly gives a high accessibility to the use of them. Many mining organizations think

3. Conclusions 
In this paper, we have devised a mathematical model for a lease equipment,  in which the lease is sold for a fleet of 
the equipment. The fleet is leased for a period of time and during the lease contract, imperfect PM is performed.  We 
find the optimal value of maintenance parameters such that minimizing expected cost of the lessor. Since nowadays, 
two-dimensional lease are abound in the market, it is important to consider  these two-dimensional approach in 
dealing with failures. A bivariate distribution of those failures can be estimated using real data from related 
industries, such as mining industry. A game theory approach can be also considered as one alternative to address 
optimization in that two-dimensional  problem.

Abstract 
 
One of the supporting aspects of Electronic Traffic Law Enforcement (ETLE) is the detection of traffic light status. 
This detection is used to determine whether someone driving a vehicle violates a traffic light or not. There are several 
ways to find out the status of the traffic lights that can be done, including what is often done is to install a system 
embedded in the traffic light system and then send a message to the traffic light status ETLE system from time to time. 
In this study, the status of the traffic lights is obtained by analyzing a still image from closed-circuit television (CCTV) 
using OpenCV and then comparing the Average Pixels Values (APV‚Äôs) in some area to get a conclusion about whether 
the traffic lights are in a certain color condition. In experiments conducted this method can detect the status of traffic 
lights with an accuracy of more than 99%.

1. Introduction 
The indiscipline of road users is commonly seen in daily life. This indiscipline is closely related to oversight of law 
enforcement or in this case the presence of traffic police on the streets. It is common knowledge that when there are 
police on the streets, the driver will obey the traffic rules. But when there no police officers are seen, they tend to 
return to their original habits: breaking the rules. 
 
According to World Health Organization (WHO), the causes of traffic accidents can be grouped into three main 
factors, namely human factors - that is, accidents caused by vehicle users, for example driving at high speed, 
disorderly, violating traffic signs and so forth. The next factor is the vehicle factor, which is a factor that is caused by 
the condition of the vehicle, for example, a blown tire, a brake failure, or something else (United Nations, 2020). And 
finally, the physical environmental factors of the roads, these are more related to the condition of the road where the 
accident occurred, for example, damaged roads, potholes, waterlogged, dark, without road markings, sharp turns, and 
so on (Hobbs et al., 1996). 
 
Based on the official release of the Indonesian National Police (Polri) in the news on Kompas on December 28, 2019, 
the number of traffic accidents in Indonesia in 2019 increased by 3% compared to the previous year. Total traffic 
accidents in 2019 were 107,500 incidents, while in 2018 there were 103,672 accidents. In the official release of the 
National Police it was stated that the factors causing the increase in accidents in 2019, the biggest was due to human 
error, and violation of regulations or traffic signs is the beginning of an accident with this human factor (Ardito 
Ramadhan, 2019).

1854","In table 1 it can be seen that the APV method can be trusted to determine the condition of the traffic light status. Errors 
that occur during the day are mainly due to the condition of the traffic lights which are sometimes dim and coupled 
with backlighting so that the processed area has an insignificant difference. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Works 
As stated in the introduction above, this research is part of the bigger research of Electronic Traffic Law Enforcement 
(ETLE). The research on APV will later be used in the ETLE system that is being built to determine the status of 
active traffic lights in real time. When the traffic light status is in red condition, then the vehicle that exceeds the limit 
to stop will be declared as violate and will be further processed by police officers. 
 
For system reliability, it is also necessary to find a treatment to overcome the occurrence of calculation errors during 
the day. Although the percentage that happens is very small, this can be a problem if someone is found guilty while 
what actually happens is because of a color reading error. 
 
There is a possibility that the error can be eliminated by replacing the traffic light with LED or a lamp with a greater 
power to get greater intensity, so that during the day the differences between an off and an active traffic light signal 
can be distinguished more significantly.

Abstract 
 
Bubble tea currently represents a popular drink among Generation Z in Indonesia. However, the quality of bubble tea 
varies depending on intrinsic and extrinsic factors to make it more appealing. On the basis of consumers' final 
economic activity actor, it is crucial to examine what factors influence the consumer purchase decision behavior. Due 
to the bubble tea shop, owners will effectively meet customer expectations for bubble tea beverages. This study 
examines factors that may influence the consumer purchase decision (willingness to pay) of bubble tea and analyzes 
the price limits disparities. The research uses a quantitative approach by distributing questionnaires to 300 Generation 
Z domiciled in Bandung, Indonesia. This research examines several aspects, including price, taste, product design, 
brand influence, and location accessibility. Also, it analyzes whether the consumers' purchase decision factor and the 
price limit of the respondents are different when it is divided based on demographics factors. The data were analyzed 
using multiple linear regression (MLR). This study found that taste, price, product design, brand image, and location 
accessibility individually and simultaneously affect the willingness to pay among Generation Z in Bandung City. Also, 
this study found differences in several decision factors and price limits on bubble tea based on demographics factors. 
In conclusion, the current study has successfully examined the factors that influence consumer purchase decisions 
(willingness to pay) and analyzed the price limits disparities of bubble tea in Bandung, Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
Countries around the world are getting closer to going cashless, and as has been reported, Indonesia is increasing the 
activity of developing a cashless society. However, Indonesia is still very vulnerable to various practices of 
underground economy activities, which are generally carried out in cash. The reduction of cash transactions is 
expected to minimize criminal crime and reduce the potential loss of numbers recorded in GDP (gross domestic 
product). The use of non-cash payment instruments will also increase the circulation of money in the economy. The 
purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that influence Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to use electronic 
money (cashless) as one of the payment methods in their business. Also, to measure in-depth the readiness factors of 
Indonesian society related to electronic money. This qualitative study was utilized to explore all the possible and 
unique factors that can influence the Indonesian SMEs' intention to use electronic money through an in-depth interview 
method to determine the crucial factors that affect them. As a result, this study found twelve essential factors that 
influence SMEs' decision to use electronic money, including cashback, willingness to learn, elucidation, kinship, 
perceived security, education level, culture, facilities, business scale, performance expectancy, business sector, 
features. In conclusion, this study has successfully explored and identified drivers of intention to use electronic money, 
and it gives so many advantages in SMEs' business performance.

Abstract  
 
In recent years, online loyalty has grown more significant in the context of electronic commerce (e-commerce). 
Customers that are loyal to a company bring in long-term income and are seen as a valuable asset. However, in a 
competitive Internet environment, businesses lose consumers due to a lack of trust, contentment, and online loyalty. 
With an emphasis on consumer purchase intention development, this study shows how online loyalty, trust, and 
satisfaction form in e-commerce. Based on the literature study, a conceptual framework was created. Data was 
gathered from e-customers of online forms in a number of Indonesian cities. Confirmatory factor analysis was 
performed when the data was clarified. The theories were tested using structural equation modeling. Consumer

1866","5. Conclusion  
The factor of customer loyalty to e-commerce companies is one of the factors that customers buy back products 
from e-commerce companies. It is difficult to develop online loyalty in e-commerce businesses, and the study's 
findings demonstrate that online trust and happiness have a good impact on customer loyalty in e-commerce, as 
well as consumer repurchase of the company's items. How is online trust and online customer satisfaction for 
the company's e-commerce? The results of the research show that a reliable payment system and simple 
purchasing procedures have an effect on customer online trust. Meanwhile, online satisfaction is determined 
from the comfort and pleasure of the customer 
 
The number of e-commerce companies due to the trend of higher customer interest in buying via e-commerce, 
the easier it is for customers to move from one e-commerce company to an e-commerce company or in other 
words online loyalty can be very low if the company does not know what factors only that can increase 
customer online loyalty which will have an impact on customer repurchase of the company's products. The 
conclusion from the results of the study explains that the ease of purchasing process, comfort, pleasure will 
cause customers to buy back the company's e-commerce products, thus the e-commerce website that is built 
must pay attention to the above factors in order to generate online loyalty of the company and customers will 
repurchase the company‚Äôs product

Abstract 
 
The transmigration program was an initiative of the Dutch colonial government and later continued by the Indonesian 
government to move landless people from densely populated areas of Indonesia to less populous areas of the country. 
Forced migration due to climate change, natural disasters, and conflict is among the most important policy challenges 
of the 21st century. The purpose of this research was to identify the impact of the Transmigration policy in the 
utilization of the local socioeconomic and cultural environment for the Sigulai village community, Simeulue regency, 
Aceh province, Indonesia. The Simeulue Government‚Äôs policy to bring in 1000 trans migrant families aims to develop 
the area of potentials economic, but in reality, the policy is not comply with the policy that has been conveyed by the 
local government to provide facilities for 2 hectares of land, decent housing, life support, clean water facilities, 
educational facilities and transportation This study was a qualitative approach by using the triangulation data, namely 
observation, interviews and literature study. The results of this study indicated that the transmigration policy by the 
Simeulue district government does not yet have any clear goals and standards for the economic inequality. Also, this 
study identified that there is a positive impact of the transmigration policy on socioeconomic and cultural environment 
of local community, including the gardening skills. This study concluded that the transmigration policy does not yet 
have any clear goals and standards, especially for economic inequality and is a positive impact of the transmigration 
policy on socioeconomic and cultural environment of local community.

Abstract 
 
Keujruen Blang is a traditional institution engaged in agriculture to assist farmers' problems in managing rice areas, 
community development, and solving problems in implementing agricultural businesses. It is also a village apparatus 
as a functional technical implementing element that regulates rice field management at the village level geographically 
in an agricultural area. Therefore, the role and function of Keujreng Blang in the scope of government is crucial to be 
optimized to increase community participation in village development. Nagan Raya Regency, precisely in Beutong 
District, Babah Krueng Village, is one of the agricultural villages that must be realizing the industrialization in food 
independence. Based on BPS data in the 2020 edition in Nagan Raya Regency, rice production declined from 
37,457.89 tons to 21,467.69 tons. This study was carried out qualitatively with descriptive analysis. Interview 
techniques, documentation, and focus group discussion were used as data collection methods. Data analysis was 
employed for data collection, data reduction, presentation, and verification or conclusion. The results of this study 
indicated that the position of traditional institutions is still fragile, nominally and instrumentally. Also, this study 
showed that Keujruen Blang could not be implemented comprehensively with the provisions of the applicable law.

cross-sectional analysis of 93 companies across 14 industries with 10,000 bootstrap samples reveals that Industry 4.0 
maturity positively moderates the relationship between supply chain performance and company financial performance. 
The research result demonstrates that the relationship between supply chain performance and financial performance 
is significantly stronger when Industry 4.0 maturity is higher. The finding indicates that Industry 4.0 magnifies the 
potential financial returns to companies through supply chain performance. We also discuss the managerial and 
research implications.

1. Introduction 
Technology advances, especially communication and information technology, are changing the manner in which 
business create and capture value, how and where people work, and how people interact and communicate (Cascio 
and Montealegre, 2016). Together, these advances are hurtling business and manufacturing enterprises toward a new 
industrial revolution, which is based on cyber-physical system‚Äîa revolution popularly known as Industry 4.0, or 
smart factory manufacturing. Savvy corporate leaders know they must either figure out how these technology advances 
will transform their businesses or face disruption by others who figure it out first (Murray, 2015). Not surprisingly, 
the area of this subject has received considerable attention not only in business, but also in engineering, sciences, and 
social sciences (e.g., Akdil et al., 2018; Hermann et al., 2016; Madsen et al. 2016; Moeuf et al. 2017; Shrouf et al., 
2014). 
 
Extensive studies seek to understand how to enforce Industry 4.0 effectively and/or how Industry 4.0 affects 
production processes/operations (e.g., Hermann et al., 2016; Liao et al., 2017; Shrouf et al., 2014; Ungurean et al., 
2014). For example, Ungurean et al. (2014) present an IoT architecture based on the Open Platform Communications 
NET (OPC.NET) specifications from Gaitan et al.‚Äôs (2008) work to enhance the usage of both industrial environments 
and smart buildings. Mazak and Huemer (2015) address the importance of interoperability to the seamless exchange 
of data and information among different parties (e.g., manufacturing companies, suppliers, and specialist contractors) 
in value networks. 
 
Subsequent work by Edmonds and Bradley (2015) investigates the impact of automation on the job markets and 
economy. They conclude that Industry 4.0 relaxes resources previously required to undertake mundane and routine 
tasks, allowing them to be employed in high value and high paid roles. R√º√ümann et al. (2015) delineate the nine 
technology trends that are the building blocks of Industry 4.0 and investigate their potential financial economic 
benefits for manufacturers and production equipment suppliers. 
 
Cascio and Montealegre (2016) investigate the potential impacts of electronic monitoring systems, robots, 
teleconferencing, and wearable computing devices on work and organizations based on a systematic literature review,

positive and negative influences on financial performance.  
 
 
 
Figure 2. Relationship between supply chain performance and financial performance at low and high Industry 4.0 
maturity (10,000 bootstrap samples) 
Like any research, this study has some limitations. First, this study uses 93 samples for examining the hypotheses. 
Although this study integrates the bootstrap-based method with our analyses to ensure better generalization (Chen and 
Lin, 2018; Preacher and Hayes, 2008), future research should triangulate our research findings by using more samples. 
Second, it is possible that factors such as internal business process performance, customer performance, or 
technological management capacity (Hsiao et al., 2017) interact with Industry 4.0 maturity, which in turn affects 
financial performance. Our study does not explicitly explore these factors‚Äô relationships with Industry 4.0. Similarly, 
a company‚Äôs organizational climate and structure might influence the company‚Äôs Industry 4.0 implementation. Future 
research could investigate these effects on Industry 4.0 maturity and thereby on financial performance. 
 
In sum, extensive research in the Industry 4.0 field develops innovative approaches and methods to achieve automation, 
as well as operational efficiency and effectiveness. However, little research explores how Industry 4.0 maturity affects 
financial performance. Our analysis via the bootstrap-based method and PROCESS (Hayes, 2012; Preacher and Hayes, 
2008) shows that the relationship between SCP and financial performance is significantly stronger when Industry 4.0 
maturity is higher. The finding indicates that Industry 4.0 magnifies the potential financial returns to companies 
through SCP.

Abstract 
Structural equation modeling (SEM) is becoming the most used method when multiple constructs, relationships, and 
latent and observed variables are involved, two main statistical analysis techniques of SEM can be applied by 
researchers:  Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), and covariance-based (CB-SEM). 
This paper is presenting a comparison study between the two methods basing on a case study of the sustainable 
supply chain innovation model for the Moroccan industrial field during the period of 2020. Section I is dedicated to 
the conceptual model and the two structural analysis techniques presentation. Section II is explaining the 
methodology. Section III is consolidating the findings revealed where the CB-SEM technique is performed and 
consistently compared with PLS-SEM.

1. Introduction 
 SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) is usually used to explain multiple statistical relationships simultaneously 
through visualization and model validation (Dash and Paul 2021).  It is a powerful and robust multivariate statistical 
analysis technique that enable researchers to examine the inter-relationships among latent constructs based on 
theories and their respective observable indicator variables (Mahadzirah et al 2019).  Complex models can be 
discussed simply through this technique. It is an extension of traditional linear modeling techniques, e. g., multiple 
regression analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), prerequisites for learning SEM. Briefly, it can be defined 
as a combination of factor analyses and multiple regression analyses simultaneously (Sarstedt et al., 2017; Hair Jr et 
al., 2017a; Haenlein and Kaplan, 2004, Dash and Paul, 2021).  The covariance between the observed variables is 
explained by this method with detailed analysis of various covariance statistics, e.g., mean, standard deviation, etc.; 
Recently, the PLS approach has become quite popular among researchers due to its variance based relationship 
rather than covariance (AlNuaimi et al., 2021; Mueller & Hancock, 2018; Hair Jr et al., 2017b; Hayes et al., 2017); 
It is different from the traditional multivariate techniques that address only individual objectives; It also verifies 
alternate models to find the most appropriate relationship among the latent variables. It usually deals with a large 
sample (Mueller & Hancock, 2018; Hair Jr et al., 2017b; Hayes et al., 2017; Ullman & Bentler, 2003). 
 
The purpose of this paper is to compare both approaches based on various parameters and to provide a possible 
solution to the dilemma. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. A subsection to discuss the scope and 
objective of the paper, which explains the need for this study, the objectives, and the research questions. It also 
includes the contributions of the study. Section 2 relates important points of SEM history, highlights the various 
characteristics of SEM, presents important communalities between the two approach CB-SEM and PLS SEM, and 
lists the limitations of each approach basing literature review. Section 3 details the process of CB-SEM and PLS-

Abstract 
The growth of the urban population has permanently increased the demand for products. Likewise, the maturation of 
electronic commerce has increased urban freight transport, which has brought negative externalities such as emissions, 
pollution, noise, congestion, and loss of habitat. There is a visible effort to make urban last-mile deliveries more 
sustainable, mainly in environmental aspects. This is the reason for an interest in replacing conventional vehicles with 
electric vehicles, but this replacement has a series of conditions. The objective of this document is to systematically 
analyze the electrification of last-mile freight transport. From the review of the state of the art, affirmations were 
identified that allowed to establish cause and effect relationships between different attributes of the system that is 
represented, in such a way that, a causal diagram was obtained that systemically expresses the studied situation. As a 
result, we identify that social dissatisfaction because of particulate matter emissions generates social pressure that 
promotes incentives for the electrification of last-mile transportation and generates an increase in the sales of electric 
vehicles, thus reducing the sales of conventional vehicles. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
The rapid growth of e-commerce and package deliveries around the world demands new solutions to satisfy the desire 
of customers; this means a challenge for last-mile transport (Allen et al., 2018; 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021
¬© IEOM Society International
1901","2021; Feng & Figliozzi, 2013; Settey et al., 2021), the experiences reflected in these were taken to validate the 
variables and conditioning factors reflected in the causal diagram. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Transport is causing problems in urban areas, particularly freight transport, because online sales and globalization 
have increased because of the dynamism of societies. This, in turn, leads to new trends in freight transport and it is 
expected that more goods will be delivered shortly. Most of the goods delivered end up in city centers, considering 
that last-mile logistics is the least efficient stage of the supply chain, improving last-mile logistics and a significant 
reduction in externalities are issues of great relevance. 
 
Driven by commitments, interests, new laws, and regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, transporters are starting 
to use electric vehicles for last-mile deliveries. However, this migration to EVs has a series of challenges and 
difficulties, such as the cost of vehicles, the absence of recharging infrastructure, the storage capacity of batteries, the 
lack of incentives to promote the importation and purchase of EVs. EVs, among others. 
 
For the development of this document, from the review of literature, statements were identified that allowed the 
constitution of causal relationships, which were included in a causal diagram that systemically expresses the situation 
studied. When conducting the analysis, we identified that tax incentives condition the increase in sales of both electric 
and conventional vehicles, given that the existence of incentives that reduce the cost of EVs promotes their sale 
because it decreases the value to be financed by the buyer, while that if there are no incentives for EVs, transport 
companies will prefer to purchase conventional vehicles. Given that last mile transportation will continue to increase 
significantly, governments must promote the necessary incentives, both tax, and non-tax, to indirectly reduce 
emissions and diversify the basket of the transportation sector. 
 
As future work, we intended to bring the causal diagram built to a System Dynamics model with simulations that allows 
evaluating different scenarios.

Abstract  
 
SMEs are business units that receive special attention from the Indonesian government in the development of their 
businesses where the development of these business units is under the Ministry of Cooperatives and the Republic of 
Indonesia. SMEs with all the limitations that exist in their business trips must face increasingly heavy business 
competition that requires competitiveness in order to survive and grow their business. One of the factors that can 
increase competitiveness in business competition is increasing knowledge. In the current digital era, knowledge is 
available on the internet, especially on social media, which can be a source of increasing knowledge both on an 
individual and organizational scale. Therefore, this study aims to build a model for improving SMEs knowledges 
through knowledge sourced from social media. The results of the study are models of knowledge usage of social 
media to increase SMEs competitiveness.

1. Introduction  
SMES has an important role in the absorption of Indonesian labor. Based on the income reports of the Ministry of 
Cooperatives and SMES (2014), that the contribution of SMES to GDP reached 57.6% (BPS,2012). However, the 
existence of SMES in Indonesia has not yet had high competitiveness. The scale of business, productivity and the 
level of application of technology can be a factor in increasing the competitiveness of SMES. The availability of 
knowledge sourced from social media about the increasing business scale and productivity and the application of 
technology can be used by SMES to improve their competitiveness. This research aims to model the use and 
transformation of knowledge sourced from social media that can help SMES improve business scale and 
productivity and the application of technology. SECI's model is part of Knowledge Management and Learning 
explaining about the process of knowledge creation and transformation, tacit or explicit knowledge. Research related 
to the limitations and efforts to increase the advantages of SMEs has been carried out by several researchers

Abstract  
Enola Holmes directed by Harry Bradbeer, this film follows the story of Enola Holmes, a young woman who grew 
up with her mother. Enola had been taught numerous things on a daily basis, including mascullin things that were 
considered taboo for women at the time. On Enola's 16th birthday, her mother went missing, and she started to 
search for her in London. Her journey, however, turned out to be an exciting experience and challenging, despite her 
brothers being opposed to her looking for her mother. In this film, Enola is shown as a feminist teenager who defies 
the expectations of ladies her age. From the problem will be researched how effectiveness of instilling feminist 
values in the family will be discussed in this thesis. The theory that gonna used for analysis is semiotic theory by 
Roland Barthes. This theory talks about examining signifier giving a sign to the signified. Through descriptive 
qualitative methodology, this research was conducted to see the description of instilling feminist values to family. 
This study found that the description of instilling feminist values into the family appears by repeatation and a clear 
example.

1. Introduction 
Communication is very important in life. According to Shannon & Weaver, communication is a form of human 
interaction, where intentionally or unintentionally there are efforts to influence each other. Not only using verbal 
language, communication can also take the form of facial expressions, painting, art, or technology. In addition, the 
definition of communication according to Mary B. Cassata and Molefi K. Asante is communication as a process of 
transmitting information that is carried out with the aim of influencing the audience. For this reason, communication 
also requires a means to convey information that will be disseminated to the public. The channel that can be used to 
help spread information is social media. There are various social media that can be used to disseminate information, 
one of which is TikTok (Inovy, 2017).  
 
TikTok is currently enjoyed by many people and from various circles. In Indonesia, TikTok also went viral in 2018. 
However, unlike now, TikTok creators in Indonesia were bullied because they were considered strange. The 
Ministry of Communication and Informatics (Kominfo) even blocked TikTok because it was deemed not 
educational. However, now TikTok is again popular in Indonesia with more diverse creators. Starting from ordinary 
people who just fill their spare time by making TikTok videos, to reaching artists, officials, and even several 
organizations (Ini Asal Muasal TikTok Yang Kini Mendunia | Kumparan.Com, 2020). 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic was first reported to have entered Indonesia around the beginning of March 2020. President 
Joko Widodo has confirmed the truth about the existence of 2 Indonesian citizens who became the first patients who

1919","interest in taking a vacation or visiting an interesting place in Bali. While there are 9 percent of respondents who 
said No to this. Of course, with this, almost the majority of respondents agree with the existence of influencers in 
influencing the audience of their content on social media  
 
4. Conclusions and Results 
Based on the results of the research and discussion that have been described in the results of the research and data 
analysis above, the researchers draw the following conclusions: 
1. Social media is very influential in the lives of most people because almost everyone is ""media literate"" and has 
social media. To get information and entertainment, everyone nowadays has relied on social media. 
2. There are various types of social media, but the one that is currently on the rise is TikTok. The increase in TikTok 
users can be seen from the emergence of many new influencers from TikTok as well as downloads on the Google 
Play Store and AppStore applications. 
3. Tourism promotion through social media is more effective because many people already have social media. 
Social media, especially TikTok, assisted by influencers can help in promoting tourism in Bali again by creating 
interesting video content about existing tourism information by starting to use the hashtag #kemBALI which means 
to return to travel in Bali. 
 
Hopefully this research can be used as a reference to start using and following social media that can provide 
information as well as entertainment, use social media wisely,Observing what social media is currently being used 
but still has a ""plus"" value in its use.

Abstract 
 This paper presents a thermal analysis of a high-speed switched reluctance starter/generator SR 
Starter/Generator for the More Electric Aircraft, the average torque is kept at least 15 N.m and the 
speed drive up to 27000 rpm within 15 s in [4]. The Finite Element Analysis FEA method was 
used to validate the torque-speed characteristic in starting mode. Direct water-cooling stator yoke s 
were implemented by simulation and experimental method. Online turn on/off angles is controlled 
in wide-range speed and torque. In order to obtain maximum speed and torque with high power-
torque density, the phase current density is from 20 to 25 A/mm2 therefore cooling system method 
is a big challenge. This paper describes the precise estimation and measurement method of the 
losses and temperature distribution in a 30 kW, 50,000 rpm switched reluctance machine. Firstly, a 
core loss model was based on finite element analysis. Secondly, those losses were applied to a 
thermal analysis model including a liquid stator cooling to calculate the temperature distributions 
in different materials of SRM

1. Introduction 
The switched reluctance machines have been used as a starter/alternator for more electric aircraft 
applications in Stuart D  2005  and Materu P.N 1992. However, in the high-speed SRMs, iron 
losses in stator and rotor are much bigger than copper loss, so the cooling system method is a big 
challenge Raulin V 2004 and M. Torrent 2010. A detailed thermal analysis including liquid 
cooling circuit design and various operating modes has been carried out. The heat was assumed to 
be generated by iron, copper, and friction losses in the SRM. The SRM thermal behavior has been 
investigated by 3D and 2D FEA also considering the effects of the winding temperature rise. A 
forced liquid cooling system with a stator water jacket has been applied. Its heat transfer 
characteristics have been calculated by a computer fluid dynamic model (CFD). 
The calculated core losses and flux densities have been validated by experimental tests. For the 
experimental determination of the core loss and magnetic curves, test equipment for voltage, 
current and electric power over a wide range of frequencies has been built. The thermal behavior 
has been verified by measuring the temperature rise curves of the winding. 
 
2. SRM Loss Calculation 
In order to investigate the magnetic characteristics and densities of iron losses in different blocks 
of SRM rotor and stator, the core loss model has been built based on the SRM lamination shapes, 
magnetic material properties, and dimensional parameters listed in table I and fig. 1.

The simulated and measured temperatures in figures 8&9 are quite the good agreement. Hot spot 
points of front winding in the experiment are 890 C so close value to temperature distribution from 
840C to 900C (average value of 870C) in simulation. The difference is only 20C it is acceptable. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This paper has calculated losses and temperature distribution of an SRM 30 kW, 45,000 
simulation, and experimental methods. The temperature distribution of different parts in SRM has 
been investigated by modeling. The fluid velocity distribution in the stator jackets was simulated 
by a CFD model. The temperature rise curves of the SRM with a high current density of 20A/mm2 
and a high frequency of 2500Hz were implemented by FEA and experimental methods. The direct 
stator cooling by a liquid jacket for switched reluctance starter/alternator used in All More Electric 
Aircraft application, the current density is allowed up to 25A/mm2 embed with Aircraft cooling 
system with cold ambient temperature. The main contribution of this study is to figure out accurate 
iron losses and thermal calculation for high-speed switched reluctance starter/generator.

Abstract 
 
Driver distraction was found to be one of the main reasons for the traffic accidents. Latest studies have shown that 
engaging with distraction while driving will positively affect the driver‚Äôs driving behavior. However, the effect on 
young drivers might be varied due to the personality and skill differences. This study aims to explore the Indonesian 
young driver distraction and its impact on their driving behavior, which is measured using SDDQ (Susceptibility to 
Driver Distraction Questionnaire) and DBQ (Driver Behavior Questionnaire). A total of 332 participants, divided into 
different age groups (17-24 years old; 25-44 years old; and 45-64 years old) from all across Indonesia, were voluntarily 
involved in the study. The result shows that those who often engage in distraction while driving possessed a higher 
score on aberrant driving behavior. It was also found that young drivers tend to be more distracted while driving than 
older age groups. In addition, it is proven that age differences affect the driver‚Äôs perception of distraction, which is in 
line with the possibility of risky driving behavior.

Driver distraction, aberrant driver behavior, age group, young driver.  
 
1. Introduction 
Traffic law violations and accidents are common problems that we frequently encounter in every part of the 
world, including Indonesia. Findings by Jusuf et al. (2017) stated that in 2014, there are roughly 28.000 road accidents 
occurred in a year. Moreover, the research predicted that shortly, the aggregate would hit 40.000 accidents in a year. 
Comparatively speaking, the study also found that younger drivers tend to be involved in road accidents (NSHTA, 
2016).  In addition, Indonesia‚Äôs Ministry of Transportation admitted that 61% of accidents are strongly related to 
human error. 
Driver distraction is the activity that distracts the driver over its primary duty as a driver (Carney et al., 2018; 
Regan et al., 2011). Intriguingly, driver distraction, which is arguably one of the human errors, is found to be frequently 
present in young drivers (McDonald et al., 2014; Mahachandra et al., 2020). The research also stated that engaging in 
distractive activity while driving will increase the possibility of an accident. Generally, distraction can be divided into 
four categories: visual distraction, cognitive distraction, auditory distraction, and surrounding distraction (Regan et

1937","distraction variables of engagement, attitude and belief, and involuntary disorder could be used as predictors of the 
driver‚Äôs self-reported method of distraction on driving behavior in Indonesia. 
 
4.5 Relation driver distraction with the driver age group  
Regression analysis with moderator variable was carried out by including the age group to see if age 
difference had an effect on driver distraction and driving behavior. The calculation is done by comparing the simple 
regression model on SDDQ to DBQ, with the addition of ‚Äúage‚Äù on its equation. Table 4 shows that there is a significant 
effect between driver distraction and driving behavior when the age variable is appended.

It was found that the age factor had a greater influence on DBQ as indicated by an increase in R square value. 
for example, initial regression model with a value of 0.212 became 0.227 when age is taken into consideration. Chen 
et al. (2016) in their research stated that age can be a significant factor to indicate the driver‚Äôs involvement in a 
distraction during driving, moreover, reported using the self-reported method. 
Several studies in the past have identified how age factors affected the behaviour of distracted driver such as, 
the presence of personality and emotional differences between age groups (Lucidi et al., 2019), dissipation on driving 
experiences that affect understanding of road hazards between age groups (Scott-Parker, 2017; Wang et al., 2014), 
self-confidence in term of driving ability (Chen et al., 2016), situational awareness of experienced and inexperienced 
drivers (Chandrasekaran et al., 2019), and how age factor affects the distraction engagement‚Äôs frequency (Qin et al., 
2019). 
  
5. Conclusion 
This study aims to explore whether there is an influence on driving behavior in case a driver is involved in 
distraction and also wanted to discern whether a person‚Äôs age has an effect if it is used as a moderator variable on 
driving behavior. Although this research was a limited and subjective research intended to car and motorcycle driver, 
it was found that each item on the SDDQ and DBQ was able to assess distraction or even driving behaviour quite well. 
Based on the data collection and analysis that has been carried out, it was found that in Indonesia, the 
tendency of a person‚Äôs driving behavior might be influenced by the driver‚Äôs involvement in distraction while driving. 
The respondents of this study were dominated by young Indonesian drivers ranging from 18 ‚Äì 24 years old. It was 
also found that the majority of respondents were more often involved in conversations with passengers which resulted 
in declined driver alertness and lapses in driving. 
The existence of the moderator variable also had a significant influence on driving behavior, in which, may 
occur due to differences in experience and comprehension related traffic hazards. Indeed, it might have an impact on 
the emergence of risky driving behavior in young Indonesian drivers in line with the increase of accidents. further 
research could can be done on one vehicle object to increase accuracy of the research. Conducting objective research 
could also be a choice to better understand other factors that may influence driving behavior.

Abstract  
  
This study analyzes customer reviews by applying Sentiment Analysis to test the similarity of expectations in airport 
experiences shared by domestic and international travelers in the 3 top busiest airports in Saudi Arabia and measure 
the correlation extent of their expectations in each airport. The study's methodology was by first collecting customers' 
verbatim comments in English and Arabic on the three major airports in Saudi Arabia, which are King Khalid Int. The 
airport in Riyadh, King Abdulaziz Int Airport in Jeddah, and King Fahad Int Airport in Dammam. The existing data 
is extracted from Skytrax, a prominent airline and airport reviewing website, and Twitter, the #1 social media platform 
used in Saudi Arabia. Second, preprocess the data through data cleaning for analysis preparation. Third, run the 
customers' verbatim comments database through Sentiment Analysis to identify the favorable and unfavorable services 
provided by the airports. Finally, stratify the data into clusters based on the outputs of the analysis. The expected 
outcome of applying SA is to essentially rank the customer's favorable and unfavorable services based on their 
verbatim feedback on the website domestic and international travelers.

1. Introduction   
Customers today use a wide range of communication channels to provide feedback on services and products offered 
by companies. These include social media pages, customer satisfaction surveys, customer emails, telephone calls, text 
messages, product reviews, and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platforms. Due to the sheer magnitude 
of the data collected from these platforms, it has become necessary for experts to develop new efficient ways of 
analyzing the data (Fontanella, C., 2020).   
  
In Saudi Arabia, Twitter is the most used social media data source, followed by Facebook and Instagram. Recent 
researchers that have also used Twitter as a source of data include (Yuliyanti & Sukoco, 2017), (Martin-Domingo et 
al., 2019), (Mansour, 2018), (Mahtab et al. 2018), and (Vishal & Uma, 2018). These studies mainly used machine 
learning tools and applications in English, such as RapidMiner, SVM, Python, and R. In general, the studies report a 
high success rate in classifying user sentiments.  
  
Most of the research on Opinion Mining is tailored for the English language, and research on Arabic mining reviews 
is growing at a prolonged rate. When applying Sentiment Analysis on customer feedback on airport reviews in Saudi 
Arabia, there is no doubt that providing services to customers requires distinguished levels of service quality in order 
to achieve high satisfaction rates, encourage airlines and airports to optimize their operations, and enhance the 
reputation of Saudi Arabian airlines and airports thus supporting the development of the Tourism and National 
Heritage Sectors which is the 8th theme of the Kingdom's 2030 vision (Vision 2030 | The Embassy of The Kingdom of 
Saudi Arabia, 2016).

subjective terms with a high degree of accuracy. Synthesizing with past research done on Arabic textual analysis, the 
challenge of analyzing informal Arabic used in everyday language was remedied by assigning expert judgers to 
thoroughly analyze the reviews and annotate each review with its sentiment and classify it based on the airports' 
services.   
  
For further research, an algorithm model that can be developed into software could potentially fasten up the bilingual 
sentiment and clustering analysis by introducing a bag of words and machine learning. The software could be 
developed to also listen to the customer's voice in real-time, prioritize unfavorable remarks, and enhance brand 
reputation while preventing customer churn.

Abstract  
 
Selection of structural system for new highway bridges during the conceptual design stage is critical to the success of 
the project and meeting stakeholders‚Äô requirements. During bridge conceptual design, a large set of subjective 
requirements must be considered and evaluated in terms of multiple criteria. In addition, it is critical to incorporate 
client needs and expectation during the conceptual design stage to achieve their satisfaction toward the delivery stage 
of the project. For this reason, this paper is proposing an integrated methodology to improve the decision-making 
process during bridge conceptual design. The proposed methodology utilises the quality function deployment (QFD) 
method to translate client needs into design requirements and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to prioritizes 
competing alternatives based on multicriteria decision analysis. The main advantage of integrating QFD and AHP is 
their ability to rank the design alternatives in order of their effectiveness in meeting client needs. While the QFD 
analysis has the power to optimize the designers‚Äô solutions from the point of view of quality engineering, the AHP 
analysis helps to make the best decision in a multicriteria decision-making situation.

1. Introduction  
The most important stage of the bridge design process is the conceptual design stage. It consumes the first 10‚Äì20% of 
total design time and has an impact on the entire design process (Wai-Fah and Lian, 2000). Moreover, poorly 
conceived design concept can never be compensated by a good, detailed design (Xu et al., 2005; Machwe and Parmee, 
2007). The most important sub-stage in the conceptual design of a bridge is the selection of the bridge structural 
system, which is based on a wide range of factors including cost, maintenance considerations, aesthetic, construction 
time, function, sustainability, safety, environmental impacts, availability and many other design requirements.  
 
Nowadays, many business organizations are looking for new strategy to stand out in the competitive market by 
offering the best possible products or services to their clients. One of the key processes to achieve this is by 
implementing a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach, which is based on listening to the client and translating

Abstract  
 
To develop more sustainable societies, industries should focus on solving environmental and economic challenges 
using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technologies for monitoring and energy auditing of buildings. Building 
defects, such as heat loss, moisture, and air leakage, inevitably lead to inefficient space heating or cooling, 
essentially explaining high energy consumption and associated emissions. UAVs contain modern monitoring 
equipment and thermal cameras to document building performance energy, creating digital models, and 3D 
photogrammetry. By advanced technology of UAVs, energy auditors can analyze the energy used rapidly and 
accurately while reducing operational costs and minimizing safety risks by reaching remote or inaccessible areas 
without compromising the pilot's life. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how the use of 
UAVs for energy audit leads to sustainability through a systematic review of seventeen studies by following the 
steps of PRISMA. The results reveal that the UAVs contribute to improving the energy performance of the 
building, which leads to reducing carbon emissions, saving energy costs, and improving human life and health. In 
this study, I attempted to shed light on how the use of UAVs drives sustainability by focusing on the economy, 
energy consumption, environmental impacts, social and safety issues.

auditors. 
 
1. Introduction  
Unmanned aerial vehicles have been growing in buildings energy auditing to achieve sustainability in built 
environments. Energy efficiency is considered one of the significant factors prohibiting the advancement towards 
the global purpose of Green House Gas emissions (GHG) reduction (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 
2014). With the ever-rising worldwide energy demand, management and auditing strategies have risen in critical 
importance(Ariffin et al., 2021). Reducing energy consumption has resulted in positive environmental and 
economic returns. Overall, buildings accounted for 36 percent of global energy demand and 37 percent of energy-
related CO2 emissions in 2020. see Figure 1 (2021 GLOBAL STATUS REPORT FOR BUILDINGS AND 
CONSTRUCTION Towards a zero-emissions, efficient and resilient buildings and construction sector, 2021). 
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA 2021), the total energy consumption in buildings can be 
classified into five sectors, as shown in Figure 2. The transition towards mainstream net-zero carbon standards 
requires immediate and strict action to achieve greater awareness, innovation, improved processes to calculate 
and process lost energy in buildings. The energy audit and inspection is the key to a structured approach to energy 
management decision-making (Patravale et al., 2018).

1967","5. Conclusion  
UAVs technology has massive potential and is a solution to the challenges of the energy audit. With the 
advancement of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we will witness new technologies and improvements to advance 
the energy monitoring process by using UAVs that detect and analyze lost energy in buildings to reach the highest 
levels of quality in maintenance, auditing. Energy processing work will become automated, requiring less human 
input, participation, and expectedly yielding more accurate results. UAVs are estimated to cut audit time and 
increase reporting accuracy, resulting in reliability (Oh, Ham and Lee, 2021). This paper has presented how the 
use of UAVs for energy audit leads to sustainability in three main sectors (environment and energy consumption, 
economy, and safety sector), based on up-to-date published literature.  
 
The battery power is drained at different rates depending on how it is operated. In the case of wall crack inspection, 
UAVs inevitably must travel upwards. However, thrust and acceleration are the two motions that drain the battery 
quickly. Thus, it is critical to minimize the thrust and acceleration motions while navigating and inspecting walls. 
To reach the goal of making a drone travel its maximum. Solar energy can be used to charge the UAVs for longer 
and safer audit energy flights. The author firmly believes that more research is needed to develop UAVs for energy 
audit as one of the main contributors to achieve sustainability. Due to some weak capabilities in UAVs, such as 
the battery save and their inability to fly in some rainy and windy weather conditions. 
 
In conclusion, there are integrated interrelationships between UAVs for energy auditing, energy consumption, 
environmental impact, economy, and safety sector that are shown in Figure 5. a Causal Loop Diagram by Vensim 
software.

Abstract  
 
The pandemic situation has been going on for almost a year. Starting from March 2020 to 2021, we are still in the 
same situation. Online teaching and learning activities that carried out are preventive measures taken to protect 
educators and students. However, the journey and process of teaching and learning activities brings its own 
challenges for educators and students. All policies and strategies are carried out so that the comfort in the running 
process is still felt like during face-to-face lectures. However, in reality the challenges of the online learning process 
such as the results of research and news coverage cannot be avoided. This is the background for research that 
focuses on Communication Strategies of Private University Students in Malang in Adapting to Online Lectures 
During Pandemic. The subject of this research is communication study program. The focus of the study on 
communication strategies was chosen because the researcher wanted to get data in the form of student 
communication styles to lecturers through various media, the media used to support their learning, and other 
findings from the communication approach that had not been revealed previously. This study uses the Theory of 
Uncertainty Reduction and Communication Accommodation as a supporting theory. The approach used is 
descriptive quantitative with survey method.

1. Introduction 
The pandemic has been going on for almost a year. Starting from March 2020 until the change in 2021, still in the 
same situation. Pandemics bring many things to happen and adjustments that must be made by various parties 
including academics in the institute. Adaptation among academics is certainly in response to government policies on 
limiting activities that have the potential to involve crowds and increase the chances of transmission of the covid-19 
virus. The policy issued by the government in this case is the Ministry of Education and Culture is a learning and

well"" Respondent 2 
 
6. Conclusion 
Adjusting to carrying out learning activities during a pandemic is a challenge for students. Because they have to find 
their own sources of information and learning references. Although the lecture continues and lecturers can be 
contacted via mobile phone, it will certainly be different from normal learning. This is what makes students have to 
create their own strategies in order to adjust well during online lectures. 
 
Based on the results of the study, the communication strategy chosen by students is a passive strategy, which is as 
much as 73.2% of respondents. This shows that students still have not taken advantage of the moment to discuss 
with lecturers. Respondents tend to find out for themselves what they need and occasionally ask friends if they think 
they need direction. It is unfortunate, because the openness of students to lecturers is very necessary. But on the 
other hand, this can also be a suggestion for institutions and educators to be able to approach their students in order 
to discuss and share information well. For the creation of more conducive learning activities.

Based on the results of the above calculations show all the hypotheses are proven convincingly. The level of 
customer trust to transact online is especially influenced by transaction security and information quality. The value 
of online transactions is also affected by reduced transaction costs and time. In the end, the customer's desire to 
transact online, especially fashion, is influenced by creativity, technology support, trust and value.

Abstract 
  
One of the crucial aspects for a firm is to choose the right mixture of debt and equity to make a financial decision. 
While debt is a cheaper source of equity as it offers tax savings, there are other financial risks associated with the use 
of debt such as high-interest rates and cash flow difficulty. Equity is less risky, but more expensive when compared 
to debt financing. It might take several years to gain returns from an innovative project, and all companies do not have 
enough internal resources to invest in research and development which is one of the main reasons companies seek 
external financing sources. In this paper, the use of debt/equity and its impacts on the innovative activities of a firm 
will be discussed. A rigorous study of the impact of leverage on the research and development expenses of a firm (a 
proxy of innovation) will be conducted with the help of Regression analysis to show that debt financing of a company 
is not directly related to the innovation output of a firm when the market value of firms are controlled. This study 
explores meaningful insights on how capital structure affects the technological innovation of a company.

Capital Structure, Debt and Equity, Innovation, Financial Leverage, Research and Development 
 
1. Introduction  
Capital Structure is one of the decisions alongside investment and dividend policies a company must take to optimize 
the value of the firm. A capital structure of a firm is a topic which is affected by asymmetric information. In corporate 
financing, asymmetric information is a condition when the internal people for instance, managers have a better 
information of their firm‚Äôs value and investment opportunities when compared to the market participants (Klein et al. 
2002). A capital structure decision can be really complicated to take considering the costs and benefits associated with 
debt and equity securities. Any wrong capital structure decision might lead a firm to financial distress or bankruptcy 
(Seetanah et al. 2014). To compensate this challenge, this paper focuses on the kind of impact that capital structure of 
a company has on the research and development of a firm. This paper further explores the relationship between 
different variables related to financial analysis of capital structure of a firm. 
 
Companies primarily use debt and equity financing to raise capitals for their business, but both have their own upside 
and downside. Mostly, companies use a mixture of debt and equity depending on what a company needs during 
different circumstances. Debt financing involves borrowing money where there is an obligation to pay it back with 
interest in the future. One of the major advantages of debt financing is that a company does not have to give ownership 
of the business to someone else, and there are several tax benefits. On the other hand, Equity is riskier and more

4.2 The Results of Regression Analysis with Controlling the Market Value of Firms 
When controlling the market value of the firms, it can be interpreted that there is a negative relationship between debt 
financing and innovation since the beta coefficient is negative. It can be said that with every million dollars increase 
in debt financing, innovative activities decrease by 0.3158936 million dollars (As Table 2 shows). Since the 
relationship between debt and innovation is negative, it can be said that the relationship between equity financing and 
innovation is positive. The relationship between debt financing and technological innovation is highly significant as 
the p-value is 0.000 which is less than significance level of 0.05.

4.3 Proposed Improvements 
The regression analysis used in finding the impact of financial leverage on innovative activities might not be sufficient 
to prove that research and development of a company truly depends on equity-based financing or debt financing. 
Several other financial engineering techniques might be required to demonstrate that research and development of a 
firm depends on financial leverage of a company. Similarly, the firms which were analyzed with the help of financial 
engineering techniques is geographically limited to the United State of America, and the results obtained might not be 
applicable to other regions of the world. The market value of the firms while doing the regression analysis was 
controlled, and there might be several other factors which needed to be controlled to get a true representation of the 
impact of leverage on the innovative activities of the firms.  
 
5. Conclusion  
Using different financing sources have their own pros and cons. While it is cheaper to use debt because of its tax 
benefits, it can be a concern to the firm because of high interest rate and cash flow difficulties. While there is no risk 
to pay back loan on equity financing, it can be highly expensive at the same time. It is important to find the right mix

the ability to pay back to the respective sources.  
 
One of the major findings from the regression analysis of 6,251 firms from the US in 2019 and 2020 reveals that the 
debt of a company has a negative relationship with research and development when the market value of companies 
are controlled. The investment on technological innovation decreases with the use of debt financing over the period, 
and it can be said that equity financing is a better choice when it comes to investing on research and development. 
While there can be loss of ownership or control, equity financing is less risky to uncertainties like a global pandemic 
or economic distress as there is no obligation to pay back the loan or interest rates. Also, several bankruptcy costs can 
be reduced by reducing the use of equity financing. These findings have been highly significant as the p-value is 0.000 
which is highly precise.  
 
There was another major finding from the regression analysis shows that when the market values of firms were not 
controlled. There is a positive relationship between debt financing and innovative activities when the market value of 
firms are not controlled. This implies that firms with higher market value do not have a problem financing research 
and development with debt financing as they have enough internal resources to pay back the loan on time and not lose 
their credit worthiness.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this research is to find out how to increase the competitiveness of micro-enterprises when they 
want to enter international trade in an effort to expand the market. The scope of the research focuses only on 
micro-enterprises in the province of East Java, which actually have superior products and can be used as export 
commodities to neighboring countries that have an interest in micro-business products from East Java. The 
research study uses several variables related to activities to increase competitiveness in order to open export 
markets where data collection uses a questionnaire instrument and uses a Categorical test approach through 
Syntax analysis. With the Syntax method, the relevant variables appear clearly in the quadrant map. The 
Categorical test method using Syntax is still rarely used in research, even though the test results are accurate for 
the field of social science. Through the Syntax testing process, it turns out that all the variables used have 
different contributions in each city. And in almost all cities that are used as research objects, their micro-
enterprises still need a lot of improvement, even though the products of these micro-enterprises appear to be 
superior and in demand abroad. The study in this study used limited variables, not covering all variables related 
to global micro-enterprise management, due to space limitations and other technical constraints. The results of 
this study can be used as material for study and consideration as well as input for the local government of East 
Java in making programs related to increasing the competitiveness of micro-enterprises. The focus of the 
discussion in this research is slightly different from other studies, because the focus is on the development of 
regional products or local products that have the potential to develop in the international market. This type of 
paper is empirical-objective so it does not involve the subjective point of view of the researcher, measure, 
observe and analyze for solutions.

Abstract 
  
Current advances in manufacturing technology have made the automotive market much more competitive. Customers 
are seeking the best products at the lowest possible cost. To maintain the best possible working relationship, it is every 
supplier‚Äôs responsibility to ship products that meet the requirements and are on time. This paper will focus on how 
internal scrap costs can directly correlate to externally received customer complaints. Quality scrap is a large driver 
in cost, shipment timing, and customer satisfaction. Every part made internally that is defective is at risk of being 
shipped to the customer. The higher the scrap cost the more likely a supplier is to ship a bad part. This will cause 
customers to lose faith in the supplier‚Äôs ability to produce a quality part and may lead to the customer seeking a 
different supplier in the future. To verify this relationship, a study was done on 4 different business groups in a 
company, comparing the percentage of internal scrap vs. overall sales per month and the complaints received. The 
results show that there is a relationship between internal scrap cost and customer complaints, but there are other factors 
that can contribute.

1. Introduction 
Some may ask, ‚ÄúWhat is Cost of Quality (COQ)?‚Äù American Society of Quality (ASQ) defines the COQ as ‚Äúa 
methodology that allows an organization to determine the extent to which its resources are used for activities that 
prevent poor quality, that appraise the quality of the organization‚Äôs products or services, and that result from internal 
and external failures‚Äù. While this is a sufficient definition, COQ is much more complex. Quality-One International 
defines COQ as ‚Äúall costs associated with the quality of a product from preventive costs intended to reduce or eliminate 
failures, cost of process controls to maintain quality levels and the costs related to failures both internal and external.‚Äù 
These costs are used by companies to evaluate the need for more resources (equipment, manpower, etc.). 
 
This study focuses on the cost of poor quality associated with internal defect costs compared to the number of customer 
complaints received during 3 a year span. The crucial piece of this definition is the result of internal and external 
failures. Every day at automotive manufacturing facilities millions of parts are being produced. Most of these parts 
are of the utmost quality, but others do not meet the desired specifications and are considered scrap. Each piece of 
scrap strikes a company‚Äôs profit margin as well as poses a potential risk of shipping non-conforming parts to all 
customers. Internal and external failures are the most significant contributors of COPQ, as they can range between 
20% and 100% and comprise the total costs of goods produced (Galli, B. J. 2021). The particular company studied 
sets a target of scrap cost as a percentage of sales. As the percentage of scrap costs rises, the number of complaints 
also rises. While this indicates there is a correlation, there are other participating elements to be explored. 
 
1.1 Background 
Making a quality component is vital to customer satisfaction. Each company in the field must maintain product quality, 
deliver on time and at a competitive price to achieve customer satisfaction (Misztal, A., Grecu, I., & Belu, N. 2016). 
Companies have increasingly focused their attention on quality costs because related activities use substantial

2000","6. Conclusion  
The study showed that there is a potential correlation between scrap costs and the number of complaints received for 
business units 3 and 4 and that there is likely no correlation for units 1 and 2. However, this data can be misleading, 
and the study should more than likely be repeated. When pulling together the data the scrap cost was pulled for the 
entire process, not just the final process. For business units 3 and 4 there are not a lot of sub-processes therefore the 
total scrap cost is very close to that of the final operation, while business units 1 and 2 have multiple operations that 
can highly increase the overall scrap and potentially skewing the results seen.  
 
There is also a factor that is not considered and that is the technology being used to evaluate these defects. If the 
defects are being captured by a 100% vision check or functional test, then the risk of getting to the customer is minimal 
and therefore can produce a large scrap value without a complaint. Robots and in-process inspection systems equipped 
with machine vision solutions are used for increased flexibility and quality in automated manufacturing (Oleksandr 
Semeniuta, Sebastian Dransfeld, Kristian Martinsen, Petter Falkman. 2018). Business unit 1 has 100% critical 
functional testing for all completed assemblies and a review of the data shows most of the rejects come from this 
operation and the parts are automatically placed in a scrap bin. This eliminates the risk of shipping a non-conforming 
part of this type to the customer. These are also fully assembled parts at this point meaning they cost much more than 
a sub-assembly further skewing the data. Business meanwhile has a 100% visual inspection by experienced inspectors 
before the parts are packed and shipped.  
 
There is also the factor of human error and technological advancements for monitoring the data. Much of the scrap 
cost are a manual calculation based on scrap sheets filled out by the production operators and then input into a system 
that will calculate the cost based on where the part was in the process. This can lead to typos and missing information. 
Customer complaints are also tabulated manually by using the approved ‚ÄúLOG‚Äù. Some customer complaints may not 
get input. There has also been a large amount of turnover in the departments responsible for inputting all the data 
which can lead to missing information. If this study were to be completed again taking all these factors into account, 
then the result may look a lot different.

Abstract   
  
Real-world emissions are much higher in several parts of the world without evident reason. This work aims to 
investigate for those differences in Mexico in the way that findings can be extrapolated to other countries. We 
identified three fields that have not been thoroughly covered in the literature: i) Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) 
programs, ii) air-conditioning systems (A/C), and iii) regional-based conditions such as fuel-quality, altitude, and 
model-year technologies.   
 
First, we must understand that I/M programs, which are absent in many countries, were created to identify highly 
polluting vehicles and force them to undergo mechanical maintenance. In this context, a methodology, based on a 
single measurement campaign using a Remote-Sensing Device (RSD), is presented in this work to assess the reduction 
in vehicles emissions obtained from implementing I/M programs. As a case study, an RSD campaign was carried out 
in Monterrey‚Äôs Metropolitan Area, Mexico. Approximately 0.4% of the vehicles registered in this region were sampled 
under similar conditions to those found in I/M programs. The results suggested that 39% of the vehicles would not 
comply with the current national regulations. Following a conservative scenario, the implementation of a vehicle I/M 
program in this urban center has the potential of reducing the current mass emissions of HC, CO and NO in 
approximately 69%, 42% and 28%, respectively.  
 
Second, to determine A/C impact on the real fuel consumption, light-duty passenger vehicles were monitored under 
their normal driving conditions in a 5-month campaign. We obtained, second-by-second, simultaneous measurements 
of the vehicle‚Äôs fuel consumption, speed, position, engine speed and load, and the A/C operational state (on/off). The 
results obtained showed that the added Specific-Fuel-Consumption (SFC, L/100 km) due to the A/C peaked at low 
vehicle speeds (<10 km/h) with values up to 17.6 L/100 km. This increment reduces with vehicle speed, being (on 
average) 8.2 L/100 km for low speeds (<50 km/h) and 1.3 L/100 km for higher speeds. However, when observing this 
increment in terms of fuel consumption rate, those differences remained approximately constant at 0.9 L/h. Results 
showed that the SFC metric is naturally influenced by the vehicle‚Äôs speed, hiding the real effect of the A/C fuel 
consumption. Therefore, we suggested to report the A/C added fuel consumption using the fuel consumption rate 
metric, which showed no clear relationship with vehicle speed. Additionally, we found that the A/C added load to the 
engine forces it to operate in regions of better efficiencies.  
 
And third, to identify the effect of regional based conditions, results from RSD measurements obtained in four different 
locations within Mexico and the US were compared. Results show that fuel formulation, altitude, and vehicle age were 
not significant factors in the Mexico-US emissions discrepancy. It was mainly due to the notable presence of one 
outdated vehicle technology in Mexico. In the Mexico-City, this single vehicle technology raises the overall CO, HC, 
and NO emissions by 16%, 12%, and 29%, respectively.

Abstract  
 
COVID-19 has made precision logistics more critical than ever before and logistics management more complicated. 
Which must the help from the government, It relate to set the direction of policy priority for solving the logistics 
problems of Thailand during COVID-19. Therefore, this research aims to find factors that should be urgently improved 
and developed to increase the efficiency of the Thai logistics system. This study demonstrates to implement optimal 
investment priorities and enact appropriate regulations to improve Thailand's logistics system, which reducing 
resource waste and inefficient investments and promoting industrial development and international trade, by using the 
consistent fuzzy preference relations (CFPR) method to weigh the significant factors influencing Thailand's logistics

1. Introduction  
Logistics systems were essential for national competitiveness (Wong and Tang, 2018). As a result of rising 
globalization, several nations have focused more on improving their national logistics costs in order to improve their 
competitiveness and support their national development objectives (Havenga, 2018). The World Bank's Logistics 
Performance Index (LPI), Doing Business's Trading Across Borders Indicators, and the World Economic Forum's 
Global Competitiveness Index are only a few examples of global indicators connected to national-level logistics. 
Although these indicators give useful macro-level information for countries, they are insufficient for assessing 
domestic and internal logistics operations in particular countries (Banomyong et al., 2021). 
 
Developing a national logistics system requires big data from providers and significant investment from the 
government to use investment capital effectively and rightly determine the policy. Prioritization of development is 
required. However, while choices have been made regarding the critical tasks that must be completed to strengthen 
the country's logistics system, a precise investment plan for rapid and effective improvement has yet to be developed. 
Furthermore, only a small amount of study has used quantitative analysis to identify the critical issues that must be 
addressed to enhance Thailand's logistics system (Banomyong et al., 2021; Garza-Reyes et al., 2018). Furthermore, 
the COVID-19 pandemic directly impacted logistics providers during the COVID-19 crisis. Logistics organizations, 
an essential element of value chains, assist businesses to get their products to customers by facilitating trade and 
commerce inside and across international boundaries. As a result, supply chain interruptions induced by the pandemic 
might influence the sector's competitiveness, economic development, and job creation. The COVID-19 epidemic has 
had a significant impact on logistics providers, exposing the vulnerability of operations in the provider sector and 
introducing new problems. Policymakers have had the difficult job of supporting health care and unemployment while 
staying within the constraints of economic and financial framework actions to avoid a complete economic shutdown.

Abstract  
 
Digital Marketing is a critical factor for SMEs in e-business. Currently, in SMEs gradual increase in use of e-business 
can be observed to gain a competitive advantage in highly aggressive markets and to achieve global access. Within all 
these e-business tools and techniques Digital Marketing does a most prominent role in achieving markets and access 
levels. Hence SME and the country can vastly benefit from adopting digital marketing because SMEs are considered 
as the engine of growth of a local economy. Therefore, for an SME to adopt digital marketing a certain set of factors 
should exist. The factors such as technology and infrastructure, market forces, supporting industry, finance and budget, 
skills and knowledge and management support is identified as an extension of the PERM model through a systematic 
literature review.

1. Introduction  
  
In a dynamic environment where different opportunities arise with different levels of technological advancement 
Digital Marketing can be highlighted as one element. Many opportunities are created in the e-business world where 
organisations can reap them and use it for their own growth because of Digital Marketing. According to Chaffey & 
Ellis-Chadwick (2019) Digital Marketing can be elaborated as the utilization of digital media, data and technology 
fused with traditional communications to achieve marketing objectives. The objective of Digital Marketing is to 
interact with multiple audiences is a harmonised pattern communicating the innovations, ideas, trends, and 
organisational objectives.   
  
SMEs are usually known to be the engine of growth for a country's economy due to their significant economic 
contributions (Putra & Hasibuan, 2015). In Sri Lanka context, SMEs are defined based on the number of employees 
and annual turnover under the SME policy framework (Ministry of Industry and Commerce, 2016). Medium, Small 
and Micro scale enterprises can be categorised under SMEs in Sri Lanka, where Annual Turnover and Number of 
Employees of Manufacturing and Service sector under of SMEs are listed in Table 1.

Once and organisation does there marketing activities through digital media it is known to be digital marketing (Smith, 
2012, p.86). Once an organisation uses the necessary digital marketing strategies, tool, and technologies, do digital 
marketing through appropriate channels and reach the target consumer segment it‚Äôs when an organisation has adopted 
digital marketing. Hence consideration on the digital marketing strategy, tools and technique usage, and reach of 
consumers through the usage of channels.  
  
5. Conclusion  
The above studies have talked about e-commerce in SMEs, the challenges, uses and impacts through models and 
various forms of research and further discusses about digital marketing in SMEs and digital marketing adaption in 
SMEs the multiple benefits varying from increase in consumer awareness to expanding the market globally. Hence 
through literature, the global situation in digital marketing can be identified as developed and advanced reaping the 
maximum benefits possible. And further according to literature it can be identified that adoption of e-commerce and 
digital marketing level is low though there is a considerable potential to expand in which is a significant problem in 
Sri Lanka. The impact and different aspects of digital marketing is addressed catering to specific industries. Through 
the papers which discusses on the situation in Sri Lanka the current situation of digital marketing in SMEs in Sri Lanka 
can be identified as though Sri Lanka has the potential to adopt to global level of digital marketing, financial, 
technological and facility resources restrictions hinder the adoption. Finally factors as technology and infrastructure, 
market forces, supportive industry, finance and budget, skills and knowledge and management support are identified 
as the influencing, readiness factors in order to adopt and implement digital marketing by Sri Lankan SMEs.

Abstract  
 
Financial behavior is how individuals or households actually behave in a determination of financial behavior. How 
individuals or households make decisions about their financial behavior. Financial system stability The financial 
system is one of the macro components that affects the stability of a country's economic financial system. This study 
is to see the effect of individual / household financial behavior on the stability of the financial system of 33 provinces 
in Indonesia during 2013 to 2019. The data for this research is secondary data collected from several sources, namely 
the Bank Indonesia Statistics Bulletin, the Central Agency Regional Economic Studies Bulletin. Statistics in various 
editions of the year of publication. The method used to analyze the data is the Panel Data Regression method using 
the Eviews 10 analysis tool. The purpose of this study is to determine the magnitude of the influence of financial 
behavior on the stability of the financial system in Indonesia. The variables in financial behavior are the dimensions 
of financial financial inclusion as measured by the access dimension, namely the ratio of the number of bank offices 
to 100,000 population in 33 provinces, the dimensions of use, namely the number of MSME loans to the total amount 
of credit in each province, savings and the percentage of poor people in 33 provinces in Indonesia. Financial system 
stability is measured from the GRDP growth rate in 33 provinces in Indonesia. The findings of this study are that 
access, use, savings, and poverty are able to explain the GRDP as seen from the R-Square value of 0.92, which means 
that all independent variables are able to explain the dependent variable while 8% is explained by variables outside 
the model. When people are able to access UMKM credit available at formal financial institutions, it will increase the 
GRDP, this can be seen from the MSME credit value increasing by 1%, the PDRB will increase by 0.02%. The 
relationship between the percentage of poor people and the GRDP also shows a significant relationship where if 
poverty is reduced by 1%, then GRDP will increase by 9.5%.

1. Introduction  
Currently, economic development is not only aimed at improving the welfare of society but also aims at human beings 
with broad insight who have foresight. Not only focus on the development of physical facilities but also focus on 
mindset should also be increased, for example on financial management. 
Knowledge about finance is growing due to increasing human needs which are increasingly complex related to one's 
ability of personal intelligence to be effective for the realization of social welfare related to globalization which we 
cannot avoid, such as in determining future decisions related to short-term decisions or long term indirectly. Financial 
literacy is something that should be a basic need for everyone individuals or society in managing finances, (Huston, 
2010). 
Sometimes people are faced with financial problems not only due to low income but also due to lack of knowledge 
about finance so that it will harm the individual. The implementation of education in order to improve public finances 
is very necessary where according to the Financial Services Authority that good literacy is financial literacy that is 
balanced with financial inclusion, (OJK, 2017). Price stability is a measure of the stability of a country's financial 
system, which means that there is no price. the more expensive ones that can harm society in this case are consumers 
and producers. 
The impact of the global financial crisis that threatens the stability of the financial system in Indonesia has forced the 
Government of the Republic of Indonesia to pass a Law (UU) on Financial System Crisis Prevention and Management 
in 2016 (Peraturan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 82 Tahun 2016 Tentang Strategi Nasional Keuangan Inklusif,

2036","while 8% is explained by variables outside the model. The access variable calculated based on the number of bank 
offices per 100,000 population has no effect on GRDP, meaning that even though people are able to access formal 
financial institutions, they are unlikely to use banking facilities such as savings. This is reinforced by the savings 
variable which, although it has an influence on GRDP, has the opposite direction. 
When people are able to access UMKM credit available at formal financial institutions, it will increase PDRB, this 
can be seen from the MSME credit value increasing by 1%, the PDRB will increase by 0.02%. The relationship 
between the percentage of poor people and the GRDP also shows a significant relationship where if poverty is reduced 
by 1%, the GRDP will increase by 9.5%. 
The econometric criteria consist of first whether there is a multicollinearity problem or not. To ensure that 
multicollinearity does not occur, a test will be carried out using the Correlation Matrix test.

Table 5.4 shows that there is no relationship between variables or there is no multi-linearity where the correlation 
coefficient is not more than 1 and less than or equal to 0.8 
 
6. Conclusion  
Access, use, savings and poverty can explain GRDP as an indicator of financial system stability. GRDP growth 
increases profitability which in turn increases the stability of the financial system. This is because GRDP is associated 
with a general increase in the income of an economy. Of the four independent variables, only the access variable has 
no relationship with the increase in GRDP in 33 provinces in Indonesia. This is probably due to the fact that people 
access bank offices only to facilitate basic financial transactions instead of using the facility of having a bank account. 
The use of MSME credit and poverty reduction has a very significant effect on GRDP growth, while savings, although 
very influential, have not been able to increase GRDP growth in 33 provinces in Indonesia. The conclusion is that 
household financial behavior measured using the indicator number of bank offices per 100,000 population, the number 
of MSME loans to the total amount of credit in formal financial institutions, the amount of public savings, and the 
percentage of poor people have a significant relationship to financial system stability as measured by growth. GRDP 
of 33 provinces in Indonesia. 
The National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (SNKI) is a strategy for increasing capability in managing finances 
starting from increasing understanding and knowledge and public awareness of financial products and services. This 
of course requires appropriate policy support by both the government and Bank Indonesia in order to increase public 
access and be able to use financial services. 
The policies needed include a) policies to encourage the socialization of financial service products according to the 
needs of the community, b) formulate product schemes that are in accordance with the needs of the community, c) 
encourage changes in provisions while still paying attention to the principles of prudence proportionally, d) formulate 
regulations on distribution mechanisms aid funds through banking, e) strengthen the legal basis for improving 
consumer protection of financial services, and f) compile studies related to financial inclusion to determine policy 
direction in a sustainable manner. Community SNKI policies require a guaranteed sense of security in interacting with 
financial institutions in utilizing the financial products and services offered. A sense of security in accessing and using 
financial services through product transparency, easy handling of customer complaints, an institution that can act as a 
mediator between financial institutions and the public, and the public also hopes for more other financial education.

This study shows the visualization of maps and patterns on SMEs strategy around the world obtained from the Scopus 
database. The results of the database analysis show that the trend of publication on SMEs strategy always increases 
every year where the peak is in 2020 with 70 documents. This is because the world is in a pandemic situation, so the 
theme of this research is very interesting. The most productive researcher on the theme of SMEs strategy is Vrchota, 
J. with 6 documents from Ekonomick√° Fakulta, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic. Jihoƒçesk√° Univerzita v esk√Ωch 
Budƒõjovic√≠ch is the most productive affiliate on the theme of SMEs strategy research with 7 documents. The United 
Kingdom with 64 documents became the most productive country for the theme of SMEs strategy research. The source 
of the most productive SMEs strategy research publication document is Sustainability Switzerland with 11 documents. 
Analysis on the subject area shows that Business, Management, and Accounting is the most numerous with 354 
documents on SMEs strategy research. The most robust research collaboration networks with a threshold of 3 
collaboration documents are Adegbuyi, A.A., Ibidunni, A.S., Nigeria, Ogunnaike, O.O., Fadeyi, O.I., and Adegbuyi, 
O.A. 
 
The implications of this research are in the form of theoretical and practical contributions. In theory, this study shows 
a visualization of the research theme map obtained from published data in the last quarter-century (1994-2020), 
namely: Strategy, Management, Industry, Planning, and Enterprise, abbreviated as SMIPE. Practically, the results of 
this research theme map can be used as a reference for the construction of strategic management by SMEs actors. 
Furthermore, further researchers can explore, develop, and collaborate on research on SMEs strategy based on the 
findings of the research theme map

Abstract 
 
Forecasting methods are being used during the planning phase in different departments in several companies, helping 
managers on their decision-making process. The aim of this paper is to analyze which forecast method fits better for 
the scrap rate of a tire industry based on historical data analysis. The scrap rate is a very important key performance 
indicator for the observed company, having a high weight on strategic decisions. Using past data, a comparison is 
made between trend-based methods: regression analysis and double exponential smoothing, and the currently in use 
by the company, a subjective method. By having a set KPI established for the tire scrap allows companies to allocate 
the proper funding and resources to this process. This also allows companies to have a standardized selection method 
on different factors that is accurate. In doing so there is no exact better or worse method to forecast the data however 
each company needs to evaluate which method is right for them.

1. Introduction 
In a competitive market, every type of decision made can have a big impact in a company‚Äôs performance and the usage 
of forecast techniques can be a strong ally on these situations. According to Wood (2020), tire sales are expected to 
reach a value around $154 billion by 2027, which shows how big this market is.  
 
The company observed on this study is a tire plant and the data that is going be analyzed is the scrap ratio. The scrap 
is a very important key performance indicator (KPI) for the plants because it represents quality and cost in one single 
indicator. It‚Äôs calculated based between the cost of non-conform material - like a subcomponent produced out of 
tolerances or an out of spec rubber - over the total cost of production.

The scrap ratio is a KPI over the Quality Department responsibility. Among tasks of control and scrap reduction, 
Quality Department needs to provide to the Controlling Department a scrap forecast for the whole year by month in 
every beginning of the year. Currently the scrap forecast is performed with a mix between objective and subjective 
methods, where the past data is used as a reference but without any specific calculation together with expert‚Äôs opinion 
on the topic.

2055","6. Conclusion  
According to Chambers et al. (1997), ‚ÄúThe selection of a method depends on many factors‚Äîthe context of the forecast, 
the relevance and availability of historical data, the degree of accuracy desirable, the time period to be forecast, the 
cost/ benefit (or value) of the forecast to the company, and the time available for making the analysis.‚Äù  The company 
currently uses a method that is not a stablished one and even with higher errors than other methods compared on the 
paper, it‚Äôs not a forecast with a complete inaccuracy or irrational values, which shows how expert information can be 
very useful when forecasting. 
So, it is important to highlight that there‚Äôs no better or worse forecast method, there‚Äôs the most suitable one that will 
fit according to the company scenario, to the type of organization, to the current software‚Äôs available etc.

Abstract  
 
This article presents a bibliometric review of life cycle analysis in the wine industry, focusing only on the ten most 
critical grape-based beverages. A consultation was carried out in databases such as Scopus, Web of Science, 
Dimensions, Sciencedirect, from which only 121 scientific articles from all databases were analyzed, discarding other 
types of documents. The analysis was performed using the VOSviewer software. The results indicate that four 
countries generate approximately 50% of the wine produced globally: Italy, France, Spain, and the United States of 
America. In addition, the authors with the highest number of documents and citations from 2000 to 2020 were 
identified, highlighting Feijoo G. with the highest number of documents and V√°zquez Rowe I. with the highest number 
of citations. The journals that most publish topics on LCA to viticultural processes are the Journal of Cleaner 
Production and the International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment; the most important topics regarding LCA are 
environmental science, energy and engineering; the most cited countries are Italy, Spain and Luxembourg; and the 
most productive countries are Italy, Spain and USA.

1. Introduction  
LCA (life cycle analysis) is methodology companies use to identify and quantify the environmental impacts generated 
during the transformation of their raw material into a marketable product (Salvador et al., 2021). In LCA, waste and 
the amount of energy required are examined, allowing companies to gain a holistic view of all stages of the

2064",,"in several phases, taking into account from the grapes, this is one of the few things that were thought not to be included 
in the environmental damage caused by the production of beverages derived from grapes. However, by carrying out 
the LCA, it is possible to identify all the critical aspects, making it very useful to correctly manage the study to obtain 
relevant and valuable data to implement improvement plans. 
 
It is possible to identify a small group of countries that are the leading producers of beverages, which serves as 
segmentation for researchers to know the places they can visit and gather information more easily. As seen in the 
research development, countries like Italy, France, and Spain have many wine industries. Therefore, it is not necessary 
to move to other parts of the world to find extensive information regarding its development. In addition to having time 
with the implementation of LCA, it is a good option for consultation. 
 
Concerning the LCA, once the theoretical and practical information was analyzed, it can be highlighted how important 
it is for the wine industry. However, once observed how it operates, it can be concluded that it is feasible to implement 
the methodology in companies of other industries since its field of application is very broad. Hence, it is feasible to 
adapt the tool within the phases of companies wishing to know their environmental impact and implement 
improvement plans to reduce environmental damage.

Abstract  
 
In Mexico, there is the belief that there are labor inequalities in the perception of income for women due to gender 
issues, this study provides current information on the existing gap in Mexico and its importance for sustainable 
development and economic growth, through an analysis descriptive-analytical method, the data collected were 
processed and analyzed through Minitab software and evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficients and 
regression models, however with this research it has been determined that statistically there are labor inequalities but 
not for gender reasons, but for educational level, since that the income disparity is less than 1% between men and 
women regardless of the academic degree. 
 
To determine how average real labor income of employed persons by genre [ILS] influences the unemployment rate, 
disaggregated by genre and age [TD], two normality tests were carried out and in the second run, the results obtained 
indicated that the average income per the level of studies is more favorable for people who attended the upper 
secondary level, compared to those who studied basic or preschool, however, it is noted that the people who receive 
higher income are those with higher academic levels higher, giving them with more job opportunities and greater 
probabilities to get decent job.

1. Introduction 
The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) establish a route of action to improve the lives of people in the world, 
through goals that include social, environmental and economic axes. Despite the progress in their fulfillment, the 
SDGs are far from being fulfilled, the year 2020 was to mark the decade of most ambitious action to achieve the Goals 
by 2030, however, due to the Coronavirus pandemic there was a significant setback in some Goals, including SDG 5 
and SDG 8, which are considered for this study, with respect to the figures offered by UN, (2020) it is known that 
since January 1, 2020, the participation of women in parliaments increased to 24.9% compared to 22.3% in 2015, this 
advance is mainly attributed to the legislation applicable to gender quotas, however in the workplace, until 2019 
women represented 39% of the population active worldwide of working age but there were only 28% in managerial 
positions, which compared to 2000 with 25% this figure has not increased significantly in 20 years, because it is 
difficult for them to access managerial positions 
 
In Mexico there is the belief that women have lower income from work, due to gender issues, that is, that there is 
employment discrimination against women, this research aims to explore whether there is a relationship directly 
related to gender and income received, therefore, if so, it should have a direct negative impact on decent work for

2077","6. Conclusion  
The objective of providing updated information on the existing gap in Mexico in terms of decent work and gender 
issues was achieved, with this study the relationship between gender equality in relation to decent work was explored, 
and it was determined that statistically Gender does not have a significant influence on labor issues, what really 
influences both genders is the level of studies, the higher the level of studies, the greater the opportunity to receive 
better remuneration and therefore, more opportunities to have decent job, in the that human rights are respected and 
there is access to social security, there is an opportunity for job growth and they contribute to the achievement of SDG 
8, generating economic growth and greater progress of society in Mexico. 
 
In fact, the figures in national reports do not express the reality of salaries in Mexico or the occupation of vacancies 
in companies, the reason being a certain degree of bias that occurs when reporting national figures, it may be because 
state agencies have sought to comply with the gender quota, however a real problem persists in terms women's access 
to leadership positions, there are limitations to enter the job market and advance in their career. 
 
This study could guide future research related to Mexico on gender equality and decent work, as the information is 
established in accordance with the sustainable development indicators of the 2030 agenda, specifically SDG 5 Gender 
Equality and SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth. 
 
6.1 Recommendations 
Due to the lack of analysis of other elements that can influence gender equality with respect to the workplace, it is 
recommended to expand the research considering more variables that influence women for the achievement of SDG 
5 and SDG 8, such as cultural aspects, in different sectors. 
 
6.2 Limitation 
Statistical information for conducting a more in-depth study is not available in the databases analyzed and the 
information available on the variables analyzed has a certain degree of bias.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this article is to present a review of the industrial symbiosis literature for responsible consumption in 
order to identify its relationship and by-products in the coffee growing sector. The type of investigation is 
documentary, and the method is deductive. The research was carried out in two phases: Systematic Literature Review 
(SLR) based on the SLR model of Garza-Reyes (2015) and the identification of the literature and relationships with 
other studies. The result that was obtained was that the reviewed literature maintains that industrial symbiosis is a way 
to get a sustainable world, because it supports the generation of jobs, additional income, lengthens the life cycle of 
products, uses waste as by-products and transfers it knowledge. In this sense, through this research, the bases of the 
relationship of industrial symbiosis with responsible consumption are laid, which can be applied in the coffee growing 
sector, where many benefits are obtained due to the amount of waste that is produced, during its production, and the 
properties that waste has, in order to be used as by-products of other processes, thus helping society, the environment 
and the economy of the sector.

1. Introduction   
Industrial symbiosis is a concept that was born in 1972, under the project developed in Kalundborg-Denmark 
(Cervantes et al., 2009). Whose experience confirms that through cooperation it is possible to reduce the indiscriminate 
use of natural resources, in addition to increasing the region's economy (Tudor et al., 2007). Among the most 
outstanding figures is the 60% reduction in water consumption in the power plant that is part of this symbiosis, by 
supplying it with surface water taken from a nearby lake and the water treated by the Kalundborg refinery (Pinz√≥n, 
2009). Later, the term would be used for the first time in an article whose main topic is production strategies (Frosh 
and Gallopoulos, 1989). According to Chertow (2000), industrial symbiosis merges traditionally separated industries 
in a collective approach to obtain competitive advantages including physical exchange of materials, energy, water 
and/or by-products. In this sense, to put this tool into practice, an exchange of resources must be given, whether by-
products, infrastructure or the provision of services (Chertow et al., 2007). 
 
Thus, currently the reuse of waste in food production chains is becoming one of the main areas of interest and study, 
with the aim of promoting the economy and processes in favor of the environment (Mansouri et al. 2017; Gunarathne 
et al. 2019; Pfaltzgraff et al. 2013; Udugama et al. 2019). In addition to generating additional income (Udugama et

Abstract   
  
Competitiveness needs to be improved to strengthen the entrepreneurial aspect in a region. Previous research indicates 
that entrepreneurs‚Äô characteristics, enterprise characteristics, networks, and the business environment influence the 
competitiveness of  MSMEs. This study applies quantitative methods to determine the influence of these factors on 
increasing the competitiveness of MSMEs in Malang City, proposing a competitiveness improvement model for 
MSMEs in Malang City and revealing the obstacles that hinder MSMEs competitiveness improvement in Malang 
City. The result of this study showed that entrepreneurs‚Äô characteristics and the business environment have a 
significant influence on increasing the competitiveness of MSMEs related to business growth performance. However, 
research findings also showed that enterprise characteristics and networks have no significant influence on increasing 
the competitiveness of MSMEs. Based on the research findings, the competitiveness of MSMEs can be increased by 
strengthening entrepreneurs‚Äô characters, creating a conducive external business environment, strengthening 
operational and marketing activities. In addition, the obstacles faced by MSMEs in increasing their competitiveness 
relate to marketing and production activities, financial strength, entrepreneurs‚Äô characteristics, and the external 
environment. The results of this study provide contributions and recommendations for model implementation to 
increase the competitiveness of MSMEs to strengthen the entrepreneurial aspect in Malang City.

1. Introduction   
One of the drivers of economic growth in Indonesia is entrepreneurship activity in the form of micro-small and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs). Several crises encountered by Indonesia has proved that MSMEs in Indonesia can survive and 
thrive. Furthermore, MSMEs can become the saviour valve for the nation's economic recovery. MSMEs have 
important roles in economic growth, such as providing job opportunities, reducing poverty, increasing national 
income, and empowering society.   
  
Most MSMEs struggle to increase their business scale. Competitiveness has a vital role in increasing MSMEs business 
scale. MSMEs competitiveness is affected by entrepreneur's characteristics, enterprise characteristics, networks, and 
the business environment (Hampel-Milagrosa et al. 2015). The complexity and dynamics of the business environment 
require rapid adjustments so that business ventures can remain competitive (Salazar et al. 2011). Optimal utilization 
of resources will create a competitive advantage for a business.   
  
Many regions in Indonesia have high economic potential. Malang city is one of the cities in Indonesia renowned for 
having excellent natural resources and is one of the famous tourist destinations in Indonesia. Data from the Central 
Bureau of Statistics of East Java Province shows that throughout the 2015-2018 term, Malang City was in the 11th 
position in the amount of Gross Regional Domestic Product or GRDP (Badan Pusat Statistik Provinsi Jawa Timur 
2021). Still, the number of MSMEs in Malang City is ranked 31st in the entire East Java Province (Dinas Koperasi

2099","MSMEs is the external performance represented by product consumption and the social impact given to the 
surrounding environment (Lantu et al. 2016). The results of data analysis reveal that marketing promotion, product 
innovation and diversification, quality control, market expansion, and production capacity have more influence on 
external performance.  
  
The explanation for these unexpected findings is explained as follows. The results of data analysis show that marketing 
promotion plays a crucial role in the level of consumption of MSMEs products. Product innovation and diversification 
also play a substantial role in increasing the consumption of MSMEs. Data analysis also reveals that quality control is 
an aspect that contributes to the increase in the consumption of MSMEs products. A strict quality control system 
guarantees product quality which contributes to increasing product consumption. The market expansion also boosts 
the consumption of MSMEs products. The expansion of the market opens up opportunities for MSMEs to serve more 
consumers. Finally, production capacity also affects the level of consumption of MSMEs products. Increased 
production capacity resulted in more products to sell.   
  
The positive impact given by MSMEs to the surrounding environment is closely related to the sustainability of business 
ventures. If an MSME has a long-life span, it will be guaranteed sustainability of the positive impact on the surrounding 
environment. Data analysis shows that marketing promotion, product innovation and product diversification, quality 
control, market expansion, and production capacity influence the sustainability of MSMEs business activities. It is 
related to the sustainability of revenue generated from MSMEs business activities. If the sustainability of the business 
existence is maintained, then the positive impact given by MSMEs to the surrounding environment can sustain. Figure 
5 depicts these research findings:   
  
 
  
Figure 5. Factors improving MSMEs competitiveness related to external performance  
  
The findings in this study indicate that marketing promotion, product innovation and product diversification, quality 
control, market expansion, and production capacity shapes product competitiveness which encourages the creation of 
business competitiveness. These findings reflect the opinion of Anggraeni et al. (2017) regarding the strategic focus 
for increasing the competitiveness of MSMEs. These five variables strengthen the entrepreneurial aspect in Malang 
City related to external performance.   
  
6. Conclusion   
This research aims to determine the factors that influence the improvement of the MSMEs competitiveness and the 
obstacles they encounter. In the end, this study proposes a model for increasing competitiveness to strengthen the 
entrepreneurial aspect in Malang City. Entrepreneur's characteristics and the business environment have a significant 
influence on improving the competitiveness of MSMEs related to business growth performance. However, the 
enterprise characteristics and network do not significantly affect the competitiveness of MSMEs in Malang City. The 
competitiveness of MSMEs in terms of business growth performance improved by strengthening entrepreneur's 
characteristics and creating a conducive external business environment. The competitiveness of MSMEs in terms of 
internal and external performance improved by strengthening operational and marketing activities. Marketing and

2108","operational activities, financial strength, entrepreneur's characteristics, market conditions or the external environments 
are obstacles that hinder the competitiveness improvement of MSMEs. MSMEs could overcome these obstacles by 
strengthening marketing and operational aspects and increasing entrepreneur's capabilities.  
  
The contribution from this study is in the form of implementation strategies that can increase the competitiveness of 
MSMEs in Malang City. In addition, the contribution given from this research to the Malang City government is in 
the form of concept formulations to develop programs to strengthen the competitiveness of entrepreneurial activities 
in Malang City. Nevertheless, this study has limitations in the research scope. The scope of this research is still 
relatively small. This study only researched MSMEs in Malang City. Further research should be carried out in a bigger 
scope, such as provincial scope to build a model that could increase MSMEs and regional competitiveness.

Abstract 
This study aimed to see the perception of Generation Z on the concept of sexual harassment through TikTok video. 
The main background underlied this research was the phenomenon of people who made TikTok videos, exposing 
themselves as victims of sexual harassment. Researcher observed a change in perception about sexual harassment, 
which was previously taboo, then become discussed directly by the victims through their social medias. In addition, 
through Perception Theory and Public Space Theory, with qualitative descriptive method. The research subjects were 
generation Z, TikTok users and currently studying in any universities in East Java. Data collection was used in-depth 
interview. The results showed that the informants had various perceptions of sexual harassment concept. Some 
supported the TikTok videos, in other words, they believed that sexual harassment should no longer be a disgrace that 
should not be discussed in public spaces. When the other still believed that sexual harassment is taboo to be discussed 
openly in public, regardless of being a victim or perpetrator, sexual harassment is a disgrace that can give bad impacts 
for the reputation and image of family and theirselves. Life experiences and social environment situations affect the 
personal perception of sexual harassment concept.

Abstract 
 
Since the use of Mobile Payment is increasing from the past few years, the issue of the factors that influence the use 
of Mobile Payments is not to be amiss. This study aims to determine the factors that significantly influence the users' 
usage of mobile payment instruments. The research was conducted by using an online survey questionnaire and 
distributed among the respected 414 respondents. The factors that were studied in this research are the influence of 
performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, trust and perceived security towards the behavioral 
intention of mobile payment usage. This study uses the quantitative method with Generation Z as the unit of analysis 
while the targeted population would be the respondents from Bekasi city. Based on the research, two of the factors 
have a significant relationship towards the behavioral intention to use the mobile payment instrument. In addition, the 
most influential factor from the highest to lowest would be perceived security and social influence. In conclusion the 
perceived security variable is the most influential variable.

Figure 1 shows a conceptual framework that may be utilized as a reference and literature study for 
individuals who want to alter or perform a study on the use of mobile payment instruments by Generation 
Z in Bekasi City. Since the Perceived Security is the most influential variables in this research, this research 
supports the previous research that have been using the Perceived Security as a factor to examine users' 
intention to use electronic payment instruments, such as Perkins and Annan (2013), Ghorban, Jajaee and 
Tahernead (2011) and Susanto et al. (2013). 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research is purposed to identify the elements that influence the Generation Z‚Äôs Behavioral Intention to use mobile 
payment instruments as well as their actual use, in Bekasi City, because mobile payment instrument usage is a better 
way in conducting transaction rather than by using the traditional cash payment. It is tested using a questionnaire that 
was delivered to 414 respondents in Bekasi City, spanning generation  Z.  The data is then examined using multiple 
linear regression with the statistical software Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS). 
 
The first objective of this research is to identify the factors that influence the Behavioral Intention (BI) to use the 
Mobile Payment among Generation Z in Bekasi city. This research would first develop five factors from the previous 
study that would potentially influence the customers‚Äô Behavioral Intention in using mobile payment. Based on the 
previous study, the factors that would be identified would be Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social 
Influence, Trust, and Perceived Security. The five factors then would become five hypotheses that would be analyzed 
by using the SPSS with Performance Expectancy as H1, Effort Expectancy as H2, Social Influence as H3, Trust as 
H4, and Perceived Security as H5. As interpreted from the questionnaire result as well as the analysis from the multiple 
linear regression by using the Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS), the factors that are identified to be 
significantly influence the behavioral intention of customers in using mobile payment are Social Influence and 
Perceived Security while the factors that have no significant relationship towards the Behavioral Intention are 
Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy and Trust.  Therefore, this research accepted the hypotheses 3 and 5 (H3 
and H5), while on the other hand rejected hypotheses 1, 2 and 4 (H1, H2 and H4). With that in mind, Social Influence 
and Perceived Security are influencing the Behavioral Intention to use mobile payment for Generation Z in Bekasi 
City.   
 
The next objective is to identify the most influential factor that influences the Behavioral Intention (BI) to use the 
Mobile Payment among Generation Z in Bekasi city. From the data that has been analyzed by the SPSS, in order to 
determine the most influential factors, the value that must be identified is the unstandardized beta values. In order for 
the factor to be most influential, the factor must have the unstandardized beta values that have the furthest value from 
zero.  The unstandardized beta value can either be positive or negative. Based on the analysis from the SPSS, the 
unstandardized beta value of each factor would be as follows.  Social Influence (0.086) and Perceived Security (0.112).  
Since the variable with the unstandardized beta values furthest from zero is required to find the most influential 
variables, the furthest unstandardized beta value from zero would be 0.112. Finally, the Perceived Security variable 
has the greatest influence.

Abstract 
The marketing strategy must change from traditional to digital application marketing that is flexible in time and 
distance. Digital marketing can increase sales of cooperatives similar to SMEs, but cooperatives have different 
challenges from SMEs, in general, to move forward. The uniqueness of this research is the evaluation of the readiness 
of cooperatives and the conceptual idea of creating a digital marketing platform with cooperatives in Indonesia. This 
shared digital marketing strategy will help both cooperatives and large companies. Therefore, it is necessary to 
evaluate the readiness of cooperatives and cooperatives to join this digital platform. This study aims to evaluate and 
form the concept of cooperative marketing ideas together in one platform. This study evaluates eight variables that 
affect the cooperative's organizational agility and the link platform with digital marketing by cooperatives assisted by 
data support by the government. This research is still in the form of concepts and ideas for evaluating and sharing 
marketing ideas for cooperatives in Indonesia. This study aims to provide cooperatives and the government input to 
sort out and support viable cooperatives to progress and develop.

Abstract  
 
Sales prediction for fashion product is known to be very difficult, as we know the fashion demand is highly volatile 
with ever-changing customer's tastes and the product life cycle tends to be short. The purpose of this study is to predict 
the right strategy, between pre-order or vice versa using the deep learning function of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This 
research was conducted by combining AI using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with statistical methods using 
Logistics Regression (LR). The LR model was adopted as a pre-selection of input factors for the ANN prediction 
model (ANN-Logit). We also calculated the probability of each case using the logistic function then added as a new 
input variable for the ANN model (ANN-Plogit). The comparison was made to compare each model‚Äôs performance. 
There is no significant difference between the outputs of each model. All models are considered good in predictions 
with fitness values above 0.85 and MSE tends to be small, but the hybrid ANN-Plogit provides slightly better than 
others with the highest fitness value of 0.995 and the lowest error (MSE) for 0.0012 with 98.6% prediction accuracy. 
This shows that the more input variables used as predictors, the better the fitness model. The models developed in this 
study may assist the firm in choosing the right strategy for upcoming product.

1. Introduction 
Fashion sector in Indonesia is the most desirable for online shopping. Based on data collected by the Indonesia 
Statistics Agency in 2019, the fashion sector was able to dominate 33% of the digital marketthe high demand coupled 
with its characteristics make it even more difficult to predict accurately. One of the factors is the fashion life cycle 
tends to be short, so the prediction of demand for a product needs to be precise as not causing deadstock when the 
selling season ends (Nenni et al, 2013). Furthermore, the selection of the right prediction method is very critical for 
fashion, choosing the right positioning strategy is important to avoid inaccuracies in demand prediction. 
 
Several studies from the last decades discuss the change phenomenon in positioning strategy from the commonly used 
strategy, Make to Stock (MTS) into the rarely used strategy, Make to Order (MTO) (Ray et al, 2004; Garmdare et al, 
2018; Sayid et al, 2018). The concept of MTS is that the presence of inventory items is used to keep the inventory 
levels to avoid stockout and lost sales, maintain a higher level of service by reducing the delivery times. (Shao et al, 
2012; Zhang et al, 2013; Rafiei et al, 2013; and Xiong et al, 2020). Otherwise, MTO strategy starts production only 
after receiving the order so there is no inventory for the finished product. Therefore, longer delivery times are quoted 
to consumers (Xiong et al, 2020; Gupta et al, 2004 and Ebadian et al, 2008). The application of make to order is often 
associated with a unique and exclusive goods, such as a suit that is specially designed by talented designer as customer 
request, or a computer designed with special specifications based on the needs. However, today's business 
developments have shifted the about concept of MTO. This strategy has been successfully applied to such a mass 
production product in the market. Without a special uniqueness of a product, it has successfully sold with a pre-order 
system (we know as make to order strategy). For example, from this research object, a shoe variant with the market 
price for $50 selling at a retailer, will be priced around $30 with a 40-days number of waiting time, and $20 for a 60-
days waiting. The main reason why the company adopts this strategy is the greater cash flow, which the working 
capital is obtained from customer payments in advance. The production process is carried out as soon as the payment 
made and will be completed within the quoted lead time so will be there no inventory costs. Some firms are focusing

2127","Based on the comparison of each model above, the developed ANN-Plogit Model with 12 inputs provides the lowest 
mean squared error for 0.0012 and the fitness value of 0.995 close to the value of 1. According to research conducted 
by (Schafer et al, 2010) they found that The Plogit-ANN hybrid model was found to be the best model among other 
developed ANN.  
 
The differences shown by each model in this study were not significantly different. all models are considered good in 
prediction with fitness values above 0.85 and MSE tends to be small. This shows that the more input variables used 
as predictors, the better the fitness (R) value of the ANN model. It means the significant relationship between a 
dependent variable and independent variables no need to be explained by using ANN. Shows that the interaction 
between variables does not affect the ANN performance (Hassanipour et al, 2019)]. So, if there are implicit 
interactions and complex relationships in the data, the use of ANNs is particularly useful (Ayer et al, 2010). 
 
5.1 Prediction Result 
Prediction is done using ¬±300 hypothetical datasets for the ANN model that has been selected in the previous 
section, the aim is to get recommendations for product characteristics that are suitable for upcoming product sales in 
the future.

From the prediction results in the Table 6 above, some insights that can be obtained are: product X is sold online 
through 5 digital platforms. However, in practice not all platforms are considered reliable for purchasing pre-order 
products. 3 out of 5 selected as platforms for PO implementation. Based on the product style, it is found that the Sn 
style of product with its character that is considered 'timeless' is suitable for the PO strategy. In addition, products with 
LCB style that are known to be unique and special are also suitable for pre-order strategies. From 23 product variants 
that have been produced by brand X over the last two years, turns out that only five products matched the pre-order 
based on ANN's study. And the targeted consumers are generations of Y and Z, which is a young population dominated 
by men in the age between 17 and 30 years. The learning function of ANN read that not all sizes are the most desirable 
for the pre-order strategy, which only sizes 39 to 45 are the most ordered sizes when purchased for PO. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Four strategy classification models were developed to assist in the prediction of pre-order strategy selection towards 
the upcoming product of fashion. ANN as the tool basis for prediction model of an Indonesian fashion brand especially 
in shoes in who sells their product through e-Commerce. The objective of this study is to predict the right strategy, 
between pre-order or non-pre-order using the deep learning function of Artificial Intelligence. Combining the 
advanced prediction using ANN with statistical method using logistics regression carried out in this study. The LR 
model adopted as pre-selection stage of input factors for the ANN prediction model (ANN-Logit). Also calculate the 
probability of each case using logistics function of LR then added as an input variable for ANN prediction model 
(ANN-Plogit). The comparison is made to compare each model‚Äôs performance. There is no significant difference 
between each model output. All models considered good in prediction with fitness values above 0.85 and MSE tends 
to be small, but the hybrid ANN-Plogit slightly better than others with the highest fitness value (R) of 0.995 and the 
lowest error (MSE) for 0.0012 with 98.6% accuracy of prediction. This shows that the more input variables used as 
predictors, the better the fitness model. As the results of LR model, there are six variables that significantly affect the

example, it has negative relationship with predictors. Means that the cheaper the price, the more likely a pre-order 
strategy will be occurred. Based on the prediction results using hypothetical data, it obtained that not all data ranges 
for each factor are in accordance with the character of Pre-order sales. Such as product variants, 5 out of 23 variants 
were successfully sold by PO, and only certain product styles were most in demand for pre-order purchases. The 
models developed in this study may assist the firm in selecting the right strategy for upcoming product in the future 
with several inherent product characteristics.

Abstract  
 
An organization dedicated to logistics service as a supplier to the automotive sector. It is essential to implement 
strategies focused on cost reduction considering the needs of the industry. To identify the main areas of opportunity 
within the warehouse and to be able to propose an improvement that allows reducing costs and unnecessary 
movements in daily operations, an audit will be carried out, which is allow an analysis of all the areas involved. This 
article proposes an improvement in the operations of a warehouse belonging to the automotive sector. An audit was 
used to identify areas of opportunity within the warehouse. The audit results showed that the picking area is 74% 
effective due to the downtime generated on tour when supplying an order. Therefore, the implementation of the Dual 
Cycle Allocation Method is presented to improve performance and reduce costs through the optimization of travel 
distances. The implementation of KPIs is proposed to measure and control the procedures related to picking.

7. Conclusions 
The investigation of this type of practical case turns out to be very useful for graduate students and workers of 
organizations because useful tools are implemented and developed in the management of the supply chain, which 
serves to face problems that arise daily in the workplace. The solution to these problems results in a continuous 
improvement in its operations and an economic benefit in reducing costs. 
This project is presented to the organization as a proposal for implementing the suggested project to the client's needs 
for the automatic taking of sets, specifically for the picking area. 
It is important to constantly and periodically monitor and monitor the performance of the activities carried out within 
the warehouse. The implementation of KPIs for the picking area helps to detect errors and/or areas of opportunity, 
generating a strategy to solve the errors detected. With this, it is expected to have greater control in the operations of 
the warehouse, reducing mistakes and encouraging continuous improvement. 
Another aspect that must be evaluated is the stock levels, taking into account the capacity to store material, since the 
stock levels proportionally affect the complexity of the picking, increasing the distance to be traveled. That is why it is 
essential to organize the layout of the warehouse and the optimization of routes.

Abstract 
 
The construction industry is responsible for several environmental impacts because of various industrial activities. 
Quantifying these impacts is a major roadmap to reducing them. This study carried out a comparative life cycle 
assessment (LCA) on two cement plants using the midpoint (problem-oriented approach): Cementos Cosmos S.A. 
Spanish cement plant (with Best Available Techniques Reference Document ‚ÄìBREF- incorporation) and a typical 
European plant to quantify the environmental impacts‚Äô gains in cement production. The analysis was based on the 
Functional Unit of 1ton of cement produced in each plant, and the LCA software used was SimaPro 8.2. The result of 
the analysis showed that the impact categories from Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant had significant reduction when 
compared with the impact categories from European plant analysis. However, Ozone depletion increased by 5% as a 
result of high quantity of petroleum coke used in Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant. Also, Climate change has not a great 
reduction, this is also due to high amount of limestone used in the production process of the cement plant; These 
however influenced the entire result of the analysis. These results show that the BREF recommendations are very 
effective as there is great improvement in the environmental performance however, further reduction of fossil fuels 
(petcoke) and limestone should be considered.

1. Introduction 
The construction sector is one of the largest industrial sectors as it is one of the highest resource-intensive sectors. 
These resources range from natural raw materials to industrial energy, which however generate great environmental 
impact. The construction sector in 2018 account for about 39% of the global CO2 emissions and 36% of the global 
energy used (Abergel, Dulac et al. 2019). As at 2017, raw material consumed by this sector was about 90 Gt which 
will continue to increase as long as there is reproduction of human being (Madlool, Saidur et al. 2011). In 2010, the 
global cement production was about 310 Mt worldwide and 191 Mt out of it was produced in the European Union 
(EU-27) (CEMBUREAU 2011). Of this production from the European union, 23.5 Mt was produced in Spain 
(OFICEMEN 2010a).

4. Conclusion 
It was carried out a comparative life cycle assessment study on two cement plants: Cementos Cosmos S.A. cement 
plant and a typical European plant using mid-point (problem-oriented) approach of LCIA method. Cementos Cosmos 
S.A. plant located in Spain has incorporated some BREF recommendations into her production processes. These 
recommendations are use of alternative fuel, use of waste as fuel, reduction of the use of fossil fuel (coal), reduction 
of the quantity of clinker used in cement production, partial replacement of clinker with alternative materials. The 
characterization result of both plants was compared, and the result showed that all impact categories from the 
Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant reduced greatly except for ozone depletion, which increased by 5%. Tracing back to the 
LCI analysis, petroleum coke has the highest impact of all the fossil fuel used. The amount of petroleum coke used in 
the Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant is higher than the value used in the European cement plant, hence the increase.  
 
Most of the impact categories with significant reduction were associated with two major production processes: raw 
material consumption and fuel consumption. These two processes involve mining and extraction of resources as well 
as the processing of these resources. Therefore, this reduction is due to a reduction in the resources mined and 
extracted, compared to the resources used in a typical European plant. This shows that the use of alternative fuel and 
material, waste, reduction of coal thus reduces the environmental impact of a cement production process. Climate 
change also has 21% reduction. From the LCI analysis, it was observed that a higher quantity of limestone was used 
in the production of clinker. Hence significant reduction was not experienced though the quantity of clinker used was 
reduced. 
 
Further analysis was carried out on the top four impact categories with the highest value in both plants. These impacts 
are climate change, human toxicity, ionizing radiation and fossil depletion. Comparative analysis between both plants 
showed that when the above-listed BREF recommendations are incorporated into the production process, there is a 
reduction of about 0.175t of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere for every 1 ton of cement produced. Also, there is a 
reduction of about 0.0323t manganese emitted into the waterbody for every 1 ton of cement produced. In addition, 
there is a reduction of about 4.6kBq of radon-222 and 0.3 kBq of carbon-14 emitted into the atmosphere for every 1 
ton of cement produced.  Finally, there is a reduction of about 0.0236t of coal in terms of coal extraction for every 1 
ton of cement produced. However, crude oil usage increases by 0.0064t; this is due to more petroleum coke used in 
the production process of Cementos Cosmos S.A. plant. 
 
The midpoint normalized values of both plants showed that the major impact categories in Cementos Cosmos S.A. 
are: Natural land transformation, Climate change, Marine ecotoxicity, Freshwater eutrophication, Freshwater 
ecotoxicity, Human toxicity and Fossil depletion, while those of European cement plant are Natural land 
transformation, Marine ecotoxicity, Freshwater eutrophication, Freshwater ecotoxicity, Human toxicity, Climate 
change, and Fossil depletion. The production processes with the highest contribution to these impacts are clinker 
production, fossil fuel consumption, and raw material consumption. The results in this study are compatible with those 
in the literature with minimal variation.

Abstract  
  
Heat treatment is the most common method to modify the mechanical properties in steel automotive workpieces, 
through heating and cooling processes. Depending of the heat treatment or stage we can have different values of heat 
transfer coefficient (HTC). For the thermometallurgical calculations, the most important boundary condition is the 
HTC, which can be obtained by a trial-and-error approach, inverse mathematical techniques, or computational fluid 
dynamics.   
  
In this paper the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the calculation of the HTC values for natural 
convection phenomena was used. These measurements were obtained in austenitizing stage, annealing, normalizing 
and quenching processes, the specimen was a structural steel channel beam. The simulation was developed in Ansys 
Fluent. The incompressible-ideal gas model was used for the buoyancy effect generated by the internal heat source in 
the flow field. The two-equation k-œâ based SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model was used to mould the 
turbulent stresses in the Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes equations (RANS).  
  
The results demonstrated that CFD simulation is a powerful tool to calculate HTC in transitory states. The feasibility 
and precision of CFD calculations in each external fluid condition was demonstrated. A good correlation between 
the gotten results and similar previous works in the literature was confirmed.

Abstract 
 
This paper follows upon the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)-inspired ecophysical formulations of S. Azaele et al. and 
A. R. Rominger by constructing a computational model in conjunction with ecosystem recovery assessment models 
to construct physical hypothesis and computational trajectories of the Barro Colorado Island (BCI) based upon tree 
species abundance data collected by C. Richard et al. Through the development of quantitative methods for predicting 
the dynamics of multispecies communities of trees in tropical forests inspired by the BCI study area, a broad array of 
questions of particular importance to tropical systems‚Äîsuch as those pertaining to mechanisms responsible for large-
scale patterns of species abundance and distribution, species coexistence, and the maintenance of vast species diver-
sity‚Äîcan be addressed, with this paper placing particular emphasis on implications relevant to those surrounding the 
neutral theory of molecular evolution.

1. Introduction 
The first coherent proposal of neutral theory was presented in 1968 by M. Kimura, in which Kimura calculates a 
mutation rate function of ùë¢ùë¢(ùëùùëù) = ùëùùëù+ 2ùëÅùëÅùëíùëíùë†ùë†ùë†ùë†(1 ‚àíùëùùëù) for an initial frequency of the new allele ùëùùëù, effective population 
size ùëÅùëÅùëíùëí and selective advantage of the new allele over the pre-existing alleles ùë†ùë† (M. Kimura 1968). Under the assump-
tion that each enzyme in an organism with enzymatic molecular weights on the scale of 105Da‚Äîreferred to as ""higher 
organisms""‚Äîthe mutation rate for the corresponding genetic site of 1,000 amino acid-enzymes of this weight (about 
3,000 nucleotide pairs) is then ùë¢ùë¢= 3 ‚ãÖ103 ‚ãÖ5 ‚ãÖ10‚àí10 = 1.5 ‚ãÖ10‚àí6 per generation, a value so high Kimura argued 
that many of the mutations involved must be neutral ones. More broadly, the neutral theory of molecular evolution 
that comes of this observation holds that most evolutionary changes occur at the molecular level, and most of the 
variation within and between species is therefore due to random genetic drift of mutant alleles that are selectively 
neutral, ""neutral"" in this context referring to a mutation that does not affect an organism's fitness. In other words, the 
different observed outcomes for the number of species in a community and their differing abundances must therefore 
only result from stochastic birth, death, migration, and speciation events. 
 
Given the resultant stochastic nature of evolution that neutral theory encourages, the application of statistical mechan-
ics is a natural one. In particular, the maximum entropy principle of statistical mechanics (MaxEnt) was formulated 
by E. T. Jaynes (Jaynes 1957a, Jaynes 1957b), who emphasized the natural correspondence between statistical me-
chanics and Shannon's information theory, the theory that studies the quantification, storage, and communication of 
information. Jaynes argued that the entropy of statistical mechanics and the information entropy of information theory 
are effectively identical. Consequently, statistical mechanics should be seen just as a particular application of a general 
tool of logical inference and information theory, with MaxEnt being a useful method to obtain the least biased infor-
mation from empirical measurements.  
 
In its ecological applications, it can be seen as an inference method used to evaluate the effective strength of interac-
tions among species on either species abundance data or simply the presence or absence of the researched species. 
This methodology provides a way to systematically incorporate the most important species interactions into the de-
velopment of a theory beyond the purely non-interacting case.

8. Conclusions 
Thus, the tree species composition of the BCI forest is not stable and changing for reasons not yet entirely under-
stood (R. Condit et al. 2019). However, we can predict these changes as a result of self-regulation. We have shown 
that most of the trajectories of the 20 most abundant species are well described by logistic difference equations with 
parameters estimated by species forecasting techniques. This makes us confident in the proposed method to predict 
the future abundances of these species. Through the Lotka-Volterra equations, the significance of interspecific com-
petition was assessed, ultimately determined to be mostly negligible relative to intraspecific competition, which vali-
dates that initial assumption.  
 
Moreover, we found the estimated species parameters, ùëüùëüùëñùëñ and ùí¶ùí¶ùëñùëñ, vary strongly from one species to another. Ac-
cording to the dispersal-assembly hypothesis, which assumes that communities are open non-equilibrium assem-
blages of species that coexist only transiently through by chance, history, and random dispersal rather than by the 
stabilizing effects of niche differentiation, regarded as negligible (S. C. Thomas 2003), there are no important differ-
ences between species. Thus, the findings of this research contradict this neutrality, in agreement with large ecologi-
cal differences found among tree species in tropical forests indicating that the central assumption of neutral theory 
that species are equivalent is simply incorrect (S. Hubbell 2008). Exact numerical predictions for the year of 2020 
were determined, with overall mean relative errors of 22.1 and 13.7 for the quadrats of side length ùêøùêø= 20m and 
ùêøùêø= 10m, respectively, indicating considerable accuracy for the ùëáùëáùë°ùë°ùë°ùë°= 4 analysis. C. Richard et al. is yet to such 
data, but it is likely conclusions pertaining to the neutral theory of evolution for older data will remain valid.

Abstract 
 
This research proposes an optimization algorithm for the economic statistical design of np chart for shift detection in 
fraction nonconforming. In the literature, less attention has been paid to the economic statistical design of attribute 
control charts compared with variable control charts although it‚Äôs usually easier and faster to handle an attribute quality 
characteristic rather than a variable quality characteristic.  In this model, the charting parameters of the np chart are 
optimized to satisfy the objective function which aims to reduce the Expected Total Cost (ETC) and in the meantime, 
ensure that the false alarm rate and the inspection rate do not exceed the allowable levels. The performance of the 
proposed optimal np chart will be compared with that of the traditional np chart under different circumstances. A 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted to study the effectiveness of the optimal np chart under different cost parameters 
and distributions of the p shift. It is found that the proposed optimal np chart outperforms the traditional np chart.

1. Introduction 
Control charts are extensively used to control a process statistically and maintain it. Control charts can be used to 
estimate process parameters. Many design approaches have been proposed and discussed in the literature, but 
generally, they can be categorized into groups: heuristic; statistical; economic; and economic statistical designs of 
control charts Zhang & Beradi, 1997). As a result of the economic statistical design, the disadvantages of both 
economic and statistical designs were controlled, the detection effectiveness of control charts was improved, and the 
cost of being in out-of-control status was reduced. The economic statistical design aims to minimize ETC, subject to 
statistical constraints, which will in turn reduce the variability in the process and increase the quality of the product. 
Economic statistical designs are generally more costly than economic designs due to the additional added statistical 
constraints, but the tight limits applied on the control chart from the statistical properties will lead to a reduction in 
the process variability and an enhancement in the product quality. Economic statistical designs require that cost 
parameters that are related to the economic design and the system parameters that are related to statistical design to 
be estimated. It yields to designs that are at least as good as statistical design in terms of statistical properties and can 
give protection over a wider range of shifts. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The initiation of a designing criterion the combines both economic and statistical models was needed to overcome the 
disadvantages when using either of them individually. Saniga (1989) developed a design by placing statistical 
constraints on economic models in order to provide designs that meet industry‚Äôs demand for low process variability 
and long-term product quality using X‡¥• and R chart. The resultant design was statistically as good as statistical designs 
and more costly than economic design, but it gave more protection over wider range of shifts. 
 
Montgomery et al. (1995) proposed economic statistical design approach of EWMA control chart to monitor process 
mean. Optimum design parameters include n, h, control limit width coefficient and EWMA weight. The optimum 
design parameters were obtained by minimizing the total cost functions, subject to additional statistical constraints on 
ATS. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to study how the statistical measure of performance (ATS) affects the

1- Both charts result in an ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥0 magnitude that is larger than œÑ when the process is in control, which satisfies 
constraint (4) and indicates meeting the false alarm requirement. 
2- The values of ATS for both charts indicates that optimal np chart excels the traditional np chart over the range 
shift (1 ‚â§ Œ¥ ‚â§10). Through the 10 observations, the ATS of the optimal np chart is always smaller than ATS of 
the traditional np chart. This confirms that the optimal np chart is more sensitive to small and large shifts than 
traditional np chart.

The optimal np chart effectiveness decreases when the shift increases. For example, when the p=2 the optimal 
np chart detects the shift faster than the traditional by 83%. But when p=10, the optimal np chart is only faster 
by 45%.

chart is better than that of the traditional np chart by 35%. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Through the investigation of the economic statistical design of attribute control charts and how it can exceed the 
performance of other control chart designs, it was found that the economic statistical design of optimal np chart 
outperforms the traditional design of np chart significantly. The same model might be used in future to propose 
economic statistical design of other control charts such as CUSUM and EWMA charts.

Abstract 
 
The issue of supplier selection becomes a very important aspect in supply chain management, especially for the 
purchasing function. Supplier selection criteria become the main thing in supplier selection. Currently, the industry of 
concern in Indonesia is fashion small medium enterprises (SME). In this study, the supplier assessment criteria and 
sub-criteria are based on the perspective of the 4th party logistics environment. To determine the criteria and sub-
criteria for supplier selection, this research conducted a literature study, interviews with experts and a questionnaire 
survey. Through a literature review and the modified Delphi method to confirm the hierarchical structure of the criteria 
and sub-criteria for supplier selection, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was carried out to determine the weights 
of the criteria and sub-criteria in the hierarchical structure framework. The results of this study can be used as a 
reference in supplier selection for each grade quality basic apparel products, thus assisting in making decisions on 
choosing the right supplier based on the perspective of fashion SMEs in a 4th party logistics environment. This study 
considers the integration of perspectives between suppliers, 4PL companies, and brands, so that the proposed model 
determines the aspects of negotiation and fairness as limitations.

1. Introduction 
The Indonesian fashion industry has significantly evolved, so that fashion become a profitable industry. In 2016, the 
fashion subsector made the biggest contribution after culinary, which amounted to 18.15% of Rp 166.1 trillion in the 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Indonesian Creative Economy. The clothing and apparel sector is the second most 
popular fashion industry category in online shopping in Indonesian, take a 14.6% portion of domestic e-commerce (J. 
P. Morgan Payments Trends Report 2019). 
 
Figure 1 shows the month of Ramadan, middle of the year, and end of the year are factors that cause an increase in 
the fashion industry sales. Many basic apparel products whose sales increased by up to 400 percent both offline and 
online at National Online Shopping Day (Harbolnas) moment. E-commerce enabler company SIRCLO revealed that 
the transaction value from the implementation of Harbolnas12.12 in 2020 increased by 328 percent from 2019. Data 
in the 2020 Indonesia Economic Report also shows that the real sales index for the clothing category experienced a 
spike on holidays. Therefore, business actors in the fashion industry need to determine the right strategy to deal with 
the phenomenon of sales surges and face competition to seize the market during the holiday and national online 
shopping day. 
 
The development of the digital world makes the marketing of fashion products currently not only done offline through 
retail stores but has grown with online marketing. According to the e-Conomy SEA (2020) report by Google, Tamasek, 
and Bain & Company, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital adoption of people using digital services 
for the first time. Indonesia experienced the highest increase in internet users in Southeast Asia in 2020, with 37% of

Abstract  
 
Presence of veterinarian or animal health workers who are easily accessible at a relatively affordable cost is needed 
by community. The health of farm animals requires special attention so that there is no problem of spreading disease 
with the intermediary of livestock such as avian influenza, Q-fever, and MERS. Handling and prevention of diseases 
in farm animals and pets requires knowledge from experts, namely veterinarian or animal health workers. Currently, 
short- and long-term solutions are needed related to animal health problems in Indonesia. One solution that can be 
considered is to take advantage of the advantages offered by technology. However, there are very minimum 
technology companies in the field of Health have focus on providing health care services and home visit health 
workers. In order to develop a service as a solution related to animal health in Indonesia, an integrated system to

4. Conclusion 
This study shows the visualization of maps and patterns on Digital Transformation on SME's research around the 
world obtained from the Scopus database. The results of the database analysis show that the trend of publications on 
Digital Transformation on SME's always increases every year where the peak is in 2020 with 119 documents. Research 
on digital transformation is becoming more and more interesting because today is the era of digital competition. The 
most productive researcher on the theme of digital transformation on SME's is Schuh, G with 5 documents from 
Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Aachen, Germany. Furthermore, Universit√© du Qu√©bec 
Trois-Rivi√®res is the most prolific affiliation with the theme of digital transformation research on SME's with 7 
documents. Germany with 56 documents became the most productive country on the theme of this research. Procedia 
CIRP became the most productive publication source with 10 documents in digital transformation research on SME's. 
Computer science is the most productive subject area in this research theme with 110 documents or 24.9%. The 
research theme map for the last 15 years has formed the linkage of keywords into 4 clusters, namely: Industry, 
Competition, Information, and Digitalization, which was then abbreviated as ICID. A collaborative network of 
researchers was formed with a threshold qualification of 3 research documents and found 3 interrelated researchers, 
namely Ays, Julian L, Muhlbradt, Thomas., and Schuh, Gunther. 
 
The implications of this research are in the form of theoretical and practical contributions. In theory, this study shows 
the visualization of ICID as a map of research themes formed from published data over the last 1.5 decades (2005-
2020). Practically, the results of this research theme map can be used as a basis for reference for knowledge in carrying 
out digital transformation for SME actors. Further researchers can explore, develop, and collaborate on research on 
digital transformation in SMEs based on the findings of the research theme map.

Abstract 
 
In this study, we propose the deep learning based platform for defect classification based on machine vision and perform the 
empirical analysis with various image data supplied by the mid or small-sized companies in South Korea to evaluate the 
performance of the proposed approach. Through this platform, we aim to perform full inspection of products with reasonable cost 
investment. Specifically, this study uses deep learning based algorithm to perform foreign material inspection, processing shape 
inspection, and processing omission inspection based on product image data of three manufacturing companies. A classification 
model and anomaly detection model were used, and empirical analysis was performed through actual product image data. All 
defective products were judged as defective, and a small number of good products were judged as false defects, with an accuracy 
of 97.9%. Through the experiments, we believe that a machine vision-based defect classification model we developed would be a 
highly cost-effective way to identify defects through images. Through this manufacturing data-based platform for the same industry, 
it is expected that even small and medium-sized enterprises with low manufacturing data-based technology can introduce and 
develop defect classification technology at a low cost.

Abstract 
 
Critical success factors are those limited areas where ‚Äúthings must go right‚Äù for a business or organization to survive. 
They are described as performance measures which are crucial in making certain that a successful project is 
implemented and closed out in organizations. Various authors in literature have highlighted what they deem as the 
most important success factors for project execution, and these have been filtered out to capture the most relevant ones 
to the built environment industry, being: time, cost, quality, and scope and risk management. Quality is not only one 
of the three dimensions of the project management triangle, but also considered the ultimate, for every delivery 
depends on it. Project stakeholders are those individuals that have a direct or indirect effect on the success or failure 
of a project and have varying opinions of what constitutes as a successful project. The listed success factors above 
will be discussed on this paper in accordance to how the most important construction project stakeholders view those 
specified factors. The purpose of this research article is to investigate, assess and determine the critical success factors 
in construction projects and to validate their impact on the views of construction project stakeholders.

1. Introduction   
Corporations partake in projects because they are in the business of doing projects. They require projects to advance 
and grow and to conquer new markets; therefore, ensuring the successful implementation and execution of projects 
becomes a primary objective of any company looking for growth and development.   
  
The organizational project manager is characterized by the role of overseeing construction planning, implementation, 
and close-out. He is required to possess knowledge related to components required for ensuring project success. He 
needs tools that will assist him in focusing his attention on set priorities across different project elements.  
 
Critical success factors are currently used as tools in measuring project success, however the crucial question in 
practice is the way in which to establish project success. Projects are generally considered as successful when they are 
concluded timely, within the allowed cost, are effective and the client is pleased with the end results. The PMBOK 
(2017) does not render an explanation of project success, and only stipulates the success criteria and objectives need 
to be defined by the project agreement.  
  
Success by the Oxford-Dictionary (2015) is defined as the achievement of ‚Äúsomething‚Äù wanted. Individuals associated 
with the project functions generally tend to view project success as a realization of set goals, therefore, for project 
success to be accomplished, the project objectives and criteria needs to be properly defined.

2233","Critical stakeholder analysis  
All the presented stakeholders (client, project manager, design team, contractor, and beneficiaries) were considered 
being important with the project manager being considered the most important and the beneficiaries being considered 
the least important.  
  
Time management analysis  
Not all the reasons presented were considered critical in affecting time management. Late or lack of information were 
considered important and design amendments and changed site conditions were not seen as reasons that could 
detrimentally affect the time management of a project.  
  
Cost management analysis  
Not all the reasons presented were considered critical in affecting cost management. Inaccurate cost estimates were 
considered critical to cost management and escalation was not seen as having severe effects on the management of 
costing of a construction project.  
  
Quality management analysis  
Not all the reasons presented were considered critical in affecting quality management. Poor construction supervision 
was considered the biggest threat to the quality management of a project and the change of a client was considered the 
least threat.   
 
Risk management analysis  
Not all the reasons presented were considered critical in affecting risk management. Political threats were considered 
the biggest risk in construction projects and inadequate Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and Environmental 
Impact Assessments (EIA) procedures were deemed the least threat.  
  
Scope creep management analysis  
Not all the reasons presented were considered critical in affecting scope creep management. Unclear scope was 
considered the top reason to affect construction projects and new regulations and policies were considered as the least 
reasons.  
  
6. Conclusion   
It has been determined under the literature review that projects are endeavors undertaken to attain goals compliant to 
deliverables of organizations by performing certain functions over a certain period. Project success entails meeting 
the requirement of project members. A connection exists between success factors and project success. Project success 
factors are tools that can be utilized to boost the successful implementation of a project. From the research findings, it 
was deduced that all the critical success factors (time, cost, quality, risk, and scope) identified on the literature review 
were considered critical to the success of a construction project, with differing weighting scales as to the reasons most 
and least affecting those success factors  
  
The purpose of identifying stakeholders in projects is to reduce the number of actions that might be taken by 
stakeholders to hamper projects in any negative way. Stakeholders are those people that depend on the project to be 
successful to realize their own objectives and the project also depends on them for it to be a success. Projects comprise 
of internal and external stakeholders who can be categorized as neutral, uninvolved, flexible, difficult, risky, or 
decisive. According to the literature review, the internal stakeholders comprising of the owner, project manager, design 
team, main contractor and end-users can be viewed as relevant stakeholders in construction projects.  
  
The first objective of the research was for project managers to understand the critical factors required to ensure 
project success. The critical success factors were researched, discussed, and listed in the order of ranking from the 
most important to the least. This is intended to help project managers in ensuring that producing a quality project is 
seen as the most important factor in any project, followed by adhering to project time frames, then keeping to the 
budget, managing the risks, and ensuring that there is no scope creep.  
  
The second objective was to understand how stakeholders perceive these success factors in construction projects. 
The aim of this research was to also identify the most important stakeholders in construction projects and to determine 
how the critical success factors impact their views on project success. The study went into detail regarding how 
construction project stakeholders being the owner, project managers, design team, contractors and end-uses viewed

Based on the findings of the study, a project manager who seeks to ensure that a successful project is implemented 
fully and to the satisfaction of all the stakeholders involved, the following measures must be undertaken:

Abstract  
 
In this study the researchers would like to explore how product quality, price, atmosphere, word of mouth, product 
involvement affects customer‚Äôs purchase intention on Starbucks‚Äô products of Starbucks Coffee Drive Thru Hayam 
Wuruk on West Jakarta during early Pandemic Covid19. There are 5 hypotheses on this research: (1) there is a 
positive effect of product quality upon purchase intention; (2) there is a positive effect of price upon purchase 
intention; (3) there is a positive effect of product involvement upon purchase intention; (4) there is a positive effect 
of atmosphere upon purchase intention; (5) there is a positive effect of word of mouth upon purchase intention. The 
research started from June of 2020 until the end of the year 2020. The results of the study showed that all five of the 
hypotheses were supported. Word of mouth is the most significant independent variable from all of the five 
hypotheses. From the discussion and findings shows the power of drivers on variables; product quality, price, 
product involvement, atmosphere, word of mouth affects purchase intention in the era of situation pandemic in 
around of the location. Then, this one becomes the interesting facts that discuss in this research paper. But even 
though the researcher has gathered results, the researcher would like for future researchers to improve a better 
research compared to this research.  This is caused by the limitations of energy and funding. 
 
Keywords:  
Product Quality and Price, Product Involvement, Atmosphere, Purchase Intention, Starbucks Coffee. 
 
Introduction 
Starbucks Coffee, the largest coffee chain originated from the United States of America. Began in Seattle‚Äôs  
Pike Place Market in 1971 by 3 co-founders, Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker, and Zev Siegel. They started 
Starbucks Coffee as a coffee roaster, retailer for coffee beans, tea, and spices Later, Howard Schultz aspired to 
change Starbucks Coffee into a coffeehouse concept and acquisitioned Starbucks Coffee. As the coffee chain 
expanded throughout the US, it also expanded to international locations such as Canada, Singapore, Japan, etc. 
serving 80 markets and holding more than 30 thousand shops. Indonesia is included as one of the markets Starbucks 
Coffee decided to expand to. First opened in Plaza Indonesia, Jakarta. Recently  this coffee shop expanded to a 
number locations over cities Indonesia,  326 different locations all around major cities (22 cities), connecting to 
Indonesians one cup at a time (Starbucks Coffee, 2018). International Coffee Organization (2020) stated that

2245",,"is also a competitive element on winning the coffeeshop competition. Customer‚Äôs product involvement can also be 
concerned by starbucks to maintain customer‚Äôs purchase intention. While word of mouth holds the highest 
contribution to purchase intention on this research. Schiffman and Wisenblit (2015) stated that word of mouth was a 
credibel communication that appeared because of their satisfaction upon the product they had used. Basri et al. 
(2016) also stated that word of mouth could become a persuasive promotional media that was transmitted from 
customer to another. From this finding, Starbucks Coffee Drive Thru Hayam Wuruk may also be allowed to find 
ways that could create word of mouth upon customers. Therefore, strategies that could create customer word of 
mouth may be able to persuade new customers or even existing ones.  
 
Limitation and suggestions 
The researcher suggests that Starbucks Coffee Drive Thru Hayam Wuruk can provide their customers with 
(relatively) great product and atmosphere to maintain customers‚Äô intention on purchasing. Maintaining them is also 
the key to maintain customer‚Äôs purchase intention. Then, providing these amenities (product quality and service) 
may also be given with pricing that is reasonable and fit to the market segment. Starbucks may also rely on word of 
mouth to create and maintain customers‚Äô purchase intention. Word of mouth can also be their promotional media. 
Starbucks may find things or strategy that can generate ways to generate customer word of mouth. Starbucks Coffee 
Drive Thru Hayam Wuruk can rely on their product or atmosphere as one of their word of mouth worthy objects to 
be talked upon customers.

Abstract 
 
 
Social media are the websites and platforms that facilitate people to share information quickly and efficiently. The 
transformation of sharing photos, ideas, and other data between individuals has changed the way people live and do 
business. Social Media communication tools are widely utilized in the workplaces to facilitate internal 
communication and improve employee business processes. The study identifies that while global organizations have 
great benefits from using social media communication tools in their workplaces, In Sri Lankan organizations, there 
can be seen a minimum usage of those tools for internal communication purposes. This study investigates the 
influencing factors for the adoption of those social media communication tools in local organizations. The literature 
review is done according to the PRISMA framework. After referring to the literature, twenty-seven factors are 
identified, and the most frequently found eight factors,  Top Management Support, Relative Advantages, 
Compatibility, Cost-Effectiveness, Competitive Pressure, Bandwagon Effect / Pressure from trading partners, Firm 
size, and Complexity are recognized as the affecting factors for adopting social media tools. The identified factors 
are presented as a model through the study. Moreover, the tools and processes used by global organizations are also 
identified in the literature review.

1. Introduction 
Social media are the websites and platforms that facilitate people to share information quickly and efficiently. While 
many individuals use mobile phone apps to reach social media, these communication tools originated on computers. 
These social media tools can relate to any internet communication feature that enables users to share information and 
interact with other people broadly. Moreover, the transformation of sharing photos, ideas, and other data between 
individuals has changed the way people live and do business. (Matthew 2020)

Abstract  
 
In comparison with the well-addressed topics, such as financial crisis prediction or credit rating forecasting, the work 
on a performance evaluation that has been considerably acknowledged as the main trigger for financial difficulties is 
quite scarce. To bridge this gap, an innovative decision framework that integrates multi-structure data envelopment 
analysis (MS-DEA) and random vector functional link neural network (RVFLNN) for performance analysis is 
proposed. By implementing MS-DEA, the decision-makers can uncover some of the structure behind the best practice, 
as well as identify the source of inefficiency within specific processes. In addition, this study further equipped the 
model with forecasting capability. That is, the outcome derived from MS-DEA are then injected into RVFLNN to 
construct the forecasting model. If the decision model with superior forecasting quality, the decision-makers can rely 
on it and then reach a better and reliable judgment. The model, tested by real-life cases, is a promising alternative in 
performance evaluation and forecasting.

Abstract 
 
As we all might have felt or seen, the impact of different mental illnesses has increased as the modern workforce is 
shifted from physically challenging tasks to mentally challenging tasks. With this change in the nature of work the 
impact on the human‚Äôs mental health is increasing as compared to earlier times. So we also need to give this area more 
attention than before. In this paper we have surveyed papers that discuss about using Audio features and using it for 
building machine learning models for predicting different mental illnesses. For this study Supervised learning ML 
models are preferable as going with the audio features unsupervised ML models may get confused with different 
excitement states.

1. Introduction 
Mental illnesses (or mental disorders) are situations that affect your thoughts, feelings, emotions, and behavior. It 
can be an occasional occurrence or a long-lasting (non-permanent) effect. Those can affect your ability to 
communicate and work each day. There are many mental disorders, with different presentations. Often it is 
characterized by a combination of unfamiliar thoughts, ideas, feelings, behavior and relationships with others. 
Psychological problems include: depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other mental illnesses. There are 
effective strategies for preventing mental disorders such as depression. There are effective treatment options for 
mental disorders and ways to reduce their suffering. Access to health care and social services that are able to provide 
treatment and social support is essential. 
 
1.1. Different classes of mental illness: 
‚Ä¢ 
Neurodevelopmental disorders: These are problems that often start in the womb, usually before the child 
starts school. For example, attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, and 
learning disabilities. 
‚Ä¢ 
Schizophrenia and various other mental disorders: These disorders cause a misinterpretation of reality - such 
as deception, hallucinations, and informal thinking and speech. The most notable example is schizophrenia 
although this disorder may be allocated with a group that usually emerges from reality. 
‚Ä¢ 
Chronic bipolar disorder and related disorders: These disorders include diversion from alternating episodes 
of mania - excessive enthusiasm and depression episodes. 
‚Ä¢ 
Depression: It includes intrusions that affect the way you feel emotionally, such as the magnitude of 
happiness and sadness, and can alter your capacity to function. Examples include major depressive disorders, 
traumatic and war associated disorders, and premenstrual disorders.

2272","4. Conclusion 
With the help of these proposed ML predictive models based on Audio data we can perform telephonic consultations 
using those predictive diagnostics models of specific mental illness. By using these audio, video and textual data we 
can equip the ML model without any need of expensive clinical equipment. Furthermore we can incorporate the above 
mentioned data with other mobile sensor data and online activities we can improve the accuracy of the models. 
Furthermore we can use the discussed method to detect mental disorders at an early stage for industrial workers and 
employees so that we can prevent any accidents or the loss of productivity.   
 
5. Future plans 
By incorporating these multimodal data features together we can build a ML model with better accuracy. Along with 
audio, video and text features, other features such as online activities such as the online surfing content, social media 
activities, sensor data, GPS data and other mobile sensor data to properly incorporate them by giving each feature 
proper weightage and training a ML model based on that data. We believe that amalgamation of various data features 
with proper weightage will be helpful in attaining much better accuracy. We‚Äôll continue this study so that we can 
ultimately develop an all-purpose mental illness detection model based on above mentioned data.

Abstract 
 
The mining sector plays a huge role in building the economy of different countries. The contribution of the mining 
industry to the gross domestic product in South Africa has declined over the years due to different challenges such as 
risks and uncertainties. The main purpose of the study was to identify the external risks affecting the mining industry 
in South Africa and their mitigation strategies. 
A total of 21 mines from 6 South African provinces were covered. The commodities covered in the study include gold, 
platinum, coal, copper, iron ore, and diamond. The external risks affecting mines globally that were identified from 
the literature review include fluctuation of commodity prices risk, volatility of exchange rates risk, political risk, 
environmental risk, health risk and pandemics risk. The survey used in the study revealed that South African mines 
are also faced with similar risks. Some more risks affecting South African mining that were identified through the 
questionnaire include illegal mining, attracting and retaining skilled labour, cyber-attacks, socio-economic challenges, 
load shedding and HIV/AIDS. The results revealed that most mining companies apply similar mitigation strategies 
such as hedging and insurance to combat the external risks.

1. Introduction  
The mining industry has always played a crucial role in human existence. It is one of the top two earliest human 
endeavours together with agriculture (Balasubramanian, 2017). The global mining industry has from the past 
experienced difficult times, with various challenges that involve the political and economic stability of countries 
(Mining and Quarry world, 2019). The concern regarding global production and supply of minerals continues with 
more interest on critical minerals which are used for new or green technology (Brown, et al., 2018). 
South Africa is one of the top ten producers of gold, platinum, coal and diamond (Phakathi, 2017). Additional minerals 
produced in the country in notable quantities include manganese, chromite, nickel and phosphate (DMR, 2017). 
According to Mckinsey (2019), the mining value chain contributes above 300 billion to South Africa‚Äôs gross domestic 
product (GDP). Vegter (2019) stated that in 1980, the mining industry was the second biggest contributor to South 
Africa‚Äôs GDP at 21% just after the manufacturing industry that contributed 22%, although the mining industry declined 
to 6th place in 2016 at 8% and 7% in 2018.  
Besides the South African mining industry being of paramount importance, it has experienced local and global socio-
economic problems that have led to its reduction in competitiveness and performance (Phakathi, 2017). One of the

The external risks affecting mines globally that were identified from the literature review include fluctuation of 
commodity prices, volatility of exchange rates, political risks, environmental risk, health risk and pandemic risks. The 
survey which used the external risks identified globally as a basis of identifying external risks in South Africa revealed 
that South African mines are also faced with similar risks. Some more risks affecting South African mining that were 
identified through the questionnaire include illegal mining, high competition and decrease in global demand, attracting 
and retaining skilled labour, cyber-attacks, socio-economic challenges, load shedding, HIV/AIDS, contractor labour 
unrests and divestment impediments. 
It was deduced from the study that there is no particular correlation between the risks. Certain external risks such as 
fluctuation of commodity prices affect all mining operations, locally and globally and will always be there as long as 
the mines are operating and trading. Certain external risks affect operations depending on the geographical location 
of an operation, a country‚Äôs governance, and type of commodities mined, while other external risks affect operations 
randomly. When these risks strike in different operations, the outcomes are mostly different as they depend on how 
the specific risks were handled. Although operations apply different mitigation strategies to combat the risks, certain 
strategies are popular within operations such as the hedging strategy for risks such as fluctuation of commodity prices 
and strategies such as insurance for environmental and political risks. It was also revealed that most operations use 
many different strategies, either simultaneously or one at a time depending on the state of the organization then.  
The impacts of external risks on operations listed by participants include: loss of production, high production costs, 
loss of mining rights, damage to mine properties and elevated social instability, while the impacts of external risks on 
employees include retrenchments, loss of lives and loss of other beneficial work incentives. 80% of all the participants 
mentioned the loss of jobs or retrenchments as the main impact on employees. This is of high concern, especially in a 
country like South Africa with a high unemployment rate and high levels of poverty. The research also revealed that 
poor countries or poor and marginalized communities get impacted more by the consequences of uncertainties that 
were not planned for as compared to countries with enough resources.

Abstract 
 
In this digital era, technology plays a vital role in our day-to-day life. Technologies reduce human errors. Evidence 
shows that many of the countries moved to E-voting systems from a traditional pen and paper-based system. for fair 
and efficient elections. E-voting means allowing voters to cast their votes through websites or electronic voting 
machines. Sri Lanka is a South Asian Democratic country. In Sri Lanka, the traditional pen and paper-based methods 
are used for Election Process currently. Since E-voting has more advantages than the traditional election system such 
as E-voting is more efficient and secure and cost-effective. Although implementing E-voting technologies will expose 
how internal technologies are developed by a country. This study addressed the technology capability in Sri Lanka to 
implement an E-voting Technology. A broad systematic literature review has been done to identify how other countries 
such as India, Brazil, Estonia, Switzerland have implemented E-voting technologies. and what are technologies have 
been used to implement. Some critical factors need to be considered when implementing E-voting Such as Security, 
Environment, integrity, Perceived ease of use, and Perceived benefits are identified as an extension of the TAM model 
through a systematic literature review.

1.Introduction 
Elections play a major role in a modern democracy. It is necessary to select their representatives of the citizens. Along 
with the help of information technology, the voting process in many countries is no longer carried out with paper 
ballots. E-voting refers to voters casting their vote through a website or electronic voting machine. after the vote is 
cast by the voters, an electronic vote is digitally stored and transformed to the counting system from each electronic 
voting machine. Electronic voting machines were first used in India in 1982 on a trial basis.in the year 2004, Paper 
ballots were eliminated, and electronic voting machines were used totally. (Yi, 2019), (Avgerou et al.,2019), (Dalla, 
2020). Brazil is a developed country, here also E-voting has been used for long and other countries such as Estonia, 
Norway, Finland, Switzerland is successfully implemented and other countries such as United States, Belgium, 
Canada, Argentina, Japan, Mexico, Peru, are partially implemented. The above countries are successfully 
implemented the E-voting system, but some countries have failed in e-voting adoption and cancelled or not continued 
E-voting method after tryouts such countries are Netherland, Paraguay, Germany. (Goretta, 2018). There are some 
common issues in the Paper ballot Electoral system such as many numbers of human resources needed to fulfil the 
election process and it takes much time to complete the selection process. From the security perspective, there are 
many frauds attempts such as vote manipulation, and in the vote polling state officers also can be in the part of the 
corruption and can be cause for fake votes, and for the paper ballots systems, the hand-counted method is using for 
vote counting, in that case, there can be chances to counting mistakes so this will lead to unfair election results. This

4. Results and Discussion 
According, most of the identified literature talked about E-voting technologies, what are the various technologies used 
by different countries to implement E-voting for fair and secure Elections and when implementing an E-voting system 
what are the technologies that can be used in the future and what are the factors that need to be more considered.  in 
that case, most of the literature talked TAM model or its Extensions such as perceived ease of use, Perceived benefits, 
and other critical factors identified from the literature. Most literature talked about security because security is the key 
aspect in the election process and E-voting technologies make sure to eliminate fraud attempts and vote manipulation 
in the election process. At the security confidential level is important, E-voting technology only allows an eligible 
citizen to access the system, to keep the security of the system, software and hardware components should be up to 
date.  Although the E-voting system needs to ensure the voting and voters integrity. and the system should be cost-
effective and less time consuming to fulfil the requirement. and should be easy to use by disabling citizens without 
any assistance. E-voting should provide a vote counting facility also then only election results will be more accurate. 
E-voting systems need to prevent data losses. When implementing E-voting technologies need to consider 
environmental factors such as power supply, internet availability, government policies and laws and political 
environment.  
 
5. Conclusion 
E-voting adoption is a proactive area. Many studies have been conducted worldwide in this area and its technology; 
Many countries moved to E-voting for efficient elections, and they have used various new technologies. These E-
voting technologies are updated year by year. Sri Lanka is a developing country, has the potential to adopt new 
technologies Sri Lankan internet penetration level and computer literacy rate is increasing every year but In Sri Lanka 
Pen and paper-based elections method is still in Action. E-voting has many advantages over pen and paper election 
systems such as being cost-effective, secure, and efficient. so above study talked about Sri Lankan technology potential 
level and E-voting Advantages and how other countries have implemented E-voting and what are the technologies 
they used and what are the technologies that can be used in future and what are the critical factors that need to be 
considered when thinking to adopt E-voting such as Security, Perceived Ease of use, Perceived benefits and integrity, 
Environment. When implementing e-voting these factors should be considered if not e-voting results will be not

Abstract 
 
Cultural diversity has many shapes and different values in every part of the world. Indeed, cultural differences 
influence perceptions and behaviors. In the field of entrepreneurship, culture has a significant role in creating 
successful business launches and certain conditions. Entrepreneurial leaders that have already survived during the first 
step in building their new venture certainly have a specific attitude that fits the local culture of their employees. This 
study examined the specific attitude of young entrepreneurs in Sundanese society by using thematic content analysis 
to formulate cultural dimension.   The data were gathered by using in-depth interviews with three fresh graduate 
entrepreneurs, who have built their businesses during their last 3 to 5 years of studies at the West Java Business 
University. The respondents were selected purposively according to certain considerations, such as their good business 
prospects. To help the analysis process, Nvivo was used to code the interview transcripts. The results showed that 
several attitudes of the entrepreneurial leaders could thematically cluster around the Sundanese dimensions, such as 
silih asah, silih asih, and silih asuh. This study offers authentic values of the Sundanese dimensions of entrepreneurial 
leaders which have not been researched before by using the thematic analysis method. It also contributes to cultural 
leadership and entrepreneurial leadership research by providing a specific cultural perspective that might have differed 
if implemented in other countries or regions.

1. Introduction  
Cultural diversity has many shapes and different values in every part of the world where it influences perceptions 
and behaviors. In entrepreneurial realms, culture plays a significant role in creating successful business launches and 
specific conditions, especially building trust. The most substantial matter that becomes a challenge for many 
entrepreneurial leaders is getting trust from the organizational members. All the organizational members need to be 
willing to reach the organizational vision. Regardless of the ideas and depth of planning, research, feasibility is 
essential during the business process. Entrepreneurial leaders that have already survived during the first step in 
building their new ventures have a particular attitude that fits the local culture of their employees. Hence, 
understanding culture is critical in order for leaders to move and influence their followers.  This study proposed the

2301","In new business, leaders have significant and essential roles in keeping the business on track. MJ asserted that to 
maintain company growth up to the current level, leadership is the crucial key. A leader in an entrepreneurial firm 
cannot be 'sakleng"" person.  Sakleng refers to straight forwardness in presenting point. In line with MJ, AV and MF 
are also concerned on being more flexible with the employees. Discipline is a good point, but being tolerant is a side 
of humanism that we must consider more‚Äîfinancial investment is not the main factor in a start-up company, in fact, 
building good relationship with people and reaching their hearts for engagement and loyalty with the company is more 
meaningful. 
Empathy is the key for Entrepreneurial Leaders to be more engaged with their employees. For new entrepreneurs, 
their firms mean everything to them, but they realize that their employees have their own private lives that they have 
to respect. The leaders has to control themselves to keep calm in any situation. They have boundaries and limitations 
in expecting the contribution of their employees.  
 
‚óè Silih asah 
Silih asah in Sundanese Leadership concept refers to leadership that highly appreciates the importance of knowledge, 
continuously improving the abilities and knowledge possessed by themselves and their subordinates. The dimension 
of silih asih in entrepreneurial leadership consists of Mahiman (Insightful),  Lagiman (skillful), Prakamya (diligent and 
tenacious), Isitwa (honet), Morogol-rogol (Enthusiastic), Langsitan, rapekan (pro-active). These characteristics refer to the 
capacity for massive knowledge acquisition, ability to define a variety of alternatives, ability for continuous learning 
from any source, ability to be honest and boldness to acknowledge their limited capability, work hard and build their 
businesses from zero, enjoying every step and taking the initiative to organize. 
Silih asah concept in entrepreneurial firm emerges clearly in the mindset of the entrepreneurial leaders. They have a 
strong passion for improving themselves, aspiring to acquire more knowledge than their followers to help and guide 
them to execute the job properly. They also have a clear vision of their profiles. They know that they have some 
limitations, so learning from others is necessary. 
 
‚óè Silih asuh 
The word ‚Äúasuh‚Äù refers to care, protect, and nurture. Silih asuh in Sundanese Leadership concept refers to leadership 
based on compassion to protect, maintain, and care for members of the organization.  Hence, the organization is able 
to generate a sense of trust and mutual respect. The dimension of silih asuh in entrepreneurial leadership consists of 
Ahiman (firm) and Mupreruk (calming). These characteristics refer to the leaders‚Äô capability of making decision precisely, 
considering the priority, handling the difficult situations occurred, utilizing personal approach toward their employees.  
The entrepreneurial leaders, adhering to the Sundanese concept believe that they have great responsibility for their 
firms, as well as the firm members. The priority is to maintain a good relationship with others in order, to preserve 
the healthy ecosystem. Togetherness and family relationship concept are the central themes of their daily operation.  
 
6. Conclusion  
This study has analyzed the entrepreneurial leadership behavior values of entrepreneurial small business owners by 
using the Sundanese values framework. Data are processed in a series of steps. The analysis begins with descriptive 
coding, where data are organized into meaningful groups. The emerging groups are then refined through successive 
stages of interpretive coding to identify overarching themes. The primary tool used for data coding is the NVIVO 
software package. Based on the focus group discussion, several Sundanese values are found in the entrepreneurial 
leaders‚Äô daily attitude and behavior. The results show that culture influences entrepreneurial leaders‚Äô behavior. 
Besides, several values of entrepreneurial leaders are relevant to Sundanese values. The perspective of entrepreneurial 
leaders for certain behavior requirements are attributed to the dimension of Sundanese values. These values are 
deemed essential for leaders in entrepreneurial firms.  In addition, several attitudes of the entrepreneurial leaders could 
thematically cluster around the Sundanese dimension, such as silih asah, silih asih, and silih asuh. 
This study offers authentic values of the Sundanese dimensions of entrepreneurial leaders which have not been 
research before by using the thematic analysis method.  It also contributes to cultural leadership and entrepreneurial 
leadership research by providing a specific cultural perspectives that might have differed if implemented in other 
countries or regions.

Abstract  
 
A survey of literature regarding ERP system supports for management decision-making in organizations revealed 
contrary views. According to some researchers, ERP systems only integrate business processes and functions and 
bring about efficiency in organizations. From various literature reviews, it is clear that there is an ambiguity in ERP 
systems effectiveness to support management decision-making.  Research on ERP systems effectiveness impact on 
management decision-making in HEIs is rare. Therefore, this study seeks to investigate this phenomenon by 
adopting a framework of Peters and Aggrey to evaluate the influence of ERP systems effectiveness on management 
decision-making in HEIs. Using relevant theoretical foundations, a research model was developed to test five 
relevant hypotheses. Using quantitative research, data were collected from 150 administrators and managers of three 
case study universities in Ghana. Data was analyzed using PLS-SEM andthe findings revealed that ERP systems 
effectiveness based on these perspectives (financial, learning and growth, customer/stakeholder and system quality) 
influence more significantly on management decision‚Äìmaking in HEIs unlike Internal business process perspective. 
The findings backed the idea that, ERP systems supports and improve management decision-making. The findings 
also support the research model proposed.

1. Introduction 
Several researchers have studied ERP systems in higher education institutions in various situations and in different 
perspectives. Examples include Watson and Schneider (1999), Judith (2005), Kvavik et al., (2002), Beekhuyzen et 
al., (2002), Mehlinger (2006), Fisher (2006), Cornford and Pollock (2001), etc. Majority of these researchers 
focused their research on ERP systems implementation success and failure, critical success factors, impact of ERP 
systems on organization and business process performance. However, few or little of these researches have focused 
on framework, model or methodology development for evaluating ERP systems in higher education institutions. 
Common frameworks or models for evaluating ERP systems effectiveness or performance at post-implementation 
stage include Balanced Scorecard (BSC), Content Context Process (CCP), Stefanou‚Äôs framework, ISO 25010 model, 
DeLone and McLean (D&M), technology acceptance model (TAM) and task-technology fit model (TTF). Each 
framework or model focuses on different aspects and has different perspectives on the evaluation of ERP systems.

Abstract  
 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems implementation is increasing rapidly in the higher education 
institutions, because of the call by various governments on them to streamline processes and functions. However, 
not all ERP implementations have been successful. There are still challenges in the implementations of ERP 
especially in the higher education sector. Since ERP implementation comes with high cost and also affects every 
aspect of the institution, there is therefore the need of investigating the challenges of ERP implementation in HEIs. 
The study focuses on ERP implementation challenges in the Ghanaian higher education. Using a case study 
research, data for analysis were collected from some public universities in Ghana and were analyzed using inductive 
thematic analysis. The findings of the study revealed three categories of challenges: institutional related challenges, 
financial related challenges and human related challenges, were some of the challenges encountered when 
implementing ERP systems in the Ghanaian higher education.  It is expected that the findings of this study would 
provide valuable information not only to practitioners but also to academics. The findings will serve as source of 
general guidance in stimulating future research in this area. Understanding these challenges will assist HEIs to 
eliminate or mitigate ERP implementation failures.

1. Introduction 
An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is one of the most widely adopted systems used by corporate 
organizations and institutions to obtain competitive advantage, reduce cost and to enhance organizational cross-
functional efficiency and effectiveness through the seamless integration of all information flowing through the 
organization. Despite the challenges of implementing ERP systems, organizations in the corporate sector have 
experienced numerous benefits from ERP systems during the last two decades than their counterparts in non-profit 
sector (Seo, 2013). These successes have encouraged higher education institutions (HEIs) to adopt ERP systems 
with the same goals that promoted corporate sector adoption (Fisher, 2006) such as increasing operational efficiency 
and decreasing costs. Apart from these goals, HEIs have also adopted ERP due to the call by various governments 
on them to streamline processes and functions (Allen et al., 2002). Stakeholders (students, faculty and government) 
pressure and reduced governmental budgets for universities have also necessitated the adoption of ERP systems in 
HEIs.

2318","Relation to previous studies  
Previous researchers (Menon et al., 2019; Soliman and Karia, 201) supported the organizational related challenges 
such as internal business process incompatibility.  The research findings also support the claim by Seo (2013) that 
the Organizational structure and culture also highly affected ERP implementation. Pollock and Cornford (2005) also 
support the findings by arguing that ERP systems are generic type of solution, but not a specific solution, hence it is 
a high-risk strategy for universities to adopt it. 
 
Finding 2: Financial related challenge (high cost of ERP project implementation) 
  
Relation to previous studies  
Other researchers (Kulikov et al., 2020; Soliman and Karia, 2016) supported the financial related challenges such as 
high cost of ERP project implementation.  The research findings also support the claim by Seo (2013) that the ERP 
system implementation was much more costly than expected, and the systems also required significant secondary 
resources and ongoing maintenance efforts. Pollock and Cornford (2005) also support these findings by arguing that 
ERP systems implementations are costly projects which required high investments to execute.  
 
Finding 3: Human related challenges (staffs‚Äô resistance to the system, staffs lack of commitments or involvements, 
lack of top managements involvement or commitments and training of staffs to use the system). 
 
Relation to previous studies  
Earlier studies by (Kulikov et al., 2020; Menon et al., 2019; Soliman and Karia, 2016) supported the human related 
challenges (staffs‚Äô resistance to the system, staffs lack of commitments or involvements, lack of top managements 
involvement or commitments and training of staffs to use the system). The research findings also support the claim 
by Seo (2013) that the top management support was one of the most frequently cited critical success factors during 
ERP implementation.   
 
Our research findings indicates that during HEIs implementation of ERP there were challenges that have been 
categorized into three in this study: organizational related challenges (low level of IT/IS maturity and internal 
business process incompatibility), financial related challenge (high cost of ERP project implementation) and human 
related challenges (staffs resistance to the system, staffs lack of commitments or involvements, lack of top 
managements involvement or commitments and training of staffs to use the system).  
 
7.Future research direction 
Since ERP implementation challenges are not technological or technical in nature but rather organizational and 
human related, it is therefore mandatory to investigate these two factors. This study recommends that future research 
should thoroughly look at the organizational and human related factors that affect the implementation of ERP 
systems in HEIs. 
 
8. Conclusion 
In conclusion, we recall the study‚Äôs research objective, research question and research findings. The research 
objective is to investigate the challenges of ERP implementation in higher education institutions (HEIs) and this led 
to the research question ‚Äúwhat are the challenges of ERP systems implementation in higher education institutions‚Äù. 
The findings of the study revealed three main categories of challenges namely: institutional/organizational related 
challenges (low level of IT/IS maturity and internal business process incompatibility), financial related challenge 
(high cost of ERP project implementation) and human related challenges (staffs resistance to the system, staffs lack 
of commitments or involvements, lack of top managements involvement or commitments and training of staffs to 
use the system). 
 
The research findings practically suggest that the HEIs management and other stakeholders should consider 
critically these challenges when implementing ERP systems in order to avoid high failure rate. Our study‚Äôs finding 
informs the HEI management and stakeholders especially the academia and practitioners on issues concerning ERP 
implementation challenges. It also informs ERP system vendors, ERP developers and other supporting ERP services 
on the need to consider these challenges when making decisions about ERP implementations in the HEI.

Abstract  
 
Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing field with applications in many industries. Yet, companies still experience 
difficulties in selecting and developing effective and efficient IoT solutions that add value. This study provides a case 
within the automotive industry, i.e. an automotive parts manufacturer, called APM. In this case, we highlight the need 
for an efficient IoT solution for APM and we suggest that a systematic and collaborative approach, called action design 
research (ADR), is used for selecting, co-developing, implementing and testing an IoT solution. Although APM 
experimented with an IoT solution before, the solution was inadequate and failed to address the efficiency problems. 
As the main contribution, we present a collaborative IoT design approach (CIOTDA) to guide practitioners in 
developing and implementing IoT solutions. In addition, we provide experimental results for a partial implementation 
of CIOTDA. The availability recorded by the sensors was an average of 3.7% lower than the availability from the log 
sheets, where the largest difference was 7.6%. The total number of parts produced was mostly consistent except for 
one cell that logged 90 parts produced while the sensor only recorded 51 parts.

1. Introduction and Research Objectives 
The South African automotive manufacturing industry is highly competitive as the number of tier 1 suppliers in the 
country decreases year on year (Davies, 2020). In an industry-wide study, Barnes, Black, Combrie, and Hartogh (2018) 
note that one of the greatest threats to the South African automotive industry was the prevalence of low-cost 
international competition fueled by aggressive tariff reduction schedules. Antao, Pinto, Reis, and Goncalves (2018) 
note that the implementation of an IoT system that allows for real-time condition monitoring has been seen to improve 
productivity, efficiency, and quality. Jena, Mishra, and Moharana (2020) provide the example of a case study in which 
a factory improved the output by 13.24% while reducing downtime by 12.94%. Yet, a class-of-problems exist, namely 
that IoT implementations often fail due to a lack of systematic and collaborative design efforts. This was echoed by 
Eris, Drury, and Ercolini (2021) who propose a collaborative approach to IoT development using different 
collaborative taxonomies. 
 
Cisco (2021) presents the findings of a survey in which 1845 industry decision makers who had experience on IoT 
projects from several industries were asked why IoT projects fail. The survey found that only 26% of IoT projects in 
industry were successfully completed while 54% of those surveyed agreed that collaboration between the business 
and IT side was the number 1 critical success factor. Other interesting findings were that according to IT professionals 
35% of projects were considered successful while only 15% of business professionals considered the projects as 
successful (it met the needs of the business case). The business professionals cited that more attention needed to be 
given to the business case as successful projects boasted an average of 10% higher engagement at every step of a 
project. The findings from the survey provide an example of how achieving data collection does not add value to the 
business but requires further processing. The findings make a case for the introduction of a collaboration focused 
approach that utilizes the tools and techniques of Industrial Engineering and Information Systems Design to create 
value from the data captured by the IT side to fulfil the business case of an IoT project. 
 
APM is a South African automotive parts manufacturing company that represents an instance of the stated class-of-
problems. According to Davies (2020), the automotive manufacturing industry accounts for 11.76% of South Africa‚Äôs 
GDP and directly employs 110 000 South Africans. The industry is currently facing heavy competition to foreign

2337","5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The sensors and dashboards are working reliably and recording accurate and real data. However, the first improvement 
on what has been built would be to finalize the operator dashboard. Another improvement that needs to be made is the 
connectivity throughout the facility. The sensors are currently in a small area of the production floor that has Wi-Fi 
connectivity. Thus, moving forward, the connectivity would need to be reevaluated and improved. The proposed 
method is to use a Raspberry Pi as described by Fisher (2015) to act as a gateway between the sensors and the internet. 
 
5.4 Validation 
An initial implementation of the CIOTDA to design an IoT solution for APM, indicated that the chosen IoT solution 
has the potential to improve the accuracy of data capturing regarding the statuses and activity/inactivity of machines. 
We also obtained feedback (survey results) on whether the CIOTDA as an approach was useful in designing an IoT 
solution that would address the problems identified at APM. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In summary, this article suggested a new collaborative IoT design approach (CIOTDA) that should be useful to other 
manufacturing enterprises that need to improve the quality of their manufacturing processes using IoT technology. 
We addressed three research objectives in this study. Addressing our first objective, we selected appropriate industrial 
engineering techniques to construct a collaborative IoT design approach (CIOTDA). Our survey-results confirmed 
the collaborative nature of CIOTDA. As a second objective, we applied the CIOTDA at a real-world enterprise, 
partially demonstrating its application in this article. Our initial implementation results confirm that the IoT solution 
has the potential to increase the efficiency of data collection and management‚Äôs ability to effectively monitor 
manufacturing operations. As a third objective, we presented some experimental results to demonstrate how the sensor 
data becomes useful to identify trends or downtime, prompting management action. The CIOTDA was developed 
using action design research (ADR), demonstrating the artefact at a single enterprise. Based on some of the feedback 
(from our survey results), the CIOTDA could be further improved to ensure that a more comprehensive set of 
requirements are gathered for the IoT solution. As indicated by the fourth stage of an ADR study, further evolution of 
the artefact is needed. The CIOTDA should also be demonstrated at other manufacturing enterprises to further validate 
its usefulness.

Abstract 
 
After surviving the covid-19 epidemic, civilization must eventually adjust to a new normal. Currently, certain 
situations are unpredictable and cannot be anticipated or projected based on previous historical data. After enduring 
the lengthy quarantine and the tremendous mental stress brought on by the complicated circumstances, the priority for 
most individuals is to take vacations. Traveling to various locations that provide a variety of holiday experiences 
becomes a viable option to selecting. What attribute of a destination has become more important to individuals when 
they decide to travel? This study investigates the significance of destination attributes to travel decisions in the new 
normal. In this study, regression is used to analyze data collected randomly from 150 respondents. The study's results 
indicate that the primary factor influencing a visitor's choice to go or not is activities. The findings of this research 
will aid the tourism sector in developing strategies for visitor-oriented activities. Another critical advantage is 
recognizing that customer behavior directly impacts a company's long-term success.

1. Introduction  
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a significant impact on various sectors of life (Wilson 
& Chen, 2020). Tourism is one of the sectors hardest hit by multiple restrictions imposed by the government as a 
policy to deal with the pandemic (Nagaj & ≈Ωuromskaitƒó, 2021). The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic makes people 
consider in detail when making the decision to travel (Wilson & Chen, 2020). The pandemic has restricted 
interpersonal interaction and has affected many industries, including the tourism industry (Seyitoƒülu & Ivanov, 2021). 
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the crisis has been huge due to restrictions on the use of transportation by countries‚Äô 
authorities around the world, and global mobility has ceased (Abu-Rayash & Dincer, 2020). Travel restriction and 
social distancing make it more challenging to survive the pandemic (Sharma et al., 2021). Without a doubt that 
COVID-19 has had two big impacts on the tourism industry. The first one is the travel restrictions that discourage 
people from traveling, and the second is the increase of travel anxiety due to the perceived risk of COVID-19 (Bratiƒá 
et al., 2021).

In Table 5, the test results show that activities, accessibility, and ancillary service have a good relationship with visitor 
decisions. These three variables, namely destination attributes,  provide good opportunities for visitors decision. More 
deeply, the test results are known based on the coefficients model (Table 4, Table 6), which partially knows the 
relationship between variables and answers the research hypothesis.  
 
Activity and Travel Decision 
First, directly that activity has a positive relationship showed with coefficient 0.447 and the significance value of 
activity is < 0,005. This means that the higher visitor considers well the activities to do during the vacation in the new 
normal. This result can be recommendation for tourism industry to give improvement in this point, supported also 
with the result of previous study that showed outdoor adventure activities as a form of sustainable tourism have 
potential implications for our understanding of, and engagement with, sustainability, mental health and wellbeing 
(Hanna et al., 2019). Recommendations from several previous research studies explain that there is a good relationship 
between activity attribute and travel decisions. 
 
Accessibility and Travel Decision 
The results of the current study show that the correlation value of accessibility on visitor decisions is 0.314 (Table 5) 
and the significance value is <0,005. Compared to activity attribute, the correlation results are clearly still lower than 
visitor confidence in relation to travel decisions. This means that it is known that the priority scale that can be 
determined in changing visitor decision. Despite being in second place, the results of the study show that accessibility 
has a significant relationship with travel decisions. Referred to Table 3 that showed most of visitors decide to visit 
destination in the city, visitor was still confidence with the availability of accessibility to tourism destination in the 
new normal. On the other side, relating to the choice of travel equipment, visitors have reduced the use of public 
transportation (Kuo, 2021). Previous study also found that for the first trip after the pandemic, visitor travel in the 
country by car with their family (Ivanova et al., 2021). 
  
Ancillary Services and Travel Decision 
The smallest score shows in ancillary service shown with the score of 0,186. This result was in line with previous 
study that found safety and security have received little attention as standalone destination attributes (Kwanisai & 
Vengesayi, 2016). Despite being the third place, the result showed that ancillary service had significance value 
is<0,005. The availability of tour guide, health care facilities and service, security still affected travel decision of 
visitors. The tourism management should put emphasize the ancillary service in the new normal.  
 
 
 
5. Conclusion  
Health, economics, and the environment are all affected by the COVID19. Tourism is one of the worst-hit industries 
during the covid-19 Era. Since tourism activities can improve mental health and well-being, therefore people are still 
searching the tourism destination without neglecting the covid-19 health protocol. During the outbreak, people are 
more likely to stay in their own city, and large families with young children are more likely to travel short distances 
than other groups of tourists. The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing, but the tourism industry is expected to recover. 
Based on the phenomena that occur, a study related to travel decision is carried out on consumer behavior of the visitor 
in the new normal. With the opening of several tourist attractions in the new normal, several factors will be considered 
by visitors to be able to make travel decision, including destination attributes. A quantitative study was carried out 
where the results of the study found activity, accessibility and ancillary service had significant relation to travel 
decision. It is immediately known that activity became the first consideration to travel decision, tourism management 
appears to prioritize visitors ‚Äòactivity in tourism area, outdoor activities can be a consideration for management to 
provide for visitors, by always maintaining the number of visitors and health protocols. Second attribute that affected 
travel decision was accessibility, it indicated that visitors was still confidence with the transportation to get the tourism 
destination. The study also showed that the most visitors still choose tourist destination in the city during the pandemic. 
Ancillary service was the last appealing indicators to visitors. It indicated that visitors really believe that the 
management has followed all the health protocol requirements as an effort to keep visitors from covid 19. The findings

travel or not. The results of this study are useful for tourism industry in determining strategies referring to activities 
that can be offered to visitors. Another most important benefit is understanding that consumer behavior provides a 
direct stimulus to the sustainable performance of the company. There are recommendations from this study as a goal 
for further research. It is recommended for further research to examine the mediation of other variables related to 
consumer behavior such as revisit intention.

 Abstract 
 
In this paper, an alternative approach is proposed to deal with the inventory positioning problem in a supply chain 
network. In particular, the problem is modelled as a mixed integer programming model. In this model, the locations 
and amount of stock at each location are decision variables, while the total holding inventory cost is the objective 
function. The optimal solution for such a model can be obtained by using a commercial. The applicability of the 
proposed method, especially the mathematical model, is validated by a few numerical experiments. The results 
indicates that our approach is suitable for various types of supply chain networks and the optimal solutions for these 
networks are easily obtained via a commercial solver.

1. Introduction 
In a highly competitive market of today, matching supply with demand is of great concern for supply chain 
managers/practioners. Since uncertainty always exists in both demand and supply, mismatches between them are 
unavoidable. Therefore, the management often relies on inventory, especially safety stock, as a buffer for these 
mismatches. With the supply chain network growing more complex, optimizing safety inventory at a location in the 
network become an ineffective practice. As a result, modern supply chain management is interested in effectively 
managing the safety inventory at not one location but across multiple locations in a supply chain network. This 
management issue is known as the inventory positioning (IP) problem and is a main research topic for many researchers. 
According to Simchi-Levi et al. (2008), a typical IP problem is concerned with the stocking locations and the amount 
of safety inventory at each location within a supply chain network. These concerns are initially addressed in the study 
of Simpson (1958). The author develops a model, from which the level of safety stocks in a serial supply chain are 
analytically determined. As a result, Simpson‚Äôs (1958) model becomes the foundation, based on which several models 
are developed to deal with IP problem under various supply chain settings. For instance, Graves (1988) incorporates 
multiple products and production flexibility in an analytical model for a single-stage supply chain. Following Simpson 
(1958) and Graves (1988), Graves and Willems (2000) construct a safety stock placement model for a spanning tree

In Figure 3, it is observed that to accommodate a short service time quoted to a customer, i.e., 2 periods, and a relatively 
long service time quoted by one of the suppliers, i.e., 37 periods, inventory should be held in both locations of Stage 
1, i.e., before and after. Particularly, 71 units of finished goods (the bucket after Stage 1), 116 units of raw material 
from Stage 2 (the bucket on the arc between Stages 1 and 2), and 124 units of raw material from Stage 3 (the bucket 
on the arc between Stages 1 and 3) are kept as inventory. This placement of inventory results in a total inventory cost 
of $5721.35, including $3106.88 for finished goods and $2614.47 for raw material.  
 
 
 
Figure 5. Inventory placement for serial supply chain 
 
A similar interpretation is applied for the results in Figure 5. Among eligible stocking locations in the serial supply 
chain, two are selected for holding inventory, i.e., before and after Stage 2. Specifically, 62 units of finished goods 
and 109 units of raw material are held as inventory. This leads to a total inventory cost of $1565.72, of which, $1238.60 
is for finished goods and $327.12 for raw material. 
 
5. Conclusion  
In this paper, an alternative approach for modelling a supply chain inventory positioning (IP) problem is introduced. 
Conventionally, the problem is formulated as non-linear mathematical model. Solving this type of model involves the 
development of complex algorithm. The implementation of such an algorithm is also a challenge. As an attempt to 
overcome this difficulty, the IP problem is constructed as mixed-integer linear programming model. The solution for 
this kind model is obtained by using a commercial solver. Indeed, this is demonstrated by a numerical study, in which 
the inventory position problem is solved for an assembly and a serial supply chain. In addition to illustrating the ease 
of having an optimal solution, the numerical study highlights the flexibility of our approach to model different 
structures of a supply chain network. As a result, the outcome of this research is served as the groundwork for future 
studies, including the consideration of uncertainty in processing and transportation, or an experiment with non-normal 
distributions for customer demand.

Abstract 
 
Health systems are faced with significant challenges during and after natural or human-caused disasters. Surge 
planning is a critical component of every healthcare facility‚Äôs emergency plan and response system. The process of 
managing and allocating scarce resources by tackling the vulnerability inherent to patients means that defining 
improvement priorities is one of the main challenges healthcare systems face when responding to a medical surge 
event (e.g., influenza, COVID-19). The consequences of these challenges include increased patient mortality, 
ambulance diversion, long wait times, and unavailability of beds. Although previous efforts in hospital operations 
management have been modestly successful in applying operations research techniques to analyze and optimize ED 
operations during a standard operating capacity and, literature provides a vast number of resources on surge response 
planning for hospital administrators, most of the planning guidelines are not suitable for the current pandemic scale. 
This project aims to develop computational models that help to answer how the constant level of hospital resources 
and the changing demand for medical care can be modeled. We propose an intelligent framework to improve ED 
operations following a four-stage process. Stage one ‚Äì develop univariate and multivariate forecasting models to 
forecast daily ED patient arrivals, which will help hospital management efficiently plan and allocate limited ED 
resources. Stage two ‚Äì investigate the current prolonged ED length of stay for COVID-19 patients, using ensemble 
methods. Stage three ‚Äì developing a multi-scale simulation-optimization framework to investigate how resource 
allocation affects the ED‚Äôs performance during a surge. The simulation model combines agent-based, discrete event, 
and system dynamics, where system dynamics address the spread of disease, agent-based models the behavior of 
patients and resources (i.e., doctors and nurses), and discrete event models the processes within the hospital emergency 
departments. The expected outcomes of the study are the multi-objective combination of indicators to optimize ED 
performance and studying the interactions between the different ED operations to improve service capacity. Our 
proposed activity will assist hospital administrators, and clinicians plan effectively to ramp up capacity in response to 
the current and future pandemic.

Abstract 
 
Emerging countries face a series of challenges on their agenda, one of them being the socio-economic development 
of their region.  One well-known way to create a competitive economy is by introducing innovative technologies, 
products, or services. Entrepreneurship can be classified into small and medium enterprises and innovation-driven 
enterprises (IDE). Three main actors can boost IDE's creation by looking at the triple helix model: industry, 
government, and the university. In this research, the university plays the leading role in promoting the creation of 
these companies. Conceiving a new company by transferring technology from an academic institution is known as a 
university spin-off. However, this practice has not been studied in depth in emerging countries. Therefore, this research 
focuses on shedding some light on how the entrepreneurial university can foster the creation of these companies.  
 
The steps in this process were (i) identifying the significant elements for the creation of innovation-driven companies 
with a literature review and a validation of the elements with the Fuzzy Delphi method, (ii) modeling the current 
process of spin-off creation in two universities in the Monterrey region using the Total Interpretive Structural 
Modeling tool, (iii) and analyzing the current situation in the region to show key points in the creation of policies to 
support university decision-makers.  
 
The results show the current process of the two largest universities in the region, one private and one public, from 
which key points can be extracted. Similar aspects are the relevance of the entrepreneurial vision of the university and 
the applied research in the following stages of the process.  Also, the high influence the context has on the applied 
research carried out by the universities.  A third common aspect was that the technology transfer strategy mechanism 
was the first entity receiving the applied research and defined whether the project could be commercialized via 
university spin-offs. If so, it was transferred to the support mechanisms for the creation and development of the 
company, for example, incubators and accelerators, among others. Moreover, access to capital was exhibited as an 
opportunity for both universities, wherein the private university, this element was not found in the system, and for the 
public university, the manner of accessing these financial resources was through funds that supported research and 
development activities, being a conflict in the creation of a company because it is non-profit capital. A call for the 
region was the lack of culture towards technology commercialization; in both universities, it was not yet strong enough 
to drive the system, and it appears to be in the shaping stage. In this way, the foundations were laid with this research, 
for the entrepreneurial university in an emerging country to understand their technology transfer channels, and to adapt

Abstract 
 
The use of social media platforms has become choice for individuals searching for health-related information on the 
web. In this study, we consider news aggregation and discussion internet forum, reddit, for its unique characteristics. 
Correspondence analysis is employed as a dimensionality reduction and knowledge representation technique for the 
text analytics of reddit posts. We present a case study of comments and posts for information retrieval, creating visual 
representations of interrelated groups of words and topics. These representations may be used for smart navigation 
systems, promoting discussion, transparency, and support pertaining to social determinants and healthcare among 
users on social media platforms and within online communities.

1. Introduction 
Reddit is a social media news aggregation and discussion website, to which registered members submit content that 
includes text posts and images. Reddit‚Äôs content is supplied by its users, and the popularity of that content is also 
determined by the membership. Posts are organized   by subject into user-created boards called ‚Äúsub-reddits‚Äù, covering 
a variety of topics among which fitness, wellness and other health-related subjects are popular, resulting in vast 
exchanges of past experiences, ideas, reviews, and support. Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top 
of their sub-reddit, with moderators keeping track of a user‚Äôs adherence to the official rules, such as requesting users 
not to post spam, ask for votes, or post personal information. One of reddit‚Äôs strengths lies in its sense of community: 
there is a sub-reddit for any and every interest, and within each of these sub-reddits, there exists a unique community 
with a distinct culture (Anderson, 2015). For some reddit communities, the platform serves as an open forum for the 
exchange of experiences. Users contribute to a sub-reddit by engaging in posts or comments that they can relate to 
and interacting with other users with unique backgrounds. De Choudhury and De (2014) studied the impact of a 
particular community and its generated content on society, where the authors studied the potential of the platform for 
mental health social support and characterized the emotional and prescriptive information provided by the community. 
Additionally, the dissociative anonymity mask that reddit provides makes the study of social determinants and health 
challenges interesting due to the disinhibition effect anonymity induces (Caplan and Turner, 2007). Researchers 
recognize dissociative anonymity of this nature, a resistance to attach to offline identity or, to their actual reddit 
account, as a foundation of online disinhibition (Lapidot-Lefler and Barak, 2012). 
 
Reddit continues to emerge as a platform for information exchange around several health challenges. In November of 
2019, reddit ranked as the No. 6 most visited website in the United States and No. 19 in global internet engagement, 
according to Alexa Internet (Competitive Analysis, Marketing Mix and Traffic, 2019), an American web traffic

2367","Posts containing similar content are assigned a color corresponding to their cluster. In this system, posts belonging to 
the same cluster as those previously visited by a user can be flagged, while posts containing content that is unlike or 
unrelated to those viewed earlier by the same user on the sub-reddit can be indicated by an exclamation. Rather than 
simply sort posts by user interaction, posts which are closely related are quickly identified, increasing the level of 
control users have when navigating the platform. Geometric data analysis allows for a representation of text data 
available in online fora that serves both patients and healthcare providers. It captures and effectively complements 
health data while also providing a non-traditional venue for mental health and social support, facilitating the 
connection of people with a wide range of experiences and valuable information at different stages of interest. 
 
6. Conclusions  
Text mining of knowledge representation can play a fundamental role in supporting the exchange of experiences 
related to health outcomes and conditions on online platforms. Providing methods which enhance the control users 
have over their content exposure on social media platforms and online forums is essential in improving the facilitation 
of these exchanges. In this article we show that the dual representation of words and posts used in    a sub-reddit allows 
for intelligent and cohesive groupings of information relevant to the unique interests of users, and that the 
representations can serve as a tool for smart navigation and web searching in an online forum. Furthermore, by 
incorporating text data from sub-reddits that may be interrelated, such as r/PregnancyAfterLoss/, an extension of these 
ideas can be used to study the behavioral patterns and social interactions within multi- community platforms. From 
this, it is possible that related posts and information could be mapped to groupings considered in this work, developing 
a navigation network for users based on their interests and the information that is pertinent to them.

Abstract 
 
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received much attention due to their capabilities to generate high-resolution 
aerial photographs that allow the creation of maps that can support the local governance of different communities. 
Aeronautical cartography is limited in rural communities due to different factors, such as bureaucratic, economic 
requirements, and the lack of access to state-of-the-art tools for territorial management and consultation in local 
governance undertakings. In this work, we describe a UAV with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities. 
This aircraft is designed as a versatile platform for image acquisition to assist local governance activities within 
Mexican rural communities. Equipped with a multispectral camera and GNSS/GPS with a PPK system allows for high 
precision photogrammetry and a high precision time register of the photographs. A case study is carried out to 
demonstrate the series of advantages over conventional UAVs, specifically in payload, flight time capabilities, and, 
more importantly, as a robust and versatile platform to perform local governance and territorial management activities. 
This VTOL platform can be used from any terrain, allowing rural communities in areas with complicated geographies 
to use it. While we have developed a promising VTOL platform for cartography and local governance activities, a 
series of considerations and improvements remain. Employing a UAV with VTOL characteristics could empower 
local communities in their local governance activities, such as planning, zoning bylaws, land conservation, and 
collaboration with other communities.

use (Y) Digital Wallet Funds, several conclusions can be obtained. Some of these conclusions will answer the problem 
formulation in this study. Here are the conclusions obtained by the researchers. Based on the results of descriptive 
analysis of digital marketing variables (X1), a score of 74%. This score falls into the high category on the continuum 
line. With the score, the digital marketing of The Digital Wallet Fund according to user perception is good.  
 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis of brand trust variables (X2) obtained a score of 83%. This score falls into 
the high category on the continuum line. With this score, the brand trust of Dana Dompet Digital according to user 
perception is good.  Based on the results of descriptive analysis of the decision variable use (Y) obtained a score of 
79%. This score falls into the high category on the continuum line. With the score, the decision to use Digital Wallet 
Funds according to user perception is good.  Based on the results of Test t and Test f, it was found that digital marketing 
variables (X1) and brand trust (X2), have significant influence both partially and simultaneously. In addition, the 
influence of digital marketing (X1), and brand trust (X2) on the decision to use (Y) by 58.9% and the remaining 40.2% 
was influenced by other factors not studied by researchers. 
 
5. Suggestion 
Based on the discussion and conclusions above, the researcher has some suggestions for several parties. Based on the 
results of respondents' responses to digital marketing variables as a whole is in the high classification of 74%. 
However, there is still a statement in the classification that is enough that ""I often see content displayed by social 
media Digital Wallet Funds."" with a percentage of 61% each. Therefore, it is expected that the Digital Wallet Fund 
can create content for social media that is even more interesting, in order to enter into the explore section of the user's 
social media and to increase users who want to visit the Social Media Dana Dompet Digital.  
Based on the results of respondents' responses to the brand trust variable as a whole is in the high classification of 
82%. Even so, there is a statement that has the lowest presentation of 79% which still falls into the high category, 
namely ""Digital Wallet Funds are not easy to break into data."" Basically, this shows that the brand trust in the Digital 
Wallet Fund is well formed. However, it would be nice for a Digital Wallet Fund to provide knowledge and 
explanations about the security of Digital Wallet Funds to users.  
Based on the results of respondents' responses to the overall use decision variable is in the high classification of 79%. 
Even so, there is a statement that has the lowest presentation of 72% that still falls into the high category, namely ""I 
started using Digital Wallet Funds after seeing the Digital Wallet Fund ad."" Basically, this shows that the decision to 
use Digital Wallet Funds is well formed. However, it would be nice for The Digital Wallet Fund to further improve 
the quality of advertising in order to capture user attention and action faster.

Abstract  
 
Efficiency and back EMF are affected by the rotor slot number selection on the induction motor design. An analytical 
calculation will investigate the harmonic order of the air gap magnetic flux density back EMF with different 
geometrical parameters of rotor skewed angle considering the saturation of the induction motor. The Squirrel Cage 
Induction motor-SCIM with 36 stator slots/ 28,32 and 44 rotor bars are verified under starting and constant speed. 
Their electromagnetic characteristics, such as electromagnetic torque, stator current, and magnetic flux density are 
compared in between two configurations. The paper contributes that the proper rotor slot number selection has a strong 
impact on the induction motor and the best design is applied for a 10hp induction motor with fixed stator and rotor 
diameters.

1. Introduction 
The induction motor is being used in several applications. Such applications are various drives, such as pumps and 
ventilation. The design and analysis of electric machines were carried out with the use of equivalent circuits and 
analytical equations (McCoy 2009). The SCIM 7.5kW-4P was implemented by the same rotor diameter, the depth of 
the rotor bars, and the air-gap length. The stator used for the simulations is chosen from a real motor from industrial 
products, whose resistance was calculated through DC current injection and whose geometrical variables were known. 
The used motor is a 3-phase, 4-pole, 7.5 kW, and 380 V aluminum cast-cage induction motor (Prousalidis et al. 2010, 
Marques and Sousa 2010). The simulations carried out are AC time-harmonic and consider the nonlinear magnetic 
characteristic of the rotor and stator iron core (Charaabi 2012, Pyrhonen et al. 2008). This paper presents harmonic 
orders of the back EMF and the air gap magnetic flux density with analytical calculations. Then, the efficiency and 
torque and losses of some simulated induction motors with different rotor slot numbers have been shown and 
discussed. Three of the rotor slot selected numbers are 28, 32, and 40 with skewing rotor slots.

This study is based on 36 stator slots and 32 rotor bars and the three-phase SCIM specification and ratings are 
shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.

The iron loss results of three motors in the figure. 5 show good agreement, verifying the validity of the proposed 
calculation method. Among the calculated results, the case of the cage rotor with skew shows the largest calculation 
error, with a calculated value 14% less than the experimental result. It can be considered that this error is caused by 
neglect of the inter-bar currents in the calculation (Kappatou 2008, Boldea 2010, Gierras 2006). 
 
6. Conclusions 
This paper has analyzed and compared the electromagnetic performance of three induction motors for industrial 
applications. The 32-rotor bar has the lowest iron loss. To verify the proposed design, a detailed design of a 3-phase 
36-slot and 4-pole IM is assembled and verified torque, power, and efficiency performances. The back EMF 
waveforms have been analyzed based on the FEA modeling.  The thermal simulation was implemented to validate 
overheat capacity

for Yunnan University. There are two recycling methods in the campus; Cainiao courier station and campus 
garbage sorting recycling mode. Then, two major factors were derived through literature reviews which 
comprises of subjective factor and objective factor. Subjective factors compose of consumer recycling 
awareness and convenience of packaging recycling. Moreover, factors concern with objective factors are 
recovery cost, unified packaging standard, incentive policies, recycling channels, and intelligent 
management of packaging recycling. After extracting all the factors, the interview questions were designed 
based on Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and interviewed experts for rating the score. The pairwise 
comparison was computed given the result of Cainiao courier station recycling mode (0.83) and campus 
garbage sorting (0.15). The result shown that Cainiao courier station recycling mode is the best candidate 
for recycling method in the campus. In addition, weight of all factors are recycling awareness (0.39), 
incentive policies (0.14), Convenience of packaging recycling (0.19), recovery cost (0.12), unified 
packaging standard (0.04), recycling channels (0.09) and intelligent management of packaging recycling 
(0.03), respectively.

1. Introduction
As the main force of online shopping, college students' shopping ability should not be underestimated. As a 
social group with tens of thousands of people, colleges and universities have a huge amount of express delivery. In 
2018, the number of college parcels in mainland China increased to nearly 2.5 billion in 2018 and expected to exceed 
3 billion (Wang and Rao, 2017). Students in Yunnan University has around 25,000. At the campus, around 4,000 to 
6,000 packages were arrived at the campus every day. More than 10,000 packages were arrived on the Double 11 
shopping day. According to the increasing number of packages, the campus faces with two major problems. Students 
are lack of awareness for recycling packages and the campus is lack of package recycling management. As a result of 
these problems, the large number of packages are discarded. This leads to the following problems: resource waste, 
increasing of the waste disposal cost, environmental pollution.  
In recent years, many domestic universities have implemented recycling measures for recycling packaging 
effectively. There are two packaging recycling methods in Yunnan University. The first method is performed by 
Cainiao Courier Station (a third-party terminal logistics service platform), and the other is performed through campus 
garbage sorting. In the campus, Cainiao Courier Station is mainly used to recycle reusable express packages with little 
damage, such as paper boxes. When students take out the parcel from Cainiao Station, they can directly take out the 
goods and place the package in the designated recycling area. The rest were handled by Logistics department of 
Yunnan University. The campus garbage will be sorted by this department. The rubbish bins are classified according 
to three categories: recyclable, non-recyclable, kitchen waste and hazardous waste. Both recycling methods have been 
implemented since the second half of 2020 and are currently in the trial phase.  
Unfortunately, these two methods are still new to the campus and lack of alignment. The campus faces with 
a large number of express packages dumped in the garbage site. Causing the package to lose its value. This paper aims 
to analyse the current situation of package recycling method in the campus. Extracting the factors which effect the

6. Conclusion  
6.1 Conclusion  
The research of express package recycling method is of great significance to the development of China's 
packaging recycling industry, which is conducive to improving the utilization of resources, reducing the pollution 
caused by traditional packaging waste disposal methods to the ecological environment, and promoting the 
development of reverse logistics and circular economy. This research aims to select an optimal recycling mode of 
express package and provide suggestion for Yunnan University to implement express garbage recycling. First, the the 
factors which impact the express package recycling were extracted through literature review. Then, the questionnaire 
is sent to experts of reserve logistics management to assess the importance of each factor for making the pairwise 
comparison matrix. Then, the AHP model is computed. As the result, the weight of Cainiao Courier station recycle 
mode is 0.83 while another is accounted for 0.15. This significant result express that he recycling method of Cainiao 
station is more preferable with consumers.  
6.2 Study the factors which affect the current packaging recycling development in campus 
Recycling factors can be divided into subjective factors and objective factors. Subjective factors can be 
understood as the recycling factors influenced by subjective reasons of consumers, such as consumers' recycling 
awareness and the convenience of package recycling. Objective factors refer to the recycling factors influenced by the 
behaviour of external subjects such as the government and enterprises, such as recycling cost, package standards, 
incentive policies, recycling channels, and intelligent management. After getting these seven factors, in the next step 
the researcher established the AHP model and design the questionnaire based on all the factors that impact package 
recycling.  
6.3 Select the best candidate of Yunnan university recycling mode through AHP method. 
  
The researcher collected data by sending questionnaires to experts, designed pairwise comparison matrix by 
analysing data with mean value method, and then designed AHP model. Through the calculation, the weight of all of 
the factors is recycling awareness (0.39), policies (0.14), convenience (0.19), recovery cost (0.12), unified packaging 
standard (0.04), recycling channels (0.09), Intelligent management (0.03), respectively. The researcher uses the mean 
value method to combine the three answers from experts into single values. Then using these data to compute the 
weight priorities of two given recycling mode when considering one given factor and show the final weight of 
4211","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

recycling mode. According to Table 3, we can see the CAI Niao Courier Station Recycle mode are the first ranked 
with the weight score of 0.83 from three experts, which means the recycling method of Cainiao Station is more popular 
among consumers, and the management level of Cainiao Station is higher, which is more suitable for promotion and 
use in campus. Therefore, the CAI Niao Courier Station Recycle mode is the best candidate of packaging recycling 
mode in Yunnan University.  
6.4 Limitation of the research 
The selection of recycling mode plays an important role in improving the efficiency of packaging recycling 
and optimizing the reverse logistics system for the campus. It is also conducive to improving the utilization of 
resources and reducing the environmental pollution caused by packaging discarding. However, there are some 
limitations in the research. Firstly, the sample size is small. Because Yunnan University has a limited number of 
experts whose research direction is reverse logistics, the opinions of only three experts were collected in this research. 
Secondly, the survey scope is narrow, because the packaging recycling mode suitable for universities may not be 
suitable for other places such as communities. In addition, literature analysis and AHP decision-making methods are 
highly subjective, and future research needs to use more mathematical methods to reduce the influence of subjectivity 
on research.

Abstract 
 
This paper aims to model a driver assignment problem which considers drivers states and capacity. The problem can 
be classified as a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). In the current literature, CVRP is a topic which has 
the most papers devoted to solving the problem. In this research, a comprehensive cost function is considered, and the 
driver can always have sufficient amount goods to deliver, and the variety of drivers is enlarged. These three factors 
are the improvement of the CVRP when compared to the state-of-the art research. We develop a mathematical model 
using linear programming approach. The complexity of the models makes the analytical solution is difficult to solve 
the problem. We develop a modified version of genetic algorithm to suit the problem in this research. We apply the 
model and algorithm to a e-commerce delivery problem of agricultural products. Based on a simulation from an actual 
dataset, the objective function from the algorithm differs 1.15% from the global optimal solution, which give the 
algorithm a promising future to be applied in other sets of problem.

1. Introduction 
Driver assignment problem can be classified as vehicle routing problems (VRP). The objective of VRP is to assign 
drivers to tasks which gives efficient operations, which is usually represented by time and minimization (Braekers et 
al., 2016). One branch of VRP is the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), where the problem usually tries 
to optimize the capacity delivered by each courier (driver). In Brakers, et al., (2016), CVRP is the topic which has 
the most papers. In this type of problem, the capacity of the drivers used is considered in solving the problem. In this 
case, there is a depot/center that has a certain capacity that will serve requests by a number of customers (Saraswati 
et al., 2017). 
 
We focus the CVRP to a specific case of agricultural products delivery. Agricultural products are generally sent by 
suppliers and received at company's main warehouse. The product then undergoes a series of activities which include 
quality inspection, storage, collection, and packaging in the main warehouse. The finished product is then sent to the 
distribution center according to the location of the request. In each distribution center (DC) requests are taken by 
drivers who use two-wheeled motor drivers to be sent according to the request address. 
 
In the delivery of demand products, the company has two driver status, namely partners and third-party logistics (3PL) 
service providers. Mitra is the status of an individual driver who works at the company, while the driver status of a 
logistics service provider is the status of an outsourced driver. The company currently has three different logistics 
service providers from three different companies. Therefore, in one delivery from a DC, the company can use the 
status of a third partner driver or service provider. In addition, the two driver status both send requests according to 
the assignments made by the company. Furthermore, the term driver category is used. 
In sending requests, each driver knows the requests that will be sent through the company's information system. The 
driver is given a notification via the respective driver's device regarding any requests that need to be delivered. In 
addition, if the drivers have finished sending all their requests, they do not have to come back to the distribution center. 
Driver assignments are managed by logistics operators. Prior to the assignment, the logistics operator will receive a 
list of requests that need to be delivered from the company's information system. From the list received, the operator

algorithm of Baker and Ayechew (2003) in solving the problem. There have been several modifications made. The 
genetic algorithm that is carried out in outline is shown in the following pseudo-code. 
 
Create an initial population of structured solutions 
Evaluation of the fitness of each individual in the population 
Repeat 
Choose two random individuals from the population to be parents 
Generate two offspring from parents (do a crossover) 
Mutations in both offspring 
Check the eligibility of the offspring 
Evaluate the suitability value of offspring 
If there are eligible offspring: 
Select individuals from the existing population to be replaced using the ranking replacement method 
Offspring enter the population and selected individuals are removed 
End if 
Until the number of generations is 10000 or there is no improvement after 200 generations 
 
4. Results 
The results are presented in Table 2. In the summary of the test results, n is the number of customers and the id 
column is a variation of the customer parameters (having different locations). Different locations affect the distance 
between the customer and the depot and accessibility (the customer's area).

Based on the data in Table 2, it can be seen that for minimal cost differences, genetic algorithm always gives better 
results for all number of customers. This also applies to the average cost difference. It can be concluded that genetic 
algorithm is able to improve the results of the Sweep algorithm which becomes a better construction algorithm. In 
addition, it can be concluded that the algorithm can provide a solution that is close to optimum for small datasets. 
After knowing the performance of the algorithm against a small dataset, the test is continued with customer 
parameters that resemble the original dataset. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, the development of models and algorithms for the problem of assigning drivers to delivery of 
agricultural products has been carried out. The mathematical model developed has been verified and validated. The 
algorithm is tested with a dataset resembling the original dataset. Compared to manual assignment, the assignment 
speed is faster (manual assignment has a speed of 0.0833 customers/sec). The algorithm has been verified and 
validated and provides a feasible solution and at a faster speed than the initial conditions. One of the suggestions that 
can be given to the company is to improve the accuracy of the longitude and latitude coordinates of the customer. 
One way that might be used is to ask the customer to place a point on a map application service (such as Google 
Maps) so that the resulting distance matrix is more accurate.

Abstract  
On this paper we are going to discuss about Malangan Mask preservation based on social media consumption of 
Generation Z in Malang. It‚Äôs a reflecting result from the previous research that has been done about social media 
consumption pattern of Generation Z in Malang towards the preservation of Malangan Mask. By using Uses and 
Gratification Theory to analyzed the issue, significant result has been found. The result showed that Instagram is the 
social media that Generation Z like the most. They also like entertainment and informative themed content so they 
follow accounts that have interesting content. Generation Z also uses social media to learn new things and can decide 
product purchases through information from that platform. Based on this social media consumption pattern, it is very 
supportive to conserve Malangan Mask through social media if artists want Generation Z as the target.

1. Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on people's lives, one of which is in the arts. From data published by the 
Ministry of Education and Culture (Kemendikbud) in May 2020, at least 58,000 artists in this country were affected 
by the coronavirus (Mutiah, 2020). One of the areas where the artists were affected is Malang, namely the Malangan 
Mask artists. Tri Handoyo, the owner of the Malang Asmorobangun Mask Art Studio, also admitted that during the 
pandemic there was almost no activity at his art studio. In addition, orders for masks in large quantities also stopped 
at this studio (Defri Werdiono, 2020). Malangan masks have appeared in the Kedungmonggo area, Malang Regency, 
East Java since the Dutch colonial era. Malangan mask is a mandatory component in the mask dance art and the 
Malang mask puppet performance. In addition to functioning as entertainment, this art has noble values which are 
national assets that need to be preserved (Kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id, 2018). How to preserve art and culture can 
be done according to the times. As in the industrial revolution 4.0 era like this, the term Internet of Things (IoT) is 
known, which means that people have the ability to connect and facilitate the communication process between 
machines, devices, sensors, and humans through the internet network (Baenanda, 2019). In introducing and preserving 
the Malangan Mask, the use of the internet can also be used as a solution. 
 
According to data from a survey conducted by the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association (APJII) in 2019, 
out of 264 million people (a total population of Indonesians), there are 64.8% of the population who are connected to 
the internet or around 171.17 million people. Most people who use the internet are 15 to 19 years old (Pratomo, 2019). 
From the survey, it can be concluded that young people, especially Generation Z, dominate internet users in Indonesia. 
McCrindle Research Center in Australia refers to Generation Z as people born between 1995 and 2009. They were

2402","considering that as mentioned by Tanner, publishing cultural heritage using collection digitization can reach new 
audiences (Baker, 2013). This can also be used by Malangan Mask artists in reaching a wider audience. 
 
5.2 Discussion 
The use of social media as a platform to introduce and promote Malangan Mask art to Generation Z in the Greater 
Malang area has proven to be the right way. As already mentioned, the results of the ‚ÄúCultural Literacy Research 
Through Social Media‚Äù where social media is proven to be a way to introduce and teach culture to the younger 
generation (Wibawa, 2019). Complementing the research on ‚ÄúIncreasing Marketing Based on Digital Art of Malangan 
Mask Art‚Äù which promotes Malangan Mask products using e-catalogs, this research can generate new ideas that 
craftsmen who already have e-catalogs can promote the catalog through social media so that it is better known to the 
younger generation (Malik et al., 2020). Or, craftsmen can also turn their social media feeds into an e-catalog of their 
products if they target Generation Z as their target market. 
Instagram can be used as a platform that helps Malangan Mask become hype among young people. Because, judging 
from the answers to the questionnaire about the enthusiasm of the respondents towards the Malangan Mask, there are 
quite a lot of respondents as Generation Z who live in the Malang Raya area who are interested in knowing more about 
the typical culture of the area where they live. Many of them also regret that this art is not well known by young 
people. For this reason, introduction through social media can be used as an option. 
Regarding appropriate content, entertainment-themed and informative content have proven to be the most sought after 
by Generation Z in the Greater Malang area to be accessed via social media. Interesting content that can be adapted 
to young people can apply contemporary elements. If you look at Mr. Amin's answer, it is also very possible to create 
contemporary-themed content that is applied to the Malangan Mask. However, some stuff cannot be changed. 
‚ÄúContemporary is a combination of anything and is freer. Still, this contemporary nature shouldn't 
change the standard stuff inside the box. For example, such as dance movements that have been 
standardized."" 
In presenting interesting content on social media, artists can also consider the results of the study entitled ‚ÄúAn 
Evaluation Model to Assess The Communication Effects Of Intangible Cultural Heritage‚Äù. According to the results 
of this study, several rules need to be considered when designing a digital communication platform for intangible 
cultural heritage. Namely, there are four approaches to improve the effectiveness of communication (Xue et al., 2019). 
One approach that needs to be considered by Malangan Mask artists who want to promote their art through social 
media is that there is no need to display academic content in-depth considering that the content is not intended for 
professional learning but is only limited to introducing this typical Malang art to a wide audience. So, the content 
created must also be adjusted to the goals and market segments. 
To sum up, the preservation of the Malangan Mask through social media can follow the result of this research. 
Malangan Mask artists can create entertainment-themed and informative content that is packaged in an easy-to-
consumer way so that the younger generation can understand it more easily. Artists can also use Instagram to introduce 
this culture and also promote Malangan Mask crafts since Generation Z in Malang tends to follow organizations‚Äô or 
influencers‚Äô accounts as well so hopefully, with catchy content, there will be more people who know about this art. 
The more who know, the bigger the chance for Generation Z who learn about this culture or buy Malangan Mask-
themed products as proven by Generation Z habit based on the result of the Surveillance concept.

The most popular social 
media for Generation Z 
in Malang is Instagram. 
The most popular type of 
content is video content 
with the majority of the 
most preferred themes 
being informative and 
entertainment-themed 
content. 
The accounts most 
followed by Generation Z 
in Malang on social media 
are accounts of friends, 
family, influencers, 
organizations, artists, and 
online shops. 
Generation Z in Malang is 
a generation that can 
apply what is learned 
from social media and use 
social media to help 
determine which products 
to buy. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The Malangan mask is very possible to be promoted more through social media considering that social media has 
become a part of generation Z's life so that by being introduced through this platform, more young people in the 
Greater Malang area will understand this art. The preservation of the Malangan Mask through social media can follow

2407","the interests of Generation Z who like interesting content. Malangan Mask artists can create entertainment-themed 
and informative content that is packaged in an easy-to-consumer way so that the younger generation can understand 
it more easily. In addition to introducing, artists can also use social media to promote Malangan Mask crafts. 
Malangan Mask Artists can use various features found on Instagram such as photos, videos, Instagram Ads, Instagram 
Stories, Instagram Live, IGTV, and others so that promotional activities can run optimally. Also, organizations such 
as schools and universities in Malang Raya can make it more obligatory for their students and students to know and 
promote Malangan Mask using social media so that it is known to the wider community. 
Further research can conduct research on other generations such as the millennial generation or generation X so that 
researchers can find patterns of social media consumption that Malangan Mask artists can use if they want to promote 
their art to that generation.

Abstract  
 
The teenage athletes seem to lack the enthusiasm to set their current life goals in the future. The purpose of the research 
is that communication between athletes and coaches will be a solution. This research is a descriptive research with a 
quantitative approach. The method used is a survey method. The research instrument used was a questionnaire with 
20 statements. Trial of the research instrument was carried out on. The research subjects were 67 swimming athletes 
at Jasalindo Sport, Malang Regency, East Java. The questionnaire was declared valid and reliable (r count = 0.841). 
Using cluster sampling method by drawing randomly. The data analysis technique used descriptive statistical 
techniques in the form of descriptive and frequency distribution. The results showed that the influence of 
communication psychology on the character of the Jasalindo Sport Club Swimming Athletes in the very positive 
category was 65.7%, the positive category was 34.3%, and none (0%) of the respondents had less positive and negative 
perceptions. Based on the results of this study, the influence of communication psychology on the character of the 
Jasalindo Sport Club Swimming Athletes is very positive.

1. Introduction 
This study began with researchers' anxiety about a number of problems in adolescent athletes. Researchers see that 
the adolescent athletes seem less enthusiastic about managing their current life goals. This can be seen from several 
examples of cases, such as adolescent athletes who have more abilities in themselves, but rarely realize this potential, 
and even hesitate to develop it. Researchers assume that this has something to do with the condition of adolescence 
which is a transition period from children to early adulthood. At this stage, it is usually filled with the search for one's

Based on data from the research results of communication psychology on the character of the Jasalindo Sport Club 
swimming athletes, the majority of them have a very positive perception of the character of swimming athletes. This 
can be seen in internal factors as much as 55.2% (very positive), 38.8% (positive), 6% (less positive), and none of 
them have negative perceptions. External factors were 49.3% (very positive), 47.7% (positive), 3% (less positive), 
and none had a negative perception. While the overall perception of the influence of communication psychology on 
the character of swimming athletes seen from 67 respondents there were 44 respondents (65.7%) had very positive 
perceptions, and 23 respondents (34.4%) had positive perceptions. So overall the influence of communication 
psychology on the character of the Jasalindo Sport Club swimming athlete is in a very positive category. 
 
After processing data about the influence of communication psychology on the character of the Jasalindo Sport Club 
swimming athlete, the results obtained that the influence of communication psychology on the character of the 
Jasalindo Sport Club swimming athlete is zvery positive. From the results of research that are known, it is hoped that 
the trainers or trainers who train will maintain or even further improve the quality of the training that is already running 
at Jasalindo Sport Club, Malang District.

Abstract   
 
Hydroxyapatite (HA, (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) is a widely studied bioceramic due to its biocompatibility, bioactivity, and 
chemical similarity to the mineral component of bone. Generally, hydroxyapatite can be made from several natural 
and synthetic sources. The objective of this study is to prepare hydroxyapatite powders from different precursors 
(natural or chemical). Hydroxyapatite was synthetized by co-precipitation method, the chemical precursors of which 
are [Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, (NH4)2HPO4] and the natural source was bovine bone. Bovine hydroxyapatite (BHA) was 
extracted from the bovine bone bio-waste via thermal method and milling process. Synthesized HA (SHA) was 
prepared by co-precipitation method with the pH 10.0 of mother liquor. The prepared powders were characterized 
using various analytical techniques such as XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetry (TG), and scanning electron 
microscope (SEM). These techniques provide information about the structural, chemical, morphological and 
physicochemical of each of the prepared powders. The use of co-precipitation method produced a low crystallinity of 
HA while the thermal method increased crystallinity. On the other hand, the results showed that the Ca / P ratio of 
synthetic hydroxyapatite (SHA) as well as that of bovine bone source (BHA) was also stoichiometric.

1. Introduction  
Bioceramics based on calcium phosphates (CaP) have developed considerably in recent decades due to their excellent 
biocompatibility and bioactivity. Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a mineral species of the phosphate family, the chemical 
formula Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 (Elliott et al. 1994), with a molar ratio equal to 1.67 (HA stoichiometric). However, 
Hydroxyapatite (HA), a calcium phosphate bioceramic, is the primary material for applications in bone replacement. 
It is a material that exhibits an absence of local and systemic toxicity, an absence of inflammatory responses and an 
apparent capacity to bind to the host tissue (Silva et al. 2012). It has been widely used for biomedical applications, 
including orthopedics, dentistry, and as a coating material for metal implants (Hendi 2017).   
 
In recent decades, hydroxyapatite (HA) has received considerable attention as a biomaterial due to its similarity to 
human bone. The hydroxyapatite (HA) preparation for medical purposes must meet specific criteria in terms of 
repeatability, raw material composition, and finished product purity (Bernard et al. 1999). Generally, the 
physicochemical properties and morphology of hydroxyapatite (HA) depended on the origin and methods of 
preparation (Sobczak-Kupiec et al. 2012). Indeed, the physicochemical properties of materials depend mainly on their 
production processes. Due to the interesting properties of hydroxyapatite (HA), various techniques have been and are 
being developed to produce hydroxyapatite. There are two main ways to obtain hydroxyapatite; one is by inorganic 
synthesis (synthetic), and the other is to obtain hydroxyapatite (HA) from natural sources. Extensive attempts have

Synthetic process parameters such as pH, temperature, calcination temperature and aging period are important 
factors that control the purity of the prepared SHA.  
o 
Synthetic hydroxyapatite (SHA) is more commonly used because it is more readily available and free from disease 
transmission.  
o 
Bovine bone can be considered a promising biomaterial to be used to produce hydroxyapatite. As, there is an 
economic and environmental incentive due to the sheer volume of agricultural waste or other types of bone 
available to find value-added applications for these materials in biomaterials.  
o 
According to the method, reagents and variables adopted, it is possible to obtain with diverse characteristics and 
properties on the intended application.

Abstract 
 
Academic performance is one of the indicators of educational accomplishment. Stress prompts low confidence of 
students, trouble in dealing with various circumstances, seeing disorders, and decreased attention to academic 
accomplishment and self-improvement of students. Fatigue or tiredness and lack of energy are some of the most 
generally reported consequences of the new normal: online learning. More than 90% of students have come up against 
negative mental health signs because of the pandemic. The study aims to examine whether stress and fatigue have a 
significant impact on the academic performance of Industrial Engineering Students in the Technological Institute of 
the Philippines - Quezon City. The researchers make use of Pearson Correlation Coefficient, Multiple Regression, 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The dependent variable is academic performance, 
while the independent variables were: stress and fatigue. The level of perceived stress of college students was 
measured resulting in low stress (f=2, 4.35%), moderate stress (f=40, 86.96%), and high perceived stress (f=4, 8.69%) 
with a total frequency of 46 and a percentage of 100%. The level of fatigue of college students was measured resulting 
in a total score of (f=35, 76.09%) experiencing fatigue and (f=11, 23.91%) not experiencing fatigue. Based on the 
statistical tests applied by the researchers, the model produced by correlation did not fit data well, having a p-value of 
0.313 for stress and 0.532 for fatigue. The multiple regression analysis has indicated that both stress and fatigue do 
not affect the academic performance of college students. This means that stress and fatigue do not have a significant 
impact on the final model, although it is an important variable and is significant while correlating with academic 
performance.

1. Introduction 
1.1. Introduction   
Academic performance is one of the many factors that go along with academic success. Academic success is 
influenced by a variety of factors, including social background, student attitude, motivation, group and family support 
(Masud, S., Muffarih, S., et al. (2019), Lamas, H. (2016), Kassarnig, V., Mones, E., Nielsen, A., et al. (2018)). 
However, online learning has taken place in our society and takes it as our new normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has created a severe shift in the way people communicate. Technology advancements were 
critical in aiding this change (Mheidy, N., Fares, M., Fares, J. (2020)). The term ""virtual classrooms"" refers to 
education that occurs through the internet. So, it is referred to as e-learning or a variation of other terms. However, 
digital learning is only one form of distance learning, which refers to any form of education outside of a regular 
classroom and occurs over a long distance (Stem, J. (2020), Bates, T. (2016)) . Taking an online class was not easy as 
it looks, there is a lot of stress on it compared to face-to-face classes. Since we all know what it is like to be 
overwhelmed or unable to cope with the pressures we encounter, it is surprising how difficult it is to define exactly 
what ""stress and tiredness"" are in terms of study. At its most basic level, stress is our body's reaction to stresses 
imposed by a stressor, which can be a circumstance/problem that changes one's life. What constitutes a ""stressor"" 
varies greatly among individuals, depending on our social and economic situations, our living environment, our 
genetic composition, and our physiology (Samele, C., Manning, H., et.al. Mental Health Foundation (May 2018)).

1. Introduction  
 
Indonesia's economy is the largest in Southeast Asia which has various endowments that put Indonesia in a 
position that deserves to be considered due to the growth economy this country (S Budiono & Purba, 2020); (Sidik 
Budiono & Purba, 2019); (Rajagukguk, Purba, & Budiono, n.d.). The Indonesian economy faces rapid developments 
in fiscal and monetary policy, developments in technology and information (Sidik Budiono et al., 2021). The role 
and position of the Indonesian economy in the global region is in the aspects of industry, trade, and investment 
which are the main aspects in developing the Indonesian economy, both domestically and in global markets (Sidik 
Budiono & Purba, 2020). A sizeable export commodity currently is coffee that originated from some area in this 
nation, however, the Indonesian people are also big coffee consumers compare to many countries over the globe 
(Surjana et al., n.d.); (Steven et al., 2021). 
Coffee is a familiar drink in various generations in the world. The complex combination of more than 800 
volatile compounds and caffeine and chlorogenic acid is the best-known mixture as known they become a good 
income that make holding companies being bigger (Suk et al., 2019); (S Budiono, Purba, & Adirinekso, n.d.); (Sidik 
Budiono & Purba, 2020). Various countries have developed their own preferences on how to prepare and serve 
coffee drinks (Nieber, 2017). The background history of coffee dates to the tenth century, with some interesting 
stories about serving and enjoying it so that a number of business done by family ones (Tan et al., 2019); (Widjaja et 
al., 2019); (Kim et al., 2018); (Sidik Budiono et al., 2021). 
The coffee cherries which are taken from the seeds are roasted and dried in the sun and then dried to 
become processed products that are ready to be served in the form of drinks. In Indonesia there are two main 
species, namely Coffee canephore (Robusta coffee) and Coffea Arabica (Arabica coffee). The difference between 
the two variants lies in the taste and caffeine content. Arabica beans which are more expensive in the global market 
and that have a lighter taste and 70% lower caffeine content than Robusta coffee beans, therefore, people would 
prefer Arabica Coffee than Robusta coffee.

1. Introduction. 
Fashion industry is currently experiencing a rapid growth especially for millennial generations nowadays 
due to better personal and or family income (Rajagukguk et al., n.d.); (S Budiono et al., 2021). New brands emerge 
both in local market and international market. The positive trends have been going better from previous in the 
market industry (Sidik Budiono, 2011); (Meesala & Paul, 2018), because fashion indeed is one of the primaries need 
that people seek from generation to next generation in the world (S Budiono, Purba, & Adirinekso, n.d.). Fashion 
takes the needs of clothing to the next level higher brands (Tasurru & Salehudin, 2014); (Laroche et al., 2012); 
(Hikaru et al., 2021). They do not mention about the expensive price, but today, people are keener in distinguishing 
clothing materials and design, which influence the purchase intention of many people in fashion brands which 
makes the industry‚Äôs growth rockets (S Budiono, Evanson, et al., n.d.); (Panday & Purba, 2012). The below table 
there are number of the consideration to buy intention.

Abstract 
The digital paradigm, commonly called Industry 4.0, has led many companies to adopt technologies that support 
process automation. The human factor has been left behind, which is in contradiction with the recommendations 
evidenced in the literature. Since the creation of value in Industry 4.0 can be reached profitably through the adoption 
of technologies that end up placing human beings at the center of modernization and improvement, the loss of skills 
due to the labor turnover is something to be avoided by companies. Engagement is an employee's emotional state that 
manifests itself with motivation and absorption in the workplace. Currently, the only way to assess workforce 
engagement is by using traditional scales techniques (such as, Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, orGallup Q12 
employee Engagement scale). Therefore, there are no mechanisms in the industrial environment capable of collecting 
data, which, properly treated, can predict employee engagement and help in recognizing when the employee is about 
to leave the company. This paper aims to present a vision about an innovative technological tool that intends to assess 
and, at the same time, to foster workforce engagement, in order to monitor the future possibility of them remaining in 
the company, or leaving.

1. Introduction 
The Industry 4.0 phenomenon brings the so-called intelligent systems that are capable of representing the simple and 
monotonous routines existing in the organization in the form of digitized mass production (Wilkesmann & 
Wilkesmann, 2018). In this way, these systems support the hypothesis of organizing social behavior to reproduce 
routines. On the other hand, cyberphysical systems are capable of reconstructing flexible, innovative, and totally new 
human-machine interactions that will converge in a fluid network of intelligent and innovative forms of cooperation 
and collaboration (Wilkesmann & Wilkesmann, 2018).  
The human factor is currently devalued when it comes to the digital paradigm, since companies, after the emergence 
of Industry 4.0, find themselves at the forefront of digital evolution, forgetting the need to put people at the center of 
this innovation (Salvadorinho & Teixeira, 2021). 
In addition, the globalization of the human force emerges with the technological evolution, therefore, there is a need 
to preserve the organizational knowledge capital and encourage the retention of people (Salvadorinho et al., 2021; 
Salvadorinho & Teixeira, 2021). Work engagement can be considered as a rewarding work-related state of mind, 
represented by an affective-motivational tool, guiding to positive job posture in employees (Gaur, 2020; Kaasinen et 
al., 2020).

Abstract 
 
The Philippines is a developing country in which technological innovations and digital interventions shaped and 
deepened the gap in the need for better healthcare services for Filipinos. The focus of this study is to identify the 
factors in the use of telemedicine that affects the satisfaction level of the Millennial and Generation Z telemedicine 
users in the Philippines. A total of one hundred thirty-eight (138) respondents from Millennials and Generation Z 
individuals in the Philippines answered the survey questionnaire and data were analyzed with the use of multiple 
regression analysis. The Millennials have five (5) factors that contributed to the satisfaction towards telemedicine such 
as usefulness, reliability, salary, ease of use, and employment status. Moreover, Generation Z has four (4) factors such 
as usefulness, interaction, salary, and period of use. According to the findings, Millennials have a score of 33.17 while 
Generation Z has a 35.85 score which corresponds to a strong telemedicine satisfaction. With this result, the study 
recommends to Information and Computer Technology, healthcare practitioners as well as the healthcare industry to 
develop ways to improve telemedicine services to sustain the growing demand to meet the needs of the generational 
gap for better healthcare delivery in the Philippines.

1. Introduction 
Technological advancements and digital interventions in the Philippines have altered and widened the gap in the need 
for better healthcare services for Filipinos. Telemedicine attempts to match the demands of today's healthcare 
customers and has the potential to transform healthcare delivery (Alvandi, 2020). According to El Y (2017), both 
younger and older generations have begun to recognize the advantages of current technological advancements. 
However, in terms of how millennials, Generation Z, and baby boomers interact with healthcare providers, there are 
generational differences (Sanborn, 2018). As telemedicine progresses toward increased functionality and integration 
it is a must to consider the generational spectrum according to Ackerman et al. (2010).  
 
There are numerous definitions of telemedicine. However, both telemedicine and telehealth are synonymous since the 
applications incorporate technological improvements. Telemedicine is described by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) as the delivery of health care services by health care professionals utilizing technology that involves the 
exchange of medical information for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and injuries. Marcelo et al. 
(2016) stated that the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) recognized ICT's potential as a significant tool in 
achieving Kalusugan Pangkalahatan (KP) or Universal Health Care for all Filipinos. In the context of the present 
epidemic, telemedicine is quickly improving, and demand for this service is growing (Kichloo et al., 2020). In the 
year 2020, the telemedicine sector shines during pandemics as it offers Filipinos an alternative source of consolation.

2477",,"5.3 Limitations and Future Research 
 
In this study, the authors note several limitations. First, the respondents of this study consider telemedicine users in 
the metropolitan area only. To produce more reliable information in the future, the study should extend the coverage 
of respondents in a rural area in the Philippines. Second, the study focused only on the two-generational spectrums. 
Future studies can increase their target respondents and are not limited to two generations to get more accurate data 
in terms of telemedicine satisfaction. Third, to bridge the internet connectivity gap, healthcare providers may adopt 
an asynchronous or offline consultation that will improve the usefulness, ease of use, and patient-physician interaction. 
Additionally, the system should include easy access to the information about the credentials of the healthcare 
practitioners. The income bracket of patients could also be considered as generation Z has 3.59 indicating a strong 
satisfaction score belonging to 34.78% that earns below the monthly income of Php 10,000. Moreover, additional 
areas of consultation exclusively for chronic illness can be incorporated to broaden the range of target patients of the 
telemedicine consultations across the country.

Abstract  
 
The outbreak of the long-lasting COVID-19 pandemic has forced several changes, one of which is a change in the 
provision of health services. Health care providers are looking for methods to meet patient needs, one of which is 
through telehealth innovation. Telehealth is an innovation that combines technology and health services so that 
patients do not need to go to the clinic to get health services. Before implementing these innovations, it is necessary 
to know the factors that influence consumers' desire to adopt telehealth innovations in health services. Therefore, this 
study aims to determine the factors influencing consumers' willingness to adopt telehealth service innovations. An 
analytical framework is defined based on the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) to achieve this goal. The method 
used in this study is Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the help of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation 
Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the hypotheses from the analytical framework developed in this study. Factors that 
influence consumer decisions will be used as input in the development of telehealth innovation.

3. Discussion 
Indonesia is currently still facing the COVID-19 outbreak. With the outbreak, innovation in health services was made 
by utilizing ICT, namely by providing electronic transmission of medical services packaged through digital 
communication, namely Telehealth. Since this pandemic, the utilization of Telehealth has continued to increase. 
Telehealth applications that exist in Indonesia today generally only focus on providing health service consultations. 
However, currently, there are very few technology companies in the health sector that focus on providing health 
services as well as home visits. To optimize Telehealth services to increase customer satisfaction, an integrated system 
will be developed to facilitate the provision of health services that can provide facilities in the form of home visits. 
This research is expected to produce a mobile application that can be used as a solution for providing health services 
at home, especially in current conditions to minimize the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The methodology used 
in this study is the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) combined with several hypotheses that have been developed 
by the conceptual framework that has been set. The following are some of the hypotheses developed in conducting 
this research. 
 
H1: Relative Advantage (RE) has a significant positive relationship to Diffusion of Innovation (DOI). 
H2: Compatibility (CB) has a significant positive relationship to Diffusion of Innovation (DOI). 
H3: Complexity (CX) has a significant positive relationship to Diffusion of Innovation (DOI). 
H4: Trialability (TR) has a significant positive relationship to Diffusion of Innovation (DOI). 
H5: Observability (OB) has a significant positive relationship to Diffusion of Innovation (DOI). 
 
4. Conclusion and Future Research 
The research framework, objectives, and respondents have been designed in this study. The assessment and analysis 
of the proposed innovations have been discussed to strengthen the hypotheses. The basic theory used is purely based 
on the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) by the goals and functions of the theory. It is highly recommended to 
continue this research by distributing questionnaires so that the hypothesis can be directly proven. 
 
The results of processing from the questionnaire can be implemented as a benchmark and a description of whether 
telehealth innovation has become the right solution. If the hypothesis is accepted then further research can be combined 
with supporting theories such as The Theory Acceptance Model (TAM). The SEM method is recommended to be 
studied more deeply according to the needs of the case study and can represent the relationship according to real 
conditions.

1. Introduction  
Tracto Partes Diamante de Puebla S.A. de C.V. is a wholesaler, importer, and distributor of spare parts and accessories 
for air brakes and suspension parts. It is made up of a central warehouse in Puebla, Mexico, and two Distribution 
Centers (CEDIS) strategically located, one in the city of M√©rida, Yucat√°n, Mexico, and the second in the city of Tuxtla 
Guti√©rrez, Chiapas, Mexico. It was the direct distributor of the leading original equipment brands and exclusive 
distributors of premium brands. 
 
In today's highly competitive environment, companies have as their primary objective to win a large share of the 
market, increase their sales and supply efficiencies. They must give adequate importance to productivity indicators, 
translated into improvement actions for companies, complying with the established objectives. Today, the processes 
within a warehouse drive companies to be highly competitive. The improvement of these processes can achieve a 
competitive advantage in the market. Companies require much more than a good sales strategy. They must take 
advantage of the improvement and measurement of the processes within the warehouse, making the operation work 
systematically to the market requirements (Salehzadeh et al., 2020). 
 
This case study will focus on establishing the necessary performance indicators within the company to obtain an 
improvement according to its objectives. 
 
Objectives  
One of the company's main goals, Tracto Partes Diamante de Puebla S.A. de C.V., is to have highly efficient processes 
and improve the company's operation. With the implementation of the KPIs the company would seek to control the 
identification, location, regulation, mobility, time, and movement of the goods in the warehouse. Having these 
performance indicators will facilitate decision-making, keeping an organization in the warehouse.

6. Conclusion  
The logistics processes within a warehouse are fundamental aspects to guarantee customer service levels in compliance 
with product requirements, expectations in the quantities to be delivered, and the expected time of order fulfillment.  
With the proposal of the KPI‚Äôs, the company should: 
 
1. Guarantee the efficiency levels of the activities carried out by the company, improving the delivery service 
and productivity resources involved profitability. of the organization 
 
2. Understand the activities of the warehouse management processes.  
 
3. Generate a baseline and identify the functions and design specific indicators for this area, allowing to 
determine the current state and making it possible to compare with future results to obtain precise conclusions 
of the increase or decrease in the efficiency of the company in the storage area, based on actual results 
achieved by the establishment of indicators. 
 
4. Measure the quality, service, costs, and delivery time of the company‚Äôs customers, through the following 
factors: Receive their complete orders, not have a supply with the wrong materials, have a short delivery 
time, quality in the products, by not presenting no failure at the time of use, receive the material in good 
condition, obtain a low or no cost in shipping by parcel and have correct advice from the company's sellers 
to acquire the right products. About this point, for the moment, the company. It does not have a standard 
measurement to define customer satisfaction; the factors above are extracted from feedback from customers 
who experience any of the factors above. It would be essential to work on a survey plan applied to customers 
to know the aspects that can help the company strengthen customer loyalty and return. 
 
In this work, we proposed some indicators in each area of operation that will be very useful for the company and have 
greater effectiveness at the time of the arrival of the supplies to the warehouse. 
 
We conclude that the perfect use of these new tools can help the company Tracto Partes Diamante de Puebla SA de 
CV have greater efficiency in its warehouse and the distribution of its products, improving logistics on a large scale 
inside outside of the company.

Abstract  
 
Because of the environmental impact and price volatility, there has been a growing concern on the use of 
petroleumbased lubricants. This issue has stimulated research into the development of biodegradable lubricants like 
vegetable oils. In this study, the tribological and rheological behavior of sunflower, peanut, and corn oils modified 
with montmorillonite nanoclay (MMT) as lubricant additives were evaluated at various concentrations. A custom-
made block on ring tribotester was used to evaluate the wear and friction characteristics of the nano-lubricants, 
following the ASTM G-077-05 standard. The effects of concentration and shear rate on shear viscosity were studied 
using a parallel plate rheometer, and the experimental data was compared with conventional models. Analytical 
methods, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis 
(TGA), and profilometry, were used to characterize the morphology and structure of the MMT nanoclay, as well as 
the worn surfaces. The experimental results showed that the volumetric wear and coefficient of friction decreased with 
the addition of MMT nanoparticles, at different concentrations, compared to the base vegetable oils. In conclusion, 
the newly developed vegetable oil-based nano-lubricants with the addition of MMT nanoclay, look like a promising 
environmentally friendly solution to compete with petroleum-based lubricants.

Abstract  
Vegetable oil-based nano-lubricants are a great alternative to petroleum-based lubricants due to their less adverse 
impact on the environment. This work evaluated the tribological performance of sunflower, corn, and peanut oils with 
the addition of Halloysite Nanotubes (HNT) as lubricant additives at different concentrations. Vegetable oils are 
commercially used as edible oils, but in this current work they were selected as base oils for the nano-lubricants due 
to their renewability and biodegradability. To analyze the tribology performance of the nano-lubricants, a block-onring 
tribometer was used following the ASTM G-077-05 standard procedure. In addition, tapping torque tests were carried 
out following the ASTM D5619 standard. Results indicated that sunflower, corn, and peanut oils mixed with HNT at 
1.5 wt% provided the best tribological performance. The wear volume loss was lowered by 29%, 78%, and 67% for 
sunflower, corn, and peanut oil respectively, with the addition of 1.5 wt%, compared to its base oil. Tapping torque 
test results also provided high tapping torque efficiency that can prolong tool life in machining processes. Based on 
the experimental results, it can be concluded that the vegetable oils modified with the addition of halloysite nanoclay 
have the potential to be used as biodegradable lubricants.

Abstract  
 
The global pandemic has taken its toll in all aspects of life, economies were destabilized and shaking all the industries 
to their limits. Aside from implementing strict quarantine protocols, contact tracing is one of the major solutions in 
preventing the spread of viruses. However, the citizens are using different contact tracing applications which causes 
challenges including the incomplete contact identification, delays in identification and isolation of cases, updates from 
Local Government Units (LGUs), and data management. 
 
This study aims to utilize the use of technology through a digital application that stores personal data of the citizens 
in Valenzuela City to increase responsiveness, maximize data processing, real-time identification of individuals, and 
to cater inclusivity to maintain the safety in the vicinity. The research will be significant to Filipino citizens residing 
in Valenzuela, the LGUs, the establishments in the city and the future researchers who will be carrying out similar 
studies.  
 
The researchers conducted preliminary data collection through survey questionnaires in the city of interest for initial 
assumptions and customer journey mapping. From these results, the researchers will then conduct surveys and 
interviews by utilizing the online platform as the mode of data collection. To protect our respondents' safety, the 
researchers will exercise the provisions of the Data Privacy Act of 2012, and the researchers will utilize other issuances

2509","6. Conclusion 
In this first phase of Design Thinking, the researchers were able to define seven personas based on identifying the user 
challenges of Project X, namely: Lucy, Cecil, Gabriela, Grace, Bertha, Leonard, and Chico. Their pain points in using 
the said project were divided into three main categories: Accessibility, Registration, and Scanning. Lucy, Cecil, 
Gabriela, Grace, and Chico are having difficulties in the accessibility of Project X for reasons such as lack of internet 
connectivity, not all citizens of the Valenzuela are tech-savvy, difficulty in finding the web address for Project X, and 
hassle in accessing QR code. Cecil, Gabriela, Grace, and Bertha were struggling in registering for Project X because 
the website's text is difficult to read, and the password complexity requirement. Lastly, Lucy, Cecil, and Grace are 
having trouble with scanning the QR codes because of repetitive scanning due to unresponsiveness of the equipment, 
possible loss of QR code that may lead to identity theft, and forgetfulness in bringing the QR code. 
 
Furthermore, some concerns outside these main categories are repetitive filling out of health declaration forms in 
every establishment, time delays/bugs in saving QR codes, and time delays in filling out health declaration forms. 
Indeed, the researchers‚Äô objectives were met. The results from the Empathy and Define stages (User-Focused Phase) 
will be used to ideate solutions, to design, and to test the prototype.

Abstract 
COVID-19 vaccines are being developed by a number of research and development teams across the world, 
but the distribution of the vaccines to different cities in the Philippines became a common problem. This research aims 
to determine the different factors in the vaccination rates. This study focuses on the queuing system to improve the 
service of vaccination in Quezon City that had been observed within a parameter of arrival time, waiting time in queue 
and time of service of the vaccine. The researchers gathered data through direct time study. Using a watch and timer, 
the data was collected from each procedure. For a duration of 1 hour, all the information is manually recorded for the 
three factors of this study. The Data using M/M/1 Queuing Model resulted in the slowest Average Time in the System 
is Step 4, Monitoring. For the Average Waiting Time, Step 1 has the slowest time. For the Average Service Time, 
Step 4 is the slowest system. For the Probability of No Person in the system, Step 1 and 3 has the highest percentage 
and for the Probability of Busy Server, Step 2 and 4 denotes the highest percentage.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Study 
The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown children's and their families' lives into disarray all around the world.  According 
to Professor Jos√© Manuel Barroso, Gavi Board Chair (2021), nobody is safe until everybody is safe in the midst of a 
Pandemic. So, right from the start of this worldwide disaster, it was evident that each individual doesn‚Äôt only need 
vaccines, but that everyone requires a lot of them. Much more than producers and distribution systems had been able 
to produce and distribute to individuals prior to the epidemic. The enormous and urgent issue of satisfying this 
worldwide demand has generated vast ethical and legal dilemmas that every individual must resolve not only to stop 
this outbreak, but also to guarantee that every person is better prepared for the next. COVID-19 vaccines are being 
developed by a number of research and development teams across the world, but the distribution of the vaccines to 
different cities in the Philippines became a common problem that led the citizens to high risk of exposure in crowded 
areas and disordering Social Distancing and Safety Protocols, due to following the guidelines in the vaccination area 
at first, then filling up registration forms for contact tracing, then staying in line and waiting for their turn, and other 
centers interviews their registrants. This one common problem could use Queuing Theory to improve the service of 
vaccination. 
Queuing theory is a mathematical study of queueing systems or waiting lines and how lines are formed-- how they 
operate and malfunction. It is a model that is built in order to anticipate queue lengths and waiting periods. The 
congestion and factors in a process are utilized to generate more improved and cost-efficient systems and services. 
Queuing Theory is mostly used in a wide range of business and operation management in order to enhance total 
customer service shortfalls, assess and optimize business objectives, scheduling, and inventory.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the results and discussion, different factors are considered in determining which queue line is the slowest: 
service time, departure time, waiting time, and total time in the system. In terms of service time, step 4 (monitoring) 
is the slowest with 13 minutes and the fastest is the first step (form filling) with resulting in 2.47 minutes. In terms of 
waiting time, Step 1 has the longest time recorded with 16.80 minutes and the shortest having 7.91 minutes is in the 
third step (actual vaccination). In terms of the longest time in the system, Step 4 has the longest time with 13.54 
minutes and the shortest is in the first step having 2.50 minutes. For the Probability of No Person in the system, Step 
1 and 3 has the highest percentage and for the Probability of Busy Server, Step 2 and 4 denotes the highest percentage. 
Overall, the people spent the longest time in Steps 1 and 4, vaccination form filling and monitoring. The health 
screening and actual vaccination process have a shorter average time spent in terms of all the factors. This therefore 
concludes that the queuing system in these 2 processes were operated faster than in vaccination form filling and 
monitoring where people have spent more time in the process.

Abstract  
 
The mung bean (Vigna radiata) or ‚Äúmunggo‚Äù is a tiny, high nutrient, green bean from the legume family that is 
frequently consumed as a crispy sprout known as mung bean sprouts or ‚Äútoge‚Äù in the Philippines. It is used in a variety 
of different meals. Furthermore, Mung bean germination is a straightforward procedure and can be done in soil or 
water and generally germinates in four to five days. Since there is demand for mung bean sprouts and large production 
is quite inappropriate for low-volume consumers and the current pandemic situation, an experimental analysis was 
conducted to know the right factors to consider in producing high quality yield of mung bean sprouts (in terms of 
length) in a home-based set up (non-soil). Through 2k Factorial Design of Experiment, 16 runs were involved having 
3 factors which are the soaking time (A), rinse interval (B) and light exposure (C), and 2 replicates. Moreover, it was 
found that single factors A and C significantly affects the length of sprout with an inverse proportional relationship. 
Light exposure had the highest effect contribution value at 82.4%. All 2FI and 3FI were insignificant thus, soaking 
time and light exposure impact were generalized to the response.

1. Introduction  
The mung bean (Vigna radiata), alternatively known as monggo or munggo in the Philippines, is a small, green bean 
that belong to the legume family and commonly consumed and grown as a sprout called mung bean sprouts. Mung 
bean sprouts, known as toge in the Philippines, are edible with crisp and crunchy texture type of culinary vegetable 
that usually linked with salads and sandwiches. It is also integrated to other dishes such as spring rolls, vegetable egg 
rolls, sauteed bean sprouts and many more. Moreover, these sprouted beans are high in nutrients, rich in vitamins and 
minerals such as proteins and antioxidants and believed to aid many ailments. Other nutritionists recommend include 
these sprouts in diet meals since they are low in calories and high in various vitamins. Lastly, the demand for mung 
bean sprouts is not only directly related to population increase, but also to an increasing number of individuals who 
are enthusiastic about using mung bean sprouts as an alternative, side dish, or main dish in respective meals and 
offered in some restaurants in the country (Bual, Cunanan, Bedruz, Billones, & Vicerra, 2019).  
 
With this progressive demand, mung bean sprout cultivation is a good motivation. They can be grown both indoors at 
home and outside planted out in the garden. They may be cultivated by planting sprouting beans in the shade and 
watering them until the hypocotyls grow tall. Furthermore, they're quite simple to grow; one way to grow the is through

The coefficients indicates that high levels of A (soaking time in hours) and C (light exposure per day in hours) will 
yield to a shorter sprout of mung beans. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study concluded that light exposure (Factor C) is a significant factor and gravely affects the growth of mung 
beans. It also concluded that soaking duration (Factor A) is also significant to yield a longer and quality sprouts. 
Furthermore, the study also showed that the relationship of these factors to the response variable (length of sprout) is 
inversely proportional in a sense of having a negative coefficient in the model. Thus, this implies that when a consumer 
plans to do a home-based set-up (non-soil) of production of mung bean sprout, high levels of soaking time and light 
exposure should be critically controlled because increasing the amount or duration of these factors will result to a 
shorter mung bean sprout.

2541","The study also found that rinse interval will not affect the growth, and interaction among the three factors did not 
prevail. Furthermore, no 2FI and 3FI were considered significant thus the impact of single factor A and C to response 
Y is generalized and treated individually.  
In terms of the analysis, the researcher came to an end that by merely observing the Half Normal Plot, it will not 
quantifiably justify the determination of significant factors. It is best to analyze the ANOVA report since there might 
be a masking effect which makes the significant factor close to being insignificant.

Introduction 
The aviation industry is one industry that is very much needed and important in this era because many 
people use planes as their transportation to be able to travel when traveling, business trips, etc (Banuara & Purba, 
2018). By using a plane as transportation, of course, it will save more time than using other transportation such as 
boats or cars. Although it is usually more expensive to travel by plane, many people still choose it because it is fast 
and convenient. Now, many technologies have been developed that have supported the aviation industry as well, 
such as booking flight tickets online without having to come, so many people choose this option because it is more 
practical. 
In today's technological era, technological developments greatly affect changes in aspects of human life 
starting from lifestyle, social life, work, etc (Prahiawan et al., 2021) (Simbolon et al., 2020). The development of 
technology that most influences human life by using the internet in their day to day activities (J. T. Purba, Budiono, 
et al., 2020). The internet can be used by all people to be able to search for information, as well as carry out 
unlimited transactions (Panday & Purba, 2015) (Tan et al., 2019). The information you want to find can be found

Abstract 
 
A number of economists argued that corruption can have a positive effect through parallel and negative economic 
flow creation. As the results, corruption is needed as the wheel‚Äôs grease for the economy. They saw that corruption as 
an economic and social positive instrument and redistributive instrument. On the other hand, there is a big consensus 
in the literature about the impacts of corruption on economic growth. The corruption impact on economic growth 
occurs in specific context and is associated with many factors, such as the law apparatus and institutional framework, 
the quality of government, and political regime. In a number of countries that have no effective government institution 
and system, corruption can be a compensation tool for government barrier and institutional weakness. This study was 
aimed to examine the factors of corruption. The data used in the study were from the World Bank covering 126 
countries with different years with the number which was not always the same. The data were analyzed using the 
multiple regression model. The dependent variable was the bribery incidence (percentage of firms experiencing at 
least one bribe payment request). The independent variables were annual GDP growth (%), individuals using the 
Internet (percentage of population), and informal payments to public officials (percentage of firms). The results of the 
study show that higher bribery incidence was associated with higher economic growth, lower internet use, and higher 
informal payments to public officials.

Abstract  
Many of the supermarket was forced to close their services because of the damages that COVID-19 brought hence 
some of the supermarket continue to operate by extending their market reach through providing online 
services. However, since restrictions and health protocols must be achieved, effectiveness of each strategy in 
promoting health safety during the pandemic is still in question. Hence, the study aims to determine the optimal 
strategy suited for supermarkets based on the criterion that customers prioritize during the Pandemic. The 
study used decision analysis to help the researchers to give innovative ideas and plans of action. The result of the study 
shows that the overall performance of actual shopping is better compared to online services and third-
party strategies based on the provided criterion.

1. Introduction  
In 2019 the coronavirus first appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China (Altman & Levkovich, 2020). This 
virus was produced by the new strain of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak of coronavirus rapidly spread 
around the world, resulting in a global health crisis of epic proportions. With this, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) declared COVID-19 as a worldwide pandemic. Governments from different countries implemented protocols 
such as lockdown, social isolation, wearing of face masks and face shields, and getting vaccinated to prevent the 
spread of the coronavirus. Due to the official‚Äôs safety standards, the business industry was severely impacted. The 
global economy slowed because of the delayed production, sales, and interchange of products around the world.   
 
Furthermore, many supermarkets, small firms, and enterprises were forced to close their services. Hence, grocery 
stores and some supermarkets continued to operate to meet people‚Äôs necessities, resulting in consistent daily earnings. 
Due to COVID-19 regulations, only a certain number of individuals are permitted to enter grocery stores at any given 
time. As a result, people are queuing, which leads them to be in the same place for an extended amount of time, which 
is deemed unsafe. Therefore, even if the enterprises are open for business, it is impossible to deny that sales and service 
have been affected because there is a sudden demand for a certain type of products together with the reduction of 
customers due to the implemented quarantine, resulting in unstable revenue.   
 
Most of the conducted studies are evaluating each alternative individually and stating its pros and cons. For instance, 
a study by Bentsen and Pauli (2017), was comparing a self-service service and human interaction based on service 
encounters. The study helps distinguish the difference between the two alternatives. However, it does not state whether

percentage it is because all its criterion has high rating score compared to online services and third-party. For the 
overall performance, the actual shopping performed the best among the three strategies presented.  
 
6. Proposed Improvements 
As recommendation, the researchers suggest that supermarkets shall continue to improve their online platforms that 
will enhance customer experience and expand the reach of this service nationwide. In addition, for the future 
researchers of this study, increase the sample size and make sure to have an equal number of respondents to perform 
decision analysis with posterior probabilities. As well as improve the developed survey questionnaires in detailed like 
add a question where the respondents can provide additional comments.  
7. Conclusion   
The use of traditional grocery shopping which in the Philippines were still the viable option to be based on the optimal 
policy generated by the decision analysis performed together with the support of the Expert Choice tool. Based on the 
data that we have gathered most of the respondents still choose the actual shopping strategy when it comes in buying 
their grocery items in the supermarket based on the different criterion that was provided. For the overall performance, 
the actual shopping still performed the best among the three strategies that was provided. The performance of online 
and third party was still comparable to the actual shopping, however due to majority of the respondents was not able 
to experience the use of this new strategies of the supermarket. The probable reason for not experiencing these 
strategies is due to the constraints of the strategy since these services were only being offered within location of Metro 
Manila and near neighboring cities. In addition, traditional shopping has solidified its service in the country long 
before the two new strategies were being offered, hence the respondents would still prefer face-to-face shopping than 
the two strategies because this gives faster access to all products being offered by the store.

Abstract 
 
In the field of education, student learning progression is structured as a hierarchical organization, wherein lower grade 
levels are set to proceed to higher levels as their knowledge advances. However, their progression is stochastic in 
nature due to various reasons such as difficulty and number of units of courses. With this, the present study aims to 
develop a Markov Model to examine the flow of Industrial engineering students in a quarter system. The data used in 
this research were the enrolled subjects of Industrial engineering students of admission batch 2019 from the first term 
of their first year up to the third term of the second year, as well as their marks for the said courses. This scenario was 
modeled as an Absorbing Markov Chain. In the analysis, it was determined that if a student starts his first term in the 
university, it is expected that he spends an average of 15.5574 terms in the span of the seven terms. Also, if a student 
starts his first term, there is 29.40% chance that he withdraws and 70.59% that he proceeds. If he starts in the second 
term, there is 24.99% chance of withdrawing and 75.00% chance of progressing. For the remaining states, the chance 
of eventually reaching the fourth term of the second year is 100%. Lastly, based on their responses, their failure in 
courses was mostly due to problems like learning environment and lack of motivation, while they take lesser courses 
per term due to difficulties in handling multiple courses.

1. Introduction  
1.1 Background 
In the field of education, student learning progression is organized by educational levels depending on the student's 
intellectual capabilities. Learning institutions are structured as a hierarchical organization, wherein lower grade levels 
are set to proceed to higher levels as their knowledge continues to advance (Brezavscek et al., 2017). As such, 
universities set that they evaluate the chance that one student would stay at a given level, move up to another level, 
drop out, or graduate. This process allows differentiation among learners and would allow them to have and be given 
the knowledge for them accordingly. However, due to several reasons, the chance of progressing from one level to 
another, up to the chances of graduating, is uncertain and could be random (Corner, 1993); for instance, Alawadhi and 
Konsova (2010) stated that college students stay longer in their courses due to the difficulty and the large credit unit 
in their programs. Also, other factors such as changes in the learning environment could influence student progress 
(Crossen, 2017). Because these reasons are inevitable and uncontrollable, having no strategic plans with regards to 
the educational system results in many delayed and dismissed students. (Adam, 2015). Hence, it is important for 
institutions to study and assess their student‚Äôs progress.  
 
Student learning progression is indeed uncertain due to various reasons (Corner, 1993). Especially for undergraduates, 
the possibilities of progressing from one level to another, up to the chances of graduating, are more prone to be erratic 
due to the increased difficulty and number of credit units compared to the preceding levels (Alawadhi and Konsova, 
2010). Due to this, the behavior of the situation could be characterized as stochastic, whereas the chances of 
progressing and graduating has a random distribution.

2579","Given this scenario, the present study had also looked into the problems encountered by the students which results in 
either failure or underload of the students. The following table shows the specified problems that each student faces 
in undertaking courses on a quarter term basis. The gathered data represents various reasons why students fail in a 
certain term and cause a delay in taking the next courses, as the subjects have a pre-requisite system. This data was 
obtained in the questions included in the survey deployed by the researchers. Overall, there were 40 respondents from 
the School of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, and this specific part of the survey had allowed 
multiple responses.

Table 5 shows the reasons for the respondent failure in the subjects, it is depicted that majority of the students 
encounter Problems with learning environments, difficulties in handling multiple courses, and lack of motivation and 
commitment to study, having the same percentages of 52.50% each. Next is having problems with time management 
having 42.50%, then health problems obtaining 15%, and for the open-ended statement, one of the respondents 
answered that students are not encouraged by the professors ‚Äì having a percentage of 2.50%. These reasons can be a 
factor which affects the student performance and productivity, and these results in a poor standing and failure in 
subjects. This then causes delays in the student‚Äôs curriculum. To support the statement according to Raychaudhuri et 
al., (2010), numerous studies have been done to identify those who have shown factors that are affecting student‚Äôs 
academic performance. The student's academic performance depends on several socio-economic factors like students‚Äô 
attendance in the class, learning environment, family income, mother‚Äôs and father‚Äôs education, teacher-student ratio, 
presence of a trained teacher in school, sex of the student, commitment of learners, and the time management.

On the other hand, Table 6 shows the reasons of the respondents for not taking full load with their courses. The results 
showed that a lot of the respondents were having difficulties in handling multiple courses which is why they tend to 
lessen their course load, this can be a factor for them to be delayed since they aren‚Äôt taking the recommended course 
load for the specific term. Problems with time management became the second highest reason. While health problems, 
financial problem, and hard to indulge all lessons together had the least response among the respondents. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In essence, the goal of the study which is to develop Markov Model to examine the flow of college students based on 
their performance on a quarter system was successfully accomplished. Firstly, the researchers have determined the 
average number of terms of the students under the School of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management 
have stayed in a term: if a student starts his first year first term in the university, it is expected that he spends 1.1765 
terms for first year first term, 4.4706 terms for first year second term, 4.2353 terms for first year third term, 1.5882 
terms for first year fourth term, 1.3375 terms for second year first term, 1.3375 terms for second year second term,

2585","and 1.4118 terms for second year third term. Over the course of seven terms, the average student's projected length is 
about 15.5574 terms.  
 
Second, in determining the probability of a student being absorbed by either of the two absorbing states, it was shown 
that if a student starts in S1, there is a 29.40% chance that he withdraws and 70.59% that he proceeds. If he starts in 
S2, there is a 24.99% chance of withdrawing and a 75.00% chance of progressing. For the remaining states, the chances 
of eventually passing and transitioning to the fourth term of the second year are 100%.  
 
Lastly, the researchers had determined the factors and variables that affect the progression of the students. The failure 
of students was mostly due to problems with learning environments, difficulties in handling multiple courses, and lack 
of motivation and commitment to study. Some students also tend to take lesser courses per term mainly due to 
difficulties in handling multiple courses.  
 
With that being said, transitioning from the starting level to the next level would be difficult for college students as 
the level of difficulty of courses may vary over time. Nevertheless, schools/universities should create an optimal plan 
to assist the students to progress accordingly, as the institution will be no worth without its student as the students are 
the most essential asset for any educational institution to survive.  
 
Based on the methodology applied in this study, it is recommended for future researchers to use this in analyzing a 
wider scope of student population. For instance, in studying the whole population of college students in a given 
program. It is also recommended that the future researchers also take into consideration other variables such as the 
inactive or on leave status of students.

Abstract 
 
Risk is often described as an event, a change in circumstances or a consequence. Risk can be addressed and can even 
be eliminated through risk management. In this study will be done identification of the cause of delay in raw materials 
until on time in the manufacturing company. During these 2 years the company faced the problem of providing raw 
materials that are often late, which is a barrier for companies to produce in a timely manner to meet consumer demand, 
because this problem the company suffered losses, so it is necessary to know the factors that cause delays in the supply 
of raw materials. The method used in this study is HOR (HOR I, HOR II) by identifying risk events and risk agents. 
After identification with HOR I risk agent that causes the onset of insulation due to late transportation, delays in 
procurement of raw materials, dependence on the parent company. To mitigate the risk agent is prepared mitigation 
strategy (HOR II) that is, making a work contract with the supplier who comes from the parent company to 
communicate directly with the supplier, procure raw materials 2 weeks - 2 months before needed.

Based on the data processing that has been done before, namely the results of data processing using HOR II, 
the mitigation design analysis that will be carried out on the company is: 
1. 
Order raw materials long before raw materials are needed (2 months before materials are needed). 
 
During this time the company is often late to receive raw materials from suppliers, resulting in a 
production schedule retreat and unable to meet customer demand appropriately, and this is very detrimental. 
To overcome this, the way to order raw materials is 2 weeks - 2 months before the proper booking schedule. 
To be able to realize this mitigation action, it takes the coordinator to bear the procedures for implementing this 
mitigation action, namely the head of logistics / logistics manager in the company. 
2. 
Multiple route 
 
The company's main raw material supplier is the existing holding company in Bogor and the company 
supplies almost 80% of the raw materials from the parent company by sea, and this adds to the long time raw 
materials arrive at the company, especially for chemical raw materials for the manufacture of foams that are 
compressed by the center from abroad (Germany, Japan) for it is needed a more efficient and fast alternative 
path,  Such as relying on air lines that are expected to be able to reduce the waiting time of raw materials to 
arrive at the company. Create a work contract with the supplier who comes from the parent company in order 
to communicate directly with the supplier. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Experiencing several problems in running its business, one of these problems is the provision of raw materials 
that are experiencing delays, this problem experienced by the company for the last 2 years and becomes a barrier 
for the company to produce products in a timely manner to meet consumer demand. Based on the results shown 
data processing and analysis of discussions that have been done before providing some conclusions as follows: 
1. By using the SCOR model in mapping supply chain activities there are 24 risk events and 16 causes of risk 
(risk agent) identified during the company's business activities, as well as causing losses. 
2. The results of calculations using the House of Risk found 6 risk factors (risk agents) that resulted in late 
reaching the factory, which are meant by these factors are: 
a. The arrival of the ship is not on time. 
b. Delay in raw material order schedule 
c. The complexity of port bureaucracy 
d. Dependence on the parent company 
e. Error of delivery of the amount of material by the supplier 
f. Low sense of responsibility in employees towards their work

1. Introduction  
In the last decade, the development of internet usage in Indonesia has progressed rapidly. In the past year, nline 
activity has increased due to the government's stay-at-home recommendations, and various activities are required 
online which results in higher levels of online consumption (Koesno, 2020). The use of the internet for digital 
activities is what encourages the creation of a social commerce environment or online social networks to assisted in 
the purchase and sale of goods and services that become technological advances in the digitalization era. All online 
purchasing and selling activities of goods and services are included in E-Commerce activities. According to Kalakota

2602","quality of service and engagement based on the Entertainment, Interaction and Intimacy factors in gamification, 
the higher the tendency of users to achieve a loyal level.  
 
Customer satisfaction is the level of consumer feeling after comparing between what is received and the 
expectation, if a customer is satisfied with the value of a product or service, they will likely be a customer for a 
long time (Kotler &Keller, 2008). The 77,8% assessment indicates that respondents' chances of achieving a loyal 
level are quite effective and through gamification can make it easier for Shopee to develop its Customer 
Relationship Management program. 
 
From the respondent's assessment of this study, after using Shopee games, about 71 out of 100 respondents were 
interested in reusing Shopee games in online shopping activities (Interested in apps), about 66 out of 100 
respondents claimed to be interested in offering Shopee games and Shopee games to friends, family and others 
(Shared to others), and 68 out of 100 respondents expressed an interest in continuing to play Shopee games and 
using Shopee as a marketplace number option  one in online shopping (Commited users). Based on the 
observations, researchers think these results are in accordance with the conditions in the field, where the form of 
loyalty to users will increase when users have a sense of customer satisfaction that is met and in accordance with 
each individual's expectations for the ease and uniqueness of Shopee games that are part of Shopee. Users need to 
use Shopee games repeatedly in order to gain experiences that lead to behavior changes that lead to loyalty. 
 
4.1 Validation  
Validity tests are used to measure the validity or validity of a questionnaire. Validity testing is a process to prove 
that the instrument, technique or process used in measuring a concept actually measures the validity of a question 
item from a questionnaire. Steps in the validity test:

Abstract 
 
This study aims to identify risks that arise in the procurement and warehouse departments, determine the factors that 
contribute to the emergence of risks, obtain the right approach in managing risk as to the scope of the company's 
Supply Chain Management. This research was carried out in a manufacturing company; the data was obtained and 
analyzed using the FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) method. This method is effective because it can provide 
a comprehensive picture of the process of risk arising in the supply chain. The approach used in managing risk will 
follow the Australian/New Zealand Risk Management Standard SA/NZS 4360:1999. The results showed that it is 
obtained that events that can become risks have a tremendous impact on company activities, especially the 
procurement and warehouse departments if they do not get attention in the management process. The risks that arise 
are strategic, technical, and operational and can be managed by treating Mitigate Risk, Transfer Risk, Avoid Risk, and 
Retain Risk with a Supply chain Risk Management approach.

1. Introduction 
The global industrial environment has undergone a very drastic change. Several companies in their development face 
various complex problems, requiring industry managers to calculate carefully in every decision making. To manage 
the industry carefully and flexibly, which can contribute to the sustainability of an industry company. Practitioners

Figure 2 determine of safety stock 
The value of the safety stock depends on the uncertainty of supply and demand. In typical situations, demand 
uncertainty is usually represented by the standard deviation of demand per period. If demand per period and lead time 
are constant, safety stock is not required because demand during the lead time has zero standard deviation. The value 
of the standard deviation of the demand is calculated by the value of the variance, where the value of the variance is 
the mean of the difference squared or the square of the deviation of all data values to the calculated mean. The variance 
for the sample is denoted S. The formula for the variance is: 
 
ùëÜùëÜ= ‚àë
(ùëãùëã‚àíùëãùëãùëõùëõ)2
ùëõùëõ‚àí1          ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..............................(2)
 
 
The variance is directly related to the standard deviation. Where the standard deviation is the square root of the 
variance. The standard deviation is often called the standard deviation. Thus, the standard deviation formula is: 
_ 
Œ£ = 
Œ£(X ‚àí X)2 
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.............................(3) 
n ‚àí1 
_ 
However, we can determine the standard deviation value for determining safety stock with the help of SPSS software. 
Thus, to calculate the value of safety stock can be done by knowing the average demand (x) and the standard deviation 
of demand (ÔÇµ) with the formula: 
SS = X ‚àí ‚àû 
............................(4) 
 
For the allowable stock out value = 5% (in other words, service level = 95%) the normal curve approach is used then: 
Z =ùëãùëã‚àíùõºùõº
‚àëùëõùëõ  , where Z= 1,645               ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.....(5)

Abstract 
 
E-procurement in the organization will help the procurement process be more efficient and effective. In the 
development of e-procurement, there can be several risks. Therefore, risk analysis is needed in the e-procurement 
planning process to overcome these risks. The identified risks are ranked using the FMEA method by filling out a 
questionnaire by the respondents. Based on the results of risk analysis using FMEA, three high risks were found. The 
risk is that the user does not receive a notification if the procurement request is successfully made. The procurement 
report cannot be uploaded, and the procurement request cannot be continued. From this analysis, mitigation 
recommendations can be made to reduce or eliminate risk so that the e-procurement made is more stable to changes 
and can cover the entire procurement process.

1. Introduction 
Supply chain management is the management of the flow of goods and services and includes all processes that 
transform raw materials into final products. It involves the active streamlining of a business's supply-side activities to 
maximize customer value and gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Procurement is the process of finding 
and agreeing to terms, and acquiring goods, services, or works from an external source, often via a tendering or 
competitive bidding process.

2623","The basic rule in minimizing supplier risk is to avoid supplier strategies that depend on only one location or from 
one company (Leiss and Krewski, 2019). It's not just about reducing supplier dependency. As in the current 
situation where many companies only cooperate with Chinese companies or manufacturers without evaluating 
upstream sources to reduce the risk of disruption. These disturbances can be in the form of internal and external 
factors, but the most obvious is the celebration of the Lunar New Year which results in many producers / 
companies not being able to carry out production properly when outside the festive month. 
 
Currently, there is a shift in production trends from companies in China to companies in Southeast Asia, India or 
Mexico, where this is often referred to as 'China + 1' or 'China + 2‚Äô. This strategy requires the company to re-
evaluate the distribution network to ensure the alignment of needs and agreed production processes (Ntwali et 
all., 2020). In other words, a regional approach is very important to reduce costs related to distribution, duration, 
and production limitations due to other factors, because a regional approach uses goods sourced around the 
country's territory to supply demand in the same region. An example of an E-Commerce company that takes a 
regional approach is Shopee, where this company, although based in Singapore (Birungi and Muthoni, 2021). 
 
‚Ä¢ 
'Port Diversification' Strategy 
Although some parties consider that it is more efficient and effective to import only through one particular the 
level of associated risk is also higher. This is due to the nature of distribution dependence, which is crucial in the 
order fulfillment process, especially when there are disturbances that can hinder distribution. For this reason, the 
company's supply chain strategy must also consider this avoid dependence on one port in a regional or global 
region. 
 
 
 
‚Ä¢ 
‚ÄúJust in Case‚Äù and ‚ÄúJust in Time‚Äù Inventory Management 
Companies are advised to maintain additional inventory for critical items, such as single-sourced spare parts or 
raw materials, or items with long and variable delivery times. Given the current situation where interest rates are 
low, the cost of capital element in inventory holding costs is also low, creating a buffer on regional inventories of 
essential goods such as raw materials or finished goods at alternative distribution locations. This allows for 
continuity of supply to the customer in the event of an emergency (Larkin et all., 2019). 
 
‚Ä¢ 
Selection of Multimodal Transportation 
Companies should consider investing in distribution solutions closer to hubs, which include intermodal rail 
terminals or multimodal hubs (e.g., highways, rail and sea lanes) to reduce the risk of stringent trucking capacity 
regulations or ever-increasing shipping costs. increase. 
 
‚Ä¢ 
Evaluation of Relationships Between Parties Involved in the Supply Chain 
Building a robust quality supply chain involves different trade-offs as actions to reduce risks that can impact 
costs, efficient and customer service. Therefore, companies must evaluate the supply chain network regularly to 
ensure solutions that are effective in service, as well as cost efficiency, especially in situations of overlapping due 
to downtime at a supplier source or distribution center. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Retaining a skilled workforce has become the biggest challenge for companies, due to the demands of technological 
developments and labor competition which are mostly driven by e-commerce. In this pandemic era, rising 
unemployment can reduce the pressure on labor needs in the short term. However, many companies are reducing costs 
related to their automation investment, resulting in less exploration of opportunities to improve supply chain 
efficiency. The solution starts from the upstream of a supply chain process, starting from company procurement that 
can be simplified and clearly measured. Presence Digital Procurement provides convenience for company 
procurement actors to reduce supplier risk, as well as facilitate the search for goods. In addition, there is also a digital 
approval process to speed up and facilitate procurement approvals, as well as limiting company spending quotas to 
match the initial procurement strategy and increase transparency.

Abstract 
 
PT KAI is a company that provides mass transportation services, which must carry out maintenance to maintain the 
performance of its fleet. The company has implemented a preventive maintenance pattern, but it is not optimal and is 
still reactive. This study discusses the analysis of the application of these patterns on the Electric Rail Train and 
designing the information system. The research uses quantitative methods by performing calculations using historical 
damage data, damage intervals, and data on repairs or maintenance carried out in the January-December period 2020 
and the business processes that occur during maintenance. From these data, calculations were made to find KRL and 
critical components, the value of availability, reliability, and downtime of each component. The analysis is carried out 
using the data from the calculation and then analyzing each critical component from a technical point of view. The 
result of the discussion is that Preventive Maintenance can increase the availability and reliability of the 8000 Series 
KRL components, namely carbon brush, brake pad shoe and SIV, but there is also an increase in downtime.

1. Introduction 
The history of the railways in Indonesia began built during the government of the Governor-General of the Dutch East 
Indies, Mr LAJ Baron Slot van de Beele dated June 17, 1864. Construction of the state railway line through 
Staatssporwegen (SS), covering the route Surabaya-Pasuruan-Malang. This success has encouraged private investors 
to build the Semarang Joana Stoomtram Maatschappij (SJS), Cheribon, Pasoeroean, Kediri, Probolinggo, Modjokerto, 
Malang, and Deli railways. Until the end of 1928, the length of railroads in Indonesia reached 7,464 km, with 
government-owned rails being 4,089 km and private railways being 3,375 km.

2630","Availability and Reliability 
Availability or level of availability is the probability that a component can work or function properly at a given time 
if operated under normal operating conditions. Below are the results of the availability calculation for each component. 
From the calculation of the availability level that has been done; several things can be identified that affect the value. 
Things that affect is the standard time of inspection and replacement of each component set by the company. The 
higher the standard replacement time applied by the company, the greater the level of availability of these components. 
Meanwhile, in the table 7 the smaller the inspection standard time applied by the company, the higher the availability 
level of the component will be.

Reliability is an opportunity for a system or, in this case, KRL components to function normally within a certain period 
during the period of use. The best level of reliability is 1 or 100%, so if the level of reliability is close to that number, 
the system or component will work optimally within a certain period. 
 
In the table below, the level of reliability that exists in the current condition of the company is in column (R(t)), while 
for conditions after preventive maintenance is applied, it is in column (Rm(t)). Calculation of the level of reliability 
of each component is different, adjusted to a predetermined distribution.  It is due to the different parameters and 
calculation methods of each distribution. Table 8 below is the data from the reliability calculations that have been 
carried out for each component.

With the increase in the reliability of these components, it is expected that the service life of the machine, especially 
these components, will be longer. In addition, it is also expected that the intensity of the damage unexpectedly can be 
reduced to a minimum level. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the discussion and analysis that has been done in the previous chapter, several conclusions can be drawn 
relating to the implementation of Preventive Maintenance on KRL, including: 
1. The critical type of KRL is the 8000 Series because it has a breakdown rate of 72 times and downtime of 69.08 
hours, which is the highest among other types of trains. 
2. The components of the 8000 Series KRL that often have disturbances and damage are the carbon brush with 31 
times damage, which is 31% of the total damage, brake pad shoe with 19 times damage, which is 26% of the total 
damage, and SIV with 14 times damage, which is 19%. of the total amount of damage. 
3. The implementation of Preventive Maintenance can increase the total availability value of the carbon brush 
component by 0.978, brake pad shoe by 0.983 and SIV by 0.988. While the reliability value, there is an increase

and SIV, there is an increase of 65.41%. 
4. The amount of downtime after preventive maintenance actions have increased. It is because of the number of 
actions performed for each component. The increase in downtime for the carbon brush component is 5.5 hours, the 
brake pad shoe component is 1.79 hours, and the SIV component is 11.29 hours. 
5. The information system can support making a recapitulation of TTR and TTF values as well as in making periodic 
reports.

Abstract  
Formulating a model has always been a helpful technique in determining certain solutions with respect to certain 
constraints. In the business world, one technique would be the Goal Programming Model. This paper focuses on the 
utilization of this technique for a certain business owner of a cake shop. The researchers were able to gather different 
data such as costs, and historical data that would help in determining dependent variables needed for formulation. 
Different system and goal constraints were also listed in order to set parameters with respect to the performance of the 
business. The researchers then used Excel Solver in order to solve for the values of decision and deviational variables 
in order to find the optimal solution for this problem. In the findings, the researchers were able to conclude variables 
in which all the goals were achieved with respect to the system and goal constraints. The researchers were also able 
to provide a Goal Programming Formulation in which it is said to have the ability to help the business owner for 
improvement and certain adjustments.

1. Introduction   
When COVID‚Äì19 strike, the world became full of uncertainties (Baker et al. 2020). Everybody‚Äôs lives stopped for a 
while, and everything was made to be done at home. Lockdowns and social distancing were implemented all around 
the world which made economies sleep for some time. During the first two months after its arrival, strict 
implementation of social distancing was at its peak and all business industries crashed (Fairlie, 2020). Among these 
companies, small businesses were the ones that got affected the most just several weeks after the pandemic‚Äôs outbreak. 
In the US alone, it was estimated that 43% of small businesses closed around that time (Bartik et al., 2020). Those 
numbers are just in the USA, a first world country, and the effects are much more in the Philippines where after more 
than a year later, lockdowns and community quarantines are still being implemented. However, people are learning to 
cope with the stay-at-home setup and the pandemic made way to homemade goods to prosper. Among all the goods 
being offered, food is the most profitable right now. These businesses that opened during the pandemic are mostly 
online with no physical store just like the study focus of this research paper which is a cake business. Since, the virus 
is still not under control, the risk of the economy failing is still high that is why maximizing the resources of a business 
and making sure that all costs are minimized while profit is maximized is important while keeping the newly open 
store interesting and engaging to the customers by offering variety of products as well as extra services like free 
delivery which the owner should consider in the budgeting. However, not everything can be offered by the company 
without adding cost that is why prioritization of certain goals or rather offering should be identified by the owner. This 
means that the business owner will try to choose the best alternative based on the set priorities that they set.  
 
1.1 Research Gap  
As our world continues to shift to a new normal, the businesses that were once closed are starting to come back, for 
the livelihood of the people to continue and for the economy to be restored. The goal programming approach has been 
used in the business world a lot and for a while now, however there aren‚Äôt many studies published in the sector of food 
and in particular, the bakery industry. There are only a few studies published and they vary in the type of products 
they create and the type of ingredients that they use. This is because of the period where stores including bakeries

2639","For the obtained results in the excel solver goal 4, which is to produce at most 12 chocolate moist cake. It can be stated 
that the cakeshop should produce 1 moist chocolate cake which will yield a value of 8. Therefore, since it is less than 
the right-hand side value of 12, we can conclude that goal 4 is achieved. 
Based on the excel solver, the optimal solution is to produce 5 small blueberry cheesecakes, 2 medium and large 
blueberry cheesecakes, and 8 chocolate moist cakes. This combination of number of cakes will satisfy all the goals 
and optimize the model by reducing the variation of values obtained from the goal‚Äôs right-hand side.  
 
5.2 Proposed Improvements 
For the future researchers that will pursue a similar approach to a particular business, it is recommended to identify 
and assess all possible system and goal constraints to have the most accurate results. There may be factors that are 
overlooked, and these may result to inconsistencies. It is also recommended to apply the method to a business of a 
bigger scale as much as possible, in this way there are more factors to consider, resulting to more goals to be achieved 
or satisficed. Applying the utilized approach in this research to some businesses of small-scale may not be applicable 
due to the low number of goals and priorities, therefore the results may not be of great difference. It is important to 
evaluate first if the method is applicable first before proceeding with the goal programming approach. Though the 
business being discussed in this research study is indeed in the smaller scale, the business‚Äô objectives and goals may 
not seem to be at a substantial level, which may not prove that the same results in this study may work exactly the 
way it is when compared to a larger scale business or an already well-known established business company. Therefore, 
future further studies of this method being applied in a larger business can definitely provide a compelling comparison 
in the use of Goal Programming and the level of their effects on a small- and large-scale business. Thus, opening the 
doors to new possibilities and discovery of new approaches. 
6. 
Conclusions 
The application of the Goal Programming approach can be used in all different aspects and venture in the business 
industry. As a matter of fact, the Goal Programming approach should be utilized more often especially in smaller 
businesses as this is a great way to achieve progress and reaching the desired goals set for a given period of time. This 
is important because effort and persistence is not always enough to bring a small business and turning it into a large 
striving business in the future. To do that, methods such as the Goal Programming approach is needed to tackle and 
identify the desired goals that can realistically be set and achieved through the use of the businesses data, resources 
and current operation capacity which this would differ among businesses. To conclude, the Excel Solver Run 2, 3 and 
4 results prove to be the best choices since they yield the best optimal results to achieve their respective goal constraints 
where all the goal constraints are achieved. But for the Excel Solver Run 1, there exists three unachieved goal 
constraints which is why Excel Solver Run 2, 3, and 4 are the best choices to run to achieve the best results in achieving 
the goal constraints with consideration of their respective priorities.

Abstract 
 
From the results of observations at the company, the main problem found is that maintenance activities have not been 
carried out properly due to the tight production schedule. It is the reason for replacing components, only when the 
machine is damaged suddenly. The purpose of the study is to determine the type of machine that requires periodic 
maintenance, and critical components, along with how much reliability if applied through an information system. The 
case study method carried out is a quantitative method by processing data according to preventive maintenance. The 
analysis is carried out by determining the engine and critical components and then calculating the meantime to failure 
(MTTF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) to get the value of age replacement, availability, reliability, and downtime. 
The results achieved are increased availability and reliability and decreased total downtime by implementing proposed 
preventive maintenance for ladle, auto spray and heater components.

From the design of system functions made, a user interface is designed to connect the interaction between the user and 
the system in carrying out tasks. The following is an example of the interface for the Preventive Maintenance

Moreover, after the interface is made, the last step is to plan how the designed system will be implemented and 
operationalized, described through the deployment environment and software architecture in Figure 7 and Figure 8. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the calculation of preventive maintenance, it was found that the die casting machine-07 is a binding machine 
with selected critical components ladle, auto spray and heater. In addition, it is known that preventive maintenance 
actions, especially replacement of damage prevention, are carried out after the ladle component reaches a service life 
of 108 hours, the auto spray component is 506 hours, and the heater component is 320 hours. Moreover, by performing 
preventive maintenance, the reliability curve of the ladle component shows an increase of 92.44%, auto spray 
129.25%, and heater component 80.07%. The application of information system applications can support engine 
maintenance activities in terms of data collection and calculation of engine and component performance. 
 
The company should pay more attention to the DC-07 engine and its components to keep the engine performance 
always in normal condition.

Abstract  
One of the renowned industries which provides services to the community is the delivery courier services ‚Äì these are 
businesses which facilitate the transport and delivery of documents and packages. Along with the expansion of E-
commerce, the demand for delivery courier services has also increased. Primarily, during the pandemic where 
community restrictions are imposed, these services are observed to have surge in demands because of the emergence 
of online purchasing. Delivery services have been convenient and necessary for businesses and individuals hence the 
said industry has been important for countries like the Philippines. The present study aims to make use and capitalize 
the tool Decision theory/analysis in choosing which courier in the Philippines is the much preferred by the customers. 
Through a preliminary survey the researchers were able to gather the most widely used courier by the customers 
namely: J&T Express, Lalamove and Grab Express. The results obtained from the study shows that in the Maximax 
Criterion the best decision was Grab Express, in the Maximin Criterion J&T Express was the best decision, in the 
Minimax Criterion J&T Express was the best decision, in the Hurwicz Criterion J&T Express was the best decision, 
and in the Equal Likelihood Criterion J&T Express was the best decision. Resulting that J&T Express was the optimal 
delivery courier service from the data gathered by the researchers.

1. Introduction  
During the past years, growth and development has been boosted due to the emergence of different industries. Besides 
the agricultural and industrial industries, another driving force has emerged and this is the service industry (Liu et al., 
2005). Because of the rapid growth and emergence of the service economy, the shift from the industrial economy has 
now been made possible. During times that we are in the role of the service industry has made a big impact in modern 
times (Cheng, 2013; Kon, 1997).  
 
The scope that the service industry covers could be considered a broad one, as it covers a wide spread of what it can 
do or perform. The service industry could be considered a complete package for every human's daily needs. The world 
that humans live in is almost surrounded by different types of services. According to Ranasinghe (2021), the possibility 
of surviving in modern times in the absence of the service sector is impossible. 
 
Since the pandemic started a lot of areas in the service sector have greatly been affected whether in a positive way or 
a negative way. One thing for sure is that for the delivery courier services, it had a positive impact due to the high 
demands since the pandemic started. The emergence of delivery couriers during this pandemic indeed has drastically 
increased due to safety reasons. Some say that delivery couriers are now part of the new normal, since it is the safest 
way to give something to someone provided that they would not be required to go out already. 
 
1.1 Current Issues Related to the Topic 
The pandemic of Covid-19 highly affects the businesses around the country were going outside, travel, and direct 
contact with others is limited. The courier service delivery is daily used by businesses and it is the safest and fastest 
way to deliver their goods to the customer rather than picking up or meeting up where it is an inconvenience and also

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The researchers recommended having survey data that procures a probability within the given factors that shows a 
possible importance that the customers would highly consider choosing. A data with a given probability would suffice 
to have an analysis of decision making with probabilities that would strengthen the analysis of the picking courier 
service delivery with the application of decision theory.  
 
 The courier services that didn‚Äôt appear to be optimal within the different choices of courier service since the balance 
or ratio of their factors of speed and quality, and shipping fee that shows that it‚Äôs too one sided or focused on one 
primary factor. It is recommended to balance out the service of speed and quality into the rate of shipping fee to attain 
an optimal result and improve the views of customers to the courier service. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The present study aims to make use and capitalize the tool Decision theory/analysis in choosing which courier in the 
Philippines is the much preferred by the customers. The study implores two aspects for its objectives, it tackles both 
general and specific aims in the result of the study. While its general aspects seek towards correlating satisfaction 
among customers towards the delivery services brought by the selected delivery companies, it also specifies and 
obtains results as it compares the factors for satisfaction with the performance made by delivery services. Furthermore, 
this shall serve as a future reference and criteria for future company improvements or studies. Gathering the needed 
data for this paper, the said objectives were fulfilled by the researchers.  
 
In summary, the results obtained in the Decision Theory show that in the Maximax Criterion the best decision was 
Grab Express, in the Maximin Criterion J&T Express was the best decision, in the Minimax Criterion J&T Express 
was the best decision, in the Hurwicz Criterion J&T Express was the best decision, and in the Equal Likelihood 
Criterion J&T Express was the best decision. Resulting that J&T Express was the optimal delivery courier service 
from the data gathered by the researchers.

Introduction  
UI/UX Designer and Engineer is a fundamental division in terms of the technical development of a digital product 
(Mispa et all., 2019). Both are influential in making an optimal digital product to suit the target market and be liked 
by users. There needs to be a strong collaboration between the two divisions. There are still UI/UX Designers or 
Engineers who still don't work well together. There are still designers who make designs but ignore the influence of 
their creations on product performance. 
Therefore, a UI/UX Designer needs to make a design according to the existing data. This will also help Engineers to 
create digital products with maximum performance (Putra et all., 2017). If you don't make a design according to the 
data, it will significantly affect product performance, such as making a website or application slow, consuming many 
data, etc. (Scholtz et all., 2016). According to data submitted quoted from DoubleClick stated that 53% of users will 
leave the application (mobile) if they must wait more than 3 seconds for the application to work (Kunath and Winkler,

Conclusion 
Social Media Marketing is very influential in the formation of Brand Awareness and Increasing Customer Engagement 
because there are so many features in social media that can be used to reach a broader market. The Social Media 
strategy carried out by Elevenia, and Shoppee is proven to form a strong image, where the name of the store will 
appear in our minds when looking for beauty products that are guaranteed to be original in the eyes of their customers. 
Not only that, through Social Media Marketing, has also succeeded in building engagement through regular and 
consistent interactions on social media pages, be it games or giveaways. 
 
This Social Media Marketing strategy can be studied, adopted, or even developed by other businesspeople to build 
brand awareness and customer engagement, especially for new, small businesses. Social media can be a suitable 
marketing alternative because it does not require too much money.

Abstract 
One of the factors that plays an important role in competition is service to customers. One of the services that can be 
provided by the company is to provide timeliness in the delivery of goods. An important factor that supports the 
timeliness is the ordering of the right quantity of raw materials and the time to order the raw materials. Whereas if raw 
materials cannot be ordered in the right quantity and time, there will be a shortage or excess of raw materials, both of 
which will cause losses for the company. The research was conducted at a manufacturing company, which is order-
based. The problem faced by the company is often experiencing inhibition of the production process and delays in 
sending orders to its customers. The aim of the research is providing propose regarding the method of ordering raw 
materials with the right quantity, considering the comparison of storage costs and the cost of ordering raw materials. 
The result was proposed decision of method to forecasting the need of raw materials, order quantity, and minimizing 
storage costs and raw material ordering costs.

Introduction 
In the current era of globalization, the growth of industry is increasingly rapid, thus requiring each industry to give its 
own advantage to compete competitively in the free market. Both domestic and foreign industries, compete to get 
customers, because the more customers mean the greater the profit or profit obtained by the company.

2672","if the order quantity is above 25.6 tons, then the additional cost for forklifts is calculated per hour, and the cost is 
cheaper than having to call forklift services every time you must unload.  
Therefore, with this proposed method, the company can make cost savings in ordering raw materials, when compared 
to the current running method, where the method incurs far greater costs than the proposed method. In addition, with 
the forecasting of raw material needs, it can help the company's management to know the estimated needs of raw 
materials in the future and can calculate the quantity of raw materials more carefully, as a basis for anticipating orders 
from customers. So that customer satisfaction can be maintained, and the company can also save costs related to the 
supply of raw materials.   
For aluminum raw materials, the most economical order is to use deterministic methods. Both PPB, W &W, and S 
&M methods, result in the same cost, which is IDR 1,774,519.05. The acceptance period with the three methods is the 
same, namely the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th periods. Since the lead time for aluminum 
raw materials is one month, the booking is made for one month before the acceptance period begins. 
Bookings are made almost every month because of the cheap message fee, which is IDR 57,734. While the cost of 
saving IDR  1,050 per Kg of raw materials. Considering the balance between the cost of the message and the cost of 
saving resulted in the booking being made almost every period. 
While the calculation of the EOQ method, produces an optimal Q* value of 200 Kg, while there are several periods 
in high season requiring more raw materials than the optimal Q*. So that in the crowded period the quantity of order 
is adjusted to the needs of raw materials. However, the cumulative variable cost is greater than the deterministic 
method, so the deterministic dynamic method is a more suitable method to apply.  
When compared to a running system, it is clearly seen that the running system incurs the most costs among the 
proposed methods. The quantity of orders that are not considered can inflate the costs associated with inventory. 
Overall, the best method to apply in a company is the deterministic dynamic method. Based on the results of 
calculations by comparing several methods, dynamic deterministic methods always provide a solution to save 
inventory costs. Thus, this method can be used to assist companies in determining the most economical quantity of 
ordering raw materials, because it is accompanied by a comparison of message costs and cumulative saving costs.

Conclusion 
As a make-to-order company engaged in button making.  The problem faced by companies today is the supply of raw 
materials that often run out, due to the determination of the quantity of ordering raw materials that are not appropriate 
because it is done based on intuition and the absence of reserve raw material supplies. This certainly causes losses for 
the company, especially in terms of costs due to the production process that is hampered or must procure emergency 
raw materials to fulfil customer orders. 
Therefore, several stages are proposed that must be taken in determining the quantity of ordering raw materials. The 
first step is to collect historical data on the use of raw materials, then make an forecast of raw material needs for future 
periods. The next step is to calculate the quantity of order based on forecasting data, by comparing deterministic 
methods and probabilistic methods.  In addition, there is also a calculation of safety stock or reserve supplies for each 
raw material so that it can overcome situations outside normal conditions, such as order surges.

Abstract 
 
In a company both manufacturing companies and distributor companies, initially the purchase part is considered as a 
cost center, it turns out that now it has turned into a profit center for the company so that it plays an important role in 
the procurement process. Where the buying part must make the purchase in a timely manner, the right amount, good 
quality, the selection of the right supplier and the most appropriate price. Therefore, the company sees the need for 
the implementation of e-procurement so that the company can excel and compete and maintain and improve its 
customers, and to overcome problems that often occur in the conventional procurement process. It is important for 
companies to take a purchasing strategy that can provide convenience in relationships with suppliers and speed of 
exchanging information regarding procurement of goods. One of them is to change the old procurement system into 
e-procurement. The methodology used is the value network analysis method with the impact analysis and value 
creation analysis approach, which analyzes the solutions needed in the development of e-procurement.  The result is 
a model of e-procurement that can be used to exchange information, negotiate with suppliers, and select suppliers who 
are more objective with supplier performance assessments. With the e-procurement system, it will be able to overcome 
problems that often occur in the conventional product procurement process, and the company can excel and compete 
and can maintain and improve its customers.

5. Conclusion  
The importance of procurement of supplies is to support service to customers. Inadequate procurement of goods causes 
between the purchase and supplier parts to experience limitations in exchanging information and negotiations. Of 
course, as a distributor company for overseas suppliers, this becomes an obstacle and causes some problems for the 
company, especially the purchase part. Therefore, the company sees the need for an e-procurement system, to be able 
to handle problems that arise in the procurement process. The methodology used is (1) the value network analysis 
method with the impact analysis and value creation analysis approach, which analyzes the solutions needed in the 
development of e-procurement.   
 
The result is a model in the form of a draft e-procurement model that can be used to exchange information, negotiate 
with suppliers and select suppliers who are more objective with supplier performance assessments. With the e-
procurement system, it will be able to overcome problems that often occur in the conventional product procurement 
process, and the company can excel and compete and can maintain and improve its customers.

Abstract 
This study applies queuing theory approach to improve service quality of banking systems in Laguna, Philippines. 
Banking industry has been affected by the pandemic but, in comparison to other industries such as food, clothing, etc., 
it has been affected in other factors such as establishment capacity, and service quality. The researchers used data 
observed from 9:00am - 3:00pm, which was analyzed using Inferential Statistics and Queuing Theory. Results show 
that waiting time for customers (Senior/PWD) significantly differs from waiting time of regular customers. In addition, 
since the bank has 2 operational counters, it showed no significant difference between the waiting and service time of 
the 2 counters unless Senior/PWD citizens are served. Last, the type of probability distribution of the waiting, service, 
and total time in the system was determined using ProModel 2016‚Äôs Autofit function. Initially, the type of probability 
is lognormally distributed, however since exponential probability is included in the top three, the data was deduced to 
fit as exponentially distributed. Even without simulation testing, queuing analysis could be applied. It is recommended 
to utilize additional counter for all transactions where the management may continue the use of existing queuing 
behavior but with the reduction of waiting time.

1. Introduction 
The success of the different service sectors has been heavily dependent on the perceived service quality. Service 
quality of the service sectors could be affected by various categories, this includes customer satisfaction and customer 
loyalty. In the banking industry ‚Äì studies have shown that service quality is the main determinant of its success. Thus, 
its continuous improvements are vital in order for the bank branch to progress and ensure its competitiveness.  
As mentioned, service quality is mainly affected by customers satisfaction and this may include several elements from 
mechanic to humanic clues. However, in the banking sector, a recent study has shown that to improve the bank‚Äôs 
service quality, customers waiting and serving time are the most common factors that measures customers‚Äô 
satisfaction. With regards to the customers‚Äô waiting time, is the perceived queue length. Studies have also shown that 
customers waiting time and queue length have a negative effect on customers‚Äô satisfaction, thus, creating a negative 
perception towards their service quality. In this particular industry, different bank transactions are available which 
takes different amount of time to accomplish, thus, resulting to longer queues. In addition to that, given the current 
situation, the capacity limit that is implemented on establishments, commercial banks cannot accommodate customers 
the same manner as compared to the pre-pandemic era.    
The global health crisis has taken its toll on commercial banking as the Department of Health and the Covid-19 Inter-
Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Covid-19 IATF) have set capacity limits 
for every establishment in accordance with quarantine guidelines that may vary per region to practice minimum health 
standards and reduce physical contact from customers and employees. The capacity limit set for establishments with 
a threshold of 50% is highly dependent on the announcement from the national government which is recommended

The calculations done in table 8 utilized the data from the current system in terms of arrival rate, waiting time, service 
time, and total time in the system. Since the proposed solution includes utilization of three (3) operational servers, the 
computations done is based on the change from s = 2 to s = 3. With that, it can be seen that the waiting time and time 
spent in the system for both senior citizen and regular customers have been reduced and falls under the target waiting 
time of 5 minutes set by the bank management itself.  
 6. Conclusion 
Queuing Theory is vastly used to solve issues that may reduce service quality since it is mainly affected by queuing 
time. With that and due to the lack of studies conducted in the Philippines with considerations of the capacity limit 
brought upon by the pandemic, this study is conducted in a bank in Laguna, Philippines where time study and 
observation was used to gather data that aided in the analysis of the current queuing system. The standard time of 
queuing and servicing time were identified and utilized to determine the areas of improvement of the current system.  
The target waiting time set by the management of the bank played a huge role in the analysis of data where it was 
stated that management has a target waiting time of 5 minutes in order to reduce exposure of the customers to the virus 
and to satisfy customers by not making them wait for an excessive amount of time in the bank. With that, it was 
determined in the queuing analysis of the current system that the root cause of longer time in the system is that there 
is no proper segregation for the accommodation of senior citizen and regular customers of only two (2) operating 
counters even though there is a total of three (3) counters in the system. Since the bank follows a First Come, First 
Serve (FCFS) and Priority (PR) queuing discipline, regular customers wait for their turn for transaction while senior 
citizen customers are automatically being catered once a server is available for transaction, regardless if the customer 
just arrived.  
The researchers mainly used the arrival rate, service rate, utilization rate, and waiting time in line as a performance 
measure to compare the data from both types of customers. It was proven in the calculation of queuing analysis that 
the waiting time of senior citizens is significantly different to the waiting time of regular customers. It was found that 
the arrival rate of regular customers is greater than its service rate, which means that number of regular customer 
arrivals magnifies faster yet they get stuck in the queue since the service rate does not compensate for the arrival rate, 
thus, resulting to a prolonged waiting time and total time in the system, which then elevates the risk of regular 
customers of being exposed to the virus.  
With that, the proposed solution or queuing management system involves the utilization of three (3) fully operational 
servers for the whole day where the management may continue the queuing behavior of serving senior citizens upon 
availability, that will not affect the waiting time of regular customers since there is an additional counter. Once the 
available servers are fully operational, this will significantly reduce queuing time and total time in the system of both

2712","customers that will conform to the target waiting time of 5 minutes set by the management since the service rate will 
be increased, which may then cater to the arrival rate of regular customers.  
Since it was found that the proposed queuing management system will reduce overall waiting time and total waiting 
time for senior citizen and regular customers, this will reduce the risk of exposure of customers generally since they 
will not have to stay in the system for an unreasonable amount of time ‚Äì thus, will improve service quality in terms of 
queuing time and may lead to an accommodation of more customers on a daily basis. 
7. Recommendation 
For the bank, since the arrival rate is significantly higher than the serving time of the customers ‚Äì this means that the 
current system is considered to be a slow paced. Thus, creating longer queuing line and longer waiting time for the 
customer. Thus, the utilization of the third counter should be implemented that would be used as an additional counter 
where management may proceed with the current queuing behavior. By doing so, serving regular customers will have 
a continuous flow instead of having interruptions because senior citizens would then be needed to served first which 
causes longer waiting time for regular customers. 
For the future researchers, since the scope of this study is only to apply queuing theory to improve the queueing system 
of the bank based on the transactions of deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer, it is recommended to widen the scope 
and include different transactions that concerns higher-level employees transactions such as debit/credit account 
opening/closing, claiming of pension/senior citizen funds, large amount deposit/withdrawal/fund transfer,  acquisition 
of insurance account, etc.,. Lastly, to include all excluded tangible and humanic factors of this study to further discuss 
such effects of the excluded factors on the result of the future study.

Abstract  
This study proposes a mathematical model and a hybrid metaheuristic (based on Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search 
Procedures and Tab√∫ Search) for the distribution districting problem considering stochastic demand. The problem is 
inspired by a situation faced by a parcel company operating in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n M√©xico. The company desires 
to develop a strategic plan to district customers in pursuit of accomplishing two objectives: 1) balancing the average 
workload between districts (by minimizing the maximum workload content in a district), 2) creating compact districts, 
which is modeled as the minimization of the maximum distance between a pair of points in a district. . In Gonz√°lez-
Ram√≠rez et al. (2017). As an extension and to incorporate the stochasticity of demand, we proposed to consider several 
representative days. We propose a single-objective optimization model in which we optimize the normalized weighted 
sum of the two objectives. As we are considering several demand scenarios, the proposed model minimizes the 
weighted sum of the maximum average workload content of each district (average over the demand days) and the 
compactness metric measured as the maximum time between the farthest away pair of points of a district. In order to 
normalize the parameters, we estimate the optimal allocation of workload among districts and the optimal compactness 
metric assuming a circular shape of districts. Furthermore, it is very important that the workload of the districts respect 
a maximum service time. Otherwise, the company has to pay extra time to the drivers. Given that this is a soft 
constraint, we model it as a third term in the objective function, penalizing the exceeding workload content of each 
demand day and district.  The proposed model was implemented in C++ and solved via CPLEX. Since it could be 
difficult to solve large instances to optimality, a multi-start hybrid metaheuristic is also developed, combining elements 
of GRASP and Tabu Search. At the construction phase, to generate multiple solutions, three heuristics to select a set 
of seeds are defined. The first heuristic selects the seeds among the most dispersed points. The second is based on a 
sweep algorithm, and the third one is very similar but considers the workload of each point. For each of the seed

2715",,"methods, a GRASP structured is implemented, randomly selecting the seeds from a restricted candidate list. Once the 
seeds have been selected, the remaining points are assigned to the districts that are closest and that are connected in 
the graph by an arc (which refers to the adjacency matrix of the graph).  With an initial solution constructed the second 
step considers a local search procedure in which the movements consider moving points between adjacent districts 
under a Tabu Search structure.   
Preliminary results confirm the fact that the model presents limitations regarding the size of the scenarios solved, 
whereas the metaheuristic obtains high-quality solutions for larger instances in a reasonable amount of time.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our educational life as online classes emerged as a way to adapt for educational 
institutions in the new normal. This has helped in continuing to cater to the educational needs of the students to prevent 
the spread of the virus. Several intuitions have implemented ways on how online learning can be accessible and 
convenient for students. Though this has been beneficial, the concern of professors in determining what is the best 
factor in the experience of students with their learning capacities given the situation. With more than a year in online 
classes, students have voiced concerns about today‚Äôs learning platforms as it affects several factors and challenges in 
the magnitude of their learning.  
 
This research aims to compare the absorption of knowledge of students between face-to-face learning and online 
learning, in order to identify what factor results with the highest absorption of knowledge. From that, the best strategy 
to be used by professors can be obtained. By conducting a survey, the researchers used the obtained data from the 
students of Mapua University, to be able to perform various calculations, statistical and decision analyses. As a result, 
the factor of Interaction/Communication yielded the highest among other factors, which indicates that it should be 
considered by professors when conducting face-to-face learning and online learning, in order for the students to meet 
the maximum level of absorption of knowledge. As a conclusion, this also implies that the students were able to 
perform academically well whenever an interaction with their peers and classmates took place. Given this, it can also 
be concluded that it is best for professors to provide interactive activities to their students to be able to obtain a high 
learning absorption.

1. Introduction  
In the first quarter of 2020, the outbreak of the new coronavirus pandemic has shaken educational life throughout the 
world. It provided the most daunting challenge for the global education system in the previous century. Over 1.6 
billion people in over 190 countries across all continents have been affected by school closures, with repercussions in 
how instructors and students have acclimatized to the limitations given by e-learning. 
  
Educators are finding it progressively impracticable to overlook the parallels and contrasts between face-to-face and 
online courses as they encounter rising challenges to include online conversations. The pressure to include innovative 
ideas into school curricula stems from a variety of sources. Certainly, several academic institutions are in the process 
of connecting with disadvantaged youth, and workers are being forced to offer more online education. Even as 
synchronous sessions are held concurrently in a nation with internet problems and scantiness, multiple technological 
issues occur for students and teachers, particularly those who live in rural locations.

students prioritize their experience in Online Classes under the Engineering Programs. The highest ranking with a 
rank value of 1 determined the important factor engineering students prioritize through Online Classes. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The pandemic has made learning institutions be lenient in online classes to prevent the spread of the virus through 
direct contact with teachers, staff, and students. Although this has been beneficial to continue and to adapt to the 
learning system suited in this new normal, the concern on which is the better learning method in the absorption of 
learnings and activity performance of the students is determined. To further expound what learning method is what 
the student‚Äôs think is best for their learning absorption and activity performance, the results have shown that students 
in both engineering and non engineering prefer the Face-to-Face classes as their preferred learning platform. As for 
the students' experience in both Face-to-Face Classes and Online Classes, the factor of Interaction/Communication 
with professors and classmates are given as an important factor that maximizes how they absorb learning knowledge 
and activity of performance.

Abstract 
The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) is a government agency responsible for handling civil registration services 
which include the responsibility for issuing birth, death, and marriage certificates. The tasks given to the PSA face 
difficulty in managing queuing time for studies have shown that the PSA has an inefficient and ineffective queuing 
system. The current queuing system of the PSA involves an online application, but the certificates requested are 
delivered after a few days or weeks. The walk-in application faces long waiting times for customers, thus resembles 
poor queuing management. This study aims to resolve the long queuing time experienced by customers in requesting 
birth certificates. The study used Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Verify (DMADV) process to determine the 
bottlenecks in the current queuing system and to provide modifications or alternative solutions that will reduce the 
waiting time of customers. Monte Carlo Simulation was also utilized to generate expected results for both the current 
and proposed solutions. Upon the utilization of tools, the researchers were able to provide two alternative systems. 
The first alternative incorporated a Kiosk machine and was proven to be significantly different from the current 
queuing system but was not able to drastically reduce the queuing time. The second alternative applied a Hybrid 
approach as it used online processing to replace some processes in the current queuing system. Results showed that 
the second alternative was significantly better and more efficient than the other two queuing systems.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Study 
The quality of service has been an essential factor in attaining any field or industry‚Äôs successes, as service quality 
mirrors how companies or businesses meet the customers‚Äô demands. Like any other industry, government agencies 
hold the responsibility of providing services to people. As government agencies are tasked to accommodate different 
matters, it is important to promote and maintain good quality services. Thus, proper queuing management must always 
be heeded as this is closely intertwined with customer satisfaction. The Philippine Government, in the year 2013, 
authorized the legislation of centralizing four (4) data-producing government agencies which led to the establishment 
of the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) (Espey, 2018). The Philippine Statistics Authority is one of the 
government agencies established in the Philippines that is mainly tasked to provide relevance and reliability in 
statistics, and services for civil registration in accordance with rules, regulations, and laws. They are in charge of the 
collection, analysis, and publication of statistical information of the Filipinos. According to Medina-Howe (2020), the 
issuance of a birth certificate is one of the most requested files in PSA as it is a requirement for almost all registration

2728","queuing system of the PSA is very minimal compare with the performance of the hybrid queuing system. The 
researchers believed that Kiosk queuing system was not able to greatly reduce the lead time and waiting time because 
the bottleneck of the current queuing system was only replaced by a machine rather than finding a better alternative. 
This means that the only difference between the Kiosk queuing system and the current queuing system of the PSA is 
the person or object being utilized to process the customer‚Äôs payment. In contrast, the hybrid queuing system was able 
to eradicate the bottleneck of the current queuing system by simply using third-party alternatives or payment methods. 
This allowed the researchers to significantly reduce the lead time and waiting time. 
 
5.4 Validation 
With the application of Monte Carlo Simulation in this study, researchers tested the acceptability of the set of random 
numbers generated to represent true data by using a Chi-Square Test. The null hypothesis in this statistical treatment 
is described as: there is no significant difference between the data thus shows a uniform distribution. As seen in table 
2, all random number generators excluding Mid Square Method showed a higher critical value (x2 theo) than the 
computed value (x2 obs). This means that the set of random numbers can be used to represent true data.

 Furthermore, the researchers also applied paired t-test to the results of the Monte Carlo Simulations to determine 
whether there is a significant difference between the three systems. As seen in table 3, all the paired t-tests indicated 
that there is a significant difference in performance among the queuing system since the p-value is less than 0.05. 
Despite the results of the Kiosk queuing system, it is still significantly different than the current queuing system based 
on the results of the paired t-test.

6. Conclusion 
Queuing lines have always been a part of any industry that deals with goods and services (Troanca, 2014). Inevitably, 
waiting lines have always been an aspect that analyst tries to minimize since it can gradually become a source of 
conflicts. Ineffective management of queuing systems results in negative outcomes such as declines in demand and 
poor customer satisfaction (Chowdhury, 2018). With the importance of good queuing management, the researchers 
assessed the Philippine Statistics Authority‚Äôs queuing system for requesting birth certificates for which the study had 
determined to be ineffective. 
Due to the poor queuing management of the PSA, customers with a desire to obtain birth certificates spent an average 
time of 5.29 hours in the entire system just to finish the process. Also, customers were forced to wait for about 5.21 
hours just to receive their birth certificates. These long queues resemble conflicts within the system for which the 
researchers would like to address. With this, the study used DMADV methodology to identify the bottlenecks of the 
current queuing system used by the PSA and to provide alternative queuing systems or modification that is expected 
to perform better than the existing queuing system. 
In this study, there are two alternative systems proposed by the researchers that were proven to be effective and better 
than the current queuing system. The first alternative utilized a Kiosk machine to replace the payment section. The 
replacement done by the researchers was able to reduce the processes from 19 to 14 specific processes. However, even 
with the modification, the researchers were not satisfied with the results since it did not significantly reduce the waiting

2737","time of the customers and the overall time spent by the customers in the entire system. This led to another alternative 
which was then called the Hybrid queuing system. This queuing system combined the capabilities of online processing 
and the current queuing system to produce a faster and more effective method for obtaining birth certificates. Results 
showed that from 19 processes, the researchers were able to decrease this up to 8 processes for which allowed the 
researchers to greatly reduce the waiting time and lead time of the customers. The second alternative was able to 
reduce 58.51% of the original lead time and 58.58% of the waiting time. Comparing the two alternatives proposed by 
the researchers, it is evident that using the Hybrid queuing system will significantly reduce the waiting time and lead 
time experienced by customers, thus indicates that the system is the most effective and efficient queuing system 
suitable for requesting birth certificates.

Abstract  
 
The Sri Lankan apparel industry is having a high demand for exports all over the world and is a leading apparel 
producer in the South Asian region. It has started to fight for its survival due to the pandemic, Covid-19. It guesses a  
bracing for a 50% drop in demand by the following one to one and a half years from Covid-19. Thus, the industry is 
in a position to reinvent itself by forcing itself to live. Thus, business continuity is necessary to proceed with the 
business without any interruption at this time. Moreover, human resource professionals act a major role to continue 
the business after the new normal, as handling the main resource of the organisation which is humans. Hence, this 
study aims to develop a guideline to maintain the continuous business operation of the Sri Lankan apparel industry 
during the Covid-19 through the commitment of HR professionals. Initially, the literature review delivered a 
theoretical understanding of the research area and a semi-structured interview was selected as the primary data 
collection method. Collected data were analysed using manual content analysis. The findings revealed that the 
challenges or factors that affect each HRM function during Covid-19 were identified and the action or solution used 
to handle those challenges/ factors were collected. Finally, the guideline was developed.

1. Introduction  
The apparel industry is the most significant and dynamic contributor to the national economy in Sri Lanka and provides 
more than 990,000 employment and empowerment opportunities, and also which has a solid worldwide reputation for 
high-quality apparel by the iconic global fashion brands (EDB, 2020). Accordingly, the nation has an important place 
in the trade of the apparel world (World Trade Organisation [WTO], 2015), and Sri Lanka is home to some of the 
world‚Äôs largest garment manufacturers (AFL-CIO, et al., 2021). The Sri Lankan apparel industry is having a high 
demand for exports all over the world and is a leading apparel producer in the South Asian region (Central Bank of 
Sri Lanka, 2013). Moreover, the production of this industry caters to many internationally reputed brands like Nike, 
Victoria's Secret, Ralph Lauren, and Tommy Hilfiger (Board of Investment Sri Lanka, 2016). Also, the revenue from 
the apparel industry is accounted for 43% of the total export revenue of the country (Kapuge & Smith, 2007). This

This research aims to develop a guideline to maintain the continuous business operation of the apparel industry during 
new normal (Covid-19) conditions through the commitment of human resource professionals. Also, this research 
answered the research question of this study which is ‚ÄúHow could improve the business continuity in the new normal 
conditions (Covid-19) of the Sri Lankan apparel industry through human resource management?‚Äù. Semi-structured 
interview data collection and analysis were contributed to achieving this study. By analysing the interview 
respondents, challenges or factors that affect each HRM function during Covid-19 were identified separately for all 
four selected human resource management functions such as recruitment & selection, performance management, 
employee engagement and compensations & benefits. Also, the action or solution used to handle those challenges/ 
factors of each human resource management function were collected and discussed. Accordingly, a guideline to 
improve the business continuity in the new normal condition like Covid-19 of Sri Lankan apparel industry through 
human resource management was developed and displayed. The guideline summarized and shows in one view that 
challenges or factors are available for each human resource management function separately and how those challenges 
or factors can be overcome. 
 
Moreover, this study has mutually significant academic and practical aspects. There are plenty of researches untaken 
separately for every three areas such as business continuity, new normal, and human resource management. Also, few 
research studies existing with the combination of ‚Äòbusiness continuity & new normal‚Äô, ‚Äòbusiness continuity & human 
resource management & ‚Äònew normal & human resource management‚Äô. However, there is a lack of researches with 
the combination of all three of the above. Also, this research is significant in the selected industry, the apparel industry. 
The coronavirus outbreak is first and foremost a human tragedy, affecting hundreds of thousands of people. The spread 
of the coronavirus and the restrictive measures imposed everywhere in countries, along with self-restrictions of the 
population, have had a rapid impact on all most all the business not from the disease and virus, but from the measures 
taken to stop it. Thus, there is a requirement available for all the businesses to continue their business during the 
Covid-19 outbreak. Thus, the practical significance from this study will be helpful to maintain the continuous business 
operations during new normal conditions, especially at this post-Covid-19 stage.

1. Introduction 
Retail businesses in the distribution chain are at the last point to meet consumers (Velayudhan, 2014). Traditional 
retail has an important role in absorbing employment and improving the local economy and has a role in maintaining 
socio-cultural characteristics (Hoang et al., 2019). Changes in people's current behavior affect the performance of 
traditional retail stores, so that modern retail stores appear (Pantano et al., 2018). Retailers must have a strategy to 
face increasingly fierce competition, especially in the current global era (Safari & Saleh, 2020; Rashidirad & Salimian, 
2020; Shah & Ahmad, 2019; Davis-Sramek et al., 2020) 
Traditional retail has challenges to coexist with modern retail (Liang & Wilhelmsson, 2011). Channel integration is 
important to meet customer expectations of service availability and speed (Jhaveri & Anantharaman, 2016; Rashidirad 
& Salimian, 2020). Good supply chain control is one of the important things that traditional retailers need to pay 
attention to win the competition (Kureshi & Thomas, 2019). In addition, traditional retail also requires digitalization 
changes to improve service performance (Hagberg et al., 2016). 
Traditional retailers continue to be able to find the latest business models (Beh et al., 2016). Business model innovation 
in retail provides opportunities for long-term and sustainable survival (Bili≈Ñska-Reformat et al., 2019). In conditions 
of intense competition like today, the application of the concept of sustainable development is a source of competitive 
advantage for traditional retailers (Bili≈Ñska-Reformat et al., 2019). 
Research on traditional retail survival strategies has been conducted and developed at an international level. However, 
studies are limited in providing big picture maps visualized on a global scale using data from many published studies. 
Even to date, there are no publications that directly address the impact of scientific research and the mutually beneficial 
interactions between researchers on the topic of traditional retail strategies in different parts of the world. 
One of the methods used to see the relationship of research, in general, is the bibliometric method. There is a method 
for measuring and analyzing scientific references with a combination of statistical and mathematical methods 
(Purnomo, Sari, et al., 2020). Bibliometrics is a statistical technique used to analyze bibliometric publication data such 
as reports, reviews, books, peer-reviewed articles, magazines, conferences, and publications. Bibliometric methods 
are widely used to present the relationship between quantitative methods and research domains (IGI Global, 2021).

4. Conclusion 
This study provides a visualized construction of the traditional retail strategy research map obtained from the results 
of data collection on the Scopus database. The results of the analysis show that the trend of publications has increased 
in number every year and the peak of the most publications in the last 20 years was in 2020 with 21 publication 
documents. The most productive researcher is Yan, Ruiliang from Texas A&M University, College Station, United 
States with 8 research documents. Indiana University Northwest became the most prolific affiliate of 6 publication 
documents. Furthermore, Sustainability Switzerland is the most productive source with 5 documents. Business, 
Management, and Accounting is the most productive subject area of research with 61 documents. The research theme 
map for the last 20 years has formed the relationship of keywords into 5 clusters, namely: Retail, Competition, Price, 
Marketing, and Supply Chain which is abbreviated as RECOMPRIMARS. The research collaboration network was 
formed with a threshold qualification of 2 research documents and found 4 researchers who networked in the 
traditional retail strategy research theme, namely Dan, Bin; Zhang, Haiyue; Zhang, Xumei; and Liu, Chan from 
Chongqing University, Chongqing, China. 
The implications of this research are in the form of practical and theoretical contributions. Practically, the findings in 
the form of a research theme map can be used as a basis for scientific references in the development of traditional 
retail knowledge. Furthermore, theoretically, this study shows the visualization of RECOMPRIMARS as a map of 
research themes formed from published data for the last 20 years (2000 ‚Äì 2020). Further researchers can explore and

Abstract  
 
There are a lot of things that you can do online, especially today where the internet is more accessible than before. 
One of the most common internet activities is the purchase of goods. The two online shops that are famous to different 
people are OL-A and OL-B. People have been increasingly interested in buying online, particularly during the Covid-
19 epidemic, because they are obliged to stay inside their houses rather than going outside. Shopping online has been 
a trend for people during this pandemic, but there are still some problems that occur when shopping online. This paper 
tackles one of these problems which is about the ordering process of OL-A and OL-B. The researchers will also 
determine how these two online shopping stores can improve their ordering process and what part of their ordering 
process they should enhance. After gathering 52 respondents for the data, the researchers applied Game theory by 
using the Nash equilibrium for solving the data gathered. This enables the researchers to evaluate how OL-A and OL-
B may improve or upgrade their shipping processes to better serve their consumers. This study identifies which aspects 
of the ordering process OL-A and OL-B could improve, and which aspects should be improved.

1. Introduction  
Current Issues Related to the topic 
Order processing starts with a customer placing an order, but in this process sometimes customers unintentionally 
place their orders wrong product quantity, and shipping address information. And there are also times that a consumer 
is unsure what type of product or service would meet his or her needs, they may seek guidance from a customer 
service. But during this exchange, problems may arise throughout this information transmission. It is possible that the 
consumer does not communicate clearly, or that the person who gets the request is inexperienced. As a result of these 
issues, a customer may receive a product or service that is inadequate. There is also an issue regarding the fulfillment, 
in here orders for actual objects and goods are picked and packed at the facility. When a customer order is picked, an 
employee searches a warehouse for the desired items, removes them from storage, and then adds them to the customer's 
order. An employee packs an order by taking the selected items and placing them in a shipping box or container. The 
usual mistake here is that the products, colors, and quantity are all wrong. From time to time there are missing products, 
incomplete orders, and incorrect packaging are the order packing issues that can result in product damage. (Reynolds, 
2017) 
 
Background of the Study 
The most popular e-commerce platform in the Philippines is OL-A and OL-B. OL-B is a marketplace for online 
purchasing and sales. The Company sells products in a variety of areas including electronics, home-made goods, toys, 
apparel, equipment for sport and food. OL-A is a prominent Southeast Asia and Philippines e-commerce platform. It 
is a region-specific platform that offers both consumers and sellers smooth, safe, and quick online shopping experience

The table shown in figure 5 shows the results of the Nash equilibrium performed on the data gathered for the criteria 
‚ÄúFalse advertising‚Äù. The results show that for OL-A and OL-B to enhance their delivering process, they should lessen 
the misleading product advertising in their store. The results also show that they should improve on lessening their 
misleading promotions to get more customers to utilize their applications. According to a recent study, misleading and 
deceptive advertising across various platforms is on the rise. (Grazioli, etal. 2003). A reduction in trust, satisfaction, 
and loyalty is one of the negative consequences of deceptive advertising. (Fayyaz, etal. 2015). 
 
6. Conclusion 
OL-A and OL-B are the Philippines' two most prominent e-commerce sites. These e-commerce platforms have 
procedures in place to ensure that customers are satisfied with their orders. However, these e-commerce sites have 
drawbacks when it comes to order processing. In this study, we focus on the four challenges that customers encounter 
and how they impact customer satisfaction. These are No update on delivery, Incorrect/Damaged item, Breach of 
confidential data, and Misleading advertisement.  
 
In this research, the researcher used Nash Equilibrium from game theory. The Nash Equilibrium results show that 
there is room for improvement in No Update on Delivery when it comes to updating the status of the customer's 
delivery, by informing the customer when the delivery is going to be delivered, and delivery process by regularly 
updating the customers during the delivery process. Incorrect/Damaged Items must improve the delivery process by 
continuing to provide the correct items to their customers. Breach of confidential data results in enhancing their 
security for the customer‚Äôs online transactions. Misleading advertisement results in their delivering process, they 
should lessen the misleading product advertising in their store.  
 
Based on our findings, OL-A offers more benefits and is easier for users to utilize. OL-A was rated more effective by 
60% of respondents, while OL-B was rated 40% more

Abstract 
 
This paper presents a method of addressing the resource-constraint problem associated with non-preemption in product 
development (PD) process. In this work, we specifically consider the development of multiple products across a 
planning horizon where development personnel and development durations are the main constraints that delay product 
launch. Relevant PD parameters were employed in defining the problem, and the problem was modelled as a 
contiguous-cells transportation problem with the objective of minimizing the ‚Äúlost revenue‚Äù associated with the re-
scheduling of PD processes due to unavailability of product development personnel. A hypothetical problem of 
scheduling six products across ten development quarters was then used to demonstrate the applicability of the model 
which yielded favorable results for product development schedules with minimal lost revenues. The result obtained 
shows that the method is effective and can be adopted by researchers and professionals to aid decision making in 
product development.

1. Introduction 
Profitability has always been the focus of manufacturing organizations. However, for any manufacturing organization 
to remain sustainable and competitive, attention must be given to innovations, particularly in the direction of 
developing new products to meet customer needs (Kogabayev and Maziliauskas, 2017; Silinevica et al. 2016). 
Launching a new product at the right time is essential to the success of the product, and this has become the focus of 
many production firms. This is because the earlier the product gets to customers, the higher the chances of the product 
amassing the largest market share. However, this is not the case in many real-life situations due to several factors that 
cause delays in product release. One major factors that is responsible for delays in product launch is the unavailability 
of development personnel. This issue may occur in cases where the firm relies on external teams for the PD process 
where the external development team may be engaged in other projects at the scheduled PD time. The problem 
becomes critical in situations when there are multiple products to be developed and the PD process is one that cannot 
be interrupted due to the nature of the products, or the setup cost associated with the PD process. In such a situation, 
there is every possibility of re-scheduling the development process of some products, thereby reducing the likelihood 
of the products to meet up with the expected time to market and leading to revenue losses. Fortunately, some products 
may have better market performance than others. Thus, one practical solution to this problem lies in making the 
decision to ensure that the most marketable products are developed and launched so as to mitigate the effects of 
unavailability of development personnel. The non-preemptive nature of the problem as described is one which is 
similar to the contiguous-cells transportation problem. Hence, this study focuses on adopting the contiguous-cells 
transportation model of solving non-preemptive scheduling problems to address the non-preemptive personnel-
constrained problem associated with the PD process. The motivation for this study is based on a previous work on the 
contiguous-cells transportation problem which has been found useful in solving non-preemptive scheduling problems 
(Adewole et al. 2020).

2768","in case 2 were obtained in case 3 where the available personnel were increased by 1 at Q5. In case 4, we see that the 
addition of 1 personnel in Q5 not only allows for development of P3 to run non-preemptively to completion. The 
inclusion also frees up development personnel at Q6 and Q7 for the development of P5, ultimately bringing the revenue 
loss to zero.  
It is also evident that ‚Äúdevelopment personnel‚Äù is not the only parameter responsible for the final schedule and lost 
revenue. All other PD parameters (T, M, Bi, ki, Di, rij, Dpi, Ni, Tmij) also contribute to the final schedule, and as such 
impact the behavior of the model. For instance, an increase in the development duration of any product while keeping 
its ready time constant will extend its market launch and possibly lead to loss of revenue. Furthermore, changes in 
market predictions during the PD process any product (as found in many real-life situations) may affect the sales life 
of the product. In such a situation, the ‚Äúaverage lost revenue‚Äù which the contiguous-cells algorithm uses to determine 
the order of schedule may change. This change may distort the order of schedule, ultimately resulting to a change in 
lost revenue. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper proposed the contiguous-cells transportation approach to aid decision making for product launch in non-
preemptive PD process. The approach considered parameters relevant to the PD process and the problem was 
successfully formulated with an algorithm proposed to solve the problem. The methodology and results obtained 
reveals that the availability of development personnel throughout the product development horizon is vital to the 
timely release of products particularly in cases where preemption is not allowed during the PD process, and this also 
contributes to the overall market performance of products as it helps to reduce revenue losses. In conclusion, 
organizations must adequately plan to ensure that product development personnel are available throughout the entire 
PD horizon. 
Future works will focus on addressing real-life problems, considering stochastic ready times for product development 
and seek to extend the development resource constraints beyond development personnel to include other development 
resources relevant to the PD process.

1. Introduction  
People nowadays are more engaged in supporting small enterprises during the pandemic. One of the businesses that 
arise are baked products, clothing line, accessories, and other items that are useful in the present situation. Big 
enterprises started from small enterprises that maintained their growth by identifying the important factors to consider 
when growing a business. Many business owners are aware of their current progress which paves the way for more 
opportunities and insights as they handle their business. Micro, small business enterprises (MSMEs) sector is 
considered as one of the major economic growth drivers in the Philippines at any rate of development. As shown in 
the most recent survey of the Department of Trade and Industry, MSMEs contribute almost 64.97% of the total jobs 
generated by all types of business establishments in all sectors and which also accounts for almost 99.6% of total 
registered enterprises. In developing countries, micro and small enterprises (MSEs) comprise the largest part of the 
industrial fabric and are among the most important development agents in society. MSEs offer many millions of poor 
people around the world the possibility of earning money, training, work experience and employment. However, 
empirical evidence shows that most small enterprises never develop the business beyond a certain scale and only a 
small minority of them manages to upgrade to the next level of productivity, income, and employment. 
 
On the other hand, quantitative criteria include the number of staff that works in the firm, the annual wages and salaries 
expenses, total annual revenue that the business produce, the value of the assets of the business which involve their 
materials, equipment's, properties and the like, and the share of ownership that is held by the owner-manager.

2778","are the following constraints, thus, the cost per unit for each product. Then, the researchers must determine the feasible 
value of X4, the maximum value of X4 will be the non-negative constraints. Given the condition that we now have 
the optimal values. It is now possible to solve for the optimal solution for X4, and optimal value as well. Then, with 
the optimal solution for stage 4, we proceed in determining the optimal solution and optimal value for Stage 3. As 
seen on Figure 5, by maximizing the optimal solution for stage 3, we take the value from the objective function and 
solve it accordingly. In solving, the researchers performed a direct substitution of the optimal values to find the optimal 
solution for stage 3. The same procedure was done by the proceeding stage until stage 1, which is the final stage 
(Figure 7).  
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The researchers think that the best option for the small baking business is to focus more on their best-selling product. 
Results shows that the ube roll and ube cheese pandesal are products that are high in demand compared to the other 
products. Moreover, the researchers also suggests to promote the other product that are low in demand. The business 
should add more products so that customers will have more choices in selecting which product they should buy.  
 
5.4 Validation  
Figure 9. LP Formulation with Solver 
Figure 10. Sensitivity Report 
To compare, the researchers also solved the problem using Excel Solver (Figure 9) given the Linear Programming 
Model that was formulated in solving the study (Figure 2). Figure 10 also shows a sensitivity report for each product 
given the Linear Programming Formulation of the problem.

arise are baked products, clothing line, accessories, and other items that are useful in the present situation. Big 
enterprises started from small enterprises that maintained their growth by identifying the important factors to consider 
when growing a business. This used the applications of LP model and Dynamic Programming in finding the optimal 
solution for the Sweet Delights Dessert Shop only. The data gathered are mainly based on the cost of the products, 
product mix, constraints, preferences that were used for the LP model that would help improve market strategy and

Abstract 
 
The advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and connected objects in recent years have created a paradigm shift in 
automotive systems, enabling more intelligent, safe, efficient, and comfortable transportation. The majority of the 
added value of these services was attained by consumers in developed countries. The mass-market consumers in 
developing countries, known as the Base of the Pyramid (BoP), were primarily excluded from capturing these added 
values. This study examined startup businesses that provide IoT services to BoP consumers. We conducted a case 
study in Iran, a country that experienced rapid population growth in the last 40 years, yet due to stagnated economic 
growth development, smart transportation systems remained unaffordable to consumers. However, in recent years, 
new IoT startups have emerged in Iran that offer smart transportation solutions. The focus of this study is to understand 
the adaptations made to the business model of these startups. We surveyed 250 individuals related to intelligent 
transportation systems namely from academic startups and incubators, automakers, component makers, services, and 
software solutions. The result of this study helps to provide nuances on business model innovations in the supply-side 
and demand-side of the value chain that enabled offering technology-based solutions to the mass market.

1. Introduction 
The advent of the Internet created a revolution in computers and how they were operated. The Internet quickly 
established itself as an excellent platform for resource sharing. Little by little, industries, organizations, and 
universities joined this huge database and they have also added information to this extensive network. Today, the 
Internet is large extensive information infrastructure, the primary purpose of which is to provide information via a 
global network of information infrastructure (Paiola and Gebauer, 2020). The Internet improved with increasing 
efficiency from providing information on the content to services, social media and has finally empowered the Internet 
of Things (IoT) that have made the connection between human and machine possible as shown in ‚ÄúFigure 1: The 
evolution of the Internet from its early stage to the Internet of Things‚Äù. The IoT further enabled a new stage of industry 
evolution called Industry 4.0.

6. Conclusion 
The study's findings provide empirical evidence to develop a model in innovative mobility businesses that offers value 
to low-income BOP consumers. This study adds to the growing body of research on smart urban transportation by 
focusing on the low-income mass market, a segment that has largely remained unstudied. Analysis of BMC reveals 
significant outcomes and offer solutions, particularly in customer relationship paths, key activities, key resources, and 
value propositions. The proposed business model, for example, states that companies should invest more in new ways 
of communicating with consumers, such as social networks and essential Internet services. One of the most significant 
findings of this study is that our research contributes to business model adaptations in urban transportation for the 
mass market consumers in developing countries. Furthermore, the most important approaches that knowledge-based 
companies operating in the IoT sector should take are to pay special attention to customer relationship processes, value 
propositions, key activities, and key resources. 
 
This research study can play a role in filling the gap of literature related to smart mobility business models as a starting 
point for future research, considering the obtained characteristics and emergence of smart mobilities technologies in 
developing countries. This study also targets a community that has previously received less attention in creating value-
creation strategies for businesses in articles with a technological approach.

Abstract  
 
Adoption of Industry 4.0 unlocks new opportunities for the manufacturing industry. Smart factories, cyber physical 
systems, artificial intelligence, internet of things, cloud computing and big data constitute 4IR components that offer 
new possibilities relative to current technologies. It is important to determine which of these 4IR technologies are 
implementable in a specific industry/geographical setting. In this paper, we investigate applicability of the 4IR 
technologies and the consequent impact upon global competitiveness for the foundry industry in South Africa. We 
further evaluated through a survey, the degree of awareness of Industry 4.0 amongst decision makers in the same 
industry, as well as potential barriers to implementation. The results reveal the potential of 4IR to enhance global 
competitiveness for the South African foundry industry. Significant obstacles however exist.

1. Introduction  
Several studies have revealed that productivity is crucial for economic growth, wealth creation and innovation 
(Schwab 2017; WEF 2018). Various economies have realized accelerated growth and development through 
industrialization (WEF 2018). The main challenges confronting manufacturing industry today is advancing 
globalization, mass customization and emerging disruptive technologies (Porter and Heppelmann 2014). New 
technologies facilitate development of new production processes (Vanli et al. 2018). Technology has made new 
products and services possible.  
 
The fourth industrial revolution (4IR), alternatively referred to as Industry 4.0 is progressively becoming a reality in 
various industries (Oztemel and Gursev 2018). 4IR is the modern trend of automation and data exchange in industries 
and is supported by modern digital technologies such as cyber physical systems (CPS), cloud computing, the internet 
of things (IoT), big data and artificial intelligence (Fatorachian and Kazemi 2018). Industry 4.0 enables smart factories 
and new manufacturing paradigms based on the adoption of new technologies (Robert et al. 2020). In addition, 
Industry 4.0 increases productivity and efficiency through smart and remote management (Felsberger et al. 2020). 
According to Oztemel and Gursev (2018), a smart factory constitutes an environment whereby production and logistics 
systems organize themselves without human interventions. Such facilities rely on Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) 
which links the physical and virtual worlds by communicating through an ICT infrastructure or IoT. According to 
Vanli et al. (2018), has the potential to effect complex transformation of the entire business. There are however 
significant challenges to overcome in the process of implementing 4IR (Schwab 2017). The more significant 
challenges include large capital investment, lack of skilled workers and IT security issues. Proper planning and 
preparation can assist to overcome these challenges (Skliton and Hovsepian, 2017). The transition remains complex 
(Hughes et al. 2020). 
 
Foundries are factories that specialize in the production of metal castings. The adoption of Industry 4.0 in the foundry 
industry potentially gives rise to a smart foundry (Lewis 2016). According to Vanli et al. (2018) a smart foundry is an 
adaptable production system capable to produce small lot sizes with good quality and cost efficiency. Foundries have 
been slow in adopting Industry 4.0 (Vanli et al. 2018). The foundry industry in South Africa arguably employs

2796","CPS in the foundries optimizes the production process, reducing set up times, processing times, labor and material 
costs. Another important finding was that CPS and IoT can enable a highly flexible production system with small lot 
sizes. Machines and equipment in smart foundries can be monitored/controlled remotely through the cloud system. 
This provides remote access to data on the machine ad process inputs to the benefit of quality. Integrated ERP systems 
directly link suppliers and customers, automatically adjusting orders and production volumes in real time. CPS enables 
workers to access and optimize machine set up virtually allowing improved quality and reduction in machine set up 
times. 
 
Augmented reality systems support additional provisions such as identifying product models on the production line 
and in warehouses as well as assigning equipment repair instructions through a mobile device. Smart foundries provide 
workers with real time information to enhance decision making and work procedures. Smart foundries can apply 
additive manufacturing such as 3D printing to prototype and manufacture components in small batches. Benefits of 
3D printing include reduced production costs, shorter product development cycles and reduction of design errors.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Manufacturing companies including foundries encounter challenges in the process of implementing Industry 4.0 
technologies.  A different skills set is required to operationalize 4IR technologies. Companies need to invest in the 
training of the relevant skills. 4IR will assist companies improve product quality, improve cost efficiencies and 
enhance competiveness for foundries in SA. There are significant barriers to implementation of 4IR technologies, 
these are however surmountable. 
 
Industry 4.0 assist foundries cope with flexibility requirements of the future. The working environment of the 
foundries is dangerous. Smart foundries will minimize human exposure to hazards such as extreme heat, dust, noise, 
vibrations and toxic fumes. Although it might take several years before smart foundries become widespread, it is 
crucial to work towards implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies.  
 
Future studies could focus on proposing a framework for implementation of Industry 4.0 in SA foundries which will 
generate more insight to managers and investors.

Abstract 
 
This paper focuses on metalworkers and welders, who in this study are referred to as small-scale manufacturers of 
aluminium and steel products. The Small Manufacturing Enterprises (SMEs) are often well-resourced with potential 
to positively contribute to the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) of the country and assist the government address 
unemployment issues and enhance skills development within the country. Despite the pivotal role played by the SME, 
the sector is still under researched, thus information regarding the sector‚Äôs contribution is still not well publicized. The 
objective of this study is to investigate and assess the contribution and effectiveness of the small-scale manufacturing 
of aluminium and steel products into the mainstream economy, focusing mainly on the Gauteng City Region (GCR). 
The quantitative data composition consists of registered and unregistered small-scale manufacturers of aluminium and 
steel products. It was collected through a questionnaire, extracted and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences (SPSS).

1. Introduction  
Small-scale industry consists of businesses which operate predominantly within the economy's informal sector. The 
staff composition usually is between 10 and 50 (TIPS 2016). These businesses are often characterized by cheap labour 
and limited ‚Äòformal‚Äô skills, rely on basic technology which still help them to produce minimal levels of output (Finnish 
Institute of Occupational Health 2012). A cause for concern emanating from the SMEs is the general lack of 
government business support which is widely documented in the literature (Timm 2011; Yusoff and Zainol 2012; 
Malefane 2013). Welding and metal working falls under the above-mentioned industry classification and as a result, 
it is statistically under reported. In support of the latter, Hussmanns (2003), reports that people engaged in casual self-
employment or extremely small-scale activities may not declare that they are employed in statistics surveys self-
employed, despite the fact that their work falls inside the enterprise-based definition, the informal sector. Generally, 
this automatically gives an impression or implicitly exclude their contribution to the broader economy as they are not 
accounted for. In fact, in metropolitan regions, the informal economy refers to a variety of economic entities that are 
mostly owned and operated by people, either alone or in conjunction with family members, which plays a significant 
role in the country‚Äôs GDP even though most of these units are not officially recorded in statistics. Klarita (2011), 
concurs with the assertions as she is of the view that the informal economy accounts for a sizable portion of developing 
countries‚Äô economies and is quickly expanding. For example, in 2021, the informal economy contributed an estimation 
of 18% of the total unemployment (Stats SA 2021a). The informal economy contributed roughly 10% of South Africa's

Abstract  
 
There are two popular ways to achieve mass customization of products: (a) creating design variants for various market 
segments using a common platform and, (b) considering human factors considerations so that the products fit the 
human capabilities and needs. The product platforming concept based on commonality of sub-systems/components 
across product variants has widely been used in industries to achieve the economies of scale. Many industries identify 
critical human factors considerations and address them during the early design stages. However, the integration of 
these two concepts to achieve greater mass customization is not explicitly discussed in the literature. This paper 
presents a general outline of the need to have such an integrated framework while designing mass customized products.

Abstract 
 
Cold Spray is a type of thermal metal spraying which uses heated gas/air to propel metal powder onto the surface of 
a substrate to create a coating or repair damaged or corroded metal components. The powder feedstock materials are 
spherical gas atomized metal powders ranging in size from 20-50 microns in diameter for best results. Cold spray 
systems use low temperatures ranging from 200-900 ¬∞C compared to existing additive manufacturing methods which 
use much higher temperatures to melt metal. These lower heating temperatures only semi-melt the metal powder 
particles allowing for them to undergo plastic deformation as they are deposited onto the surface of the substrate. The 
main objective of this project is to develop and characterize cold spray coatings using aluminum, copper, and nickel 
powders deposited on different substrates varying processing parameters. As cold spray can be used in different 
coating applications with a wide range of different metals and alloys, coatings have an unlimited range in applications 
where rapid repair and high-quality coatings are needed. The ease of use of this technology has a promising future in 
aerospace and defense applications as it provides a low-cost solution in corrosion prevention and repair of damaged 
components.

Abstract 
 
The work aims to energy saving in the curing process of Virginia tobacco, introducing solar energy and energy 
efficiency in a current stove. A prototype of an improved stove was adapted from a bulk-curing type stove, adding a 
roof solar air collector, thermal insulation, and a new heat recovery system.  The prototype was measured in six 
complete tests and compared with the conventional one during four tests. For an average process, the energy-saving 
of the proposed stove was 22.3% and the reduction of curing time 16.7%, with an average gas consumption of 0.60 
m3/kg. By campaign, this had a 20% of production increase, 6.7% of energy saving, and 41.03% of emissions 
reduction. The collector roof represents 65.7% of the total energy savings with a production of 0.77 MJ by dollar 
invested. The replacement project has financial and socio-economic feasibility. The socio-economic evaluation 
improves indicators compared with the conventional stove increasing the net profit by 33.37%; the net present value 
by 40.9%; the benefit-cost ratio by 7.9%; and the internal rate of return by 14.3%. The investment payback was in the 
half of the third year.

1. Introduction 
Within the framework of sustainable development, the inclusion of renewable energy into regional productions is 
essential. The United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (RIO+20) emphasized the need to increase the 
participation of renewable energy in the energy matrix and the adoption of regional planning actions. It's more 
remarkable to regions with renewable energy potential (Salim and Rafiq, 2012). 
 
In the province of Salta, Northwest of Argentine, agriculture is the main economic activity, and tobacco production 
stands out due to its socio-economic impact; it provides direct and indirect work to more than 130,000 people. The 
annual yield of cured tobacco is around 40,000 t, being 50% of the national production. The curing of Virginia-type 
tobacco uses particular stoves, being the stoves park approximately 6,000 for Salta and 15,000 for the entire country. 
Of these, around 85% consume natural gas, while the rest uses firewood. The annual consumption of natural gas for 
the Salta stoves park is approximately 4√ó107 m3/year (Rodr√≠guez and Zilocchi, 2012), and it produces 1√ó105 tCO2e 
of direct Carbon Footprint (Dib Ashur, 2013). 
 
Although the drying of agricultural products is an area with progress concerning the use of Solar Energy, there are 
few antecedents of its application in the tobacco curing process. Technical requirements of appropriate humidity and 
temperature for each stage of the process and their incidence on the final quality of the cured tobacco are some 
challenges to overcome.  It is significant in terms of environmental security to reduce fossil fuel consumption by 
improving the energy efficiency of the current process (Siddiqui, 2001). In this regard, tobacco curing has the highest 
incidence in the CO2 emission of the entire carbon footprint (Dib Ashur, 2013). 
 
In the bibliographic references, Huang and Toksoy used a North-South oriented greenhouse which consists of a 
transparent surface exterior to the stove as a solar collector glazing. The system had a gravel solar collector-storage 
system. A quality cured tobacco with 47-54% fuel saving compared to a conventional bulk-curing stove was obtained

5. Conclusion 
An improved prototype of a bulk-curing stove was built using solar technology and other actions for energy-saving 
purposes. These adjustments grew the thermal efficiency, decreasing the natural gas consumption and the curing time 
of the conventional bulk-curing stove. Concerning a control stove, the results were an energy-saving around 22.3% 
and a decrease of 16.9% on the curing time.  Concerning the bibliography reference, the energy-saving was 33.1%.

2826","The main changes in a traditional stove were (a) the conversion of the roof into a solar collector, (b) the accessing of 
preheated air from the roof to the heating unit, and (c) the heat recovery from the gas burner. Also, the incorporation 
of thermal insulation in the floor, perimeter walls, thermal bridges in the structure, and avoiding air leaks. 
 
Annually and concerning the control stove, the prototype has a 20% increase in production, 6.7% in energy saving, 
41.03% of GHG emissions reduction, and 17% less time. The total gas consumption was 22.4% lower than the control 
stove, with an average gas consumption was 0.60 m3/kg. The function of weight versus time adjusts with a linear 
regression of slope -0.39 % per hour from the initial weight. 
 
The improvements produce approximately 3 x 103 MJ of energy-saving by curing process with USD 4,178 
reconversion cost. The collector roof is the most convenient investment from the total energy savings, represents 
65.7% with 0.77 MJ by USD invested. 
 
The replacement project has financial and socio-economic feasibility. Compared with the financial analysis, the socio-
economic evaluation improves all indicators. This evaluation increases the net profit by 33.37%, the NPV by 40.9%, 
the IRR by 14.3%, and the BCR by 7.9%. The payback of the investment occurs in the half of the third year. 
  
The impact of the improved stove on the tobacco sector is through the energy saving, the decrease in curing time, the 
increase in curing number by stove during the campaign, and on environmental protection with the consequent 
reduction of greenhouse gases by non-consumed gas. All this declines the production costs, improving the sector's 
competitiveness. 
 
Despite these advantages, some barriers to this technology in the local context are the lack of appropriate channels for 
dissemination and the unstable socio-economic situation. Previously, the main was the energy subsidy that dismissed 
advances in energy efficiency. Besides, there is another cultural barrier from the producers. They have a fixed recipe 
for the process based on the final results obtained with a conventional stove. The producer needs concrete evidence 
about the new technology, which requires several years.

Abstract 
 
Currently, oxygen cylinders installed in an aircraft require refilling once to three times per production cycle for testing 
the oxygen system. Refilling a cylinder requires removal from the aircraft, transportation to the fill shop, performing 
the filling operation, returning to the aircraft, reinstallation, and retesting the oxygen system. Opportunity exist for 
damaging cylinders and contamination of the oxygen system along with adding a recurring potential for mistakes in 
the removal and installation of the cylinders and pressurization and depressurization of the system. 
 
A novel tool was developed to eliminate this lengthy and potentially hazardous way of working. Using the newly 
defined tool, oxygen cylinders no longer need removal from the aircraft. Only the pressure regulator must be removed 
from the cylinder assembly and the tool and fill cart attached to the cylinder, while remaining in its installed position. 
This process saves time and money as well as increases safety, both for personnel as well as for equipment. 
 
The tool is an assembly of existing qualified aircraft oxygen system parts and a pressure relief valve connected with 
copper based tubing. It is designed to minimize the potential fire hazard due to adiabatic compression heating during 
the filling operation.

Introduction 
Removal and installation of oxygen cylinders used for aviation emergency supplemental oxygen has been found to be 
a burdensome task for aircraft production lines as well as during aircraft servicing between flights.  The time 
considerations are important by themselves due to the leak tight connections that must be disconnected and 
reconnected between the aircraft oxygen system and the detaching and securing of the cylinders within the aircraft. 
The sometimes cramped spaces that must be navigated with tools and cylinders by aircraft oxygen technicians when 
removing or installing the cylinders, also requires careful moving in the aircraft compartments.  However, more 
important is the possibility of damaging the system connections or cylinders during the removal or installation process. 
There are abundant opportunities to scrap cylinders and equipment that are not designed to be handled often.  While 
the cylinders themselves are not fragile, nicks, and cuts to the composite outer coating is a quality defect that cannot 
be allowed for a new aircraft. Transportation of the cylinders from the aircraft to an oxygen shop, where the cylinders 
are refilled and inspected, and back also has a potential for delays due to tracking paperwork and waiting on a time 
slot in the oxygen shop.  Another concern is that dealing with high pressure oxygen is a safety hazard which demands 
a high level of training and concentration to limit the dangers of an ignition event. The potential for leaks that lead to 
an oxygen enriched atmosphere is multiplied by the number of times a cylinder is removed and installed.  Leak tests 
must be performed after each installation adding to the time the system is non-operational.

Estimated Benefits 
The estimated time savings per refill was calculated to be 2.58 hrs. with approximately 1600 cylinders being refilled 
each year. The time savings per year would be approximately 4,128 hours.  Actual tact time data and approximate 
cost savings for labor and reduction of scrap is not available for this paper. 
 
5. 
Conclusion 
The oxygen filling tool was found to be a new development in the realm of refilling oxygen cylinders aboard aircraft. 
It provides a safe and efficient means to avoid damaging cylinders due to removal and reinstallation after servicing in 
an oxygen shop. The ability to safely refill the oxygen cylinders while still installed in the aircraft saves time and 
prevents mistakes that may result in equipment scrapping and replacement or an oxygen fire. Testing and subsequent 
usage in the production environment provided proof that the tool works as designed and provides the time savings and 
reduced opportunity for equipment damage hypothesized.

Abstract  
 
Currently, Lean Manufacturing (LM) tools are crucial for economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This 
article reports a bibliometric analysis of LM applications in industry and their impact on the social, economic, and 
environmental sustainability they have obtained. The PRISMA methodology is used to identify 241 articles that are 
analyzed using the VOSviewer¬Æ software. From the analysis, the main authors who investigate the topic and the 
journal that publishes them, the countries in which it is published the most, the collaboration networks of the 
researchers, the main keywords, documents, and most-cited journals are identified. The results indicate that the 
countries India, the UK, and the USA are the ones that publish the most on these issues and that the UK and the USA 
have been pioneers in dealing with sustainability and LM issues.

1. Introduction 
Lean manufacturing is a production philosophy that integrates tools that significantly affect waste elimination through 
their application. LM represents a cultural change in the business organization with a high commitment from senior 
managers who decide to implement it and always offers a series of benefits, such as social, environmental, and 
economic (Tortorella et al., 2018). LM originated in Toyota, and its creator was Sakichi Toyoda and his sons: Kiichiro 
Toyoda and Eiji Toyoda. Sakichi Toyoda worked in the textile industry and invented a motor-driven loom with a 
specialized mechanism that would stop the device in case of thread breakage, pioneering the development of Jidoka 
(Human-made Automation).  
 
In 1922, Kiichiro Toyoda was impressed with the Ford Production System of the United States of America (USA) and 
decided to apply the solutions he learned on his return. Taichi Ohno was a manufacturing engineer working at TPS in 
1940 and carried the improvements until 1980 with advances in computing. Currently, LM applies to the automotive 
industry and can be applied to many other industries. It is not easy to create a structure for the LM implementation. 
Traditionally, the ""Toyota Production System House"" scheme has been used to quickly visualize the philosophy 
behind LM and the tools available for its application. It is explained using a house because it constitutes a solid 
structural system if the foundations and columns are strong. A broken abutment or set of tools would weaken the entire 
system.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this convergent parallel mixed methods design study was to determine the perspective of the Business 
Operation team and IT team during project team communication and interaction towards an awareness of the critical 
business processes and systems needed to ensure project success.  For companies to remain competitive, a catalyst for 
growth through software development projects is required. Impediments to successful software project outcomes include 
inefficient communication, one-sided team communication, siloed team interaction, lack of business knowledge, lack of 
information sharing, and insufficient training resources.   
 
The mixed methods research study included an in-depth review of the Business Operation teams' and IT teams' 
perspectives concerning team communication and interaction.  An Independent Sample T-test was conducted to 
understand the differences between the Business Operation team and IT team regarding General Communication, Team 
Communication, Team Interaction, and Project Outcomes.  The T-test results indicated a difference in the perspective 
between the groups with General Communication but no difference in the perspective of Team Communication, Team 
Interaction, and Project Outcomes.  The themes emerging from the qualitative component indicated an opportunity for 
training to acquire the knowledge and skills required to understand the underlying business process to facilitate a 
software project discussion.

Abstract 
 
Type I and II diabetic patients must measure their glucose level from 2 to 10 times daily by invasive 
methods, the most used device is the glucometer. This device causes many problems to patients, such as 
discomfort, fear, pain, and a strong economic spending. Nowadays, there are non-invasive methods that 
can determine the glucose level, but they are unaffordable for most people. Detecting peaks on 
electrocardiograms (ECG) signals is indispensable to calculate heart rate variability (HRV), also, 
plethysmography can be used to determine HRV, but it requires a precisely algorithm without signal gaps. 
Other researchers have found a strong relationship and statistical correlation between HRV and glucose 
level, but only limited statistical methods with non-representative databases had been used to estimate this 
correlation. Regression and classification methods were used to determine the glycemic status of healthy 
patients; HRV was the main physiological variable used. Designed PPG and ECG peak detectors were 99% 
accurate, this quality was critical to calculate a precise HRV. Machine learning methods results were 
positive; the best classification method was random forests with an exactitude of 85% and best regression 
method was an assembly between SVR, Lasso and Elasticnet models with an RMSD of 18.6621 mg/dl.

Abstract  
  
The availability of spare parts for automotive products is one part of after-sales service, which is a critical factor that 
must also be considered to support customer acceptance and maintain the sustainability of the sales of these products. 
The fluctuating characteristics of demand for spare parts is a challenge for automotive manufacturers in preparing 
inventory levels so that they are always available in the correct quantity and time when customers need them. This 
study adds the objective function of profit and constraint of fill rate and costs in the calculation of the optimization 
model and is applicable for probabilistic demand characteristics. In addition, inventory classification based on the 
results of profit and fill rate optimization can be utilized as a reference for companies to prioritize and review the 
inventory management of existing SKUs.   
  
Keywords

1. Introduction  
Continuous improvement efforts carried out by a company in maintaining and improving product quality must also be 
supported by suitable after-sales service activities. After-sales service is one of the critical keys to improving marketing 
performance and can increase customer loyalty in the long term. The scope of after-sales service activities are vast 
and varied, and one of them is the availability of service parts (spare parts).  
  
Spare parts inventory management is essential for every company in various sectors (Boylan & Syntetos, 2010). The 
characteristics of demand that have a high level of fluctuation in terms of type and quantity cause companies to have 
to prepare higher inventory levels to mitigate the risk of not meeting demand (Hu, Boylan et al., 2018). This high level 
of spare parts inventory, on the other hand, will have an impact on increasing the budget for inventory and inventory 
costs, and this will harm the company's profits and business continuity in the long term. Another problem that must 
be observed is the relatively large number of types of spare parts to control. With a tremendous amount of stock 
keeping unit (SKU) that has no proper inventory strategy, the company will find it difficult to determine which spare 
parts need to be prioritized and stay aligned with its business needs. Therefore, a grouping strategy is needed for the 
SKUs.  
  
Research on spare parts inventory has developed quite a lot in optimizing the amount of inventory and inventory 
classification, but not many have integrated the two. Examples of such non-integrated research included Vaez-Alaei 
(2018), which focuses on optimizing inventory and fill rates for case studies of aircraft spare parts, and Chawla et al. 
(2019) in research which focuses on developing classification methods with multiple criteria. Teunter et al. (2010) 
were the first to integrate inventory optimization and inventory classification with service level criteria and cost 
minimization objective functions. Millstein et al. (2014) developed inventory classification with profit and cost 
optimization criteria, even Yang (2017) in his research with profit and cost optimization, with non-stationary demand 
characteristics. However, both the research of Millstein et al. (2014) and Yang et al. (2017) did not make the fill rate 
the target parameter to be achieved. The three studies have not been able to answer the problems faced by many

2853","Additionally, an inventory classification analysis was conducted to learn more about the results of grouping or 
grouping SKUs based on the optimization of the development model that can be used as a reference for decision 
making in inventory management. Table 2 shows that 9050 SKUs were divided into groups G1 to G4, with interesting 
data that only G1 and G2 contributed positive profits, while G3 and G4 generated negative profits. Furthermore, each 
group's characteristics will be analysed to get a reference in the formulation of inventory policies. The parameters to 
be analyzed are related to the number of requests and part prices. Therefore, the SKU characteristics of each group are 
mapped into 4 zones based on the number of requests and part prices, i.e. zone A (low demand, low price), zone B 
(high demand, low price), zone C (low demand, high prices), zone D (high demand, high prices). The mapping of each 
group is shown in Figure 2.  
  
Figure 2 shows that the characteristics of SKUs in group 1 (G1) are dominant in zones B, C and D, which tend to have 
high demand and high prices, and almost none have low demand, low prices. These characteristics in G1 contributed 
greatly to income and profit. On the contrary, if we look at G3 and G4, they have the characteristics of low demand 
and low prices. The characteristics of the SKUs in G3 and G4 are low demand or slow-moving, which results in 
unfavourable profit conditions. By looking at this data, it can be used as a reference for company management to 
evaluate and improve SKUs in G3 and G4 to increase profits or at least reduce losses. The evaluation results can be 
in the form of a proposal to change SKUs with low demand/slow-moving from inventory items to non-inventory items 
(zero inventory) to reduce costs.

6. Conclusion   
This research produces mathematical models and algorithms for inventory optimization and inventory classification 
in an integrated manner and can be implemented in general on inventory models with characteristics at PT X and other 
companies with the same characteristics. Fluctuations influence the re-order point and order quantity decision 
variables for each SKU in demand, although with different sensitivity levels. Meanwhile, changes in costs have no 
effect on the decision variables. Applying the proposed model and algorithm can improve the company's business 
performance by increasing the total profit by 13.3% and the fill rate from 76% to 95.1%. Inventory classification is 
divided into four groups sorted by the optimization value of PS (Performance Score), with the top 2 groups contributing 
positive profits and the other two groups contributing negative profits. In this study, improvements to the spare parts 
business operations were carried out on the 'supply' side, while from the 'demand' side, it was still wide open for 
development. In the future, the analysis can further elaborate on the demand patterns and very diverse characteristics

an optimal grouping or classification following the company's business needs.

Abstract 
 
Fleet maintenance is the process fleet manager utilizes to manage fleet and asset information from acquisition to 
disposal. It helps the companies reduce costs, improve efficiency and safety. Second Harvest of Metrolina Food Bank 
(SHMETROLINA) distributed over 70 million pounds of food and household items to approximately 800 partner 
agencies in 2019. With the critical need for transportation for distribution, a vehicle experiencing downtime will 
disrupt scheduled routes to partner agencies and increase repair costs for SHMETROLINA. This research developed 
an interactive dashboard using R shiny to help non-profit food bank fleet managers make informed decisions for 
effective fleet maintenance operations and support the food bank operations to meet hunger needs. The dashboard 
consists of the visualizations of the maintenance cost, mileage, and operational cost for individual and fleet vehicles 
from the data collected by the food bank.

1. Introduction 
Food insecurity is defined as an individual or household‚Äôs inability or limited access to safe and nutritious food they 
need for an active, healthy life (Campbell, 1991; Coleman-Jensen, Gregory & Singh, 2014). According to USDA 
Economic Research Service, 10.5 percent of U.S. households were food insecure in 2020, where 6.6 percent (8.6 
million households) had very low food insecurity (USDA, 2021). Feeding the Carolinas is a non-profit program 
working to solve and prevent food insecurity in North Carolina and South Carolina. The program currently has 10 
Feeding America Food Banks across North Carolina and South Carolina. These 10 Food Banks distribute perishable 
goods to several different counties throughout North Carolina and South Carolina. As part of Feeding the Carolinas, 
Second Harvest of Metrolina (SHMETROLINA) is located in Charlotte, North Carolina. SHMETROLINA has a 
regional distribution warehouse and three branches that supply grocery items to over 800 partner agencies in North 
Carolina and South Carolina. Over 70 million pounds of food and household items were distributed to 24 counties in 
2019-2020, as seen in Figure 1. 42 million pounds were fresh produce, meat, and dairy. SHMETROLINA serves a 
population of over 553,000 people, including almost 182,000 children and 48,000 seniors. The food bank distributes 
food from the central warehouse in Charlotte and through their smaller branches in Hickory, NC, Anderson, SC, and 
Spartanburg, SC. 
 
SHMETROLINA is a non-profit organization where 80 percent of the food is donated, 7 percent is received from 
other food banks, and approximately 13 percent of the food comes from government commodities. These foods need 
to be delivered to partner agencies through a fleet of vehicles. SHMETROLINA has 36 vehicles, of which seven are 
out of service, that distribute to over 800 partner agencies. With a critical need for transportation for distribution, a 
vehicle experiencing downtime disrupts scheduled routes to partner agencies. Unfortunately, currently, 
SHEMETROLINA does not have a practical approach to increase its fleet's life span, and the donations do not 
contribute to the maintenance of the vehicles. Specifically, SHMETROLINA is facing the following challenges: ‚Ä¢ 
Difficulty to predict the time for repair maintenance; Lack of funds for maintenance; Unstructured information in 
decision-making in fleet maintenance.  
 
The objectives of this research are to collect maintenance data from SHETROLINA and develop an interactive 
dashboard by integrating data analytics with visualization tools to extract useful information that can help food bank

2862","Recommendations analyzed from the interactive dashboards for SHMETROLINA would be to distribute truck's 
mission types between truck's age or manufacturer. The trucks should be evenly distributed for mission types based 
on age and size. Older trucks should distribute shorter distances, while newer trucks can distribute to farther locations. 
Using the thermometer plot to get the status of the truck‚Äôs preventive maintenance schedule, to help reduce vehicle 
downtimes. The change in PM schedule will also help lower fleet cost by avoiding unexpected repair costs and rental 
costs to operate the fleet. Route planning and analyzing drivers would decrease fuel usage, fuel cost, and frequent tire 
replacements. Telematics software would benefit the foodbank by collect accurate information for routes and drivers 
handle.  
 
6. Conclusion  
This research developed an interactive dashboard to assist food bank fleet managers to make data driven decisions. 
The interactive dashboard allows the fleet managers to detect the trend, identify potential problematic areas and take 
preventive actions. This research provides a way to integrate analytics with visualization to assist fleet management 
for a nonprofit organization. Finding of this research will benefit non-profit organizations that depend on distribution 
to reduce vehicle downtime, maintenance cost, or reduce errors related to fleet management decision-making. We 
have shown through visualization results that proper decision-making techniques can improve the overuse of vehicles 
and inefficient PM scheduling. However, the data collected in this study was limited to one fiscal year, and a more 
detailed analysis using at least five years of data (when available) could improve the effectiveness of the dashboard.

Abstract 
The problem that influences the world on energy is climate change and until we increase our alternative sources the 
world will continue to face the energy issue. Besides, greenhouse gas emission is a main issue which is related with 
current energy access. Another global energy issue is hundreds of millions of people lack access to sufficient energy. 
In addition, depletion of natural resources become other crucial issue due to global energy consumption is growing in 
tandem with population growth, energy dependent patterns of usage composed with technological advancements. This 
study aims to focus on alternative power generation from renewable and hybrid sources in techno economic as a 
countermeasure for current energy sources issue in isolated communities which remote from the existing electricity 
transmission and distribution infrastructure. HOMER Pro software and RETScreen software are used to analyze best 
optimization of hybrid renewable energy system and check financial viability. A comparative analysis is done for 4 
cases of energy: solar PV, wind, hydropower, and biogas to obtain estimation of Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized 
Cost of Energy (LCOE) and renewable fraction. His work also determines IRR, simple payback and energy production 
costs.

1. Introduction 
Greenhouse gas emissions is a major issue which is related to current energy access. Another global energy challenge 
is hundreds of millions of people lack access to sufficient energy. In addition, depletion of natural resources become 
other crucial issues due to global energy consumption is growing in tandem with population growth, energy dependent 
patterns of usage composed with technological advancements. The global population was 6.84 billion in 2009, rose to 
7.59 billion in 2018 (World Bank 2020), and worldwide energy consumption rose from 482 Mtoe to 583 Mtoe in 10 
years, an average yearly rise of 1.60 percent (British Petroleum (BP 2020). Furthermore, global electric energy usage 
was 17,355 TWh in 2009 and rose to 22,964 TWh in 2018, representing a 3.23 percent rise (Esteban and Leary 2012; 
Siti Masyita Noraziman et al. 2019; United Nations 2019). 
 
International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates the annual average household usage in remote areas is 1,250 kWh will 
power four lightbulbs for five hours a day, one refrigerator, a fan for six hours a day, a cell phone charger, and a 
television for four hours a day as of standard devices (International Energy Agency (IEA 2021). The accelerated usage 
of electrical devices because of technological advancements is the key reason for the higher growth rate of energy 
consumption than the global population and primary energy demand. Many countries have been forced to explore for 
alternative ways to fulfil their energy needs because of this situation (Rahman et al. 2019; Rahman et al. 2018). 
Renewable energy utilizations can counteract the current energy challenges such as greenhouse gas emissions, 
insufficient energy access and depletion of natural resources (Bayrak and Cebeci 2014). Exploration of new renewable 
energy is one of main factor for the transition from natural resources to alternative and diversified resources. Similarly, 
to fight with energy access challenge for remote population, the combination of more than one energy sources is 
advantageous for distributing power generation, where it would be economically unfeasible to connect these 
consumers to the centralized generation infrastructure (Esteban and Leary 2012).

5. Conclusions 
Comparing all results from HOMER Pro analysis and RETScreen¬Æ analysis, hybrid energy system of solar PV, diesel 
generator and storage system is the best choice to do investment in small scale. For this system, the NPC value and 
LCOE value is the lowest. Besides renewable energy fraction is more than 50% which is 68%. Then, refer to 
RETScreen¬Æ analysis, energy production cost is the lowest RM 0.29 only and has higher annual savings and revenue. 
This proposed system has fastest simple payback at 8.7 years only. Other than this system, hybrid energy system 
consists of hydropower, solar PV, and storage system. Although, the energy production cost is under third rank after 
number three, but as known wind speed in selected area is not enough to generate electric power. For the situation of 
any malfunction of solar PV, wind turbine will not be able to supplement the shortage due solar PV failure, thus 
combination of hydropower and solar PV is better choice.

Abstract 
 
A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a real dynamic system that can simulate its current conditions, predict its 
future behavior, and log valuable information about its internal operation and interactions with other systems. A key 
feature is the capability of automatic bidirectional information flow between virtual and physical worlds. The objective 
of this work is to create a Living Lab for the demonstration of interacting urban Digital Twins under the United 
Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goals of sustainable cities and communities, health and wellbeing, and industry, 
innovation, and infrastructure. By using a network of sensing devices mounted on a vehicle, the proposed system is 
capable of processing real-life data through edge computing, modeling software and Machine Learning algorithms. 
With the processed information, a 3D virtual representation of urban spaces and the vehicle itself, the interactions 
between both subjects and the evolution of each is enabled. This approach of Digital Twin technology for urban spaces 
has significant value when it comes to analyzing a community‚Äôs evolution, mobility, a vehicle‚Äôs dynamic behavior, 
and its interaction with urban infrastructure. This work presents the proposed methodology for developing Digital 
Twin concepts for urban spaces and vehicles as well as their respective characteristic components.

1. Introduction 
Digital Twins (DT) are an emergent technology which has seen a recent surge in case studies mostly centered on the 
development of DTs for smart cities, building information models and manufacturing applications. With case studies 
on smart cities and urban spaces, some applications of DTs revolve around the target of accurately modeling the 
evolution of urban spaces, living standards and the interaction of people with infrastructure, buildings, mobility, etc. 
Certain interest has risen with respect to having more insight on infrastructure, citizen feedback, and building 
information models. This insight is of great value towards city planning, disaster prevention and improving 
accessibility for everyone. The basic architecture of a DT as proposed by Campos-Ferreira et al. (2019) is composed 
of three aspects: the physical world, digital world, and the connectivity between both. Automatic bidirectional flow of 
information between physical and digital worlds is what allows a DT to accurately represent real-life conditions and 
evolve through time as well and to have an impact on the physical twin. For each aspect, there are several devices and 
methods that work together. For instance, the physical world requires a network of sensing devices that generate input 
for the DT, and a series of methods is necessary to ensure connectivity between worlds, etc. 
 
United Nations¬¥(UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (United Nations, 2015) were considered to direct the 
objectives towards sustainable development, citizen wellbeing and smart mobility. The target SDGs are the following: 
‚Ä¢ 
Goal 3 ‚Äì To ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. 
o 
Through this SDG, a DT may allow the analysis of an urban space in terms of security and infrastructure to 
determine wellbeing and health within a specific area. This information could also be used as insight towards 
improving living standards (White et al. 2020). 
‚Ä¢ 
Goal 9 ‚Äì To build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster 
innovation.

2880","5.3 Validation 
The validation process is very important when it comes to evaluating and validating systems or models that represent 
real objects or processes. In our case, since the digital models are desired to produce calculations and conclusions on 
the behavior of their physical twins, these need to be as accurate and precise as possible to present the most real 
information as possible. For our system experiments, the validation process is carried out by comparing absolute true 
values to those output by our design system. In the case of the mapping module, distances and altitude is evaluated 
through percent error and RMSE calculations. 
 
When the system and individual models are complete, the use of other validation techniques are necessary. For our 
work, the Grieve‚Äôs Tests of Virtuality (GTV) will be performed to evaluate the ability of our models to mirror their 
physical twins. These GTV consists of three tests: sensory visual, performance, and reflectivity (Juarez et al. 2021) 
where the behavior similarity of both physical and virtual worlds is evaluated. 
 
‚Ä¢ 
Sensory Visual Test: A tester subject demands a movement either from the DT or the physical twin and if 
the tester cannot differentiate among the real system and the DT, this test is approved. 
‚Ä¢ 
Performance Test: The tester demands an action from both twins and if it cannot differentiate the performance 
among both, this test is approved. 
‚Ä¢ 
Reflectivity Test: The tester demands information on the current state of the object, if there is no difference 
between the data from the physical and virtual twin, this test is approved. 
 
5.4 Proposed Improvements 
With respect to the accuracy of the 3D urban space visualization, more research is needed to determine the adequate 
set of tools need to generate the most accurate maps. Automated PC classification algorithms have a 90% accurate 
classification percentage that, when used with tools like geospatial deep learning (DL) models packages, can be 
increased. These DL packages have already been trained by Esri with high volumes of geospatial information and 
could extract building footprints, land cover classification and tree point classification. 
 
LIDAR terrestrial sensing has limited ranging capacity in terms of a 3D space. As mentioned earlier, using this method, 
knowing the height for objects is not possible. Using drones for aerial LIDAR sensing is a good option to increase the 
level of detail (LOD) of the objects being registered, but specially of buildings, allowing to calculate the real height 
to objects, gather more data and create a better 3D representation. However, this data acquisition architecture will 
bring increased complexity and components to the system. Autodesk programs like Revit, Civil 3D or City Engine 
from ESRI, could enable a better LoD for buildings and infrastructure, allowing asset evaluation in several situations 
or simulations like energy consumption, flooding risk, zoning regulation, among others (Autodesk, 2020). These will 
be explored and assessed to determine their participation and interoperability with this project‚Äôs system. 
 
In terms of the vehicle‚Äôs DT, the use of the CAN Bus has presented challenges when it comes to decoding signals. For 
instance, each vehicle manufacturer will operate under different IDs and CAN protocols, meaning signals will never 
be decoded or identified in the same way on different vehicles. This challenge becomes even greater if the system is 
desired to have widespread adoption. A proposed improvement is developing an external network of sensors to 
measure the desired signals instead of having to sniff the vehicle‚Äôs private CAN Bus. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Urban spaces DTs, requires a lot of systems, layers‚Äô integration, and software interoperability, making it a design and 
management challenge. Working with statical data allows to understand how information could be processed for an 
increased LoD and integration level of modeled objects. One of the key improvements to enhance this DT system is 
utilizing real-time data from the different devices and processing them using edge processing techniques to obtain 
high quality and high-fidelity simulations and predictions. This will enable higher levels of maturity and integration. 
Before moving to automatic bidirectional information flow, individual system evaluation and validations processes 
need to be carried out to ensure maximum accuracy and precision. After this phase, the connection between all systems 
and platforms is the next challenge. 
 
With the current results, the system may already be classified in a maturity level 1 according to the DT maturity 
spectrum index. However, once the system is complete and once it is validated, a level 2 and even level 3 of maturity 
will be achieved. The static information and real-time information will come from the sensing devices mounted on

2889","the vehicle. This will also demonstrate the interaction between an urban space DT and a vehicle DT concept. 
Furthermore, the current system may be classified as a SoS level hierarchy and an integration level of Digital Shadow. 
When the system is complete, the integration will be classified as a Digital Twin. A lot of work needs to be done with 
the interoperability and connectivity of platforms and devices. It is a special challenge when it comes to real-time data 
processing, and enabling technologies such as ML, Big Data, DL, IoT and edge processing have a great role. 
 
The objective of creating the Living Lab for the demonstration of the interaction between DTs is still to be reached, 
but with the current developments and experiments of the system, a solid foundation is being set that will facilitate 
the further development of the system and the DT concept. This initial development of a vehicle‚Äôs DT and initial steps 
for urban spaces is the first step of creating the LL. Working under UN‚Äôs SDGs has also provided a more defined 
framework for our system objectives and focus and has allowed the team to work under the focus of sustainable 
innovations. The project transcends technological improvements but considers societal impact and future societal 
needs which adds great value to the core value of this work. This research has a direct contribution to vehicle DT 
concept development for performance management and urban space and smart community DT systems 
interoperability with sensing devices and other DTs.

Abstract 
In an attempt to manage university business process in an integrative manner, we have shown in our previous 
study that resulted in modelling and mapping university business process level 0 and level 1.  This research paper 
aim to go further in modelling and mapping University Business Process University in Indonesia to level 2. Using 
SIPOC diagram, ADLI dimension and excellence indicators from the Malcolm Baldrige Criteria for Performance 
Excellence (MBCfPE), we manage to model and map 51 (fifty-one) processes of level 2 in a simple but inclusive 
form. This integrated business process result has been possible by utilizing QPR Process design and analyser 
software. Further study still needed to map and model the process to the next level as necessary so that it will be 
detail enough to develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that will be ready to connect to dashboard 
performance management system.

Introduction 
Business processes have become a dominant and popular topic in various literature (Davenport 1993), but 
organizational resistance to change is often miscalculated which is the cause of reengineering failures of the 
program (Davenport, 1965). As a consequence, each time talking about the process, it is always analogies with 
reengineering and streamlining the organization (Rumler, 2004). Recently, our ability to measure and improve 
process performance has increased greatly as a result of increased utilization of information systems in the 
management of processes within the organization. Process management strategy will help organizations optimize 
benefits from implementing the system.

know that by mapping and modelling business process integrated, it will help a lot in managing organizational 
business process that is known to be complex. Further study would be to use metrices in measuring process 
performance that could help improve measurement system dashboard of the organization.

Abstract 
 
Within the context of high precision robotics fields such as surgery, machinery requires the utmost accuracy. This 
paper introduces the method of proportional gyroscopic movement, applied through iterative testing with Lego 
Mindstorms EV3 technology. Consequences of unstable robotics on an industrial level can be as severe as death of a 
patient. To counteract the influence of external motion upon the linear movement of a robot, the gyroscopic algorithm 
(‚Äúgmove‚Äù) being tested was applied to an educational Lego EV3 rover robot to perform along a laser straight reference 
line. Across all trials, gyroscopically oriented movement demonstrated superiority in both precision and consistency, 
bringing to light a novel method of precision movement in the robotic industry.

1. Introduction 
The first three years of experiences in FIRST Lego League (‚ÄúFLL‚Äù) robotic competition, particularly the failures and 
challenges during the robot design stage and competition, the author was inspired to pursue in-depth study in robot 
design and programming. It became obvious that higher precision movement of the robot is one key element of scoring 
higher and winning the FLL robot game. Throughout the fourth and fifth year, the author did further research, 
experiments, made significant improvements to the robot making it capable of moving with higher precision and 
eventually reached champion level of the FLL seasons in the local Silicon Valley district of California and the 
international arena at Razorback Invitational by the University of Arkansas, USA. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
This research project is aimed at discovering any possibilities of higher precision robot movement using non-
industrial, educational Lego Mindstorms EV3 (‚ÄúEV3‚Äù). The FLL robot game competition only allows original Lego 
bricks such as RCX, NXT, EV3, SPIKE Prime, original Lego parts, original Lego sensors, and original Lego 
programming environments. 
 
In the FLL competition arena, the educational EV3 robot is considered sufficiently accurate if it can hit the target 
within plus minus 10 millimeters deviation. At this condition, the robot can still perform the next tasks such as reaching 
or capturing objects that are usually much larger than 10 millimeters in size. This project is to attempt robot movement 
accuracy within plus minus 10 millimeters. 
 
1.2 Scope 
The primary focus of this project is on designing a rover type of robot commonly used in FLL robotic competition. A 
rover robot is typically driven by a pair of motors capable of moving in a straight or curved line, forward or backward

2900","speed. In particular, at speed 100%, more dots in Figure 14 are within the target plus minus 10 millimeters accuracy. 
A better result may still be possible by further fine tuning the fminspeed, fru, frd input parameters. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This project indeed discovered the possibilities of higher precision robot movement using non-industrial, educational 
Lego Mindstorms EV3. The use of Lego gyro sensors made it possible to control and keep the EV3 rover robot 
movement on target path. The implementation in gmove command and its unique approach in combining proportional 
gyro control with acceleration deceleration control have demonstrated significant improvements. 
 
Within the limitation of FLL competition rule, the educational EV3 robot movement using gmove is sufficiently 
accurate where the robot is now capable to arrive at the destination point within plus minus 10 millimeters deviation. 
This not only meets the original goal of this research but also proven satisfactory when used in real world FLL robot 
game competition participated by the author, improved robot game scores, winning the robot performance award 
category.

Abstract 
 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are key enablers to achieve the objectives of public transportation and transit 
policies. These systems make it possible to optimize the use of the existing tools and resources by increasing the 
control, effectiveness, efficiency and safety of transport systems and infrastructure, to better accommodate and 
manage the growing demand for mobility. This is achieved with the implementation of low-cost technologies that 
allow the monitoring and acquisition of data to consecutively create enough databases that are used by public and / or 
private entities for decision-making based on, management and future planning of the infrastructure.  
 
Driving style refers to the way the driver operates the vehicle's controls in the context of the driving scene and external 
conditions such as, day of the week, time of day, weather, weather conditions, road type and the emotional state of 
people, among others. Commonly, previous studies can be classified into two groups: survey or questionnaire studies 
and studies based on the variables (i.e Characteristics Parameters- CP‚Äôs)  that describe the behavior when while the 
vehicle is running. Some advantages to driving styles recognition and classifying task are: to save more than 25% of 
fuel consumption when good driving styles, improve the utilities of ADAS Systems in automated vehicles and  energy 
management system. 
 
In addition, driving cycles are developed as a tool to describe driving patterns through CP's, in some cases, including 
fuel consumption. Also, they seek to reproduce real driving conditions with good precision and therefore, through 
them it is possible to classify driving styles based on statistical measures ( i.g standard deviation, mean square error - 
MSE). 
 
The project aims to address mobility problems in the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga by answering the question 
of what are the habits or driving styles of people in the region? From the implementation of an On-board monitoring 
system (OBD- II) for a sample of light vehicles greater than 15, recording data second by second for 4 months, which 
will allow, to develop a local driving cycle more representative and at the same time, classify the driving styles that 
help to adequately describe the driving pattern in the city from statistical methods. Finally, by identifying driving 
styles, it is possible to know what the driver's habits are when facing the different driving conditions, and thus establish 
the future work to solve mobility needs existing in the city.

Abstract  
 
The transformation of cities is key to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) in the near 
future. The worsening climate crisis urges to long-term solutions which orientate the development of cities to be more 
sustainable and livable spaces. Urban planning remains as a complex task and, therefore, benefits from the use of 
technology to better assess the actual needs of cities and find the best way to conjugate the already existing resources 
towards smarter and more accessible places. Hence, this study focuses on the implementation of UrMoAC, a tool 
developed by the German Aerospace Center, to obtain useful data about the San Francisco Bay Area which in return 
can be utilized to shape and guide planning processes oriented to promote urban accessibility and the SDG.  The 
results demonstrate that the urban areas of San Francisco Bay Area have good accessibility levels to public primary 
schools and help to understand the dynamic environment of the cities involved and plan accordingly to create smart 
mobility.

1. Introduction  
Cities around the world need immediate transformation to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), defined 
by the United Nations. The SDG are an urgent call for action from all countries as a result of a global partnership. 
They provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future (United 
Nations 2015). Therefore, immediate changes need to be made in the way cities are planned and structured. Planning 
plays a significant role in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. Two of the largest contributors of greenhouse 
gases - transportation and buildings - are influenced by planning decisions and policies (American Planning 
Association 2021). 
   
However, to design and plan a city is necessary to know how the city operates. Since information and communication 
technology affects positively urbanization and directly improves urbanization levels and efficiency (Wang, 2021), 
technology should be used as a new methodology for urban analysis and transformation This paper presents Urban 
Mobility Accessibility Computer (UrMoAc); it is a scientific tool for computing accessibility measures, 
supporting aggregation, variable limits, and intramodality (Krajzewicz et al. 2017) developed by the Institute of 
Transport Research of the German Aerospace Center. It allows to know in a quantitative and empirical way the 
performance of a city, considering the urban structure of the city, the urban morphology, the transport modes, the 
different destinations, and the variability of traffic depending on the time in which it is transited. This tool is easy to 
use, so cities all over the world can make use of it, as well as make analysis at different scales (metropolitan 
areas, counties, cities, etc.). Knowing the accessibility of a city is a step forward towards smart mobility and it can 
help the decision makers to have a guide of what needs to be done to improve the urban environment for citizens, in 
terms of security, air quality, economic opportunities, etc. 
  
In this study, we will analyze the usefulness of the UrMoAc tool to visualize variables such as travel time and distance 
to essential destinations, such as an elementary school, and how they can influence climate change, since longer 
travels imply greater CO2 emissions.

2918","5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The versatility of the UrMoAc tool makes it possible to use it in different applications. In this study, the specific case 
of co-pollutant generation depending on distance and travel time was analyzed. However, an interesting application 
for future research is the comparison between cities with different urban development and main transport modes. For 
example, a city which main transport modes is the bicycle or the electric car, versus another one which uses more 
individual motorized transportation, or public transportation. This comparison can help identify trends in cities with 
less pollution and implement them in cities with more pollution.  
The tool also allows for easy visualization of the information obtained, which can facilitate the identification of the 
city's distribution that could help the government recognize the areas of opportunity for development. For instance, 
the tool can detect places with a lack of green areas, or where access to schools and hospitals is scarce, to design and 
plan the necessary improvements.   
  
5.4 Validation  
A similar analysis was made for the article ‚ÄúAssessing Urban Accessibility in Monterrey, Mexico: A Transferable 
Approach to Evaluate Access to Main Destinations at the Metropolitan and Local Levels‚Äù developed by researchers 
from Tecnologico de Monterrey (Gaxiola-Beltr√°n et al. 2021). The study focuses on the analysis of accessibility at 
metropolitan level (Monterrey Metropolitan Zone), and at local level (Distrito Tec area) in the surroundings of 
Tecnologico de Monterrey. It demonstrates with the use of UrMoAc tool, that at the city of Monterrey, Mexico the 
levels of accessibility at the metropolitan level are divergent depending on the desired destination from different areas 
of the city. At the local level, the Distrito Tec area was analyzed to diagnose to what extent it could be considered 
a 15-minutes city. The results showed that it does not meet the desired parameters, but that there is a considerable 
increase in accessibility when bicycles are used as the main mode of transportation. It was possible to observe trends 
that this city is following as well as to mention some recommendations that could be made when planning an 
improvement in the accessibility and sustainability of the city (Gaxiola-Beltr√°n et al. 2021).  
With this application, we can validate the use of UrMoAc tool as an aid to understand the operation of the city and 
be able to know some trends that help to plan the cities of the future.   
  
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, changes must be implemented in cities to make them more sustainable aligned with the SDGs. 
Therefore, the use of technology emerges as a great help to understand the operation of the city and thus apply the 
necessary improvements depending on each situation. With the results obtained by applying the UrMoAc tool, we can 
confirm its usefulness and versatility since it allows to know in a very fine level of detail the operability of a city 
considering its urban structure, morphology, transport modes and destinations. These characteristics make it a valuable 
tool for designing and planning the cities of the future. Moreover, it is an easy-to-use tool that can be adapted to the 
needs of different places to develop smart mobility all over the world.

Abstract  
  
The present study determined by simulation, the energy efficiency of the internal configuration of the electric traction 
systems: simple traction (case 1) and in-wheel system (case 2), using a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) 
with a field oriented control (FOC). The study proposes an analysis in the VSI (Voltage Source Inverter) topology 
where the design of each configuration is explained and an energy efficiency analysis is presented taking into account 
the power losses in each configuration through simulation in PSIM (Powersim). Finally, the results are tested in a 
traction system model of the ADVISOR (Advance Vehicle Simulator) in the UDDS driving cycle where the energy 
efficiency of each configuration is determined.

1. Introduction  
Electric Vehicles today have surpassed expectations worldwide. Many manufacturers have focused their research and 
development on making their vehicles more efficient by considering improvements in the Battery system and power 
inverters.    
1.1 Objectives  
Analyze the configurations of electric traction systems with a wheel motor and single traction.  
Simulate the selected configurations in the PSIM software.  
Analyze the efficiency of each configuration, this implies a study of losses in the power block of each system. Validate 
the simulations of each configuration in the ADVISOR software.  
  
2. Literature Review   
The technology in batteries that guarantees greater energy efficiency, energy density, autonomy, without memory 
effect, among other characteristics is lithium-ion batteries (Ramachandran et al.2019). In the power block, studies 
show that the energy efficiency of a three-phase inverter can reach 96.74% using silicon carbide elements (SiC) 
(Ozdemir et al. 2016).  
The configuration with simple Traction (Figure.1) is the configuration with the greatest presence on the market. The 
motor is responsible for supplying traction in the vehicle (front or rear), which is controlled by a single inverter, the 
position and material of the battery depends of the manufacturer.

Abstract 
 
The promotion of interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) areas is a priority in the 
current and future context of Mexico, evidenced through concrete actions, both public and private. As such, there is a 
need for tools to accurately measure vocational interest to effectively promote STEM education. According to Holland 
Occupational Themes theory, vocational interest can be conceived as an aspect of personality. There is empirical 
evidence supporting personality prediction using neurophysiological signals. Therefore, vocational interest may be 
predicted using similar data. The objective of this study is to develop an intelligent system that estimates engineering 
interest in children through their physiological response to engineering-related activities. The participants were 13 
children between 6 and 15 years old. For each participant, 8 different electroencephalographic channels were 
measured, as well as the electrodermal activity, heart rate variability, facial gesticulation, and body temperature data 
for four 2-hour sessions of engineering-related extracurricular educational activities. Psychometric tests were also 
included to evaluate the children‚Äôs interest in specific engineering fields according to their learning activities. The 
generated data was processed and used to design a machine learning algorithm. The results and implications are 
discussed.

1. Introduction 
Many countries are struggling to employ more people in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) 
industries who are trained in the design and use of technologies capable of advancing national production (Kier 2014). 
The Mexican government has implemented public policies with the purpose of strengthening the STEM education 
system. Based on this, projects have been developed in the private and public sphere to promote interest in these 
professional fields. To study the effects of such initiatives, the project must be able to evaluate in a standardized, 
efficient, and precise way the interests and capabilities of individuals in STEM areas. Furthermore, interest not only

Abstract 
 
Today, pollution and sustainability are two important aspects of the global agenda; however, economic growth is 
also an important but challenging factor that helps to minimize climate change and maximize society's progress. 
This article analyses the behavior of the Bullwhip Effect specifically in Mexico's transport and logistics sector during 
the period 2004 ‚Äì 2017 as well as in the Northern States of Mexico and several OECD countries, taking into account 
the economic contractions that have happened as well as the existence of the sustainable phenomenon, applying a 
proposed model based on the Cobb-Douglas function and using the Time Series and Data Panel techniques using 
the stochastic frontier model (SFA). The objective of this article is to detect the sustainable inventory limits of 
Mexico's Transport and Logistics Sectors when the Bullwhip Effect arises, representing the above in useful 
applications for temporary measures obtaining economic and sustainable benefits.  The results show that the 
maximum sustainable Bullwhip Effect limit for the logistics & transport sector in the northern states of Mexico is 
23.1%  and in several OECD countries is 40.0%.

1. Introduction  
 
The phenomenon of the Bullwhip Effect arises when the high trend of orders is presented to suppliers and higher 
than the sales themselves, in other words, the demand initiated by the customer is progressively amplified through 
the links of the supply chain (Lee et al. 2014). Its implications are varied as it relates directly to supply, demand, 
inventories, business cycles, and consequently with affectation to all links in the supply chain. This study 
phenomenon was analyzed in 1958 by Forrester, who has been regarded as the father of this study phenomenon, 
which by the way before being coined as ""Bullwhip Effect‚Äù, until the 1990s this had been known as the ""Forrester 
effect"" (Udenio 2014). 
 
However, within the classic contexts in which the bullwhip effect relates such as demand signal processing, 
reasoning games, batch order, price fluctuations (Lee et al. 1997), there is a context in which it has gained remarkable 
relevance in recent decades and which has inserted uncertainty not only to companies but also to human existence 
itself: climate change and sustainability (Turrisi and Bruccoleru 2012), (Dahl et al. 2007). Several fields of study 
have inserted the sustainability variable as an active participant within the Economy (Labandeira et al. 2007), (Van 
den Bergh and Nijkamp 1997), Finance, Engineering, Medicine,  Politics Science, Regional Science (Bell and Morse 
2008), (Levin et al. 2018), (Grazi et al. 2007), Spatial Economics (Poirson and Weber 2011) and therefore this 
cannot be alien to the bullwhip effect. As the Bullwhip Effect occurs at any given time, companies alter their 
inventory levels from those that are not consistent with their demand levels, and as a result, is generating high storage 
costs (also resulting in unnecessary levels of contamination due to the production of unnecessary products for sale); 
otherwise, if the bullwhip effect is reverse, not having sufficient levels of products to meet demand also results not

2947","5.3 Proposed Improvements  
 
Based on the results obtained in our research, it is proposed that in the case of Mexico, specifically in its northern 
states, is essential that the transport supply chains that prevail in these regions re-evaluate their storage capacities 
related to the transport sector so that they do not exceed 23.1 % of their current capacity,  and in this way avoid 
structural damage, both economic and environmental one. Urgency must be taken in this aspect, since this region 
presents two alarming aspects obtained: that this region has a random spatial behavior (which makes it even more 
difficult to apply sustainable resilience policies in the logistical aspect) and that in addition, its level of pollution is 
much higher than some of the most relevant member countries of the OECD. 
 
 
5.4 Validation 
 
We detected the deviation of our data from the normal distribution: the level of skewness that although close to the 
value of zero in most variables, is not entirely symmetrical to its normal distribution curve because for the case of 
the National level series is predominantly and slightly elongated to the right; and as for the state-level series some 
lengthened to the left and others to the right. On the other hand, the values of kurtosis indicate that for most variables 
both National, State and Countries levels are less than 3 which represents a very flattened curve. So our residuals 
resulting from our model tend to non-normal distribution, predominantly. This underpins the need for both the use 
of a technique of a different type of statistical distribution as well as the application of dummy variables, which also 
justifies for our research the use of the Stochastic Frontier Model technique (with exponential distribution) as well 
as the two dummy variables of our macroeconomic model (ùê∑ùê∑ùëéùëé y ùê∑ùê∑ùëèùëè). In addition to performing these descriptive 
tests, we apply a unitary root test to our series data to verify that their level of integration is under economic theory

2956","6. Conclusions 
 
The Bullwhip effect is a phenomenon of study where information concerning market demand is distorted through 
the different links of supply chains in such a way that production and unnecessary storage costs and scarce resources 
are generated. This phenomenon of study, although since 1958 has been studied in depth, today there is very little 
research where its relationship and behavior with the sustainable effect in Mexico is analyzed. In this regard, this 
research provides a proposal for controlling and resiling the sustainable Bullwhip Effect in the transport & logistics 
sector in Mexico, by identifying the maximum sustainable levels of production of this sector (23.1% of the excess 
over the actual bullwhip effect they have) based on our methodology taking into account the levels of stochastic 
technical efficiency of northern states of Mexico based on the data 2004 ‚Äì 20017. 
 
The future lines for research, generated from this investigation, are among others: the application of the 
methodological proposal applied to the rest of the federal states of Mexico (center and south region states); the 
behaviour of the bullwhip effect of the transport & logistics sector and its sustainable levels of production in the 
face of economic convergence and divergence scenarios; inserting to the proposed model sustainability variables 
where human capital is included; analyze the spatial lapse behavior of the bullwhip effect in relation to the 
sustainable phenomenon within the transport & logistics sector for the central and southern sectors of Mexico; apply 
the methodology and the present model with respect to specific types of sustainability such as those related to the 
sustainability of water, agriculture or forestry in relation to the bullwhip effect that occurred in the transport & 
logistics sector; determine the geographical strategic areas of each state to develop commercial agglomerations in 
order to be favorable both for sustainable spillage and for the productivity of the logistics & transport sector; apply 
the methodology and model proposed in this research specifically on the behavior of the bullwhip effect but as 
panels of continental world regions (Europe, Asia, Africa, America, Oceania) as well as under an extrapolation of 
time series until 2021 to see how this bullwhip effect behaved during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Undoubtedly the field of study of the bullwhip effect is wide and interesting. Despite its extensive analysis, there 
are still several areas of opportunity that can be used thanks to the Big Data tools and therefore this same bullwhip 
effect can be analyzed with information from the more than 2400 municipalities that compose up Mexico, obtaining 
useful conclusions in favor of the progress of the Transport & Logistics Sector.

Abstract 
 
This work presents a real-time biofeedback tool that uses wearables and Internet of Things (IoT) for applications in 
education. Using wearables (electroencephalography helmet, smart bands) and a Raspberry Pi, signals were integrated 
in real-time. Moreover, a three-class random forest (RF) classification machine learning (ML) algorithm, based on the 
aforementioned signals, which predicted a student's mental fatigue (none, moderate and extreme fatigue) with 92.69% 
average correct classification percentage using 5-fold cross-validation (CV). The system can evaluate a student's 
performance under different learning modalities, in addition, it can show different content types to students, depending 
on the professor's necessities. In the current work, vehicle signals were integrated for teaching automotive engineering.

1. Introduction 
Education needs to adapt constantly, hence a variety of trustworthy evaluation and teaching methods need to be 
employed. A recent option is the use of biometrics as a biofeedback tool that works as an intelligent system for 
students, as well as teachers, to improve their respective learning performance. 
 
Biometrics is the use of biological measurements related to the human body, one of the oldest biometrics being used 
are fingerprints, since they have been used on forensics with the purpose of identifying an individual, as each 
fingerprint is unique (NarayanMohanty and Sikka 2021). On the other hand, recent methods extract biometrics, such 
as vein biometrics, further used on the financial industry to authenticate financial transactions (Mohsin et al. 2020). 
 
Moving back to education, multiple efforts have been made to implement them, advances range from its basic form 
as biometric scanners such as fingerprints or face recognition (Leaton, 2018) to access facilities or as a payment 
method within the campus, done via companies as identiMetrics and IDconnect (Garg et al. 2018). Other studies use

Abstract 
 
A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a real dynamic system that can simulate its current conditions, predict its 
future behavior, and log valuable information about its internal operation and interactions with other systems. The 
unique capability of automatic bidirectional information flow between virtual and physical worlds and predictive 
analysis of Digital Twins are what make this emergent technology greatly innovative and of significant value. The 
objective of this case study is to implement a vehicle‚Äôs performance Digital Twin concept on an electric passenger 
bus and analyze the technology‚Äôs adaptability level, capabilities, scope, limits, and future improvements. This system 
incorporates a network of sensing devices mounted on the vehicle, a real-time simulation model, edge computing 
capabilities and the possibility of incorporating predictive maintenance models to determine remaining useful life of 
components. The Digital Twin is thought to have great value when it comes to gaining deep insight on the dynamic 
performance of the bus, analyzing energy waste, exploring determining factors of energy usage and monitoring the 
current and future state of the vehicle. All of this being possible through simulation technology, digital modeling, 
physical and virtual sensors, edge computing, Internet-of-Things networks, and Machine Learning algorithms.

1. Introduction 
Digital twins (DT) are an emergent technology which has seen a recent surge in use cases and applications in a variety 
of industries. Due to the benefits of developing DTs for specific applications, it a desirable method for gaining deeper 
insight and testing/validation of physical object or processes. By having a reliable and experimentable model as a 
virtual testbed, users can extract information about current inner operations of a real object or process, predicting its 
future behavior and even simulating what-if situations. In this sense, it is possible to develop high fidelity, 
comprehensive ‚ÄúSimulation Models allowing a simulation-based verification and validation throughout the whole 
lifecycle (of the physical twin)‚Äù (Dahmen and Rossman, 2018). Recent studies and use cases for DTs revolve in its 
majority on manufacturing and smart city applications. However, with the emergent trend of electrification and 
evermore complex mechatronic systems, there is an opportunity of developing DT concepts for automotive 
applications. This work presents the case study of the use of the DT concept of a vehicle applied on an electric bus 
(Electrobus). This bus was converted from and internal combustion engine (ICE) to a fully electric (EV) powertrain 
and is expected to become a vehicle with smart mobility and connectedness capabilities. Amongst these capabilities, 
is the DT concept of the bus which would serve as a way of monitoring its performance, having an experimentable 
model of the physical bus, being able to predict future performance behavior and making available for the driver and 
other users, deep insight on sustainability and performance analysis of the vehicle and its interaction with its 
surroundings. The DT of a vehicle was previously developed for the representation of a commercial ICE vehicle. The 
original test vehicle was the Mazda 3 2018 hatchback which is classified as a Class C mid-range road family car. For 
this work however, the DT platform was converted and adapted to run the simulation model of an electric bus and the 
focus of the data analysis was shifted towards sustainable mobility. The test vehicle for this work is a Class 6 (gross 
vehicle mass of approximately 10,000 kg) city bus modified and converted to an EV bus. The powertrain, body work 
and driver cab will be modified, but the chassis for the bus will remain the same. The result will be the capability of 
analyzing the performance of the bus in real-time and having a record of its performance through time. This will 
enable deeper insight of the inner behavior of the vehicle. This in turn will provide information for data-led decision

2971","5.4 Validation 
The validation process is very important when it comes to evaluating and validating systems or models that represent 
real objects or processes. In our case, since the digital models are desired to produce calculations and conclusions on 
the behavior of their physical twins, these need to be as accurate and precise as possible to present the most real 
information as possible. For our system experiments, the validation process is carried out by comparing absolute true 
values to those output by our design system. In the case of the mapping module, distances and altitude is evaluated 
through percent error and RMSE calculations.  
 
When the system and individual models are complete, the use of other validation techniques are necessary. For our 
work, the Grieve‚Äôs Tests of Virtuality (GTV) will be performed to evaluate the ability of our models to mirror their 
physical twins. These GTV consists of three tests: sensory visual, performance, and reflectivity (Juarez et al. 2021) 
where the behavior similarity of both physical and virtual worlds is evaluated. 
‚Ä¢ 
Sensory Visual Test: A tester subject demands a movement either from the DT or the physical twin and if 
the tester cannot differentiate among the real system and the DT, this test is approved.  
‚Ä¢ 
Performance Test: The tester demands an action from both twins and if it cannot differentiate the performance 
among both, this test is approved.  
‚Ä¢ 
Reflectivity Test: The tester demands information on the current state of the object, if there is no difference 
between the data from the physical and virtual twin, this test is approved 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results and designed software for this work already has great value in terms of setting a baseline for the future 
development of the DT for a vehicle and for urban spaces. Implementation is still pending, however after the proposed 
validation techniques, system integration will be feasible, and implementation would be the next step. In this sense, 
the objective for the project is still to be reached. Some challenges and limitations have already been worked around. 
For instance, implementation costs due to the number of devices and software needed is a challenge to overcome. For 
this, open-source software and popular platforms were used and tailored-made designs developed. Other challenges 
like the complexity of interoperability amongst software was experimented. Matlab and Simulink were a solution 
option due to their facility to interact with other platforms. 
 
With the current results, the system may already be classified in a maturity level 1 according to the DT maturity 
spectrum index. However, once the system is complete and once it is validated, a level 2 and even level 3 of maturity 
will be achieved. The static information and real-time information will come from the sensing devices mounted on 
the vehicle. This will also demonstrate the interaction between an urban space DT and a vehicle DT concept.  
 
Furthermore, the current system may be classified as a SoS level hierarchy and an integration level of Digital Shadow. 
When the system is complete, the integration will be classified as a Digital Twin. A lot of work needs to be done with 
the interoperability and connectivity of platforms and devices. It is a special challenge when it comes to real-time data 
processing, and enabling technologies such as ML, Big Data, IoT and edge processing have a great role. 
 
Future work will focus on connecting both physical and virtual world and performing experimentation to evaluate and 
validate individual systems. After this, implementation of the DT for Electrobus will be enabled.

(SDG¬¥s) are mentioned, being a point of reference for a critical route towards the 2030 United Nations agenda, these 
in conjunction with the project dimensions and frameworks proposed, give as a result a first draft of how a 
methodology for smart mobility in mexican cities could be. This methodology includes several diagnostics meant for 
specific size areas that leads to a planning phase where private and public requirements, and aspirations should be 
analyzed. It can be found that there is a social dimension that has been disassociated from mobility and the optimal 
way to transit from fuel-based transport to renewable energy is through electromobility, but the success of this 
transition will rely on PPP‚Äôs actions required to create a functional electromobility system.

1. Introduction  
Conscious mobility initiative is a collaborative effort between Tecnologico de Monterrey Campus Monterrey, Distrito 
Tec, and several private stakeholders from the automotive sector. Its main purpose is to develop future mobility models 
based on electromobility for persons and goods transportation, following the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG¬¥s), 
Smart cities frameworks and applying them to Mexican cities. 
 
Recent growth from Urban spaces have had a direct impact on the number of vehicles on streets, being Internal 
Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles, the ones that lead the market, increasing the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG). 
Emissions from the transport sector are a major contributor to climate change, about 14% of annual emissions 
(including non-CO2 gases) are from burning fossil fuels (Wang and Ge 2019), consequently different efforts to 
decarbonize the transportation sector have been made, such as electrifying transportation, replacing ICE vehicles with 
electric vehicles (EV¬¥s). EV offers the possibility of zero vehicle emission, lower lifetime cost, enhanced safety, and 
possible renewable energy (Ehsani et al. 2021) 
 
Electric buses global fleet reached 460 thousand vehicles in 2018, where China represents 99% of the electric buses 
global market. Europe registered approximately 900 electric buses in 2018, the United States more than 300 electric 
buses and Latin America had its first deployment with 200 electric buses in Chile and 40 in Ecuador. Electromobility 
infrastructure follows the same path, where China has 153,000 chargers from the approximately 157,000 charges and 
Europe has reached 3000 chargers.

5.6 Proposed Improvements  
Enhance frameworks and methodologies used for this paper by adopting and contextualizing existing strategies that 
comes from other manuals like the ‚ÄúCollection Methodology for key Performance indicators for Smart Sustainable 
cities‚Äù, ‚ÄúCITYkeys indicators for smart city projects and smart cities‚Äù, ‚ÄúOECD Smart City Measurement Framework‚Äù, 
among others, these manuals are created by organizations like United Nations, European Union, and Organization for 
Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). These manuals consider many other dimensions or subdimensions than 
the ones chosen for this project, but it is possible to extrapolate some common objectives from the study cases shown. 
 
For applicable key performance indicators (KPI¬¥s) in the development of this electromobility plan, it would be 
necessary to incorporate more indicators that could drive from quantitative to qualitative analysis, quantity of electric 
buses operating, charging stations installed or travel time are common indicators. Complex indicators like Dynamic 
Public Transport information, Traffic monitoring, public transport network convenience, Intersection control, among 
others, should be considered. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Nowadays there is a lack of conscious mobility at a local level. Therefore, it will be necessary to increase research 
flow on this topic. It can be seen clearly an intention to implement new norms regarding new mobility, however it is 
important to embrace new methods of transportation, not only with law enforcement but infrastructure investment. It 
is known that there is an economic dimension of mobility where newer technologies imply higher costs in a short 
period of time but higher savings in long term schemes. Nevertheless, there is a social dimension that has been 
disassociated from mobility although it should be one of the main lines of research, a conscious mobility. 
 
From a technology standpoint, electromobility will be the best path for migrating from a fuel-based transportation 
system to a renewable energy transportation system, establishing the beginning for a strategy that has as key objective 
reach United Nations SDGs goals that were proposed for this project. A successful transition will depend on the PPP¬¥s 
efforts to establish an agenda that fulfills the regulations, normative and actions required for a functional 
electromobility system in its operation and as a business model, giving the fair incentives for every automotive 
company that want to aggregate EV¬¥s to its vehicle fleet. Interoperability advantage from this new transportation 
system will accelerate its shifting time, but as this technology is still in development its acquisition could just be 
performed by developed countries, stretching the gap between developed countries, and developing countries.

Abstract 
 
The implicit variables of the driving cycle are closely related to level of emissions produced by the vehicles, 
particularly, these are equipped with a series of pressure, flow, temperature, and instrumentation sensors that allow 
the measurement of the vehicle speed and engine revolutions, including GPS modules that allow collecting altimetry 
and position data in real time. However, motorcycles with displacements less than 250 cc usually use a carburetor and 
do not have all this instrumentation since it would raise the manufacturing cost, and consequently, sale price. This is 
a key factor to the customers which prefers that mode of transportation due to the facility of movement in congested 
roads and low cost of operation. Specially, in some countries such as Colombia, the quantity of motorcycle and traffic 
is very high and thus a higher rate of violation of regulations, its participation in accidents and contribution in air 
pollution should be considered more carefully.  The challenge is the inclusion of precise technology without increasing 
costs and to be able to monitor its performance and location to include it in a smart city environment. 
 
Currently, there is no low-cost device developed in Colombia for the measurement of real fuel in motorcycles, since 
most of the engine types are fueled by carburetor due to the nature of the combustion process it is difficult to get an 
accurate measurement and find available sensors or embedded systems in the market. Another reason why a device of 
this style has not been developed is because the cylinder capacity of these motorcycles is less than 250 cc, with which 
fuel consumption goes unnoticed by the owners of these vehicles, creating little awareness of saving and caring for 
the environment in terms of polluting gas emissions. Besides, the study of driving cycles is a useful task to be able to 
analyze the environmental and economic impact that the use of vehicles and motorcycles leaves in a given area, since 
fuel consumption and vehicle speed are closely related to emissions. 
 
The project aims to design a semi-industrial scale an instrumental system that monitors and records the position, speed, 
RPM and fuel consumption of a carbureted motorcycle with a displacement of less than 250 cc as well as develop a 
mobile application that allows the visualization and storage in the cloud of the data obtained from a monitored route. 
Finally, is necessary to carry out the device performance test based on measurements obtained through laboratory and 
road tests.

Abstract  
 
The recovery of the global economic activity following the Covid-19 pandemic, caused emissions associated to energy 
consumption to be 2% higher in December 2020 than the same month in 2019. The migration to a low carbon energy 
system is essential, achieving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Energy efficiency is a key point in 
clean energy transitions and energy efficiency policies the development path, which in 2019 covered only 35% of the 
final energy use.  
Colombia committed to reduce 51% of its GHG emissions by 2030 compared to the projections made for that year. 
The country electric generation is relatively clean, 69% corresponds to renewable energies (RE) and the remaining 
31% to fossil resources, with associated emissions of 11,82 GtCO2eq for the year 2019. However, Colombian electric 
system is unstable, due to the water resource dependence, which can be affected by variable weather conditions, and 
to the high energy losses that reached 60% in 2012, with a cost of 5200 million dollars per year.  
Therefore, it is necessary to generate energy efficiency strategies and policies in the Colombian electric system, due 
to its relationship with the economic competitiveness, energy security and environmental benefits. The impact of these 
strategies and policies implementation can be monitored through an energy efficiency indicators analysis that allow 
taking timely actions to meet energy goals. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to determine energy efficiency 
indicators to evaluate the current state of the Colombian electric system, analyzing the trends and historical dispersion 
of the data. It was made a compilation of the historical variables selected for the calculation of the following energy 
efficiency indicators: generation efficiency, energy intensity, emission intensity, CO2eq emissions and per capita 
consumption. Based on the preliminary results it is concluded that, although Colombian energetic matrix is mainly 
composed by RE, it is susceptible to the world oil market variations, due to the crisis occurred during 2014 and 2016 
years, where the international oil prices dropped, causing a 1% negative increase in the electric generation during 2015 
and 2016 years, which had a relative annual growth rate of 3%.  
On the other hand, this study is a macro project preliminary step, which seeks the construction of a platform that 
allows to variate different key parameters, to generate and project energy efficiency strategies which can adapt to the 
needs of the different entities associated in the generation, distribution, and end use processes of the country electric 
energy.

Abstract  
 
In recent years, biometric systems have been used to provide access control security, to help identify and recognize 
people. However, today due to the advance of the pandemic some of the biometric systems are considered as sources 
of transmission and contagion of COVID-19. This situation motivates us to the development of a facial recognition 
access control system through the Application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that, by not having physical 
contact with the devices, safeguards against COVID-19. A pre-trained VGG16 model was used and the new CNN 
model was trained with the Transfer Learning application. The recognition system was tested using a public database 
such as celebA, obtaining an accuracy of 84%, this isn't the best possible accuracy as some authors report better results. 
However, our objective was not to provide the best accuracy with random data, we only need to achieve good accuracy 
with the company's controlled data, our CNN model achieves an accuracy of 98% in controlled conditions with an 
average identification time of 80 milliseconds. It has a low implementation cost that allows it to be competitive in 
low-income countries, like Ecuador, compared to international costs of state-of-the-art systems.

1. Introduction 
The late 1990s saw the beginning of the face recognition boom with the Facial Recognition Technology (FERET) 
program conducted by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL). The ARL conducted government-supervised 
testing and evaluation of automated face recognition algorithms. The objective of the tests was to provide an 
independent method of evaluating the state of the art in automatic face recognition, (Phillips, et al. 1996). Significant 
progress has been made in recent years thanks to the development made by Lawrence in 1997 (Lawrence, et al. 1997), 
when he implemented an unsupervised learning method for face recognition based on a Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN), leading to multiple applications such as image classification to detect personal protective equipment, tumor 
detection, emotion recognition, voice recognition, etc. All this processing power is due to Deep Learning, which is a 
technology for processing data, extracting information, and obtaining predictive models for decision making. CNNs 
are part of the deep learning algorithms widely used today (Adjabi, et al. 2020; Dean, et al. 2012).

In Figure 5, the training accuracy curve which represents the learning of the trained model is obtained. On the other 
hand, the validation accuracy curve gives an idea of the generalization of the model. These curves allow analyzing the 
quality of the CNN model reached, meaning, it evaluates the ability to make new predictions based on images that it 
has not seen before. If the training accuracy increases while the validation accuracy decreases, it is possible that there 
is an excessive overfitting that is why there should not be a gap between these two curves. The results in our model, 
for the training set, match the results of the validation set.

4. Conclusion  
In this work, we were able to implement a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks for face 
recognition through the application of Transfer Learning. The training time of the CNN was optimized and the data 
processing time was 13 seconds. The system response was simulated and validated by generating a confusion matrix 
through the input of untrained faces contained in the test folder. With the results obtained for each class, the system 
achieves a 98% accuracy with an average identification time of 80 milliseconds. The accuracy obtained corresponds 
to the number of trained persons, which are 10, with a number of images for Train: 300 and Test: 1000, the accuracy 
of the system can be improved if we increase the number of images of each employee. The learning curves show that 
at epoch 13 there is a crossover point between loss and accuracy, indicating that the CNN network has gained 
knowledge. As the training progresses, overfitting is not diagnosed. Therefore, the number of epochs could be 
decreased to optimize the training time of the CNN. An access control system was developed with great accuracy, in 
order to recognize the employees of micro-enterprises, where the lighting environment is controlled. However, for the

environments. In addition, by training the model with these conditions it is possible to have high precision for different 
conditions. Eliminating the use of other biometric systems, like fingerprint, since today, they represent a source of 
possible contagion of Covid-19. It has a low implementation cost that allows it to be competitive in low-income 
countries, like Ecuador, market compared to international costs of state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract 
 
Microstructure evolution under interactive effects of severe shear strains, strain-rates and the accompanied 
temperature rise often follows complex trajectories. Encapsulating the process‚Äìstructure linkages under these 
conditions is vital for prediction and control of product outcomes from processes that involve severe plastic 
deformation. This paper examines the microstructure transformations during severe shear deformation induced by 
plane strain machining (PSM) on high-purity (99.99%) Nickel. Deformation conditions in both chips and the surface 
are created using PSM and characterized via in-situ techniques which are then juxtaposed with orientation imaging 
microscopy (OIM) via electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD). The dislocation densities are quantified using the 
broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks of crystallographic planes. We capture the variation of microstructure response 
(subgrain size and dislocation density), by applying the supervised model-based learning techniques combined with 
physics-based models to enhance the predictions performance. The features involved in the study are cutting speed, 
rake angle, temperature, strain, strain-rate, in addition to lnZ and a rate parameter R identified from the saturated

Abstract 
 
Advanced Networks have been studied through emulation testing connectivity and management under IPv4 and IPv6 
using their corresponding routing and management protocols such as ISP companies do for backbone infrastructure. 
In this work, given four different and complex backbone advanced networks in different regions in the world, four 
different kinds of files have been transmitted from one extreme to another for each backbone network then time and 
computational resources have been considering, testing GNS3 capabilities when emulating under IPv6 using limited 
CPU and RAM resources. The four advanced networks are Africa Connect for Africa, GEANT for Europe, 
AMERONET for America, it means the joint of CANARIE, INTERNET2 and CLARA, and Pacific Wave for many 
countries in the pacific. Those four advanced networks involve 187 backbone routers. Given a specific hardware 
resource, results show capabilities and limitations when testing different file transfers when emulating advanced 
networks. This work adds to evidence of the potential for GNS3 but indicates an issue for transferring video files 
around 10MB for the combo GNS3 and Core i7 and 16GB using 70% for CPU and 80% for RAM.

1. Introduction 
Advanced networks are the assigned name for the National Research and Education Networks (NREN) inside countries 
around the world since 1996. NREN have been evolving in their topology characteristics including backbone routers 
and bandwidth, so advanced networks are of interest of Internet Service Provider (ISP) companies and academy research 
laboratories. In time some advanced networks have been studied by emulating and testing connectivity by OSPFv2 and 
OSPFv3 protocols and management by SNMPv2 and SNMPv3 under IPv4 and IPv6, respectively. The different 
advanced networks studied in past covered countries such as INTERNET2 for USA, CANARIE for Canada, CUDI for 
Mexico and REUNA for Chile, also a regional network as CLARA for Latin America and continents such as GEANT 
for Europe, AFRICACONNECT for Africa, and America, where each advanced network has a specific Autonomous 
System (AS) number. 
 
In this work four huge backbone advanced networks were selected to test file transfer, for four types of files, among the 
extremes of their backbone infrastructure. The selected advanced networks are AFRICACONNECT for Africa, 
GEANT for Europe, AMERONET (CANARIE + INTERNET2 + CLARA) for all America70 and the Pacific Wave 45 
which includes several countries, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Korea, China, Taiwan, Mexico, 
among others. Then different file transfers are developed to test GNS3 and equipment capabilities under IPv6, such as 
OSPFv3 and BGP protocols. These kinds of analysis and reviews are useful for Network Operation Centers (NOC) of 
Internet service provider (ISP) companies.

So, text, image, audio, and video files do not seem to show a huge significative difference for the topologies for each 
advanced netwrok. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Four complex backbone advanced networks were emulated using the c7200 backbone routers and virtual machines to 
test the file transfer for text, image, audio, and video files to verify the GNS3 and computer resources performance 
under IPv6 OSPFv3 and BGP-4 protocols. Ping and Traceroute test were executed to test connectivity for each 
topology, then the file transfer was tested for each topology and four times for each file transfer then the average was 
taken. All tests ran under the same conditions for each topology. Results show spent time for file transfer for different 
weights is proportional in a way, but three main details must be remarqued, the first one is that no differences are 
shown for text files, maybe because the size of the sent file. The second one is that spent time is proportional to size 
of the sent file for all kind of files and for all topologies. But the third one, and maybe the most interesting conclusion 
is the fact that there is a notable difference in time for those two backbone topologies which use BGP-4 as an additional 
AS routing protocol. It means AFRICACONNECT and GEANT which used just OSPFv3 spent less time than 
AMERONET and Pacific Wave which used BGP-4 additionally, so not only the size and complexity of the topology 
is important particularly when transferring video files, but also when transferring from one AS to another.

Abstract 
 
The efficient use of resources, sustainability, innovation, the inclusion of information technologies such as IoT and 
industry 4.0, urban planning, public management, social cohesion, citizen security, mobility and transport are the tools 
which a city must be considered smart. Smart cities have emerged as a response to problems such as climate change, 
high energy consumption due to population density of cities, difficulty in mobility due to the imbalance between roads 
and vehicle systems (i.g motorcycles, vehicles, bicycles, public transport), competitiveness and economic growth. 
Also, the need for intelligent mobility arises as a solution to the problems of vehicular traffic (i.e congestion), 
pedestrian traffic and lost time, unsafety , air pollution, the growth of the vehicle fleet both in quantity and in diversity 
of vehicle types and the limited availability of road infrastructure. These factors have a direct impact on driver behavior 
(i.e trend and style), on vehicle use and performance (i.e modes of operation)  and on energy consumption (i.e fuel 
consumption, or electricity) and on the direct or indirect emission of pollutants. 
 
The way the population drives is known as the Driving Pattern (DP). Currently, there is no clear definition of DP. 
Commonly, DP has been defined as that which describes the behavior of the driver. In a broader sense,  DP should 
describe the way in which one drives in a specific region, including not only human factors (driving behavior) but 
operational factors (driving style) as well as reflecting the driving conditions (driving conditions). Then, it is necessary 
to determine other characteristics of the driving pattern and not only the average speed is enough. DP varies from one 
region to another, which limits the application of valid and widely used techniques. For this reason and the availability 
to collect sufficient data, it is unknown whether Latin American cities present similarities in their driving patterns. 
 
Frequently, driving patterns are represented by Characteristic Parameters (CP) which are dependent on speed and 
time. To obtain the CPs, a second-by-second record of the vehicle speed is required, which is obtained through GPS 
(Global Position System). This process must be carried out on a representative sample of vehicles for at least one year 
of operation to capture seasonal behaviors, which makes it highly costly. Currently, there is no consensus on the 
number of CP's that should be used to recognize the driving pattern nor on what is the appropriate methodology to 
describe them in a generalized, reliable, and representative way. Other alternatives to describe DP are: Vehicle Specific 
Power (VSP), Speed- Acceleration Probability Distribution (SAPD), Driving Cycles (DC) and Driving Pattern 
Recognition (DPR). 
 
Knowledge of local driving patterns is required to identify and design strategies that help reduce energy consumption 
and vehicle emissions. Likewise, is possible to recognize and evaluate the driving styles of a region respectively. This 
project aims to show current methodologies and evaluate the performance to describe local driving patterns.

Abstract 
 
In the present research two new methods to select optimal suppliers considering component replacement policies for 
a micro-grid were developed, the main objectives considered in the replacement problem are to minimize the overall 
system costs (operation cost, maintenance cost), as well as maximize the overall system efficiency. Once the 
replacement schedules are generated, we propose two methods, a) Euclidean Distance and b) Ideal Vector System) to 
select suppliers to replace components in the system. The methods are applied to a previously designed micro-grid, 
the Euclidean Distance method looks for solutions (vectors) defined by the closest distance that most closely resembles 
the desired (ideal) vector (solution), which is the one with a smaller distance to the ideal vector, the closest solution, 
as defined by the Euclidean distance, will be the one the one that offers in this case a more efficient condition to the 
characteristics of efficiency and system cost,  among others. The second method proposed in the present work, the 
ideal vector system, considers the gains that exist between the characteristics of the participating vectors (solutions), 
for example, cost is a characteristic for which the negative gain becomes a positive gain for this algorithm, and 
characteristics such as component life considering the longer components‚Äô life the better for the system. The final 
solution is found in the vector that defines the highest gain; all characteristics are converted into a vector in values per 
unit referenced to a desired vector established by the decision maker. The proposed methods are applied to a microgrid 
previously generated by using a microgrid design allocation algorithm and after running a component replacement 
analysis model. Finally, the two proposed methods are applied to a microgrid and both methods converge to select the 
same suppliers to replace components in the micro-grid.

1. Introduction  
Nowadays, there is a growing demand for electric energy and one of the the major challenges is to reduce climatic 
warming due in large part to emissions released by fossil fuels (Abdelkader et al. 2018). U.S. Energy consumption for 
generating electricity Fifty years ago was self-sufficient in its supply of petroleum. Today, it imports more than half 
of its petroleum and consumes 25% of the world‚Äôs supply (Salameh, 2014). Oil is a limited resource that will 
eventually run out, at least as an economically viable energy source (Salameh, 2014 and Dawoud et al. 2018). The 
exponential increase in global energy demand is the primary cause of rapid depletion of fossil fuels and increased 
greenhouse gas emissions of conventional generators (Adefarati and Bansal, 2017). Natural options are offered by the 
Earth to produce electricity such as photovoltaic, concentrated solar energy, wind energy, fuel cells, and many others. 
Not only governments around the world are worried about the climate changes but also researchers from developed 
countries are investing many time and money to create or improve green energy strategies. In 2015, global energy 
consumption increased by 1.0% and in 2014 increased by 1.1%, while in the last ten years the average energy 
consumption was 1.9%. This result is one of the consequences of energy savings efforts made by governments and 
citizens. The power grid consists of three distinct divisions namely, the generating station, the transmission network, 
and the distribution network, so the focus of this job it is after distribution network called load center. The load center 
is categorized by different terms such as public or private no large areas and public or private massive areas. The 
specific focus of this job is centered on private or public buildings. According to Dan Arvizu, director of National 
Renewable Lab., buildings consume 38% of the total energy produced in which 71% is electricity. For instance, the 
energy demand for hotels is on average higher than that of commercial buildings. A typical hotel‚Äôs annual power

As it can be seen in the results, both methods convert the characteristics of each of the electrical component separately 
into vectors that are positioned in a plane, in the case of method number one the comparison is with a desired vector, 
this desired vector is composed of the values expected by the decisions maker. This method defines by closest distance 
the provider vector that most closely resembles the desired vector, that is, the vector with a smaller distance to the 
desired vector is the one that offers in this case a more efficient condition to the characteristics of efficiency, cost of 
life useful, among others. In the case of methodology number two, the decision is found in the vector that defines the 
highest gain, all characteristics are converted into a vector in values per unit referenced to a desired vector established 
by the person concerned. It is understood that values of higher better are opposed to the values of lower better, for this 
reason a change of sign is established in the values lower better so that the positive response of the lower side is shown 
as a positive gain of the upper side, therefore event, the vector with the highest gain becomes the most efficient vector 
with respect to the vector previously set as the desired vector. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This work is based on the selection of components of the micro-grid solar panel stand-alone once they must be selected 
to replace an existing component that in theory will be out of service. This algorithm is based on the creation of vectors 
using the characteristics of the potential components provided in a finite number of providers, these vectors will be 
compared in distances against a desired vector. The vector that keeps the least distance against the desired vector will 
be the vector to be selected by the algorithm. Another algorithm contemplates the gains that exist between the 
characteristics of the participating vectors, such as cost is a characteristic of greater better, for which the negative gain 
becomes a positive gain for this algorithm, as well as characteristics such as life It is useful that larger populations are 
better, it is a characteristic that does not change sign, it remains positive throughout the process, so the vector that 
offers the highest gain will be the vector selected by this algorithm. In this particular work, it was found that both 
methodologies converge at the same provider selection points based on a desired vector. Despite this example is 
limited by only three providers and a specific number of characteristics to evaluate, this work can be taken to more 
complex instances of selection contemplating variable elements of the components that are involved in the operation 
of the same components. Perhaps, where the geographical areas with variation in solar irradiation are present as parts 
of the estimation variables. Considering international suppliers in the process with variation in the monetary values 
that are involved in the costs of the elements.

Abstract  
 
The Philippines, one of the developing countries in Southeast Asia that reached the 1,000,000 cumulative mark of 
COVID-19 cases, are continuously challenged in controlling the pandemic through various government efforts and 
policies. As of April 2021, the country is in the 21st-30th bracket regarding the number of cases. The National Capital 
Region (NCR) or Metro Manila, the center of business, technology, and education of the Philippines, is tagged to be 
the most critical area in the country. Most of the offices and educational institutions adopted a remote setup. Malls, 
shops, and restaurants are hampered by the pandemic too. For more than a year of various community quarantine 
classifications and loose direction, Metro Manila residents imposed severe dissatisfaction with how the government 
is managing the pandemic. This research shall explore and assess the local government units (LGU) responses during 
the pandemic. Using factor analysis, the researchers evaluated the LGUs‚Äô pandemic response through the SERVQUAL 
Dimensions (Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, Empathy, and Tangibles). Results show that four factors were 
composed, which are 1) Efficiency and Effectiveness, 2) Available Resources, 3) Adequate Information and 
Convenience, and 4) Customized Service.

Based on Table 7, it is explicitly shown that the Efficiency and Effectiveness factor has a higher mean gap among the 
other factors, which means that this has the most significant variance between perceived and expected service. On the 
other hand, the Customized Service factor has the lowest mean gap, which has the smallest variance between perceived 
and expected service.

The researchers recommend that local government units pay attention to all the factors as these result in negative gaps 
between what their constituents expect and receive from their pandemic responses. A great emphasis and attention 
should be made to address the mean gap of efficiency and effectiveness. Local units must revisit projects and 
programs. Also, they must provide adequate information and convenience, especially at these difficult times to their 
constituents. The availability of resources that is an existing challenge should match the needs of their members‚Äîthe 
possibility of realigning their budget to cope with the dilemma of available resources. Lastly, the local units must 
continue to cater customized needs of their constituents, including but not limited to health-related, economic, and 
educational, as this is one of their measure of customer satisfaction.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to determine if the image of the United States country and the image of the China country positively 
impact the purchase intention of foreign products in Mexican consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-
probability snowball sampling was used. The survey was sent through social networks. The sample obtained was 393 
consumers from Mexico City, Jalisco, and Nuevo Le√≥n with ages between 16 and 66 years. Multiple linear regression 
was performed using the stepwise method. The findings showed that the image of the United States country (Œ≤ = 0.418; 
t = 7.851; p = 0.000) and the image of the China country (Œ≤ = 0.125; t = 2.343; p = 0. 020) positively impact the 
purchase intention of foreign products in Mexican consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic by 17.4% and 1.5% 
respectively. Mexican companies could be affected if the consumption of domestic products remains lower than the 
consumption of foreign products. Therefore, the results of this research may be useful to senior managers of national 
companies because they will be able to develop strategies to increase the purchase intentions of domestic products.

Introduction 
The global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected many countries on all continents (WHO, 2020). 
In addition, it has caused changes in the purchasing intentions and behaviors of Mexican consumers. According to 
data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI, 2021), the consumption of foreign products has 
been more significant than the consumption of domestic products for eight years. This event could affect Mexican 
companies, mainly new companies. 
  
Today, the country-of-origin image plays a central role in the purchasing behavior of consumers because, with the 
increase in electronic commerce that operates across borders, it is possible to have access to a wide variety of products 
on the global market (Bao et al., 2021). Reasons why understanding the country-of-origin image of imported products 
can significantly benefit companies that compete in the domestic market (Knight, 1999) because consumers tend to 
maintain stereotypes of different countries and use the information of the country-of-origin to choose products (Wall 
et al., 1991). Besides, consumers conceive different images for developed and developing countries (Allred et al., 
2000). Thus, analyzing the country-of-origin image is of utmost importance to better understand consumer buying 
behavior. Roth and Diamantopoulos (2009) explain that, in globalized markets, a favorable image of a country has a 
significant impact on the evaluation that consumers make of foreign products and, thus, influences their subsequent 
purchase decision.  
 
Authors like Diamantopoulos et al. (2011), Martin and Eroglu (1993), and Wang and Lamb (1980) recommend that 
future research analyze if the country-of-origin image of a product influences the purchase intention of foreign 
products in order to understand the stereotypes that consumers have about certain countries.

Abstract 
 
The brawl between residents in the Medan Belawan sub-district, Medan city, North Sumatra has become a culture of 
the people in this sea port city for decades. Every time a brawl occurs, the local mass media releases news massively, 
but for the people of Belawan, the brawl between residents has become an open secret because it is related to the entry 
of drug carriers through Belawan port, so the fights become a distraction for these illegal activities. This research is a 
media study that examines how the mass media present information in this case study. This study aims to conclude 
the information behind the news about the brawl in Medan Belawan by using a communication management approach. 
This study found that there has been a bias in the focus of the mass media with the public in seeing the reality of this 
brawl between residents.

Abstract  
 
Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) quality control chart is commonly used in many industrial applications. In this research, 
an improved scheme of the CUSUM chart is introduced to monitor attribute data. In this scheme, the difference 
between actual and in-control numerals of nonconforming items is raised to an exponent w to enhance the detection 
effectiveness. The exponent w is optimized, along with other charting parameters to minimize the Average Number 
of Defectives (AND) which is used as an objective function. The proposed scheme outperforms the conventional 
CUSUM chart for detecting a wide range of shifts in fraction non-conforming.

Control chart, Average Number of Defectives (AND), Quality control,  CUSUM chart. 
 
1. Introduction  
The use of Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) control chart has been gradually increasing across multiple industries for 
detecting process shifts (Wu et al. 2008, Shu et al. 2008, Zhao et al. 2005). This is because on-line monitoring 
techniques have become a necessity in modern day Statistical Process Control (SPC) applications (Wu et al. 2008, 
Woodall and Montgomery 1999). CUSUM charts can be used to monitor attribute and variable quality characteristics. 
Nowadays, attribute quality control charts are widely utilized in manufacturing and service sectors (Ou et al. 2009). It  
is accredited to the fact that attribute quality characteristics are relatively easier and simpler to handle in comparison 
to variable characteristics (Wu et al. 2008). A popular chart to detect a shift in attribute quality characteristics is the 
binomial CUSUM chart. This chart is designed to detect the number of nonconforming items d is a sample of size n. 
The chart detects the shift by monitoring and plotting the statistic Ct. The statistic Ct depends on the difference between 
the actual number of nonconforming items and the in-control number of nonconforming items (dt - d0).

The best use of this chart is when the actual shift size of the process can be predicted. However, in industry, it is 
difficult to predict the actual shift size for a lot of processes (Wu et al. 2008). Multiple researchers (Sparks 2000, Zhao 
et al. 2005) suggested combining two or three control charts to widen the range of mean shifts that can be detected.  
In this research, an improved scheme of CUSUM chart titled wCUSUM chart is introduced to monitor attribute data. 
In this scheme, the difference between actual and in-control numerals of nonconforming items is raised to an exponent 
w. The exponential w will be optimized along with charting parameters k, and H to increase the sensitivity of the

 are always greater than one, this indicates that the proposed scheme 
always outperforms the conventional scheme. It is observed that the superiority of the wCUSUM chart over the 
conventional CUSUM chart is not constant. In some cases, such as cases (1, 2, 4, and 5) the performance difference 
between the two charts is quite high and can exceed 50%. On the other hand, in cases 3, and 6, the performance of both 
charts is almost identical. According to the performance difference between both schemes under the selected levels for 
the six cases, the maximum shift Œ¥max and the sample size n, seem to have the most significant effect on the relative 
AND ratios. The average of the ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥cusum ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùê¥ùë§ùë§CUSUM

indicates that the proposed scheme under multiple different settings is more effective than the conventional CUSUM 
chart by 31%, in average. A remark that worth mentioning is that the conventional CUSUM chart has not been more 
effective than the proposed wCUSUM under any circumstances. This is because the conventional chart is just a special 
case of the newly proposed wCUSUM chart where w = 1.  
 
Hypothesis testing is conducted to validate that the proposed wCUSUM chart outperforms the CUSUM chart. The 
hypothesis testing is performed by comparing the average AND of the wCUSUM chart with that of the conventional 
CUSUM chart under a confidence interval of 95%. The data available from the six cases presented in Table 2 is 
insufficient to perform the hypothesis testing, and due to the high computational time, a hundred values of ANDwCUSUM 
are generated using Minitab statistical software using the mean and the standard deviation of the ANDwCUSUM values. 
Similarly, a hundred ANDCUSUM values are generated using the mean and standard deviation of the ANDCUSUM values. 
The mean and standard deviation of ANDwCUSUM and ANDCUSUM can be obtained using their respective AND values 
shown Table 2, and they are as follows: 
 
ùúáùúáùë§ùë§CUSUM  =  0.2422  
ùúéùúéùë§ùë§CUSUM = 0.1315 
 
ùúáùúáCUSUM     =  0.3314  
ùúéùúéCUSUM    = 0.2110 
After that, the hypothesis testing is conducted using 2-sample-t test. The null and alternative hypothesises are 
respectively as follows: 
 
H0: ùúáùúáCUSUM ‚àí ùúáùúáùë§ùë§CUSUM =  0 
 
H1: ùúáùúáCUSUM ‚àí ùúáùúáùë§ùë§CUSUM  > 0 
If the P-value is less than or equal to the level of significance Œ± = 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative 
hypothesis is accepted, otherwise the null hypothesis is accepted. The hypothesis testing results obtained from Minitab 
statistical software are as follow: 
 
 
 
 
 
Where Œº1 and Œº2 are the mean of the generated AND values of the CUSUM chart and wCUSUM chart, respectively. 
The obtained P-value is less than Œ± = 0.05, as a result, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis 
is accepted. The objective function is to minimize AND, and accepting the null hypothesis proves that ANDwCUSUM is 
smaller than the ANDCUSUM. 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion  
This article investigates the possibility of raising the difference between the actual and in-control numbers of non-
conforming items to an exponent w. Also, this research reflects the importance of the optimization design  of the 
control charts in general, and specifically, the wCUSUM chart. Adding w as an additional charting parameter to be 
optimized provides little more complications to the design of CUSUM charts, but it allows more design flexibility and 
enhances the detection effectiveness. The wCUSUM chart can perform reasonably good and outperform the 
conventional CUSUM chart for detecting a wide range of shifts. The results of the conducted comparative study

It is noticeable that at a small shift, the difference in performance between both charts in terms of ATS is higher than 
that at a large shift. At small shifts, the conventional CUSUM generates a higher ATS, in comparison with the 
wCUSUM chart by 61%. This percentage drops to 18% at the largest shift point. The ratio ANDCUSUM/ANDwCUSUM 
indicates a significant improvement in the detection effectiveness by 38%. 
  
The performance of both charts has also been studied under different design specifications considering six different 
cases. The proposed wCUSUM chart is 31% more effective than the traditional one, on average in terms of AND, 
under different circumstances. The advantage of the wCUSUM chart over the conventional CUSUM chart is further 
proved using 2-sample-t test. It is perceived that the value of the relative AND ratio (ANDCUSUM/ANDwCUSUM) is never 
below 1, this indicates that the conventional CUSUM chart is simply a unique case of the wCUSUM chart in which 
the exponent w equals one. If the values of the optimizable parameters k, and H of the wCUSUM chart are set to those 
of the conventional CUSUM chart, and w is set one, then both charts generate identical results.

Abstract 
Media is an important aspect of society, which play active role in mobilizing people to participate in an event, 
particularly when such event are important and at the pinnacle of regional discussion among citizen, which will 
motivate them to partake in the sociocultural and political activities. However, it is also an avenue which information‚Äôs 
about historical events are known or circulated. Lots of challenges have emerged, and may still from the way news 
are covered, particularly in crisis or war affected areas. This study will be structured around four main critical 
questions like, are media system able to report real seen during crisis events? Are those news diluted or framed? What 
role did media partake during 2010 and 2015 election in both countries? And finally what aspect of media mostly used 
during those elections? Furthermore, I will also argue on archives of media involvement in historical events in the 
region. Finally, mechanism, such as global, regional enactment and pressure group, how where they able to contribute 
to political structure of both countries.

Abstract 
 
In the field of product marketing, especially marketing of small business products, design, quality and 
appearance of packaging is something that is sensitive. Some appeal will appear if the products offered, tend to 
attract and are able to trigger consumer curiosity. Small business actors using traditional packaging will tend not 
to provide information to their customers. It causes consumers not to get enough information about the product. 
Sufficient information on product packaging is able to make consumers more interested in buying products than 
products that have no information at all on the packaging. This study aimed to find out by way of implicit 
testing whether the products were packaged through modern packaging and products packaged with traditional 
packaging had the same opportunities for behavior in the market or otherwise, products with modern packaging 
tended to be more salable in the market. To prove the hypothesis, this research used Chi-Square test because the 
purpose was to test the consumer's perception, not to test anything other than consumer perception.  However, 
all activities in the world of business, entrepreneurship and trade locally and globally must comply with and 
comply with all forms of laws and regulations that apply in each country to minimize disputes and disputes that 
are mutually beneficial

Abstract 
 
Investment strategies have important theoretical and practical implications. As one of the main strategies, technical 
analysis (TA) is a well-known investment analysis for investors. Usually used with fundamental analysis, it helps the 
investors to analyze stock performance. TA helps investors to predict the future pattern of an investment by using 
historical market data. In contrast, efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is the ideal market which the price reflects all 
information in the market. The purpose of this study is to investigate market efficiency of Japanese equity market, 
Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), by using TA. We use a sample of three (3) stocks from the TSE for selection and 
analysis based on simple moving average (SMA). The period performance and performance ratio are also determined 
to test the validation of SMA. Our results show that SMA failed to predict the market. The inverse result between 
SMA and stock performance, and the poor performance of ratios indicate that SMA failed to predict TSE, thus 
implying market efficiency. This paper builds the foundation for other researchers to analyze the Japanese stock 
market. 
 
Keywords 
Technical analysis, efficient market hypothesis, simple moving average and Tokyo Stock Exchange. 
 
1. Introduction 
There are many techniques being used in the stock market for investors to gain profit, such as portfolio diversification 
(Markowitz, 1952; Nor & Islam, 2016, 2017), fundamental analysis (FA) (Piotroski & So 2012; Nor & Zawawi, 2020) 
and technical analysis (Park & Irwin, 2007). The first corresponds with market efficiency and deals with optimal 
portfolio selection based on sufficient number of stocks. Whereas FA and TA contradict efficient market hypothesis. 
In particular, TA is used to predict the future walk of an investment by using historical market data from financial 
market such as price, volume and other obtainable data (Yamato, 2012). It usually used to forecast the price 
movements of the investment. Generally, academic research on technical analysis is focused to techniques that can be 
expressed in the mathematical form, which be called as technical trading strategy (TTS) (Park & Irwin, 2007). Moving 
average and candlestick charts are some of the famous TA. EMH is a market that the price is ‚Äúfully reflect‚Äù available 
information (Fama, 1970). According to Jensen (1978, p.96), he defined it where ‚Äú[a] market is efficient with respect 
to information set ùúÉùúÉùúÉùúÉ if it is impossible to make economic profits by trading on the basis of information set ùúÉùúÉùúÉùúÉ.‚Äù

This means that Sony Corp. will have the highest risk to invest as the company might not be able to pay their debt and 
bankrupt. Overall, the SMA failed to analysis the TSE market as the period performance shows negative result with 
SMA analysis. Moreover, the performance ratios indicate the poor performance of the selected stock, which the result 
suggest that the best investment is invest in 3-month treasury bond. However, there are still some limitations in this 
paper. In particular, this paper only analyzes 1-year  period and 3 stocks from the market.  
 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper, we explored the profitability of SMA in the TSE. We find that SMA fails to find any historical pattern, 
and our results suggest the Japanese stock market is weak form efficient. However, our study only utilizes simple 
strategy, which is SMA. Therefore, there might still be possibility that the market is inefficient, but the SMA is unable 
to identify any pattern. Indeed, the profitability of TA relies on market inefficiency. If the market already reflects all 
available information (in this case historical stock prices), TA is hence useless. However, several studies such as Nor 
and Wickremasinghe (2014), Nor and Zawawi (2019) and Shahzad et al. (2017) show that not all markets are efficient. 
Although this might be true, technological advancements can also lead to market efficiency, as argued in Nor and 
Wickremasinghe (2017) in the Malaysian stock market. 
 
Moreover, stock prices can also be affected by different factors, including macroeconomic variables, economic policy 
uncertainty and oil prices. These issues have been explored by researchers such as Abuoliem et al. (2019a,b), Hasan 
et al. (2020a,b), Naeem et al. (2021) and Shahzad et al. (2017a,b). Bearing these in mind, further studies are needed 
to investigate the profitability of TA by using different TA models and markets. Rather than using simple rule such as 
SMA, future studies can investigate rules such as moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the relative 
strength index (RSI). In addition, issues such as environment, social and governance (ESG) can also be explored to 
enhance TA decision making process. For example, in the context of portfolios, Nor and Zawawi (2018) focused on 
the differences of performance in the investment portfolios between strong and weak corporate governance. This line 
of research is further supported by Rehman et al. (2021), who show that investors in the emerging markets are now 
seriously looking into socially responsible investing.

Abstract  
  
The increasing variety in the retail sector and complexity of the forecasting problems resulted in the need for 
increasingly complex predictive models with difficult parameterization. When demand forecasts for a considerable 
number of items need to be performed, the forecasting process can take several hours or even days, which can be 
detrimental to business operations. This paper addresses this dilemma by presenting a model for forecasting retail 
demand in the health and wellness sector that improves forecast accuracy and balances computational cost and 
performance. The model incorporates classes of predictive methods using individual selection approaches and an 
aggregate selection where the method with the best performance for a population of time series is determined and 
applied. A time series grouping technique was used due to the need to establish forecasts for more than one thousand 
SKUs, each one with demand characterized by an individual time series. Time series' centroids obtained by 
grouping with the DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) method were used to choose the best predictive method to be 
applied in each group. Results of this approach were compared with the help of the CHAID (Chi-square automatic 
interaction detection) algorithm. The selection of the predictive method through the cluster centroids showed a 
reduction in the average forecast error of 16.7% compared to the current model. In addition, the average processing 
cost of the proposed model was only 2.1 seconds per SKU, demonstrating that the selection of the predictive method 
for each cluster through the centroids proved to be an estimate with great application potential.

1. Introduction  
In any highly competitive environment, inventory and service levels are always a concern and an important 
competitive factor. In the retail industry, product availability is generally considered an essential indicator of 
quality. Low service levels can result in lost customers and sales, while, on the other hand, excessive inventories 
result in unnecessary costs due to carrying extensive inventories. The main challenge in managing retail inventory 
is balancing replenishment and demand, providing items on the shelf justified by future sales. Therefore, demand 
forecasting is an integral part of inventory management systems. Periodically updated forecasts determine target 
inventory levels and replenishment order sizes needed to reach those levels.  
Predicting with accuracy is a challenging task as the change in demand over time can be affected by many factors 
of a complex nature and modeling. This growing variety and complexity of forecasting problems have resulted in 
the need for predictive models that are increasingly complex and difficult to parameterize. In general, more complex 
models require more data and adjustments to be trained, which leads to a corresponding increase in computational 
cost reflected in time and memory requirements.  
Most organizations involved in inventory management, especially in the retail industry, are faced with making 
decisions for a large number (100's, 1,000's, 10,000's, or 100,000's) of individual items. As a result, many 
companies' complete demand forecasting process can take several hours or even days, disrupting business 
operations. Thus, one of the challenges of forecasting retail sales is to estimate future demand without imposing 
high computational or inferential demands in the forecasting process.  
The study was carried out in a company specialized in the sale of medical, orthopedic, physical conditioning, and

The present work aimed to develop a retail demand forecasting model for the health and wellness sector that would 
improve prediction accuracy and be balanced in terms of computational cost and performance. Compared to the 
technique currently adopted, the proposed model was able to reduce the average forecast error by 16.7% when 
using the NRMSE metric. That said, it can be assumed that the developed model can increase the company's 
forecast accuracy. Furthermore, the average processing cost of the proposed model was only 2.09 seconds per SKU.  
Using the k-means algorithm with the DTW metric to form groups of products with similar historical behavior 
allowed to recover an average shape that mimics the shape of the cluster members. A computational cost 96.7% 
lower was obtained in the aggregate selection than in the individual, representing a significant saving of processing 
time. On the other hand, there was an increase of 9.5% in the average of the NRMSE. Despite the slight increase 
in the forecast error, the aggregate selection method was selected in the proposed model given the reduction in the 
computational cost. The results showed considerable reductions in the forecast error arising from the application 
of the proposed model. Thus, it can be considered that it is balanced in terms of computational cost and 
performance. Finally, it can be considered that, in general, a combination of time series clustering techniques with 
the aggregate selection approach allowed expressive reductions in computational cost without excessively 
increasing forecast error.

Abstract  
 
Finance is a notable barrier to the growth of small businesses in South Africa. Scholars agree that accessible and 
affordable finance can help grow small businesses and develop the economy. Even with such evidence South Africa 
still has a poor record of manufacturing besides the progress made in agro-processing, automotive assembly, and 
mining. The country imports large amounts of clothing, home goods, and equipment. This paper investigates the quest 
to create a growing manufacturing sector by the South African government through funding. This paper is a desk 
review of the funding processes at the Industrial Development Corporation, Small Enterprise Finance Agency, and 
Gauteng Enterprise Propeller. It provides an overarching view of requirements, processes, and context. The analysis 
juxtaposes the requirements versus realities of manufacturing as cited in the introduction and the literature review. It 
is evident from this review research that South Africa does indeed have a problem of what comes first in its quest for 
growing small-scale manufacturing. The type of requirements, support available, and contextual understandings must 
be studied by policymakers equally or more like technical abilities of manufacturers. This paper further suggests that 
a developmental approach to financing small scale-manufacturing be adopted.

1. Introduction  
This paper tackles the challenge of funding and financing of small-scale manufacturing in South Africa. The country 
has a small manufacturing sector, and this is besides many attempts to create new manufacturers (Matthee and 
Heymans, 2013). Funding and financing are scarcely available for small scale manufacturers and hard to access due 
to stringent financing criteria (Marwa, 2014). The preparedness of small-scale manufacturers to fulfill the funding 
criteria is another challenge. 
 
Small scale manufacturers fall in the category of small and medium enterprises. They acquire financing and funding 
within the provisions made for small and medium enterprises (Khoase and Ndayizigamiye, 2018). Small scale 
manufacturers are not exempt from the stiff competition of funding and financing that affects all sorts of small and 
medium sized businesses. The points at which an enterprise meets the funding criteria vary and is dependent on a lot 
of factors such as: readiness of the business to apply for funding, compliance with tax laws, up-to-date registration 
documents and financial records that show viability (Alexander, 2011).  
 
Funding and financing are part of a broad range of challenges that face small and medium business (Cant and Wiid, 
2013; Ramukumba, 2014; Zondi, 2017). The broad range of challenges (like the financing criteria) include stringent 
regulations that govern businesses, levies that choke cashflow in the context of small businesses, lack of funding and 
finance products directed at small and medium enterprises, and a meager small scale manufacturing sector. Relative 
research has shown a relationship between finance, funding, and growth (Cant and Wiid, 2013). If the funding and 
finance challenge is not tackled the small-scale manufacturing sector in South Africa will rarely experience growth 
(Mbonyane and Ladzani, 2011).

The sustainability factor is of interest to all agencies, it begins with evaluating the product offer and wide set 
of verifiable information to back the viability of the investment, and possible returns. 
 
 
Figure 1 - Funding and Financing Eligibility and Requirements 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The eligibility criteria and requirements prove in the case presented in this paper to be a specific barrier to accessing 
finance and funding by small and medium enterprises. Zondi, (2017) shows that for small businesses to thrive funding 
and finance must be available for the different stages of enterprise development. While the agencies offer different 
funding packages, they remain locked into the stringent requirements and are less developmental in their approach. 
They insist on collateral, that is not readily available in the small but promising manufacturing enterprises ‚Äì including 
shareholder contributions, unreasonable proofs of sustainability and leaving no room for development. 
 
Following the review of the various offerings, processes, and requirements it is recommended that funding and 
financing agencies in South Africa and elsewhere, consider the following: 
‚Ä¢ 
Adopting a developmental approach to financing small-scale manufacturing 
‚Ä¢ 
Learning about the production processes of the enterprises needing finance 
‚Ä¢ 
Drop the step-by-step funding and financing process but increase focus on product sustainability and 
viability 
‚Ä¢ 
Equip potential enterprises with alternatives and offer experimental grants. 
 
In Malaysia and India, the developmental funding approach supported by government and private sectors has 
demonstrated success. According to Padachi, Howorth and Narasimhan, (2012) traditional sources of financing 
incorporated into the modern-agency driven sources of finance increase the success of small businesses in Malaysia. 
A developmental approach would further allow GEP, IDC and SEFA to assist small businesses to diversify their 
funding sources and achieve productivity in return as it has been the case in the Malaysian context (Rasiah, 2011).  
 
6. Conclusion  
This review shows that there is an opportunity to explore the role of financing and funding agencies beyond the three 
selected here. From this review it can be concluded that finance and funding agencies cannot on their own meet the 
needs of small-scale manufacturers. The work of financing and funding agencies when juxtaposed with the 
manufacturing requirements, the need for refinance and grants it does not enable small-scale manufacturing activity 
to thrive. The funding and financing sector is obsessed with stringent requirements and in process is inhibited from

Abstract  
 
This paper proposes a new combined scheme (termed as Mnp-EWMA scheme) for monitoring multi-attribute 
characteristics. The proposed Mnp-EWMA scheme combines both the multi-attribute np (Mnp) and multi-attribute 
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) charts for effective monitoring fraction nonconforming. In this 
study, the Average Number of Defectives (AND) is used as an objective function in an optimization model to identify 
the best design variables of the proposed Mnp-EWMA scheme. The performance of the proposed Mnp-EWMA 
scheme is compared with that of the Mnp and MEWMA charts under five scenarios with the different inputs of design 
specifications. The results show that the Mnp-EWMA chart outperforms the Mnp and MEWMA charts under different 
settings.

1. Introduction  
When there are multiple processes, which have many associated quality characteristics, there is a need to control & 
inspect all characteristics of such quality simultaneously because all these characteristics have impact on product. As 
there are numerous quality characteristics are involved in monitoring the quality of process, only multi-attribute control 
charts can help the industries nowadays (Jolayemi 2000) . Limited work founded on monitoring multiple quality 
characteristic, especially on multi-attribute control charts compared to multi-variate control charts (Chong et al. 2019). 
Haq and Khoo (2019) developed an adaptive multi-variate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average chart 
(AMEWMA). Similarly, Yue and Liu (2017) proposed an adaptive multi-variate nonparametric EWMA control chart. 
Furthermore, Park and Jun (2015) examine the process performance using multiple testing approach & multi-variate 
EWMA control chart. Other multi-variate control charts implemented Hotelling‚Äôs T2 that caters to the Multi-variate of 
the business processes (Ahsan et al. 2020, Hadian and Rahimifard 2019). Zhang et al. (2010) designed a new multi-
variate control chart called ELR chart; to monitor the mean and variability of the process simultaneously. Whereas 
Aparisi and Luna (2009) suggested a control chart that has the ability to detect very small shifts showing in the multi-
variate process, named Multi-variate Synthetic-T2 control chart. Khoo et al. (2009) developed a multi-variate Synthetic 
WSD‚ÄìT2. Adegoke et al. (2018) highlighted the effect of using multi-variate cumulative sum (MCUSUM) control 
charts on the manufactured product. On the other hand, Niaki and Abbasi (2006) proposed a new technique that assists 
in monitoring the multi-attribute processes. Haridy et al. (2013) proposed an optimization model for CUSUM chart and 
np scheme (np-CUSUM). Haridy et al. (2014) illustrated two different charts for monitoring multiple attributes and 
evaluated their performance. Chong et al. (2019) suggested a binomial multi-attribute cumulative sum (MCUSUM) 
chart for detecting the upward shifts in the nonconforming units. Shamsuzzaman et al. (2018) designed a multi-attribute 
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) chart for processes of products that has multiple defects. 
Jolayemi (1999) evaluated the performance of the multi-attribute control chart (MACC) and compared it with np control 
chart. 
 
 In this research, a new combined pattern (termed as Mnp-EWMA) of MEWMA and multi-attribute np (Mnp) charts is 
proposed for monitoring multiple attribute characteristics. The goal of this study to integrate the MEWMA & Mnp

The overall performance of the three control charts under five different cases are reflected by AND. It is clearly 
observed that the ratio of AND/ANDMnp-EWMA for the three charts are always more than 1. It is interesting to note that 
the control chart that produces a smaller number of defectives, has high strength of detection effectiveness. This 
indicates that the proposed Mnp-EWMA scheme always outperforms the Mnp and MEWMA control charts. 
 
7. Conclusion  
This paper shows the design and implementation of a combined Mnp-EWMA scheme for monitoring multiple 
attributes. The proposed scheme is compared with the Mnp and MEWMA charts using the average number of defectives 
(AND) as an objective function to be minimized. The overall performance of the proposed Mnp-EWMA is examined 
and compared with Mnp & MEWMA control charts. The results of comparative study indicate that the proposed Mnp-
EWMA scheme always performs better than the Mnp and MEWMA charts. For further optimization of the proposed 
Mnp-EWMA control chart, n and h might be involved in the optimization model as design variables in a future work.

Abstract 
The objective of this project was to compare the results of creating hard apple cider with fresh and frozen wort. The 
study considered the percentage of alcohol, percentage of sugar, pH levels and temperature. There are several other 
factors that affect the characteristics of hard apple cider but for the purpose of this investigation, it was only considered 
those mentioned. For each of these variables, it was analyzed the variability between the two processes. The results 
of this investigation will be of great value to apple farmers as it can be another selling channel available to them. This 
discovery will mean that, in case of an overproduction of apples, farmers and apple cider producers can store the 
excess of wort on a fridge and use it later. The study considered for the percentage of alcohol the unit %alcohol and 
for the percentage of sugar %Brix. For both variables a refractometer was used. We also analyzed the pH levels with 
pH strips and a pH meter. In addition, for temperature a cooking thermometer was used. The process for creating the 
hard apple cider was as follows: first, the stems of the apples were removed. Then, the fruit was cleaned with running 
water. Later, a solution of drinking water and sodium metabisulfite was created to immerse the apples on it with the 
objective of eliminating any substance that will contaminate the wort. The process was continued by cutting the apples 
and blending them. Next, half of the wort was deposited on a fermentation tank of our own creation (for the process 
of fresh wort) and the other half on a recipient that will be stored in the freezer for a month (for the process of frozen 
wort). A 10L water bottle, a valve and an airlock were used to create the fermentation tank. Measurements of %Brix 
and pH levels were made each other day for a month. After a month, the substance from the fermentation tank was 
deposited on a glass recipient with a cork. This process was repeated for the frozen wort. At the end, it was calculated 
the % alcohol and the %Brix.

Abstract  
 
Development in meeting the needs of the community in order to create a welfare, the government must pay attention 
to the problem of poverty. So the government issued a policy, namely the Family Hope Program (FHP). FHP aims for 
intense social protection for underprivileged households. The government takes a long time to determine the selection 
of FHP, therefore a decision support system is needed to assist and speed up the process of determining the selection 
of FHP. In order for a decision support system to run well, a method is needed to facilitate the implementation of a 
decision support system. The recommended method is the simple additive weighting (SAW) method. The SAW 
method is used to find the weighted number of performance ratings on each alternative for all attributes. Slawi Wetan 
Village is a village where most of the population lacks clothing, food, and minimal income. So that there are often 
problems, including the criteria for the population being surveyed are not appropriate, the selection selection is still 
manual and still uses data from several years ago. The best solution for solving problems in the village of slawi wetan, 
with a decision support system using the SAW method which helps the process of managing FHP data so that in 
managing FHP data it becomes better, on target according to predetermined criteria. The decision support system can 
be used to determine the selection of FHP, find out population data, know the results of the FHP selection, and can 
provide a recap of the results of the selection report for determining the selection of FHP.

1. Introduction 
Development in meeting the needs of the community in order to create a welfare (Wiryomartono, 2015). This is to 
realize a community welfare, the government must pay attention to the problem of poverty (Najib & Kiminami, 2011). 
Because poverty that occurs in Indonesia is a problem that must be resolved immediately (Hasibuan et al., 2018). This 
problem is very important because the number of poor people in Indonesia has reached 25.99 million people, which is 
9.84 percent of the total population of Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik Republik Indonesia, 2018). Realizing these 
problems, the government made efforts to reduce the poverty rate (Astradanta et al., 2016). 
Efforts made by the government are by issuing a policy related to empowering poor families, one of which is the 
government's policy in this case through the Family Hope Program (FHP) (Y. Nugroho, 2011). FHP or often called the

Abstract  
 
With its various advantages and conveniences, the franchise business is a type of business that is in great demand by 
entrepreneurs today, especially the franchise business with the type of food and beverage, this makes many people 
who want to start a business interested in trying the franchise business, with many choices of food and beverage 
franchises. that exist, making many people feel confused about which franchise business is suitable according to the 
circumstances of prospective business actors. From these problems, the need for a decision support system that can 
help provide recommendations to prospective entrepreneurs about a suitable food and beverage franchise business. 
The criteria used for franchise data analysis are capital, outlets, bep, franchise fees, and profits. In this study, the data 
processing process uses the Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique (SMART) method as a multi-attribute problem 
solving method. To determine the benchmark for the final result, the author made a questionnaire that had been filled 
in as many as 53, from the questionnaire there were 52 out of 53 or 98.1% of respondents who stated that the franchise 
business recommendation system really helped them to determine the type of business to be done, Then as many as 
47 of 53 or 88.7% of respondents intend to seriously run a franchise business, and as many as 10 of 12 or 83.3% of 
respondents who have tried the application say this application is useful.

1. Introduction 
Starting a business, of course, begins with an idea (Hardjono & Van Marrewijk, 2001). However, ideas often become 
obstacles when there is an intention to open a business (Vuontisj√§rvi, 2013). Sometimes prospective entrepreneurs feel 
that the intention is already there, but are confused about how to start and what kind of business they want (Burke & 
Clark, 2016). Currently, business opportunities are increasingly wide open with the proliferation of food and beverage 
franchises. Currently, the number of food and beverage franchise businesses is the most dominating partnership business 
compared to businesses in other fields (Najib & Kiminami, 2011). Therefore, as a beginner who wants to run a culinary 
business with a franchise system, there are many options for choosing the most potential food and beverage franchise 
products with varying price packages in Indonesia (Scheidel & Farrell, 2015). 
 
The franchise business is a growing business and is in great demand by prospective entrepreneurs (Karamti & 
Grzybowski, 2010), because many provide franchise partnership businesses in Indonesia. This makes many prospective 
entrepreneurs feel confused when choosing a franchise business that is right for them. Based on the problems in 
choosing a franchise business, this research focuses on building a decision support system for choosing a franchise 
business. The decision support system uses the Simple Multi Attribute Rating Technique method approach, which is in

Abstract  
 
Samsung Smart Switch is a multi-platform application that will make it easier for users to share and transfer data via 
wired or wireless from various platforms to all Samsung Galaxy devices. This study was conducted to analyze the 
adoption factors for the acceptance of data sharing applications using the Samsung Smart Switch with the Unified 
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. UTAUT consists of four independent variables and 
one bound, namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and behavioral 
intention. This research was conducted on 100 respondents of Samsung Smart Switch users who had moved data from 
old devices to Samsung Galaxy devices. Data was collected through interviews and questionnaires, and multiple linear 
regression was used for data processing. The results of the study obtained the results of the analysis that the variables 
of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition have a correlation value of 0.902 
to behavioral intention, meaning that the independent and dependent variables in this study have a strong relationship, 
the calculated F value is 103.360, the value of R Square (R2) of 81.3% while the rest is influenced by other variables. 
It can also be concluded that simultaneously, the variables of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social 
influence, facilitating condition have a significant effect on behavioral intention. Effort expectancy and facilitating 
condition variables have a significant effect on behavioral intention partially, while performance expectancy and social 
influence do not have a significant effect on behavioral intention.

1. Introduction 
Mobile device technology or known in English as a mobile device is a technology that is developing very rapidly 
(Tolle, Pinandito, Kharisma, & Dewi, 2017). Digital In 2019 Report data in October 2019 from the We Are Social 
website shows that no less than 7,730 billion mobile device users around the world or around 55% of the world's 
population use mobile devices (Simon, 2019). Sharing and moving data using applications will be needed, especially if 
the data to be shared is large or large besar (Kurniawan & Creativity, 2017). One example of such a media sharing 
application is the Samsung Smart Switch. This Smart Switch application was developed by Samsung and is also a 
mainstay feature on Samsung devices. Samsung Smart Switch users until this research was made have been downloaded 
more than 100 million times. 
A large number of downloads and good reviews on Google Playstore underlies this research. The need for the 
application to be carefully evaluated for user acceptance of the application. Several models can be used to evaluate user

Abstract  
 
Cancer patients are usually advised to follow a number of treatments. Such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and 
surgery. Now increasingly popular is therapy with the method of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is the latest 
breakthrough in cancer treatment. This therapy uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells. In this study, 
a comparison was made between the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and the Neural Network by using the 
Rapid Minner application and the Immunotherapy dataset, showing the results that the Neural Network has a higher 
accuracy value with an average accuracy value of 79.08%, 95.52%, 95.63% in three stages while for Support Vector 
Machine the average accuracy value is 78.22%, 83.82%, 86.48% in three successive stages from the results which 
concluded that the Neural Network has a higher level of accuracy than Support Vector Machine for Immunotherapy 
dataset classification, using the Genetic Algorithm Optimization Feature Proven effective in increasing the accuracy 
of both classification algorithms.

1. Introduction 
In the era of big data, the tremendous growth of data dimensions, many redundant and irrelevant features in data 
collection, resulting in not only an increase in computational costs but also a decrease in classification accuracy. 
Therefore, Feature Selection (FS), which aims to select a subset of relevant features to reduce overfitting and improve 
classification performance, has attracted great attention in data pre-processing (Zhou, 2021). Wart is a skin disease 
caused by the mediated Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Experts are trying to find customized and effective treatment 
methods for patients. Cryotherapy and Immunotherapy are the best-known and most common methods of treating 
common warts. Doctors need to determine which method will give better results for each patient (Asbar & Saptari, 
2017). This diagnosis requires a classifier with high predictive accuracy and must also recommend some useful 
insights that can be interpreted to the doctor. This in turn will help medical practitioners to decide on an effective time 
and treatment plan for each patient (Roopal Jain, 2018). 
 
Cancer immunotherapy provides long-lasting clinical benefits in only a minority of patients, mainly due to the lack of 
reliable biomarkers for accurate prediction of treatment outcome and evaluation of response (Santosh Kumar Paidi, 
2020). The cost of cancer treatment is quite expensive, so it is necessary to have the right treatment technology with 
a high success rate for curing cancer.

5. Conclusions 
The results of the classification of the Immunotherapy dataset using the Support Vector Machine and Neural Network 
algorithms can be concluded that the Neural network algorithm is superior to the Support Vector Machine seen from 
the average value of the Neural Network algorithm, getting the average results from 3 research stages, namely 79.08% 
of the classification without using optimization, for the average value of 95.52% using Adaboost optimization to 
improve the performance of the Neural Network Algortima, and the highest average of the Neural Network algorithm 
is 95.63% using genetic algorithm feature optimization and algorithm optimization using Adaboost. The Support 
Vector Machine algorithm gets an average result with a value of 78.22% for classification without using optimization, 
while with a value of 83.82% using Adaboost optimization, and the last with a value of 86.48% using genetic algorithm 
feature optimization and optimization. the algorithm uses the Adaboost algorithm, it looks quite far from the results 
obtained in the 3 stages of testing, Genetic Algorithm that can handle various optimizations depending on the objective 
function (fitness) whether balanced or unbalanced, linear or non-linear, continuous or discontinuous, or with random 
noise (Gorunescu, 2011). Genetic Algorithm that is applied using optimization features and Adaboost is proven to be 
effective in increasing the accuracy value significantly. This is based on 3 experiments carried out using split 
validation from various ratios, this method is effective because the T-test results show p value <0.05 which indicates 
this result is significant.

Abstract 
Many e-Marketing activities need to competitiveness survival by rapidly responding to customers' requests in jerky 
circumstances via understand and implement Jidoka. The Jidoka provides E-Systems high speed manipulating for requests 
information through an allocated algorithm. Jidoka targets to satisfy both customer and enterprise by providing commodities 
in minimum cost and delivery time. The main limitation faces the algorithm is dealing with an uncertain requests e-
marketing path, the limitation that lengthens the requests' Manipulating-Lead-Time MLT and affects their profits. The main 
challenge in manipulating the customer's request is the nature of e-marketing, which is subject to uncertain requests and 
uncertain cancelations for the serviceable requests are allowed. The probability distributions for requests are not known 
(i.e., fully randomly), but can estimate the significant e-stock mean and their standard deviations. In this paper, A proposed 
allocation algorithm that consists of two sequential phases aims at determining the MLT according to serviceable, returns, 
and disposal requests over the offer horizon, which reduced by 21% of previous Lead-time and the second estimates the 
volume of e-stock, which related to a shortage cost analysis that reduced by 47%.

Introduction 
The Adventurer e-marketing is a new vision, especially in deploying social-media marketing business. It is 
unsurprising that this vision is highly popular among people and salespeople, which emerged from their comfortability in 
closing the deals. This vision has one famous limitation, which is estimating for e-stock that satisfies all customers. 
Nonetheless, it remains relatively unknown in the academic and scientiÔ¨Åc communities. Weng Marc Lim (2020), aims to 
address this knowledge gap by oÔ¨Äering greater clarity on this concept, via adopt an interrogative approach targeting to 
provide a richer understanding of e-marketing approach. Weng Marc Lim hopes to become a seminal reference for academia 
to understand challenger marketing. Osmonbekov, Adamson, and Dixon (2019, p. 289) say that challenger marketing is a 
story of probabilities. It is a story of increasing the likelihood of winning, keeping, and growing your business over-time. 
All collected data tell us is that if you want to place your bets, this [challenger marketing] is the best bet. The Adventurer 
e-marketing is a concept that encapsulates the powerful ideas captured in two coin's faces: The Adventurer Sale and The 
Adventurer Customer. This study proposes that the inclusion of inter-people networks may explain different levels of 
control over the channel partner when there are uncertain requests (e.g., requests) as cited by Ebers & Oerlemans, (2016). 
Customer's intention to initiate a business relationship with the supplier via the e-marketing process. There are many results 
that indicate important preferential differences in supplier pre-selection between customers according to two variables, 
namely quantity and cost in minimum versus maximum value cases. Forecasting demand is a crucial issue for driving 
efficient e-marketing operations management plans. This is especially the case in the Swvl, Uber, Careem booking and 
systems like that, where demand word and cancellation are uncertainty as noted by Dean, T., et al., (2016), lack of seasonal 
data trends usually coexist. Requested requests allocation in e-marketing management studies on how to allocate the limited 
available products (e.g., seats and trips in this work), which optimally to satisfy the uncertain customers' demands. In the 
e-marketing activities, advice creating wait booking list even if e-stock run out, due to cancellation activity. This paper 
focuses on the modeling and optimization of three related issues namely waiting time, service reliability, and losses as 
discussed by Gould, A. N. et al., (2016). The first section of the paper investigates an important and unique issue in an e-

phases. The first aims to schedule the waiting booking-list in minimum delivery time to increase the customers satisfaction 
by 21%, while the second phase makes an analysis for significant costs such as fixed, variable, shortage, and opportunity 
cost to satisfy the enterprise via increase their profit by 47%. the e-marketing has four variables that have impact relations 
such as time interval with minimum cost and service reliability with waiting time as illustrated in Figure. 16, the waiting 
time reduced by selecting the nearest suitable station for customers with respect to a minimum serviceable time and cost 
and increase utilization to achieve satisfaction to customers and enterprise via e-marketing processes.

Abstract  
 
The socio-food-flow system focuses on the structure of mental models, which can assist in recognising social systems 
and human structures as well as determining their knowledge and views about the level of comprehension of the food-
chain system. Qualitative methods like face-to-face and online interviews, cognitive mapping, and even image 
interpretation, are used to create the mental model method. It is also assisted using quantitative approaches for the 
goal of obtaining more accurate and relevant data, such as questionnaires, so that the results acquired cannot be 
challenged by any researcher. In addition, the researchers are carrying out a literature review over the next five years 
abroad, from 2015 to 2021. As a result of the study‚Äôs findings, most researchers prefer to discuss food-related research 
in the context of food health and safety, while others prefer to discuss it in the context of food treatment technology. 
This is supported by the findings of previous studies conducted by researchers, in which 13 journals were reviewed 
from indexed sources such as ScienceDirect and Scopus from 2015 to 2021. This study could be used to remind the 
whole community of the food chain system‚Äôs relevance for improving product quality and reducing the environmental 
impact of production. The conceptual approach of the model can assist researchers in increasing public awareness of 
the relevance of the food chain system in the future.

1. Introduction  
The sustainability of the food chain systems management directly leads to the health of the Earth‚Äôs systems. 
Maintaining a stable supply of basic resources is the main concern of territorial sustainability (Wostl, 2019). 
Simultaneously, agricultural systems are a significant factor affecting the impact of human activities on the Earth‚Äôs 
ecosystems, accounting for approximately 60% of global greenhouse gas emissions (Meng Cai, 2021). As a result, 
food production in developing countries such as Malaysia is incredibly challenging, particularly in terms of resource 
management efficiency. Furthermore, production and consumption patterns can be identified based on actor roles in 
the food chain system network. Given the complexity of the food chain system and the interplay of socioeconomic 
factors, supply and consumer demand, this phenomenon of reduced food reserve loss should be carefully considered, 
considering that the majority of the world‚Äôs citizens have a positive spending pattern on imported food products and 
dietary restrictions (Charlene Li, 2021). 
 
Thus, food chain management has a strong correlation with influencing the factors involved, as well as the role of 
indirect actors, such as the importance of nutrition, health, economic development of society, stakeholders‚Äô 
involvement, and key sectors in food production and processing. According to Juan D. Su√°rez-G√≥mez (2021),

4. Conclusion  
The Food Chain System is a distribution network that is inextricably linked to logistics and comes in a variety of 
sociocultural, economic, and environmental configurations. The food chain system‚Äôs conservation is critical for 
preventing the degradation of soil, water, air, and human health resources. The food chain system serves as a 
benchmark for evaluating a country‚Äôs food supply network‚Äôs performance in light of factors such as perishable food 
sources, seasonal food production, and the availability of high-quality and sufficient food sources, as well as 
transportation and processing facilities for food products, to meet consumer needs. Understanding the behaviour and 
the comprehension of human agents is critical in the food chain system due to their relevance to changing consumption 
patterns of current food sources. Consequently, authorities place a high priority on efficient governance of food chain 
systems in order to address the issue of excess or reduced food supply and ensure future sustainability. Previous 
research has demonstrated the inability of concerned parties to focus on simultaneous cognitive thinking across the 
overall food chain system. Thus, bridging the gap through the consolidation of multiple objectives and cross-
disciplinary food systems through the use of mental models is a more pertinent and ideal solution that adheres to the 
Sustainable Development Agenda

Abstract 
 
Municipal solid waste covers 64% of the overall waste composition in Malaysia. The highest waste found in the 
municipal solid waste was household waste, from which 70-80% of the total waste consisted of recyclable materials 
disposed at the landfills. Solid waste management which focuses on the recovery potential of recyclable materials 
found at the landfills helps in restoring environment by reducing the volume of waste at the landfills, and by improving 
economic market of recyclable materials. Thus, this study aims to identify the value of input and output flows of 
recyclable materials in municipal solid waste (MSW) system at the generation, collection and transportation, 
separation, and final disposal phase. The application of Material Flow Analysis (MFA) was suitable as the supporting 
tool in order to visualize the flows of the recyclable materials throughout the four phases in the MSW system. The 
primary data for the MFA were obtained from field observation, in-depth interviews and literature review, covering 
eight districts of Terengganu. The results showed that the highest input flow of recyclables materials in the MSW 
system was from household waste flow. The total flow of recyclable materials was 1.54 kilotonnes per year while the 
output flow of recyclable materials being recycled was only 6.92 kilotonnes per year from the overall flow of the 
system. It is suggested that the partnership between private sectors and local authority should also involve intensive 
promotion of the 3Rs activities to encourage recycling activities among people in Terengganu.

The total input and output flow of recyclable materials in MSW system could be calculated and visually presented by 
using STAN-MFA. The MSW has a good potential to recover recyclable materials. Hence, the authority should 
emphasize in waste minimization and improving recycling. The task of recycling was mostly taken by scavengers, 
and this should be supported actively by households by practicing separation at the sources. In order to improve the 
highlighted issues, the proposed recommendation can be considered by the local authority to achieve a sustainable 
solid waste management.

Abstract 
 
Apart from Malaysia being supplied with and having abundance of water resources, the country is also experiencing 
increasing problems concerning water resources. Kampong Pantai Senok, Bachok is one of the affected areas in 
Kelantan that are having issues with immoderate amounts of water consumption, unsatisfactory services by the water 
company due to rapid social and economic growth. Therefore, a small seawater desalination plant is installed to 
address these issues. The objective of this study is to identify the potential social impact associated with stakeholder 
participation, which is the local community, using Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) as a methodology. In S-
LCA, the methodology very much resembles the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework and both assessments gave 
phases of procedures, which are goal and scope definitions, the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), the Life Cycle Impact 
Assessment (LCIA) and interpretation. A set of questionnaires was developed using the selected sub-categories 
proposed by UNEP (2009) to be accessed by the stakeholders (local community). The results showed positive social 
impacts for the local community, as satisfaction is high for the sub-categories involved.

1. Introduction 
The importance of water in life is very significant and cannot be denied as water is the most valuable natural resource 
compared to others. According to the World Health Organization, one in three people on the global continent are 
affected by these water scarcities and almost one fifth of the world inhabitants live in areas with water shortage 
problems. Although Malaysia is provided with plentiful of water resources, the country is also experiencing increased 
demand of water for the past few years. Additional reasons for the water resource problems in this country are due to 
growth population, urbanization and improving of life standards. It also unveiled the lack of access to fresh and clean 
water supply at rural populations compared to urban people (Ahmed et al., 2014). As in Kelantan, due to the increasing

3185","4.4 Results on midpoint analysis of local community 
The calculation on the midpoint analysis to identify the potential social impact in Table 4 shows that there is a 
significant difference between impact categories on local community by the sub-categories involved. The highest level 
of positive social impact obtained are safe and healthy living conditions with 82.3%, followed by local community 
involvement (70.9%) and lastly on job opportunities at 54.9%. The existence of the seawater desalination plant in 
Kampung Pantai Senok has positive implications on the local community as it provides safe drinking water 
continuously to them in a non-hazardous environment. The authorities also provide activities that involved both 
parties. The authorities need to provide training to some local communities that have the qualifications required to 
increase local employment opportunities.

5. Conclusion 
As a conclusion, the assessment on social impacts from the life cycle of the seawater desalination process in this study 
has identified a few social aspects which requires improvements for the local community. The seawater desalination 
process activities influence the society nearby. Most of the local community had good opinions on the installation of 
the seawater desalination plant. The social aspects derived from S-LCA satisfied the requirements in terms of social 
significance. However, there are some improvements needed on the sub-categories of job opportunities for the local 
community. Programme and training can be provided to some local communities that have the qualifications required 
to contribute to local employment opportunities. Other research can be done for the rest of the seawater desalination 
process to get the overall potential social impact as this study only focused on three life cycle phases. The results of 
the study will help the plant management to reduce any negative social impacts and upgrade the efficiency of the 
drinking water production.

Abstract 
 
The level of prosperity of the owners represents the high firm value. Investors' primary focus has shifted to the firm's 
value. The firm's value reflects the level of prosperity of its shareholders and investors. It means that the firm value 
has become a performance indicator for the company's finance manager. One of the most primary company goals is 
to obtain maximum profit from the business activities. However, the purpose of establishing a company is not only to 
achieve maximum profit but also to increase the prosperity of parties related to the company's business activities, such 
as shareholders and stakeholders, so that the company's value increases. Thus, the current investigation examines the 
relationship between working capital management and leverage towards firm value in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. 
This quantitative study utilized secondary data were collected from the Central Bureau of Statistics of Indonesia for 
2016 to 2020. The data were analyzed using time series regression by assisting econometrical software, namely 
EVIEWS-10. The results indicated that Working Capital Management has a positive and significant effect on Firm 
Value. Besides that, the leverage has no significant effect on Firm Value. In conclusion, this study has identified the 
important factor influencing firm value, and leverage has not affected firm value. The findings of this research can be 
used as the basis for making investment decisions. The aspect measures the ability of the company's assets to generate 
a return on investment made in the company's asset instruments.

Abstract 
 
Fluctuations in the international price of crude oil follow the axioms of the market economy. The prevailing price 
level is mainly decided by the demand and supply mechanism as a fundamental element. The oil price shocks had a 
negative and significant effect on Gross Domestic Product. Oil shocks transmission mechanism to the economy, 
starting from the effects of demand, supply, and even the effects of the exchange rate of trade. Another factor that 
significantly influences the financial system's stability is the monetary cycle, which consists of inflation and the impact 
of exchange rates. The type of data in this study is time-series data taken from January 2017 to December 2019 by 
conducting a documentation study conducted on the publication of monthly transaction reports from the required data. 
The financial system stability index is measured by the credit growth rate of north Sumatra and monthly data from the 
monetary cycle and macroeconomic factors of world oil price. The results showed that inflation has the highest 
extraction value, which significantly affects Financial Stability. Also, the velocity of money has moderated the 
relationship between the exchange rates and the financial system stability of North Sumatra, Indonesia. The findings 
of this study can assist the stakeholders, including the government, which is financial system stability can be realized 
by limiting the circulation of foreign currency in Indonesia by only granting ownership permits and foreign currency 
transactions for certain needs. Then, the government must play a serious role in dealing with the symptoms of inflation

Abstract 
 
In this work, a system for approximating soil NPK (Nitrogen- Phosphorus-Potassium) level, from the measured pH 
value of the soil was developed. The moisture level of the soil was also determined. The proposed system‚Äôs design 
involves the use of soil moisture sensor, pH sensor, and peristaltic liquid pump with silicone tubing (12V DC power) 
employed as the actuator. The system is mobile and can be easily transported from one place to another. Extensive 
literature review revealed that most researchers determine the NPK level of soil from the reference chart of pH level 
0-7 which considers only the acidic level. This is due to the fact that the required nutrients for most crops are present 
in the soil of pH level of 4.5-7.0. However, crops like asparagus, beans, and garlic can yield optimally in alkaline soil 
of pH level of 6.5-8.0.This justifies the need to extend our findings to alkaline pH level. The develop system 
approximate the NPK level of both acidic and alkaline soil, from the measured corresponding pH value.  The actuator 
is explored for necessary action of irrigation and fertigation if required after determine the moisture level and the NPK 
level.

1. Introduction 
The quantity and quality of farm produce is a reflection of soil condition (Christensen, 2001). Crops degrade when 
there is insufficient rate of supply of necessary nutrients. Fertilizer is usually applied to improve soil properties for 
proper plant growth. The type and quantity of fertilizer to be applied depends on the contents of the available nutrients 
in the soil. (Ghosh and Devi, 2019) stated that soil moisture, pH value and NPK value are generally known as the most 
important soil conditions considered in farming.  
 
Soil pH is a characteristic that describes the relative acidity or alkalinity of the soil.pH values ranges from 0-14. Soils 
are considered acidic below a pH of 5, and very acidic below a pH of 4 (Slessarev, et al., 2016). Crops like apple, 
carrot, corn among others require acidic soil with pH in the range of 4.5-7.0. Conversely, soils are considered alkaline 
above a pH of 7.5 and very alkaline above a pH of 8. Plants, shrubs and vegetables like Asparagus, leek, elder- box, 
and garlic, among others require alkaline soil with pH in the range of 6.5-8.0. Soil pH values are measured in a standard 
laboratory, by mixing 10g of soil with 20 ml of 0.01 M CaCl2 solution. The pH is measured using an appropriate 
electrode connected to a pH meter (Burt and Soil Survey Staff, 2014).Recently, spectrophotometric methods have 
been developed to measure soil pH involving addition of an indicator dye to the soil extract. These compared well to 
glass electrode measurements but offer substantial advantages such as lack of drift, liquid junction and suspension 
effects (Bargrizan, et al., 2017).

Abstract 
Tuberculosis occurs in many developing countries, one of them is in Indonesia. This disease emergence is 
due to a lack of understanding by the community to treat the mild diseases that are symptoms of 
tuberculosis. Then, Madurese people have a well-recognized culture of traditional medicine. For its 
effectiveness, traditional medicine from Madura becomes renowned. Several plants have been used by 
Madurese community, which are potentially bioactive as anti-inflammatory and anti-tuberculosis. RFI was 
used to evaluate the data from the interviews to find out which plants are most effective in treating 
symptoms of Tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to determine the types of plants used by the 
community to prevent symptoms of TB in the Pamekasan district. The method used in this study is a 
descriptive qualitative approach by interview techniques. Based on the study's findings, it can be inferred 
that the Magnolia champaca plant was the most popular among respondents. Magnolia champaca is 
processed according to a specific prescription as a traditional medicine for treating tuberculosis symptoms. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
The knowledge of Indonesian people on the efficacy of plants is based on the knowledge and experience of 
people from their ancestors. This knowledge handed down from generation to generation. The Madurese 
people uphold the traditional medicine culture. Traditional medicine culture through herbal has an interest 
in the last decade(Mudjijono, dkk., 2014). Based on empirical studies, it has been known that the Madura 
tribe is the only tribe who still uses traditional medicine to prevent through herbal formulation. Furthermore, 
the efficacy of Madura herbal medicine has been known by the wider community. Jamu Madura is not only 
used for mother and child health but also to treat diseases (Handayani, 2008). Madurese has a wide variety 
of traditional medicines. They have knowledge about disease classification, medicinal properties, treatment 
methods, body caring method, and medicinal plant species. Several types of medicinal plants used to reduce 
heat, cough medicine, vaginal discharge, itching in infants, and high blood pressure (Destryana, 2019).

1. Introduction  
The insurance sector as Indonesia's financial services sector plays an important role in the stability of the Indonesian 
economy through risk management. Through the insurance sector, economic actors can transfer their risk of loss, so 
that daily economic activities can continue (Setiawan, 2013). In European Union, Solvency II is prudential regime for 
insurance and reinsurance, concerned on the principle that insurance institutions must have sufficient financial 
resources to cope with potential insolvencies in their operations, thereby preventing those financial difficulties of risk 
profile of each individual insurance could disseminate to the market as a whole (EU law). 
Malik (2011) revealed that the insurance sector is integrated in the financial industry which acts as an intermediary 
institution. The Financial Services Authority (OJK) stated that the number of sharia life insurance assets nationally in 
2019 reached Rp 45.80 trillion. Meanwhile, conventional life insurance assets were recorded at Rp 756.52 trillion. 
Then the Sharia insurance market share in 2019 reached 6.05%. Monitoring the financial performance of insurance 
companies is very important in order to optimize market potential and consumer confidence. Fundamental factors in 
insurance companies are reflected in the financial ratios of Risk Based Capital (RBC) and Early Warning System 
(EWS) (Hapsari, et.al, 2014).

Abstract  
 
This paper investigates the relationship between firm ‚Äì specific factors and profitability in transportation sub-sector 
industry in Indonesia. The study has collected data from Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) of 26 firms from 2015 
to 2019. This study explores three hypotheses explaining the relation between (i) Leverage and profitability; (ii) Firm 
size and firm‚Äôs Profitability; and (iii) Sales growth and firm‚Äôs profitability. Primarily OLS has been applied using 
STATA 16 software, followed by panel data estimation. In our results we do not observe that leverage can induce 
profitability in the study object. At the same time, sales growth and profitability is not correlated strongly. When we 
apply separate regression, leverage with DER and LDER proxies have strong effect on firm‚Äôs profitability. Also, the 
relationship between firm size and profitability is strong in the 2 regressions. Meanwhile sales growth does not affect 
profitability.  ROA has been used as the proxy of firm profitability. The results derived from regressions can put light 
on firm‚Äôs performance specifically in transportation sub sector and, simultaneously, may set guidance for principal to 
make strategic decision for the company.

1. Introduction 
The transportation sector industry has become a concern for the Indonesian government in line with the acceleration 
of domestic infrastructure development in the last 10 years. According to the Bappenas Report (Chapter 33), policy 
measures and results have focused on road infrastructure, road transport traffic, railways, river and ferry transport, sea 
and air transportation, and supporting the transportation sector (Ministry PPN/Bapennas, p. 33.18- 33). Approaching 
MEA 2016, transportation operators to be managerially successful in welcoming the implementation of the ASEAN 
single market in 2016 will have an impact on the liberalization of this sector so that transportation operators operate 
in ASEAN member countries through the cabotage principle of sea and air transportation modes which will have an 
impact on the national economy. especially stocks of transportation services (Ministry of Transportation of the 
Republic of Indonesia, 2015). 
In 2020, several transportation companies experienced a decline in the third quarter, including PT Garuda Indonesia 
Tbk. (GIAA), PT Blue Bird Tbk. (BIRD) and PT Wintermar Offshore Marine Tbk. (WINS) which experienced a 
decline in the third quarter. The airline, PT Garuda Indonesia Tbk (GIAA) suffered a loss of Rp. 15 trillion in the third 
quarter of 2020, and only earned US$ 1.14 billion in revenue. This achievement decreased by 67.79% from the same 
period in 2019 which received revenues of US$ 3.54 billion and PT Blue Bird Tbk. (BIRD) which recorded a net loss 
of Rp156.01 billion in the third quarter of 2020 even though operating income from the taxi segment had significantly 
improved quarterly. Based   on the financial statements for the third quarter of 2020, Blue Bird posted revenue 
of IDR 1.55 trillion as of September 30, 2020. This realization decreased by 47.55% from IDR 2.96 trillion in the 
same period last year. PT Wintermar Offshore Marine Tbk also experienced a decline. (WINS) which experienced a 
decline in the first nine months of this year, namely in the third quarter of 2020. Based on the company's financial 
reports, the revenue of PT Wintermar Offshore Marine Tbk. This was only US$ 31.4 million until the end of September 
2020. This realization decreased by 23.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019 which was recorded at US$ 41.05 
million. This decrease was due to the decrease in revenue from vessel charter to US$ 30.08 million from US$ 38.58

The interplay between financial institution like mutual fund investment manager is essential for financial and 
economic stability. This study aims to analyze the direct effect of macroeconomic determinants on net assets value 
(NAV) of equity funds as well as through Composite Stock Price Index (CSPI) as intervening variable. We used 
interest rate (Bank Indonesia 7-day repo rate), Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), Rupiah currency rate as 
macroeconomic factors. This research consists of 12 conventional equity funds investment management agent 
listed in Financial Services Authority (OJK) statistical data, from the period from 2015 to 2019. The data used in 
this study were analyzed using partial least square and carried out with the help of software WarpPLS 6.0. The 
novelty of our work is to identify  the Composite Stock Price Index (CSPI) as the mediating variable for the 
relationship of three exogenous variables on NAV respectively. Our results show that a sharp increase in interest 
rate triggers reduction of Net Asset Value of equity funds. Both variables inflation and currency rate index do not 
affect significantly on NAV. Only the effect of inflation on the net asset value (NAV) of equity funds can not be 
mediated by CSPI.

1. Introduction  
Mutual funds are one of the financial instruments that are developing in the capital market trading. The 
development of mutual fund products in recent years has been very dynamic, marked by the increasing number 
of mutual funds issued by investment managers, through the types of sharia mutual funds and conventional mutual 
funds. In Indonesia, regulations related to mutual funds are regulated in Law No. 8 of 1995 article 1 paragraph 27 
concerning the capital market. 
The performance of equity funds can be seen from the Net Asset Value (NAV). NAV is a number of assets after 
deducting existing liabilities. Meanwhile, NAV per unit of participation is the total value of net assets divided by 
the number of units of participation (shares issued) in a certain period. In assessing the performance of 
conventional equity mutual funds, investors refer to the performance of the composite stock price index (CSPI). 
Equity funds are chosen because they are more volatile than bonds or other types of funds because most of their 
portfolio is invested in fluctuating shares (Hermawan, 2016). Equity funds invest at least 80% in pure equity 
securities.

3248","also impacts on the decline in the net asset value of equity funds because 80% of the mutual fund portfolio is 
invested in shares. This means that investors must pay attention to monetary policies related to interest rates and 
exchange rates, because the two policies are interrelated to maintain the stability of the country's economy 
determined by the central bank. When the Rupiah exchange rate against foreign currencies strengthens, many 
investors will invest in stocks because the strengthening of the currency indicates that the economy is in good 
condition. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Our research of the linkages between macroeconomic and NAVs and the mediating effect of CSPI attributes to 
investment in equity mutual fund. The paper is based on descriptive and econometric analyses. According to our 
descriptive study, economic activity is highly correlated with the trends of NAVs. As we saw from the data, in 
the period  of positive economic growth 2015-2019, inflation and interest rates are low and stable. As we can see, 
there is a strong connection between interest rates and NAV from investment activities as well the contribution of 
CSPI to intervene the relationship within it. Unfortunately, we were not able to find the strong correlation between 
inflation and NAVs either with currency rate. When we connect the currency rate variable with CSPI, there is 
strong mediation relationship with NAVs. Our research also contributes to investors who will invest in 
conventional equity funds, macroeconomic factors such as the interest rate, inflation, and the rupiah exchange rate 
are necessary to take into account, so that later investing in equity funds can provide maximum returns and make 
the CSPI as a reference for investing because there is a link between the CSPI and mutual funds. For further 
research, it is suggested to examine the influence of other macroeconomic factors as well as institutional factors 
of mutual funds, also using wider sample such as different type of mutual fund, lastly it is expected that the results 
of this study can add to the development of knowledge related to macroeconomic factors and stock investment.

1. Introduction 
Employee performance is an important factor for companies, because employee performance has a strong correlation 
with company performance (Ramli, 2018). Thus, employee performance must always be maintained and improved. 
Increasing employee performance can be done by taking into account the factors that affect employee performance 
improvement. Theoretically, employee performance is influenced by individual factors. system, and contextual 
(Armstrong, 2018). Individual factors are factors inherent in individuals such as work effort, knowledge (declarative 
knowledge related to job requirements and objectives, and procedural-knowledge about what to do and how to do it), 
expertise, motivation, and participation. The system factor is a basic input-process-output-outcomes model in the 
company. Contextual factors are factors inherent in the company, such as corporate culture, employee relations 
climate, the people involved and the internal environment in the organizational structure, company size, company 
technology, and work practices. 
 
Several previous studies have stated that employee performance is positively influenced by spiritual leadership 
(Salehzadeh et al., 2015; Tengfei et al., 2018) and employee engagement (Fidyah & Setiawati, 2020). The results of 
this empirical study imply that employees with a high level of engagement and with good behavior are also important 
for the company, the two behaviors have a positive relationship in improving employee performance. Therefore, 
increasing engagement and good organizational behavior is one of the responsibilities of leaders in making it happen. 
Previous empirical studies have stated that employee engagement is positively influenced by spiritual leadership 
behavior (Hunsaker & Jeong, 2020; Zhou & Yang, 2020). Likewise, organizational citizenship behavior is also 
influenced by spiritual leadership (Djaelani et al., 2020; Siriattakul et al., 2020). Companies need to improve employee

From table 5 above it can be seen that the influence of spiritual leadership on employee performance has a P value of 
0.016 or less than 0.05. So it can be concluded that spiritual leadership has a significant effect on employee 
performance. The influence of spiritual leadership on employee engagement has a P value of 0.000 or less than 0.05. 
So it can be concluded that spiritual leadership has a significant effect on employee engagement. The effect of 
employee engagement on employee performance has a P value of 0.038 or less than 0.05. So it can be concluded that 
employee engagement has a significant effect on employee performance. The influence of spiritual leadership on 
employee performance through employee engagement has a P value of 0.038 or less than 0.05. So it can be concluded 
that employee engagement can significantly mediate the influence of spiritual leadership on employee performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The results show that spiritual leadership has an effect on employee performance. This is based on the results of 
hypothesis testing where the P value of spiritual leadership on employee performance is less than 0.05, which means 
that spiritual leadership has a significant effect on employee performance. The more positive the spiritual leadership, 
the higher the employee's performance. Vice versa, the more negative the spiritual leadership, the lower the employee's 
performance. The results showed that spiritual leadership had an effect on employee engagement. This is based on the 
results of hypothesis testing where the P value of spiritual leadership on employee engagement is less than 0.05, which 
means that spiritual leadership has a significant effect on employee engagement. This means that the better the spiritual 
leadership, the better employee engagement will be. The results of the study indicate that employee engagement has 
an effect on employee performance. This is based on the results of hypothesis testing where the P value of employee 
engagement on employee performance is less than 0.05, which means that employee engagement has a significant 
effect on employee performance. This means that the more positive employee engagement, the more positive impact 
on employee performance. Conversely, the more negative employee engagement, the more negative impact on 
employee performance. The results show that employee engagement mediates the effect of situational leadership on 
employee performance. This is based on the results of hypothesis testing where the P value of spiritual leadership on 
employee engagement and employee performance is less than 0.05, which means that employee engagement mediates 
the effect of situational leadership on employee performance.

Abstract 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused the open unemployment rate (TPT), the impact experienced by all taxpayers 
throughout the country is at least enough to make activities in this country not conducive. The government through 
the Ministry of Finance has issued several incentive and relaxation policies in the field of taxation for taxpayers 
affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in order to realize the National Economic Recovery. Tax incentives and relaxation 
are government policies that refer to the efforts made by a country to attract investors in order to encourage economic 
activity, with the government policy of the Directorate General of Taxes (DJP) of the Ministry of Finance providing 
relaxation in the form of simplification of document submission to complete annual notification letters or SPT, in 
Covid-19 pandemic conditions This relaxation is provided for corporate taxpayers and individual taxpayers. His study 
is to determine whether there is an effect of incentives and relaxation as well as understanding of tax regulations, the 
method used in this study uses a quantitative method based on tax rates and the principle of justice on mandatory 
compliance, the impact of the Covid 19 Pandemic disaster on the level of compliance of the annual SPT reporting of 
individual taxpayers and institution. Utilization of Information Technology has a significant effect on taxpayer 
compliance.

Introduction 
As the largest source of funds in governance and development, the role of tax revenues is increasing from year to year 
in supporting national development, this is reflected in the plan to increase tax revenues. The existence of taxes is 
expected to improve the welfare of all people's lives. The system adopted in tax collection in Indonesia is the Self 
Assessment System, namely full trust given to taxpayers to calculate, deposit, and report all their tax obligations. Tax 
authorities apply different measures to increase tax compliance. These measures differ from country to country. 
Nevertheless, many practical and theoretical accounts such as the slippery slope framework of tax compliance have 
categorized different measures into two basics approaches: the power approach and the trust approach. The power 
approach (also termed deterrence or the command and control approach) relies on frequent audits and severe fines in 
case of tax evasion. In contrast, the trust approach originates from transparency, fair procedures, or the conviction that 
paying taxes honestly is a binding social norm. The mutual influence, interaction, and dynamic between these two 
approaches is seen as important for tax compliance. As the tax system becomes complex, it follows that more taxpayers 
will opt for an assisted tax preparation method which include self-preparation with tax software and using tax 
consultants, and this has indeed increased over the years. To date, tax authorities around the world are using electronic 
tax administration systems to interact with taxpaying public in tax collection, administration and compliance settings. 
This implies that the taxpayers must be knowledgeable about these developments including having the competence to 
prepare returns that conform to the law requirements using these systems. which is full trust given to taxpayers to

is expected to maintain people's purchasing power. (www.kemenkeu.go.id. The government provides tax incentives 
to support the business world and the community during the COVID-19 pandemic 20/04/2020). So that the efforts 
made by the government in the program to support UMKM capital and cash flow during this pandemic are in the form 
of capital assistance either through banks or directly. 
 
The decline in 2020 PPh21 Revenue by 0.97% that occurred at the Pondok Aren KPP Pratama is the impact of the 
Covid-19 pandemic, with the tax relaxation, taxpayers continue to report and pay Annual SPT. Relaxation is well 
executed. Although there is a decrease in income from PPh 21, with the addition of the number of taxpayers with a 
decrease in taxpayer income due to the impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic. 
 
Conclusion  
Based on the results of research and discussion on the Impact of the Covid 19 Pandemic on the Compliance Level of 
the Annual Individual Taxpayer at the Pondok Aren Tax Office, South Tangerang City, it can be concluded that the 
understanding of regulations and tax benefits has a positive effect on individual taxpayer compliance. With the 
government's policy of tax relaxation during the Covid-19 Pandemic and the benefits derived from this policy, 
taxpayers continue to comply with annual SPT reporting despite a decline in PPh 21 revenue that occurred in 2020 
due to a decline in people's income and purchasing power. 
 
Suggestion  
Based on the results of the research that has been submitted, the authors suggest the following; first, to further enhance 
innovation more consistently to involve the general public in the pioneering of systematic Annual Tax Returns by 
conducting an online counseling or seminar approach on how to make good use of the policies provided by the 
government during the Covid 19 Pandemic. Second, to provide support to MSMEs in increasing turnover by compiling 
cash flows and financial statements which are very important for annual SPT reporting. Third, tax policies and 
treatment will continue to be implemented by involving all levels of society.

Abstract 
 
An important factor in determining the effectiveness of an organization is the quality of human resources in the 
organization. Therefore, the performance of each individual in an organization becomes an essential concern for the 
organization. Lecturers have a role as the primary human resources within the University who hold many duties and 
responsibilities. With the abilities possessed and how lecturers create good relationships with students, it will 
significantly affect how the campus life environment is created, which will impact the development of the University 
in the future. As a teacher, of course, each individual must have adequate abilities, not only in terms of intellectual 
(Intelligent Quotient) but also in terms of emotional management (Emotional Quotient) and creativity in teaching. In 
this study, further research will be conducted regarding the influence of the intelligent quotient and emotional quotient 
on the performance of lecturers mediated by the creativity of lecturers at a university in the West Jakarta Region. By 
using the non-probability sampling technique, the results obtained that the intelligent and emotional quotient factors 
positively influence the performance of the lecturers produced. Besides that, the creativity of the lecturers also plays 
an essential role in supporting the performance of the lecturers.

3278","6. Conclusion  
In determining the effectiveness of an organization, one of the essential aspects to consider is the quality of human 
resources in the organization. The performance of individuals in an organization is an essential concern for the 
organization. Lecturers act as the primary human resources within the University who hold many duties and 
responsibilities. With the abilities possessed and how lecturers create good relationships with students, it will 
significantly affect how the campus life environment is created, which will impact the development of the University 
in the future. As a teaching staff, of course, individuals must have adequate abilities, not only in terms of intellectual 
(Intelligent Quotient) but also in terms of emotional management (Emotional Quotient) and creativity in teaching. 
This study explores the influence of intelligent quotient and emotional quotient on lecturer performance mediated by 
creativity. 
 
The results show that the intelligence quotient has a significant positive effect on lecturer performance. This shows 
that the higher the IQ intelligence possessed by a lecturer, the better the performance. In recruiting lecturers at 
universities, of course, specific academic qualifications must be met. Lecturers who are recruited are, of course, 
lecturers who have good academic qualifications, and preferably those who already have teaching experience. These 
results are consistent with previous research, which explained that the intelligence aspect has a somewhat important 
role in predicting the performance of employees. The second result shows that the emotional quotient has a significant 
positive effect on lecturer performance. This illustrates that the aspect of emotional management is also an essential 
factor that can have an impact on the resulting performance. Emotional management here involves the process of a 
lecturer in building good relationships with students and co-workers. This, of course, makes the work environment, 
both the relationship between lecturers and students and the relationship between lecturers and colleagues, more 
positive. The aspect of creativity also plays an essential role in supporting the performance of lecturers. Creativity is 
proven to mediate the relation-ship between intelligence quotient and lecturer performance. This condition illustrates 
that lecturers who have good intelligence in transferring knowledge to students are carried out in creative ways, and 
methods will impact the resulting performance.

1. Introduction 
Firm value is the company's ability as shown by the stock price formed by the demand and supply of the capital market 
which reflects the public's assessment of the company's ability (Harmono, 2009). The value of the company is an 
important thing because the value of the company determines the level of prosperity of investors. The higher the value 
of the company, the level of investor prosperity is also high. The value of the company has a view that an investor will 
have achievements in the company for managing resources in the company. The increasing number of investors who 
buy shares in the company will make the share price also increase, then the value of the company will also increase. 
The rise or fall of the stock price in a company can determine the value of the company to investors. 
Firm value has a close relationship with profitability. If a good company value attracts investors to invest in the 
company, with the hope that they can make a profit. The increasing number of investors to invest in the company will 
increase the share price in the company and the outstanding shares will increase. Has an impact on increasing share 
prices which result in an increase in the value of the company. An increase in the value of the company becomes a 
desire of the owner in the company, because the increasing value of the company can show prosperity to shareholders. 
One of the factors that affect firm value is profitability. Brigham and Houston (2013) define profitability as the end 
result of a number of company management policies and decisions. Profitability is the most important element in the 
company's ability to achieve profits, profitability also shows a measure of the effectiveness

1. Profitability has a positive effect on firm value 
Based on table 4 with a confidence level of 5%, the results of testing the first hypothesis (H1) indicate that 
profitability has a positive effect on firm value. This can be seen from the 5% confidence level, indicating that it 
is greater than the tsign value (0.05 > 0.027). Thus the test shows H1 is accepted. 
2. Firm size has no effect on firm value 
Based on table 4 with a confidence level of 5%, the results of testing the second hypothesis (H2) indicate that firm 
size has no effect on firm value. This can be seen from the 5% confidence level, indicating that it is smaller than 
the tsign value (0.05 < 0.894). Thus the tester shows H2 is rejected.

Based on table 5 the results of the moderation test in detail can be explained as follows: 
1. Profitability has a positive effect on firm value with dividend policy as moderating variable 
Based on table 5 with a 5% confidence level, the results of testing the third hypothesis (H3) show that profitability 
has a positive effect on firm value with dividend policy as moderating variable. This can be seen from the 5% 
confidence level, indicating that the value of is greater than the tsign value (0.05 > 0.000). Thus the test shows that 
H3 is accepted. 
2. Firm size has no effect on firm value with dividend policy as moderating variable 
Based on table 5 with a confidence level of 5%, the results of testing the fourth hypothesis (H4) show that firm size 
has no effect on firm value with dividend policy as moderating variable. This can be seen from the 5% confidence 
level, indicating that the value of is greater than the tsign value (0.05 > 0.154). Thus the test shows H4 is rejected. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Profitability has a positive effect on firm value. Because more increasing Return on Assets (ROA) of a company, the 
greater the level of profit achieved and the better the position of the company in terms of the use of assets so as to 
increase the value of the company. Firm size has no effect on firm value. Because the size of the company will not 
affect the size of the company's value. No matter how big the company is when there are rumors that the company is 
experiencing losses and is on the verge of bankruptcy, investors will automatically not invest in the company. So the 
size of the company cannot affect the value of the company. Profitability has a positive effect on firm value with 
dividend policy able to be used as a moderating variable. This is because companies with a high level of profitability 
have a greater opportunity to pay dividends with a greater value to shareholders. So that the dividend policy is able to 
strengthen the influence of profitability on firm value. Firm size has no effect on firm value. Dividend policy cannot 
be used as a moderating variable. Because the larger the company uses debt, the company tends to pay dividends in 
smaller amounts because the profits obtained from the debt are first paid to creditors along with the interest costs 
which of course will affect investors' perceptions of the value of the company and make dividend policy by distributing 
dividends. unable to moderate the effect of firm size on firm value.

1. Introduction 
The success of a company is strongly influenced by the performance of its employees. Good companies recognize 
their employees and try to improve their performance. This is because the company realizes that employees who have 
high performance will affect the company's performance in achieving company goals. The success of a company is 
strongly influenced by the performance of its employees. Good companies recognize their employees and try to 
improve their performance. This is because the company knows that employees have high performance; it will affect. 
Mangkunegara (2016) explains that performance is the result of work both in quantity and quality obtained by an 
employee in carrying out his duties in accordance with his responsibilities. Good performance is maximum 
performance, in the sense that performance is in accordance with organizational standards and supports the 
achievement of organizational goals, namely the vision and mission of the organization. Increased employee 
performance will create progress for the organization to be sustainable in the intense business competition. 
Employee performance is the result of work in quality and quantity that can be achieved by an employee in carrying 
out tasks in accordance with the responsibilities given to him (Widia and Rusdianti, 2018). Employee performance 
can be seen from the amount of work produced by employees, the level of efficiency and effectiveness of employees 
in carrying out their work, and the timeliness of completing the work that has been determined (Mangkunegara, 2016). 
Meanwhile, Robbins (2015) explains that employee performance is a function of the interaction between ability and 
motivation. Furthermore, Robbins (2015) mentions setting performance goals is setting goals that are useful not only 
for performance evaluation at the end of the period but also for. According to Robbins (2015) that employee 
performance is an interaction and function between motivation and ability. Setting performance goals is useful for 
setting targets and not only for evaluating performance at the end of the period but also for managing work processes 
during the period. Companies need to improve employee performance because if the performance of an employee 
declines then the employee may have a desire to leave the company and this is very detrimental to the company. As 
stated by Suyono et al (2020) that turnover intention is more dangerous than the real turnover.

1. Introduction 
The development of technology in the era of globalization is increasing rapidly. Competition between companies is 
also getting tighter. Companies must be able to keep up with the changes that occur around them, especially in the 
business world. If the company is not able to adapt to the changes that occur, the company will not be able to compete 
in the competition between companies. As a result, the company will not survive and the products that are sold will 
disappear from the market. One way to overcome this, the management must evaluate the things that are in the 
company, especially in terms of human resources because human resources in the company are the key determinants 
to be actively involved and gain an advantage over the competition (Gea, 2014). 
Employee performance is one of the important things that need to be considered in an effort to advance the company. 
According to Mangkunegara (2017), performance is the result of work in quality and quantity achieved by an 
employee in carrying out his duties according to the responsibilities assigned to him (Maharani, 2016). Good employee 
performance can be seen from the quantity of work achieved by employees that exceeds or is in accordance with the 
targets set by the company; quality of employee work that is in accordance with the standards set by the company; 
timeliness of completion of work in accordance with that determined by the company; the number of employee 
attendance is greater than the number of absences; as well as the ability of employees to cooperate with other 
employees. One of the ways to improve employee performance is by increasing knowledge sharing (Memah et al., 
2017). 
Knowledge sharing is defined as a systematic process of sending, distributing, and disseminating multidimensional 
knowledge and context from a person or organization to other people or organizations in need through various methods 
and media (Lumbantobing, 2011). According to Andika (2015), knowledge sharing has various benefits, including 
encouraging the spread of individual learning throughout the organization (Yang, 2007); facilitate competency 
development (Trivellas et al., 2015); has a positive influence on the performance of organizational members (Javadi 
et al., 2012; Kuzu & √ñzilhan, 2014); and innovative work behavior (Akhavan et al., 2015); and organizational 
innovation capabilities (Lin, 2007). According to Swift and Hwang (2013), there are 3 (three) dimensions of

Abstract 
 
Work loyalty and organizational commitment have a very important meaning for every company in improving 
employee performance. State-owned companies engaged in clean water services are very concerned about employee 
performance to improve services to the community. This research was conducted at a government-owned clean 
water company in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia with the aim of analyzing the effect of work loyalty on employee 
performance, employee loyalty on organizational commitment, organizational commitment on employee 
performance and employee loyalty to employee performance through organizational commitment. This study uses 
63 employees of clean water companies as the population. The sampling technique used was total sampling 
technique. Data analysis used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) Partial Least Square (PLS). The results showed 
that work loyalty has an effect on employee performance, employee loyalty has an effect on organizational 
commitment, organizational commitment has an effect on employee performance, and organizational commitment is 
able to mediate the effect of employee loyalty on employee performance.

1. Introduction 
Many experts say that human resources are the most valuable asset for a company and therefore they should be 
managed efficiently to ensure increased productivity. The existence of human resources in a company plays a very 
important role. Human resources have great potential to carry out business activities. For this reason, the company 
must optimize the potential of each employee to get optimal productivity. The success of a company is strongly 
influenced by the performance of its employees. 
 
Mangkunegara (2016) explained that performance is the result of work (output) either quality or amount achieved by 
an employee in carrying out tasks based on the responsibilities assigned by the company to the employee or 
employee. Good performance is maximum performance, meaning that performance is based on the standards set by 
the company and is able to support the organization in achieving the mission and goals of the organization. 
Increased employee performance has an impact on the development of the organization so that it can exist and 
continue in a very fierce competition. Employee performance itself will be influenced by various factors related to 
HR or related to the organizational environment. Each organization certainly has a guideline and order that must be 
obeyed by all workers, among others, namely the presence of employees, all employees are required to come 
according to the working hours that have been set by each organization. Employee performance is work 
performance in terms of quality and amount that can be achieved by a worker in carrying out his duties based on the 
responsibilities that the company has handed over to the worker (Widia and Rusdianti, 2018). Employee 
performance can be seen from the quantity of work achieved by workers, the level of efficiency and effectiveness of 
workers in carrying out their duties, and on time in completing tasks that have been set by the company 
(Mangkunegara, 2016). Meanwhile, according to Robbins (2015) employee performance is a function of the

3316","loyalty variable has a significant effect on organizational commitment. The effect of organizational commitment on 
employee performance has a P value of 0.000 or small and large from 0.05. This means that the organizational 
commitment variable has a significant effect on employee performance. The effect of loyalty on employee 
performance through organizational commitment has a P value of 0.002 or less than 0.05. This means that the 
loyalty variable has a significant effect on employee performance through organizational commitment. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The results showed that work loyalty had an effect on employee performance. This is based on the results of 
hypothesis testing where the P value of work loyalty on employee performance is less than 0.05, which means work 
loyalty has a significant effect on employee performance. This shows that the more positive work loyalty, the higher 
the employee's performance. Vice versa, the more negative work loyalty, the lower the employee's performance. The 
results showed that work loyalty has an effect on organizational commitment. This is based on the results of 
hypothesis testing where the P value of work loyalty to organizational commitment is less than 0.05, which means 
that work loyalty has a significant effect on organizational commitment. This means that the better the work loyalty, 
the better the organizational commitment will be. The results showed that organizational commitment had an effect 
on employee performance. This is based on the results of hypothesis testing where the P value of organizational 
commitment to employee performance is less than 0.05, which means organizational commitment has a significant 
effect on employee performance. This means that the more positive organizational commitment, the more positive 
impact on employee performance. Conversely, the more negative organizational commitment, the more negative 
impact on employee performance. The results showed that organizational commitment was able to mediate the 
effect of work loyalty on employee performance. This is based on the results of hypothesis testing where the P value 
of work loyalty on organizational commitment and employee performance is less than 0.05, which means 
organizational commitment is able to mediate the effect of work loyalty on employee performance.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to examine the effect of transformational leadership and job satisfaction on turnover intention, 
transformational leadership on job satisfaction, and the role of job satisfaction as a mediating variable between 
transformational leadership and turnover intention. Using a quantitative research approach, data were obtained using 
a questionnaire. This study used a sample of 363 employees who work at Koperasi Tenaga Kerja Bongkar Muat 
Surabaya, using simple random sampling technique. Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) 
was used for analysis and hypothesis testing. The results show that transformational leadership is able to make 
employees have no intention of changing workplaces, and job satisfaction positively mediates the effect of 
transformational leadership on turnover intention. This shows that the influence of transformational leadership on 
turnover intention will be stronger with the satisfaction of employees in their work because it helps employees to 
create a conducive situation, thus creating value that makes employees feel comfortable in their work. The findings 
of this study suggest the importance of company management optimizing the leadership style used and developing 
an integrative job satisfaction development program.

1. Introduction 
Human resources are one of the factors that determine the success or failure of an organization in achieving its 
goals, both in public organizations and private organizations. An organization without the support of appropriate 
human resources both in terms of quantitative, qualitative, strategic and operational, then the organization will not 
be able to maintain its existence, develop and advance its organization in the future (Zainal, 2015). Along with the 
flow of globalization, every organization is required to be able to compete so that it can survive in global 
competition. One strategy to always be able to compete is to strengthen its human resources (Sudarmanto, 2015). 
Human resources play a role in a non-conducive work atmosphere in the organization which can have an impact on 
the intention to move for employees (turnover intention) and in the end can lead to an increase in turnover intention. 
Currently the problem of high turnover rates has become a serious problem for many companies, the negative 
impact felt by this problem on the company is on the quality and ability to replace employees who leave the 
organization, so it takes time and new costs in recruiting new employees. A high turnover rate will have a negative 
impact on the organization, such as creating instability in labor conditions and increasing human resource costs. This 
makes the organization ineffective because the organization will lose experienced employees and have to retrain 
new employees to replace them. 
 
Turnover behavior in employees does not just arise. Behavior arises based on a) humans generally do things in ways 
that make sense, b) humans consider all available information, and c) explicitly or implicitly humans take into 
account the implications of their actions (Azwar, 2013). Behavior is influenced by attitudes through a careful and 
reasoned decision-making process, and its impact is limited to three things; 1) behavior is not much determined by 
general attitudes but by specific attitudes towards something, 2) behavior is influenced not only by attitudes but also

However, to ensure that job satisfaction provides benefits for the company, managers need to identify effective and 
efficient ways of creating a conducive work environment, supporting internal resources, and using them. This is 
important so that job satisfaction can be achieved and formed for a long time span and can be stable despite 
employee rotation.

Abstract 
 
Life facts have shown us all that not everyone lives in a good and fully equipped body. People who do not have 
complete body parts related to their sensory, mental and intellectual properties call people with disabilities. We often 
see people with disabilities who get stigma, ridicule, insult, discrimination against and find it challenging to fulfill 
their daily needs because of the discrimination that comes to them. Buddhism views that people with disabilities 
should be cared for and cared about because everyone has the right to live a decent, reasonable life and live happily. 
So that in this life we should be able to help each other at the same time be able to spend time in this life to make and 
multiply excellent and helpful deeds for others. As a person who is complete in the physical body and who is related 
to his sensory, mental, and intellectual, we should not be proud and look down on people with disabilities, because 
one day we all will also get old and may experience illness, so everyone has the potential to become people with 
disabilities.

Abstract  
 
The research that we have developed on the Correlation of Development of Persons with Disabilities including 
Leprosy in relation to Accessibility and Independent Living and Community Engagement in Several Cities in 
Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi and East Nusa Tenggara compared to the Experience in New Zealand, brings one 
understanding of what citizens' duties are for. in maintaining national resilience and security in the welfare of all 
citizens of the country without differentiating them from one another. But there are still those who still don't 
understand or pretend they don't know about this situation. Whereas in the four islands of Indonesia that I mean 
above, the cultural principles of our people are very caring and often very very concerned, but they are often 
different in practice, very sad. Meanwhile in other countries it is often said to be very ""individualistic"" but in 
practice they really care, or is it because their quality of life is getting better? Or is it true that their life ethics as 
citizens are already very good? Everything can be measured from various parameters such as disability friendliness, 
accessibility, stigma and budget provision for each central government program including corporations or 
government or private institutions and the community. The research methodology is a qualitative method, direct 
observation in Indonesia, including in the cities of Auckland, Wellington, Rotorua and New Plymouth in New 
Zealand. Including countries other than the two countries above. We can observe from public transportation, places 
of public facilities in both cities and regions, including buildings of worship of every religion. Of course, the results 
of the bias are compared well, for example, religious buildings, will Indonesia, which is known as a religious 
country, be better than New Zealand? This challenge will be very important as the citizens are very religious.

1. Introduction  
The insurance sector as Indonesia's financial services sector plays an important role in the stability of the Indonesian 
economy through risk management. Through the insurance sector, economic actors can transfer their risk of loss, so 
that daily economic activities can continue (Setiawan, 2013). In European Union, Solvency II is prudential regime for 
insurance and reinsurance, concerned on the principle that insurance institutions must have sufficient financial 
resources to cope with potential insolvencies in their operations, thereby preventing that financial difficulties of risk 
profile of each individual insurance could disseminate to the market as a whole (EU law). 
 
Malik (2011) revealed that the insurance sector is integrated in the financial industry which acts as an intermediary 
institution. The Financial Services Authority (OJK) stated that the number of sharia life insurance assets nationally in 
2019 reached Rp 45.80 trillion. Meanwhile, conventional life insurance assets were recorded at Rp 756.52 trillion. 
Then the Sharia insurance market share in 2019 reached 6.05%. Monitoring the financial performance of insurance 
companies is very important in order to optimize market potential and consumer confidence. Fundamental factors in 
insurance companies are reflected in the financial ratios of Risk Based Capital (RBC) and Early Warning System 
(EWS) (Hapsari, et.al, 2014).

especially in the micro and small enterprises community in Jakarta and its vicinity. Covid-19 causes fear for people 
to make direct contact because of the danger to be invected easily. the social distancing procedure which issued and 
forced by the government has disturbed the activity of selling and buying goods, disturb manufacturing and almost 
all kind of business activities, including service business activities also being disturbed. Many workers were sent 
home or forced to work from home. All shopping centers, shopping malls, and markets are closed. Thus all 
economic activities are disturbed and closed. The research focus is on the business sectors‚Äô victims of COVID-19. 
The research question is, Which business was badly affected as victims of the COVID-19 pandemic,  how can they 
become victimized and what kind of suffering they are facing?  Qualitative research methods are used in this study. 
The phenomenology approach is applied. Participatory Observations and in-depth interviews was conductedto 
gather data. The researcher found four types of suffering victims of COVID-19 from small business communities,

Abstract 
 
Covid-19 pandemic extends throughout the world and infects tens of millions of the world's population, 
not knowing caste, social status, position, education level, and economic strata. In Asia, the icon of trade 
center, Singapore is even threatened with bankruptcy because growth has been minus 41%.  As a result all 
the finance ministers of these countries panicked and tried to carry out various economic stimulus to 
increase foreign debt. Then this is a bell coming tsunami of the world crisis that will paralyze the 
economy in the long run. Uniquely, the crisis not only plagued the financial sector, but also the real sector 
even small businesses. So whoever you are, whatever business you are in, you must be very good at 
anticipating. Carry out effective strategies to survive the crisis era. One strategy that can be applied is 
human spirit based marketing of sharia. Sharia marketing strategies based on human spirit are very 
compatible in the era of digital transaction media and in the midst of a pandemic atmosphere that changes 
consumer behavior to prioritize satisfying basic needs, which are not only related to physical needs, but 
also have spiritual values.

Abstract 
 
Classroom learning activities for schools and campuses have been stopped since the covid-19 pandemic in 
accordance with the regulations of the implementation of PSBB by the Indonesian government. According to 
the Kemendikbud as many as 8 million students and 300 thousand lecturers suddenly transformed into online 
learning due to the pandemic. The meeting conference technology, either zoom or google meet, is currently 
adopted as a class conference for means of interacting with lecturers and students in directly presenting lecture 
material. Success. The effectiveness of using class conferencing with zoom must be measured by the 
achievement of the average grade. From the results of calculations carried out on 100 students learning by class 
conference is very effective. This is evident from the comparison of post test values that there is no value below 
C with an average value for Post Test of 87 with class A of 89, class B of 91, class C of 86, class D of 81. For

1. Introduction  
In response to facing the Covid-19 pandemic the Indonesian government issued PP no 21 of 2020 which 
regulates large-scale social restrictions or PSBB. This restriction is not only done in the industrial sector but also 
in the education sector.  
 
As a result of this rule teaching and learning activities cannot be carried out in the classroom and are replaced 
online. This is in accordance with SE Mendikbud RI no 4 of 2020 regulates distance learning in a pandemic For 
distance learning campuses or commonly called E-learning is not something new and has often been done for 
certain subjects. During this pandemic, the campus was challenged to present all lecture learning activities 
through E-learning. According to the Kemendikbud (2020) In March, as many as 8 million students and 300 
thousand lecturers suddenly transformed into online learning. 
 
E-learning applications are designed and implemented with facilities that are equipped with downloading 
material, assignments, quizzes and uploading material (Lestari and Herlina 2019). The level of effectiveness of 
e-learning as measured by the achievement of the average value obtained (Rivai and Susanto 2019). E-learning 
itself also has advantages when compared to conventional, namely in terms of flexibility of lecture time and 
ease of task collection (Sari and Azizah 2019).

Abstract  
 
In this study we collect data from 148 public tenders of medium and large construction projects. In these projects, the 
tender issuing body is a public agency that also estimates the true cost of the project before the bidding process begins. 
Bids are publicly open to contractors that meet certain criteria, and the lowest bid wins the contract. Construction is 
supervised by project managers employed by the public agency. For each project, we computed the average bid as the 
average of all the valid bids. The mean of the average bids was almost identical to the mean estimated cost. This result 
is known as the wisdom of the crowds. Since the winning bid is the lowest valid bid, by corollary of the wisdom of 
the crowds it also implies the winner‚Äôs curse. On average, the winning bid was 8% lower than the estimate cost. 
However, the actual payments to the contractor were, on average 16% greater than the estimated cost. These cost 
overruns imply a pendulum swing, i.e, that the winning contractor is able to pendulate their loss into a gain.  
Indeed, that fact that construction projects are beleaguered with cost overruns is well known. Researchers and 
practitioners have tried numerous ways to explain the causes for cost overruns and explore ways to prevent them. For 
the particular case of a public agency that employs project managers who interact with the winning contractor, we 
argue that the motivation for cost overruns can be explained using a game theory model that describes the interaction 
between the project managers and the winning contractor. The current workplace culture as well as the tender method 
results with an outcome that leads to cost overruns to the detriment of the public. By expanding the game to include 
the public agency as a first mover player, we show how the combination of changing both the workplace culture and 
the tender method can result in a second period game between the project managers and the contractors with an 
equilibrium outcome that is more beneficial to the public.

1. Introduction   
The automotive industry is becoming highly competitive, because of the changing nature of products, the variety of 
models, and client demands(El Farouk Imane and Fouad, 2017; Ibn El Farouk et al., 2020). In the other hand 
Environmental challenges have intertwined with all areas of long-term economic productivity, while in this recent 
years, the concept of environmental protection has received considerable attention. Incorporating green practices into 
Supply Chain Management (SCM) to achieve economic, environmental and social performance(Jawab and EL 
MOKADDEM, 2018) is a subject that has become a hot topic in academic literature. This enthusiasm reflects a 
growing concern for the environment and the attempts by governments and organizations around the world to reduce 
environmental issues according to (Jawab and Arif, 2015). Moreover, supply chain management is a concept that has 
been used to describe materials planning and control, information flows and logistics activities both outside and inside 
of an organization (JAWAB and Bouami, 2004). It also aims to add value to the global logistics chain by enhancing 
management capabilities and processes, increasing profitability through efficiencies and maintaining customer 
satisfaction (Arif et al., 2020; Jawab et al., 2006).In this context our paper will study green supply chain management 
practices based on green SCOR MODEL.  
 
This paper has organized as follows: the generality of automobile industry has represented in section 2. The GSCM 
has defined in section 3 while the study of GSCM practices for automobile industry based on Green SCOR MODEL 
has presented in section 4. Finally, the conclusion of our paper offered in Section 5.

Abstract 
 
Tourism is defined as a location with attractions to attract visitors to come and visit it; therefore, the development of 
infrastructure in tourist attractions is also one of the reasons to attract people to visit it. Tourism, particularly in 
Indonesia, is one area in which the government is investing heavily. With the two review sites having the same type 
of tourism, this study aimed to identify the most dominant factors in the development of tourism infrastructure. The 
findings of this study identified a variable in taman safari with a dominating value among the six criteria examined, 
for tourism located in taman safari, the water factor with the variable water demand being the highest index with a 
value of 4.49, while for tourism located in Ragunan, the accommodation factor with the variable needs of the hotel 
gets an index value of 4.44. 
 
1. Introduction  
A tourism object is defined as a tourism destination which is an attractive place for tourists to visit. The potential 
development of tourism is one of methods to develop or advance tourism destination to attract more tourists visit to 
the place. 
 
According to Muljadi (2012) a tourism destination must have a special attraction to fascinate tourists. Tourist objects 
that have a strong attraction like a magnet that can attract tourists to visit.  
 
The infrastructure system can be defined as the facilities and infrastructure or basic structures, equipment, installations 
that were made and needed to carry out the functions of social and economic system of society (Grigg, 2000). 
 
1.1 Objectives 
This study aims to determine the dominant factors of infrastructure development in tourist destination. 
 
2. Literature Review  
2.1 Definition of Tourism 
In Law no. 10 of 2009 concerning Tourism Chapter I Article 1 states that tour shall mean the travel activity carried 
out by a person or a group of people by visiting certain place for recreation, personal development, or study the 
uniqueness of the tour attractiveness visited in temporary period. Thus, the description of tourism has four elements, 
namely travel activities, carried out sincerely, temporary, the trip has partially or totally purpose to enjoy tourism 
objects and attractions. 
 
2.2 Definition of Development 
According to Nadler, development is learning activities that are held within a certain time period in order to increase 
the possibility of performance improvement. 
 
2.3 Definition of Infrastructure 
Infrastruktur menurut Grigg (1988) adalah sebuah sistem yang memberi layanan yang diperlukan seperti 
Transportation, bangunan, serta fasilitas umum yang lain.

Analysis of the data used in this study used the index mean method, this method calculates the average value of the 
respondents' answers which were arranged in the data tabulation. The results of these values were ranked, in order to 
observe the most dominant factor, which can be seen in the following table 7, 8. 
 
                       Table 7. Taman Safari Mean Index                                 Table 8. Ragunan Mean Index Rank 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the table, the top five ranks were chosen as the dominant variables. In the first table show that there were 
top 5 variables obtained at Safari Park, namely A1 (Sufficient water at the location) in this variable the highest mean 
index was 4.49, F4 (Availability of trash bins on site) in this variable the mean index obtained was 4.48, A3 
(Availability of adequate toilets at the location) in this variable the mean index obtained was 4.35, D2 (information 
guides/road signs) in this variable the mean index obtained was 4.31, variable A2 (clean water available at the location) 
obtained a value is 4.28. 
 
the second location for the dominant factor obtained is in the following factors and variables. E1 (Availability of hotels 
near the location) in this variable the mean index obtained is 4,44, A2 (Clean water available on site) in this variable 
the mean index obtained is 4.43, D1 (Good communication network at the location tourist attractions) on this variable 
the index mean obtained is 4.39, A1 (Sufficient water needs at the location) at this variable the mean index obtained 
is 4,24, F4 (Availability of trash bins at the location) on this variable the mean index obtained is 4.23. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the stages of research that had been carried out in order to determine the dominant factors in developing 
tourist infrastructure, it can be concluded from the top 5 variables that the most dominant factor in both tourism 
destinations was water with the variable water demand at first location, while the accommodation with the hotel 
availability variable being the highest index at second location. 
 
but there is a non-dominant variable, namely special facilities for people with disabilities on factors (health, security, 
and environment). although the variables of these factors are not dominant, they can still be taken into consideration 
for development.

Abstract  
 
The construction project, especially in the highway sector, is a highly expected construction project. Moreover, at this 
time, the world in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic which has limited the space for human movement as a form of 
preventing the spread of the epidemic. This creates a new factor that affects the success rate in the construction of 
highway projects. This research aimed to identify various dominant factors that influenced the success of highway 
construction projects. This research method used descriptive statistical methods and it was processed by the SPSS 
(Statistical Package for Social Science) application. From the results of data analysis using the index mean test, 
obtained the five most dominant factors that influenced the success of highway construction projects, they were 
workers discipline, good quality of equipment, productivity of equipment at work, availability of workers, availability 
of equipment according to work needs. 
 
Keywords  
Highway Project, Successful Project, Factor Identification. 
 
1. Introduction  
In line with the progress in the economic sector, consumer needs in the goods and services sector also grow and 
develop, so adequate infrastructure is needed to accommodate the movement from one place and another. The 
availability of existing toll road transportation infrastructure turns out to almost exceed the capacity of the number of 
vehicles per day planned. Road infrastructure plays a dominant role in the national transportation system. A data 
describes if the road infrastructure transports 70% of the total freight transport and 82% of the total passenger transport 
(World bank, 2012). Public roads that are still part of the road network system and become national roads and those 
that use them must pay are called toll roads (Pupr Ministerial Regulation No.10 of 2018). 
 
Construction is a work activity that aims to build facilities and infrastructure. In a construction work, construction 
must be supervised by the project manager, design consultant, and project owner. As for supervision in the field is 
given responsibility to the project foreman as well as experts related to the building to help supervise workers involved 
in the construction. 
 
According to Ginting, 2021, project management is a process that is implemented during the building construction 
project process including planning, organizing, and managing in achieving effective and efficient project goals. In the 
implementation of construction projects, construction management is divided into four general parts, namely planning, 
organizing , implementation (execution), and supervision (controlling).  
 
Based on the statement, it can be concluded if the construction project, especially in the field of toll roads, is a 
construction project that is expected to succeed. Moreover, in this day and age, the world is faced with health problems, 
namely the COVID-19 pandemic that has limited human space as a form of prevention of the spread of the outbreak. 
This makes the existence of new factors that affect the success rate on the construction of toll road construction 
projects. Thus, some previous researchers concluded that factors that could affect the success of construction projects 
include human resources (Mursadin, 2017), equipment, materials (Natalia et al., 2017), managerial, financial 
(Deshariyanto, 2013), environment and weather (Natalia et al., 2017), Occupational Health and Safety (K3) (Pontan

3393","opinion (Putri et al., 2020) which stated that the quality and state of the tool was one of the dominant factors which 
influenced the success of construction projects. 
 
In addition, the interview conducted by (Putri et al., 2020) to the executor on the ground was that one of the causes of 
the hampering of work on the ground was due to the lack of available equipment. It could be concluded that the 
availability of adequate equipment on the ground could prevent construction work from being hampered so as to 
increase success in the construction of construction projects, especially on toll road construction projects. 
 
The latest variable contained in the covid-19 pandemic factor was to vaccinate all workers involved in the project and 
provide supplements or vitamins which served to strengthen the body's immunity was not the dominant factor which 
affected success in the construction of toll road construction projects because of vaccinations and provided 
supplements or vitamins which affected workers not easily exposed to covid-19. However, a development project 
should continue to run as scheduled with the covid-19 pandemic or the absence of the covid-19 pandemic. 
 
In addition, if a company had to provide supplements or vitamins to all workers involved in toll road construction 
projects on a regular basis will result in very high budget expenditures. This could happen because in the preparation 
of the budget in the construction of the project did not consider providing supplements and vitamins as a form of 
prevention of covid-19. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the mean index calculation on all factors obtained five of the most dominant factors which 
affected the success of the construction of toll road construction projects, they were labor discipline, good equipment 
quality, productivity of equipment at work, availability of labor, availability of equipment according to work needs. 
 
The variables contained in the equipment factor dominate in the top five rankings in influencing the success of the 
construction of toll road construction projects where the quality of equipment was good, productivity of equipment at 
work, and the availability of equipment in accordance with work needs.

Abstract 
 
Rebar materials are one of the major construction materials in a construction process that generate main 
contribution of construction and demolition (C&D) wastage. Therefore, a monitoring and controlling process as 
a part of waste management  in design, procurement and construction phases is obligatory. This paper presents a 
model for a rate calculation of rebar waste in the construction phase based on realtime progress by blending output 
from Building Information Modelling (BIM) Quantity Takeoff Software in the form of the report of total volume 
steel reinforcement and that of current rebar volume based on the existing progress to monitor spreadsheet to 
perform the rate calculation of real time and exact rebar waste. Simulation and ‚ÄúWhat if‚Äù scenario were applied 
to this proposed calculation model. For a 40% progress of the suspended road structure project, the proposed 
calculation model partakes 4,02% rebar waste rate. This result validates that the model can produce rebar waste 
rate based on the exisiting project progress.

1.  Introduction 
Nowadays sustainable development has become a popular topic in socio-economic development of every country. 
Minimizing negative impact on environment through construction industry is highly required in the global 
sustainable development goals. The strong ties between environmental concerns and urban development as one 
of the primary generators of material waste and consumers of water and energy have been recognized by 
government as well as construction industry professionals. This explains why the adaptation of green practices in 
the construction industry has been increasingly growing (Tafazzoli et al., 2020). As cited in Tafazzoli‚Äôs (year) 
research, green practices in construction industry focus on minimizing activities considered as waste. Minimizing 
waste does not only bring value for the owner, but also more profits, thus enhances the quality and improve the 
customer satisfaction. Construction sector is one of the major contributors to global waste generation. The impact 
of waste disposal pollutes the environment; therefore, a call for an improvement in the waste management is 
essential  (Fitri et al.,2019). 
 
The findings of Nagapan et al.‚Äôs (2012) research in Malaysia suggested 5 key causes of waste generation: poor 
site management and supervision; lack of experience; inadequate planning and scheduling; mistakes and errors in 
desgin; and mistakes during construction.  Other researchers such as Fitri et al. (2019) listed several factors 
contributing to waste production: recurrent design changes; errors in design and construction detail; waste from 
cutting uneconomical shapes; lack of knowledge and experience in construction waste; purchase of materials 
which are unsuitable with the specification; and inappropriate storage causing failure and rework. This suggests 
that the construction stakeholders need to raise concerns about waste construction not only in a construction phase 
but also in a design phase and take action in minimizing the waste. 
 
The majority of the current practices of managing construction waste focus on the construction stage. Some 
forecasting tools have been used to assist construction waste reduction during design stages. However, decision 
making tools for construction waste management during design stages are lacking (Liu et al.,2015). 
 
Information on reliable waste generation is a basic requirement for formulating successful waste management 
strategies (Wu et al., 2014). According to Wu et al.‚Äôs (2014) research, generation rate calculation is the most 
popular methodology for estimating construction and demolition waste amounts. Some integrations of calculation 
method include survey visit and fixed percentage. For rebar material, fixed percentage rate estimation is quite 
essential in cutting down the wastage and saving money.

5.  Conclusion 
The objective of this paper was to extend BIM function as waste management collaborative tools for rebar waste 
control and management in construction phase. 
 
Generally, the proposed model of calculation is successful and validated by a case study. The model was effective 
in providing the calculation of the real time rebar waste rate so the project team could monitor and control waste 
rate in the field. This proposed calculation model also offers the stakeholders more options and assistance in 
decision making processes and evaluating the rebar production in more productive and quick manners through 
BIM, especially for a crash program project with no detailed plan on rebar shape schedule. 
 
The present study, however,  was unable to calculate the length of extended rebar lap in the edge of latest concrete 
that makes the model a little less accurate. This study may be applicable to a single floor infrastructure; thus, a 
further study could develop the proposed model in more complex types of constructions such as building 
constructions.

Abstract 
 
Electronic medical record (EMR) satisfaction in hospitals is very important to understand. This is related in how far 
doctors will use it. There are many factors that can affect the internal satisfaction of ERM. Some of them are 
communication styles, computer efficacy and competencies. This research seeks to analyze how far communication 
style, computer efficacy and competencies affect internal satisfaction of electronic medical record services. Location 
of this research was conducted in one of the hospitals in Surabaya, Indonesia. The method used is multiple linear 
regression analysis. Sample collection involve 30 doctors from general clinics. The results show that communication 
style, computer efficacy and competency have a positive and significant effect on internal satisfaction with 
electronic medical record services, either partially or simultaneously. Computer efficacy are the most dominant 
factor in influencing EMR satisfaction. This research is expected to be used as input for hospital management to 
focus on EMR satisfaction by improving doctor‚Äôs communication styles, computer efficacy and competencies. If 
these three factors continue to be improved, especially in computer efficacy for example through training, then EMR 
satisfaction at hospital will also increase.

1. Introduction 
Starting in the middle of 2018, digital transformation begun in PHC Hospital Surabaya. It transforms from document 
to digital. The process included scanning hard copy document into soft copy data and then stored into single storage 
database. Firstly, doctors used multi combination between medical record documents and electronic medical record 
(EMR). That happened because it was not possible to convert all medical record document into EMR at once. The 
process continued until the end of 2018. Doctors have to type medical records into computer and sometimes have to 
read document if it is not scanned yet and available in computer application. Even when the application was ready to 
be used and document had scanned, some doctors still wrote down medical information of patient into paper or 
medical record document. It‚Äôs hard to identify which document had scanned and which one had not yet. Although 
hospital management instruct to use electronic medical record instead, some doctors still wants to write in paper.   
 
With that fact, hospital management think, there is no ending process between writing document and scanning. That 
action must be stopped, or EMR have no success. Then in February 2019, hospital management decided to stop 
medical record paper document. Implementation process got obstacle such as technical problem and human error. 
Doctor complained it‚Äôs harder to type in computer while interacting with patient than write on paper. It also affected 
to some doctors who likes to talk with patient and write comprehensive detail of medical record. They will type 
simple text because it takes time to type longer text on computer. Simple text of medical record history made doctor 
dissatisfied to EMR. Another problem arised when doctor not familiar with computer or they lack of computer 
efficacy. Even they had been trained to use computer, application and EMR, they still have problem with that. When 
they did not know how to operate computer or use application, they often filled the data incomplete and hard to

5. Conclusion 
From this research, several conclusions can be formulated. Partially there is a positive and significant influence of 
communication style on internal satisfaction of EMR services. There is also an influence of computer efficacy on 
internal satisfaction of EMR services positively and significantly. Partially there is an influence of competency on 
internal satisfaction of EMR services positively and significantly. Simultaneously there is a positive and significant 
influence on the variables of communication style, computer efficacy and competency on internal satisfaction of EMR 
services. This shows that simultaneously all independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable. 
Communication style affects the internal satisfaction of EMR services, so that satisfaction with EMR services can be 
increased by increasing the use of communication media in the form of coordination groups related to EMR services. 
Whenever there are technical problems or administrative problems related to the disruption of EMR services, doctors 
can inform the group and these problems can be handled together quickly. Not only that, the Change Management 
Department at the hospital can also provide reminders about good communication tips, culture and hospital motto for 
the service department, especially medical personnel and doctors. Computer Efficacy affect the internal satisfaction of 
EMR services, so that satisfaction with EMR services can be increased by continuing to carry out socialization 
activities related to how to use and troubleshoot EMR applications by IT units. In addition to socialization, hospital 
can also regularly conduct webinars on IT-related topics for employees, including doctors. With these routine 
activities, the computer efficacy for doctors will increase. Competency affects internal satisfaction of EMR services, 
so that satisfaction with EMR services can be increased by establishing a communication forum between internal 
doctors that aims to discuss scientifically with each other. Human Capital Department of the hospital can also provide 
training for employees, especially doctors to improve competency and implement a workplace rotation system to 
provide new experiences or handle new cases so that doctors are encouraged to continue to improve their 
competencies. Based on the results of the study, the adjusted R2 value was 0.426, this means that the variation in 
satisfaction can be explained by variations in the independent variables of communication style, computer efficacy 
and competency of 42.6 percent. While the remaining 57.4 percent is explained by other reasons outside the model. 
From the remaining percentage obtained, it can provide the opportunity for further researchers to examine what other 
aspects can affect the internal satisfaction of EMR services apart from communication style factors, computer efficacy 
and competency.

Abstract 
 
Operating costs are all expenses that are directly used for the production or carried out by a company to optimize the 
current inventory in the field so that it can provide optimal benefits for the company. This study uses quantitative 
methods and data analysis techniques with multiple linear regression, where the samples used are the operational 
employees of the Domestic Container Terminal in the finance section and the On Duty Manager (MOD) and their 
staff as many as 67 respondents. Based on the results of the Keyword Analysis that the Operating Cost Variable has 
no significant effect on Work Productivity. The Container Distribution variable has a positive and significant effect 
on the Work Productivity variable. Variables Operating Costs and Container Distribution together have a positive 
and significant effect on the Work Productivity variable because the F test results show a value of 52.371 which is 
greater than F table of 3.142. This means that if there is an increase in Container Operation and Distribution Costs, 
then Work Productivity can also increase.purchase of needed goods. Container distribution is a container 
distribution activity.

1. Introduction 
Given the geographical condition of Indonesia as an archipelagic country where the ocean area is larger than the 
land area, the means of transportation by sea have a big role in connecting cities and islands in the country. The 
development of sea transportation must be able to drive the development of Eastern Indonesia, by prioritizing the 
regularity of ship visits that can stimulate the growth of trade and development activities in general. The archipelago 
sea as a maritime business area requires prioritizing national archipelago shipping that is able to ensure the 
availability of decent and safe sea transportation services while creating jobs. (MPR Decree No. II/MPR/1993) 
which indicates that the implementation of development in the sea transportation sector is directed, among others, to 
increase inter-island trade activities, in addition to inter-state trade (import-export). 
 
With the increase in the flow of goods and services through trade activities by sea, the existence of sea 
transportation service companies, such as the Ship Loading Expeditionary Company (EMKL) and the Loading and 
Unloading Company (PBM) have a very large role. Apart from the role of EMKL and PBM, what is not important is 
the role of port operators who facilitate the two types of companies (EMKL and PBM) operating in the port area. 
 
One of the port operators is the Domestic Container Terminal which started its activities as a port terminal operator 
since early January 2002. The Domestic Container Terminal has been serving both international and domestic 
loading and unloading of goods and containers, including containers and non-containers. However, since 2012 the 
Domestic Container Terminal has no longer served international container activities and in 2014 has also no longer 
served non-container (bulk) activities until now, which only focuses on loading and unloading services for domestic 
containers. 
In doing business, like companies in general, Domestic Container Terminals always carry out planning and 
supervision of operating costs, product distribution and company work productivity, so that the company can run 
smoothly and be able to increase profits according to the direction of the policies it takes. For the three components, 
operating costs, product distribution and work productivity become one unit in order to achieve the company's main 
objectives.

3419","4.5.2 Multiple Linear Regression Test  
Multiple linear regression is used to determine the magnitude of the effect of differences from one variable on other 
variables, in this case the variable operating costs and container distribution on work productivity as an intervention 
variable with the following formula: 
 
Y = Œ≤0 + Œ≤1X1 + Œ≤2X2 + e 
Description :  
 Y   
= Work productivity   
X1 
=  Operating Cost   
X2      =  Domestic Container Distribution   
Œío   =  Constanta  
Œ≤1.2   =  Regression coefficient 
e       = Error value 
 
Based on the analysis, the results of the analysis are as follows: 
 
4.5.4 Effect of Container Distribution on Work Productivity  
The results of this study indicate that the t count of Container Distribution (X2) is 7,137 t table = 1,997, then the 
value of t count > t table. Meanwhile, the significance value of t count variable for Container Distribution (X2) is 
0.000, meaning <0.05. Based on these results, H0 is rejected and Ha is accepted, which means that Container 
Distribution has a significant effect on Work Productivity (Y). 
 
This is in accordance with what is explained by Firmansyah Kurniadai (2010) in a study entitled The Effect of 
Promotional and Distribution Costs on Increasing Sales Volume, where an increase in product distribution will 
definitely increase work productivity, especially in the production and marketing department. The conditions that 
occur at PT Berlian Jasa Terminal Indonesia Pelabuhan related to the increase in distribution are: 
1. Enforcement of the tariff rate for the storage period for containers in the field which has an impact on planning 
and shipping activities to immediately shorten the storage period for containers so that the cycle/distribution of 
containers in the field is faster; 
2. Enforcement of the requirement of 75% of containers required to stockpile so that ships can dock has an impact 
on optimizing vacant land; 
3. Enforcement of mandatory stockpiling requirements for frozen food containers to further optimize the rifer field 
in accommodating refrigerated containers. 
 
For the simultaneous relationship of the variable operating costs and container distribution which together have a 
significant effect on the productivity of loading and unloading work which can be proven in the F test results 
obtained, Fcount shows a value of 52.371 which is greater than Ftable 3.142 with a significance value of 0.000, if 
operating and distribution costs container increases, work productivity can be reduced and also increases. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In accordance with the objectives formulated in this study, the results of the analysis that have been carried out show 
that the Operating Cost Variable has no significant effect on the Work Productivity variable, meaning that if there is 
an increase in operating costs it does not necessarily increase work productivity. 
 
The Container Distribution variable has a positive and significant effect on the Work Productivity variable, meaning 
that if there is an increase in the Container Distribution, the Work Productivity will increase. 
 
Operational Cost Variables and Container Distribution together have a positive and significant effect on the Work 
Productivity variable because the F test results obtained show a value of 52,371 which is greater than Ftable of 
3,142. This means that if there is an increase in Container Operation and Distribution Costs, then Work Productivity 
can also increase.

3433","6. Suggestion 
Based on what shows a significant and positive effect of the variable Operational Cost and Container Distribution on 
the Work Productivity variable, it provides suggestions that can be used as references and considerations so that in 
the future it can be useful. The following are suggestions given by the author based on the results of the study: 
1. To increase employee productivity, the company should use proper training for employees. With the right 
training method, employees can easily understand the content of the training materials so that they are more 
effective and efficient in increasing employee productivity. 
2. Companies must be more careful in planning activities to reduce operating costs without having an impact on 
decreasing loading and unloading productivity. 
3. Calculations for operating cost planning consider the distribution of containers and the productivity of unloading 
work so that the total operating costs do not occur. 
4. The company must also be firm in implementing the rules for the distribution of containers, especially regarding 
the rules regarding the shortage of shipping fleets in loading and unloading, so shipments must receive their 
unloaded containers first in the field to facilitate loading and unloading activities. 
5. For further research, it is hoped that someone will examine how the distribution of containers can be optimized 
to obtain maximum profit for the company, not only to increase work productivity.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia is the largest and only archipelagic country in which two-thirds or 63% of its territorial area is in the 
form of water. As the largest archipelagic nation, Indonesia needs a broad and well-developed maritime sector 
so that it can help the country achieve its economic, social and political goals. 
According to Tjiptono (2014: 295) distribution sector are things that become organizational expectations that 
perform all the functions needed to flow services and transportation or products from sellers to consumers or 
final buyers. Because it is more profitable to transport goods and services by sea than land or air transportation, 
it can load large volumes of goods at low cost. Economic factors needed in sea transportation must be able to 
meet several requirements, namely high speed, large loading capacity, ease of unloading or fast ship turnaround 
time. 
 
In addition, sea transportation activities cannot be separated from the nature of people's livelihoods in most of 
the Indonesian archipelago. Turning on sea transportation can not only facilitate the flow of goods and 
passengers from one area to another, but also develop sources of livelihood for the people in general. In the 
development of sea transportation infrastructure, apart from being a means of connecting one island to another, 
it is also a driving force for a movement of social and economic activities in the export and import of goods and 
other activities, the area is a port. 
 
With the background as described above, the role of human resources (HR) is supported by equipment that 
supports the importance of carrying out an activity at the port, thus raising the title ""Performance Operators and 
Loading and Effectiveness Unloading Equipment to improve Container Handling at Terminal on Domestic 
Container‚Äù. 
  
2. Literature Review  
2.1 Performance Operators 
Operator performance is defined as an ability or expertise possessed by employees of a company in a particular 
field according to their field such as a skilled and skilled forklift operator or Reach Stacker (RS) operator to 
Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Monterrey, Mexico, November 3-5, 2021
¬© IEOM Society International
3436","Based on Table 4.18 the T-test analysis is the magnitude of the tcount value on the operator performance 
variable (X1) is 4.535 with a significance level of 0.000. Because 4.535> 1.990 and 0.000 <0.05, it shows that 
H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted. 
 
Conclusion: So that the independent variable operator performance (X1) has a significant partial effect on 
container handling (Y) 
 
b.  Formulation of hypothesis for t-test (partial) on variable loading and unloading equipment (X2): 
1) H0 : Œ≤2 = 0 
H1 : Œ≤2 ‚â† 0 
or 
H0 : The independent variable loading and unloading equipment (X2) has no partial significant effect on 
loading and unloading equipment (Y). 
H1 : The independent variable loading and unloading equipment (X2) has a significant partial effect on 
container handling (Y). 
c. 
If the significance value of the independent variable loading and unloading (X2) in the t-test sig <0.05 or t-
count> t-table, then there is an effect of variable X on variable Y. If the value of sig> 0.05 or t-count < t 
table then there is no the effect of variable X on Y. 
Based on Table 4.18 the analysis of the T test is the magnitude of the value of tcount on the variable 
loading and unloading equipment (X2) is 15.997 with a significance of 0.000. Because 15.997>1.990 and 0.000 
<0.05, it shows that H0 is rejected. 
    Conclusion: So that the independent variable loading and unloading equipment (X2) has a partial 
significant effect on container handling (Y). 
 
5.4 Discussion  
5.4 1 Effect of operator performance on container handling  
Based on the hypothesis testing using the partial test (t test), the results show that the operator's performance 
(X1) has an influence on container handling (Y). This can be seen from the significance value on the t-test of the 
operator performance variable (X1) of 0.000 or less than the significance level (Œ±) of 0.05 and Tcount > Ttable 
of 4.535> 1.990. Based on this, the first hypothesis which reads ""It is suspected that there is a partial effect of 
operator performance on container handling"" is proven true and can be declared accepted. 
 
The results of the analysis show that there is an effect of operator performance on container handling, meaning 
that the better the operator performance formed by Terminal on Domestic Container, the higher the container 
handling will be. In other words, operator performance can be shaped by the handling of containers built by 
Terminal on Domestic Container. 
 
5.4.2 Effect of Loading and Unloading Equipment on Container Handling  
Based on the hypothesis testing using the partial test (t test) it is found that loading and unloading equipment 
(X2) has an influence on container handling (Y). This can be seen from the significance value of the t-test of the 
loading and unloading equipment variable (X2) of 0.000 or less than the significance level (Œ±) of 0.05 and 
Tcount > Ttable of 15.997 > 1.990. Based on this, the second hypothesis which reads ""It is suspected that there 
is a partial effect of unloading equipment on the handling of containers at Terminal on Domestic Container "" is 
proven to be true and can be accepted. 
 
There is a partial effect if the performance of operators and loading and unloading with positive and significant 
performance. This means that the performance of the operator and equipment that is dismantled has a 
unidirectional relationship, then the performance of the operator and unloading equipment will increase or it can 
be said that there is no problem. (Journal of Magister Management Vol. 2 No 1, March 2016 35-68 ) by Amril1, 
Jerry M Logahan. 
 
6. Conclusions  
Based on the results of research and discussion in the previous chapter, several conclusions can be drawn to 
answer the formulation of the problem. Some of these conclusions consist of: (1) Operator performance has a 
significant partial effect on container handling of Terminal on Domestic Container, with a significance less than 
0.05. Thus, the first hypothesis which reads ""It is suspected that there is a partial effect of operator performance 
on    container    handling at Terminal on Domestic Container"" is proven to be true and can be declared 
accepted, (2) Loading and unloading equipment has a partial significant effect on container handling at Terminal 
on Domestic Container, with a significance less than 0.05. Thus the second hypothesis which reads ""It is 
suspected that there is a partial effect of loading and unloading equipment on container handling at Terminal on 
Domestic Container"" is proven to be true and can be declared accepted.

Abstract 
 
Jamrud Surabaya Terminal must to continue monitor its work productivity factors. One of the factors that 
support work productivity in loading and unloading activities is loading and unloading equipment, workload, 
and employee work stress. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the readiness of 
HMC equipment, workload and work stress on the work productivity of Surabaya Jamrud Terminal employees. 
The data used in this study is primary data obtained by distributing questionnaires to the employees of Terminal 
Jamrud Surabaya, totaling 48 employees. The data analysis technique used multiple linear regression analysis 
technique. The results showed that the readiness of the HMC tool had a significant relationship with work 
productivity with the t count of 6.877, which was greater than the t table of 2.01537 with a significance level of 
less than 0.05. Workload also has a significant relationship to work productivity with a calculated value of 
16,381 greater than t table of 2,01537, with a significance level of less than 0.05 and work stress of 2,503 
greater than t table of 2,01537, with the significance level is less than 0.05 so it can be concluded that work 
stress has a significant relationship to work productivity.

1. Introduction  
Jamrud Surabaya Terminal is one of the terminals that used for loading and unloading activities for both 
container and cargo ships, so that Jamrud Surabaya Terminal must continue to reduce work productivity factors. 
Productivity is a universal concept that aims to provide more goods and services that are used by many people 
by using fewer real resources (Sinungan, 2014: 17). One of the factors that support work productivity in loading 
and unloading is loading and unloading equipment. unloading equipment is a tool used for loading and 
unloading from ship to land and vice versa. The readiness of loading and unloading equipment greatly affects 
the loading and unloading process in terms of loading and unloading speed. The readiness of loading and 
unloading equipment can be seen from the readiness of mechanics, spare parts, and modes of transportation 
where these three things can affect the speed of loading and unloading. The reality in the Jamrud terminal field 
is that when loading and unloading ships often occur, which hampers the ship's exit cycle activity. 
 
In addition to the readiness of the tools, the factor that affects work productivity is the workload. According to 
previous research results from Encep Saefullah (2017: 67) said that ""workload has a significant effect on work 
productivity"" According to Danang Sunyoto (2015: 64), ""workload is one that causes too much of a person's 
self, causing stress"". This can be caused by the level of expertise that may be too high, the work speed is too 
high, the work volume may be too much and so on. The third factor that affects the productivity of unloading 
activities is employee work stress. According to the results of research from Yohana T (2015: 76) shows that 
work stress affects work productivity. According to Handoko (2015: 200) stress is a condition that affects a 
person's emotions, thought processes and physical condition, while there is another understanding of work 
stress. can affect human physical health. Stress is our perception of a situation or condition in our own 
environment. Another understanding states that stress is a condition that affects emotions, thought processes,

that may be too high, the work speed is too high, the work volume may be too much and so on. The result of the 
relationship with workload also has a significant effect on work productivity with a t value of 16,381 which is 
greater than table of 2,01537, with a significance level of less than 0.05. The third factor that affects the 
productivity of unloading activities is employee work stress. According to the results of research from Yohana T 
(2015: 76) shows that work stress affects work productivity. According to Handoko (2015: 200) stress is a 
condition that affects a person's emotions, thought processes and physical condition, while there is another 
understanding of work stress. can affect human physical health. Stress is our perception of a situation or 
condition in our own environment. Another understanding states that stress is a condition that affects emotions, 
thought processes, and one's condition. If an employee experiences too much stress, it will interfere with a 
person's ability to deal with the environment and work, this opinion is quoted by Hariyono (2015: 193). The 
results of this study related to work stress have a t-count value of 2.503 which is greater than t-table of 2.01537, 
with a significance level of less than 0.05 so that it can be said that work stress has a significant relationship to 
work productivity. 
 
6. Conclusion   
Results Based on the research, the HMC tool readiness variable (X1), workload variable (X2), and work stress 
variable (X3) have a significant relationship to the work productivity (Y) of Surabaya Jamrud Terminal 
employees. The readiness of the HMC tool affects the speed of unloading time and must have a significant 
relationship to work productivity with the result of t count of 6.877 more than t table of 2.01537, with a 
significance level of less than 0.05. Jamrud Surabaya Terminal employees must be fast in their work and must 
be prepared with a large volume of work. The workload of this study also has a significant relationship to their 
work productivity with a t value of 16,381 which is greater than ttable of 2,01537, with a significance level of 
less than 0.05. The third factor that affects the work productivity of Surabaya Jamrud Terminal employees is 
work stress. The results of this study related to work stress have a t-count value of 2.503 which is greater than t-
table of 2.01537, with a significance level of less than 0.05 so that it can be said that work stress has a 
significant relationship to work productivity. The suggestions given in an effort to increase the work 
productivity of Surabaya Jamrud Terminal employees are as follows: 
a. Jamrud Surabaya Terminal must continue to unite the problem of HMC equipment readiness, 
workload and employee stress because it affects work productivity 
b. For researchers who will conduct further research, this research is expected to be used as a reference, 
support, guideline, comparison, and is expected to add other variables that can be used as indicators 
in further research. This is because there are still variables that have not been found by researchers 
that still have a relationship related to work productivity.

Abstract 
 
Currently, one of the challenges of companies engaged in logistics is to balance human resources with existing 
business processes (both current and future) to support the company's competitiveness. This research is important as 
a proposal for internal organizations in more detail and depth of internal steps that are sought to improve and be able 
to compete both nationally and globally. This study uses a qualitative approach. The collection of primary data in 
addition to using a semi-structured qualitative interview questionnaire and a structured qualitative interview 
questionnaire also used a Focus Group Discussion approach. The development of the human resource model is the 
development of human resources that can be carried out by the company based on the human resource gap currently 
faced by the company. There are several key human resource development criteria that are of concern, that is (1) 
internal coaching, (2) one-on-one coaching, (3) development of formal and non-formal education, (4) compiling a 
task force team, (5) partnering with expert human resources.

Abstract 
 
The complexity and the amount of data that needs to be processed make it mandatory for companies to have a 
system that can help companies to have better performance. One of them is by implementing an integrated 
information system SAP S/4 HANA. The purpose of this study is to analyze how the influence and what factors 
influence the implementation of SAP S/4 HANA in the Supply Chain Management process in construction 
companies. The research method used is a descriptive research method with a quantitative approach through the 
application of DeLone McLane modeling, which is then poured in the form of a Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) diagram. From the research, it was found that information quality, system quality, usage, and user 
satisfaction have a positive influence on company benefits. And the company benefits obtained are work 
effectiveness, work time efficiency, increased productivity, opportunities for innovation, cost efficiency, increased 
company profits, and ease of decision making. This research can provide an alternative to the application of an 
integrated information system SAP S/4 HANA Material Management Module in a construction service company as 
an effort to obtain company benefits.

1. Introduction 
The development of digitalization technology has now entered the industrial revolution 4.0. Where in this era 
everything is associated with digitization. So is the world of construction. The world of construction in Indonesia is 
currently in the era of the construction industry 4.0. Digitization and automation are important factors in a company 
and are expected to bring better effectiveness and efficiency in work. (Novianty, 2020). 
 
In a construction service company, one of the major processes is Supply Chain Management. This process is a 
process related to the supply chain flow, namely the flow of materials, the flow of funds, and information. This 
process is a process where all data related to material or related flows are processed. The challenge faced in this 
process is the complexity of the data that must be processed and controlled. This includes the amount of material, 
the number of equipment, the number of vendors, for the number and location of the warehouse or in this case the 
number and location of the project. The expectation that the company wants from this Supply Chain Management 
process is to obtain materials of good quality that comply with standards, vary according to needs, at efficient prices, 
flexibility, innovation, and on time of arrival. (Pujawan, 2017) The demands of a company to meet the challenges in 
the Supply Chain Management process can be done by implementing an integrated information system based on 
digital technology. 
 
SAP S/4 HANA is an integrated information system that can be applied to the Supply Chain Management process of 
a construction company. This system is an integrated information system that can enable a company to work more 
effectively and efficiently. This system allows companies to conduct data transactions to analyze a company's 
business processes simultaneously with data input. 
 
The method that will be used to examine the effect of implementing SAP S/4 HANA on the Supply Chain 
Management process on company benefits in construction companies is to use the DeLone McLane model. This

Abstract 
 
Projects with high complexity have a high risk of increasing construction costs, data accuracy is needed regarding 
cost control so that these problems do not occur. SAP S/4 HANA module Project System (PS) is an ERP system-
based application that contains data ranging from planning, procurement, control, and payment. Previously, there was 
no study on the implementation of SAP S/4 HANA specifically for the PS module on infrastructure projects. It is 
necessary to analyze the implementation of the SAP S/4 HANA PS module on data accuracy as a net benefit. This 
study aims to analyze the factors that influence the implementation of the SAP S/4 HANA PS module on data accuracy 
as net benefit in infrastructure projects. This research method used descriptive statistical methods, causal correlation 
analysis and factor analysis. Data collection techniques were carried out by expert validation and questionnaires given 
to the infrastructure project team using the SAP S/4 HANA PS module. The results showed that the ease of use, the 
speed of accessing information (system quality), data reliability and data validity (information quality), had a positive 
effect on data accuracy (net benefit). This research can be used to improve data accuracy and report quality with SAP 
PS module.

1. Introduction 
Last five years in Indonesia, infrastructure projects have become one of the most massive developments, as evidenced 
in the list of national strategic projects (PSN) regulated in Presidential Regulation Number 109 of 2020 concerning 
the Acceleration of Implementation of National Strategic Projects, there are 65 toll roads, 8 projects airports, 15 
railway transportation development projects, 48 dam projects, 9 irrigation projects, 17 industrial estates and many 
others. 
 
Projects with high complexity have a high risk of increasing construction costs, as According to Braeckmann et. al., 
2019, the higher the level of project complexity, the greater the potential for cost overruns and schedule overruns, 
which need to be managed carefully. Therefore, it is necessary to control costs so that these problems do not occur. 
According to Kadar (2011) the Earned Value method represents that the project budget is related to the Work 
Breakdown Structure (WBS) of the work, and the WBS becomes the basis for implementing the Enterprise Resource

5.2 Proposed Improvements and Validation 
The test results on the analysis of the Structural Equation Modeling model about things that affect the implementation 
of SAP on Infrastructure Projects are as follows: 
 
The results of the convergent validity test, of the 30 indicators that exist in the Structural Equation Modeling model, 
all indicators reflect each X variable. This means that the results of expert validation are in accordance with the 
convergent validity test. 
 
Of the nine hypothesis tests carried out, there were seven accepted hypotheses and two rejected hypotheses. This 
means that information quality, service quality and system quality have a positive effect on user satisfaction, then 
information quality and service quality affect usage. Then user satisfaction and usage have a positive effect on benefits. 
There are several factors that cause the hypothesis that the quality of the system affects usage is rejected, this happens 
because the service provider company already has clear procedures regarding SAP and there is an obligation to use 
SAP applications in each project. So that the users in the project (end users) are less able to know whether the quality 
of the system used in the project is good and maximal or not, so it does not affect usage. In addition, the use of SAP 
on the PS module must be carried out in real time every time a construction cost transaction is incurred, so that each 
user always tries to input data in real time, whether it is constrained by network access or language difficulties. 
 
What can be maximized is to improve the quality of users with training (end user training) so that users of SAP do not 
experience difficulties in understanding the SAP system and language, and end users can understand well what is 
inputted in SAP, so that it has an impact on the accuracy of the construction cost evaluation data. on the project. 
In addition, there are factors that cause the hypothesis of usage affecting user satisfaction to be rejected, this happens 
because the use of SAP, as previously explained, is an obligation that must be complied with in service provider 
procedures, and its use is in real time, it cannot be routinely once a week or once a week. once a month, whenever 
there is a transaction, the end user must immediately input the data. 
 
With real time usage, but currently the benefits of SAP in service providers are still limited to the accuracy of recording 
construction costs, not being able to accurately predict the estimated construction costs until completion, a long and 
continuous SAP development process is needed to be able to predict the estimated construction costs to completion 
accurately and can increase user satisfaction due to use. 
 
Among the hypotheses that have a positive effect, the one with the greatest value is customer satisfaction with benefits. 
This is very impactful for service provider companies if SAP development has reached the stage of satisfaction with 
the quality of the SAP system which can calculate and estimate construction costs to completion accurately, it will 
increase performance for both projects and corporates. They are able to mitigate the risk of increasing project costs 
because the calculation of project cost estimates until completion is accurate. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the data analysis and discussion that has been carried out, it can be concluded several things, namely as 
follows:

3489","1. Factors that can affect SAP are information quality, service quality, system quality, usage, customer satisfaction 
and benefits. There are indicators in these factors. This research supports from previous research, the factors that 
influence the implementation of SAP used by industry can also be used in infrastructure projects. 
 
2. The implementation of SAP S/4 HANA PS module has a positive effect on data accuracy as a benefit. The 
influence can be described as follows: 
 
a. The quality of the system affects customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction affects the benefits, it is clear 
that the ease of use of the application can technically minimize the occurrence of human errors in filling out 
construction cost data so as to increase data accuracy as a benefit. 
b. Data reliability, data validity, and synchronization between parts contained in the quality of information and 
system quality affect customer satisfaction and affect benefits, this can illustrate that valid SAP S/4 HANA 
data can improve the accuracy of the data itself. 
c. The speed in accessing information and the existence of facilities to correct those contained in the quality of 
the system affect the effectiveness in working as user satisfaction. Because filling in the SAP S/4 HANA PS 
Module in real time and making it easier to trace historical data before there are problems or errors in data 
input in the future. This of course can improve data accuracy as a benefit.

Abstract 
Powerhouse also called a generator house is a place or space that is used to meet the operational needs of 
buildings, usually used as an installation space for electricity, water, air conditioning, and others. There 
are many cases of structural damage caused by human error or natural behavior. Structural damage can 
occur in the construction process or factors of the building itself or external factors. The shape and level 
of structural damage can occur from mild to severe. In choosing the method for repairing and 
strengthening concrete structures, several factors must be considered, namely the capacity of the 
structure, the environment in which the structure is located, the available equipment, the ability of the 
implementing staff and the limitations of the owner such as limited workspace, ease of implementation, 
implementation time and cost. Analytical Hierarchy Process is a support systems method in decision 
making, with real data and carefully studied can solve various multi-criteria decision-making problems, 
and can solve the problem of choosing the method of repair and reinforcement of concrete in the 
powerhouse building. The results of the decision making on the repair of concrete building structures can 
be decided to choose the alternative application of the Mortar Cement as the main choice with the highest 
value: 0.3485, as the best choice. Furthermore, to strengthen the concrete building structure, it was 
decided to choose the highest value: 0.3564, with the alternative application of Self Compacting Concrete 
as the main choice.

1. Introduction 
The construction of multi-storey buildings in Indonesia is currently increasing its needs. Multi-storey 
buildings are commonly used as government buildings as well as public facilities such as offices and 
hospitals. In addition, the construction of multi-storey buildings in Indonesia can also be used as an 
investment such as apartments, hotels, malls, and others. The use of multi-storey buildings needs to be 
supported by the existence of power house buildings (generator houses). Overall the powerhouse has a 
smaller building size than the main building, the size of the powerhouse space is calculated from 
whatever utility is in it. For example, space is needed for generator sets, panel rooms, ac chillers, 
transformers, and sub stations or medium voltage and low voltage panel rooms. In the implementation of 
the powerhouse building will carry out operational activities, as for the operational understanding 
according to Sofjan Assauri (2008:12), said that ""Operations are activities that regulate and coordinate the 
use of resources in the form of human resources, resource tools and resources of funds and materials, 
effectively and efficiently to create and increase the usefulness utility of goods or services"". 
 
Powerhouse must be built at a higher level to be safe from the possibility of flooding. In addition, the 
distance of the powerhouse with the main building is recommended to be closer to saving energy. 
Powerhouse is the heart of every existing building, because this building supplies power for the 
operational needs of the building. If there is damage to the power house building or working machines it 
will result in disruption of operational activities in the building. The losses incurred from such damages 
are not small, in addition to costs can also interfere with the comfort and safety of building users. There 
are many cases of structural damage caused by human error or natural behavior. Structural damage can 
occur in the construction process or the age of the building and damage due to lack of maintenance. The

Abstract 
 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have an important role in the Indonesian economy. Both in the pace 
of the country's economic development and employment. The MSMEs can reduce the current unemployment rate. 
The Indonesian government continues to implement various strategies in economic development to improve the 
welfare of the people. One of the strategies carried out is fostering and growing MSMEs. Thus, this study aims to 
analyze MSMEs actors and socialize Financial Accounting Standards (SAK) MSMEs to apply SAK- MSMEs-based 
financial reports. This study involved MSMEs actors in Pekalongan district, Indonesia, and was collected by using the 
purposive sampling technique. Data was obtained by distributing questionnaires to 40 MSME respondents in 
Pekalongan. Of the 40 respondents (63%) are women, (75%) are 30-40 years old, (55%) have a D3/S1 education, 
(70%) are 5-10 years old in the business, (50%) are IDR. 5.000.000, - up to IDR. 10,000,000, -/month, and (52%) 
make MSMEs financial reports. The data was analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression by assisting the statistical 
software, namely SPSS-25. The results indicated that the socialization, education level, perceptions of MSMEs actors,

The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of the principal in improving the quality of education at the 
Laboratory Elementary School of Unimuda Sorong. The methodology used was qualitative with a phenomenological 
approach. The study found that the role of the principal in improving the quality of education at the Laboratory 
Elementary School of Unimuda Sorong consisted of three stages: input, processing, and output. The input stage 
includes 1) Free of costs: providing free education for Papuan children and 2) Mapping: prioritizing Papuan children 
and transmigrants‚Äô communities around the ""Warmon Kokoda"" village. The processing stage includes enlarging the 
classrooms, providing laboratories, creating a comfortable library for elementary school-aged children, evaluating al-
Qur'an teachers, and daily controlling the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Finally, at the output stage, all of 
the students of the past few years graduated with stable and static grades. The leadership style carried out by the 
principal was democratic in all respects by taking a social-persuasive approach when problems occur between teachers 
and parents and the surrounding community.

1. Introduction  
Currently, financial investment is one of the main choices among investors. Financial Investment is investing a number 
of funds in financial assets, such as deposits, bonds, stocks, and securities. Financial investment can be done directly 
and indirectly. Directly which means investors buy the company's financial assets, and indirectly means buying shares 
of investment companies that have a portfolio of financial assets from the company directly.

rejected and H1 is accepted. This means that the Investment Strategy and Risk Management simultaneously have a 
significant influence on Bitcoin Online Trading. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the research and discussion previously described regarding the Effect of Investment Strategies 
and Risk Management on Bitcoin Online Trading. then the author can draw the following conclusions: Investment 
Strategy is included in the good category which shows that bitcoin investors in Indonesia do not only trade bitcoin at 
random but use investment strategies well. Risk Management is included in the good category which shows that 
bitcoin investors in Indonesia trade bitcoin with good risk management in order to avoid losses and maintain profits. 
Bitcoin Online Trading is included in the good category, which shows that bitcoin investors in Indonesia value both 
the advantages and the ease of doing Bitcoin Online Trading. 
 
Investment Strategy (X1) has no significant effect on Bitcoin Online Trading (Y). This happens because even though 
they have adequate knowledge and skills, they do not have the courage to take investment in investors in Indonesia. 
Risk Management (X2) has a significant influence on Bitcoin Online Trading (Y). This shows that risk management 
is very important for bitcoin investors in Indonesia in conducting Bitcoin Online Trading. By managing risk 
management, even poor methods can still make a profit. Investment Strategy and Risk Management simultaneously 
have a positive and significant effect on Bitcoin Online Trading. The effect of the Investment Strategy and Risk 
Management variable is 0.132, which means that this result indicates that 13.2% of the Bitcoin Online Trading variable 
can be explained by the Investment Strategy and Risk Management variable. While the remaining 86.8% is influenced 
by other variables.

1. 
Introduction  
Economic recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major problem in various countries, including 
Indonesia. Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are considered capable of supporting the Indonesian economy 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past few decades, SMEs have become the center of attention for research 
because they can drive a country's economic growth (Ribeiro-Soriano, 2017). SMEs are well known to play a role in 
creating new jobs and generating financial capital (Gilmore, 2011). Indonesia now has more than 64 million SMEs 
and could employ more than 116 million workers by 2019 (Faried et al., 2021). One of the provinces in Indonesia that 
cares about SMEs is East Java. To face the challenges of digital technology development (Maulana et al., 2020), the 
era of the industrial revolution 4.0 (Sudrajat et al., 2019), and society 5.0 (Purnomo et al., 2021), the East Java 
provincial government seeks to strengthen the SME empowerment network to Islamic boarding schools through the 
One Pesantren One product (OPOP) program. 
 
The One Pesantren One product (OPOP) is a social entrepreneurship movement that aims to develop the economic 
welfare of pesantren-based communities through empowering students, pesantren, and alumni of Islamic boarding 
schools (OPOP Jatim, 2021) by optimizing the role of informal leadership (Anam et al., 2019). Pesantren are Islamic 
boarding schools with a social and cultural community base for centuries in Indonesia. Santri are students in Islamic 
boarding schools. The SMEs participating in OPOP receive training on entrepreneurship, capital, packaging design,

3514","program need to pay attention to entrepreneurial orientation and market performance to increase business growth 
while strengthening the brand orientation of their products. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This research has shown that entrepreneurial orientation, market performance, brand orientation have a positive and 
significant impact on the business growth of SMEs participating in the East Java OPOP program. In addition, this 
study has proven that brand orientation can have a positive and significant impact on the business growth of SMEs 
participating in the East Java OPOP program. However, the comparison of direct and indirect contributions shows 
that the presence or absence of a mediator variable does not affect the independent variable (entrepreneurial orientation 
and market performance) on the dependent variable (business growth).

Abstract 
 
Cities in the developing world have the challenge of supporting and promoting clean, safe, and efficient ways for 
people and goods to access opportunities and markets, directly affecting human health and quality of life while 
reducing energy intensity. Significant innovations and disruptive changes are coming to the transport sector, electric 
vehicles, and digital technologies capable of revolutionizing the provision of transport services. These significant 
changes can decarbonize the transport sector while contributing to other sustainability goals related to healthier, safer, 
and more livable cities. In some dense city centers, inefficient trucks are being replaced with e-cargo bikes to deliver 
goods, with the potential to massively improve safety, cut noise and emissions, and free up the street and public space. 
Cycle logistics involves integrating bicycles, tricycles, and other cycling technology into the goods movement network 
to improve the efficiency of deliveries in congested urban areas. This work aims to assess the potential to implement a 
collaborative model of consolidation and burden sharing where the companies make use of a platform to consolidate 
merchandise from warehouses or distribution centers located in areas near the city and later load and distribute on 
smaller vehicles (electric bicycles/tricycles) to their final destination. The approach of collaborative models for the 
consolidation of load and distribution to smaller vehicles allows identifying a solution for the profit of all actors 
involved in the last mile distribution process. We design and implement a pilot with four companies during 3-7 months 
in order to evaluate the logistics, environmental and economic impact of cycle logistics under two operational models 
for the food and packaging sector. Results show that e-cargo bikes have the potential to replace 1-ton vehicles, 
motorcycles, and human-powered vehicles in last-mile operations in Bogota.

1. Introduction  
The rapid development of technology today is followed by the development of increasingly complex financial 
products, requiring everyone to pay attention to financial planning and financial decision making. This relates to a 
person's need to prepare for retirement by setting aside a portion of his current income. Everyone needs to have 
financial literacy to assist in making financial planning and making good financial decisions so that the goal of getting 
financial prosperity in the future is achieved. 
 
Planning is an important thing in the investment world. Investment planning is considered to play a very important 
role for the financial condition of the company or individual because the selection of the right investment will provide 
additional income that has an impact on increasing the welfare of the company or individual Susdiani, (2017). With 
planning, a person no longer hesitates in making decisions to invest more maturely and avoid losses. An individual 
must have good financial knowledge so that his financial decisions are clearly directed when planning for an 
investment. Rasuma Putri & Rahyuda, (2017) 
 
The capital market is a non-bank financial institution that conducts securities offering & trading and is also a 
professional institution related to securities buying and selling transactions. The place where sellers and buyers of 
capital or funds meet is known as the capital market. The capital market has two functions at once, namely economic 
and financial functions. Therefore, the capital market has a major role in the economy of a country. It is said to have 
an economic function because it provides facilities or provides a place that brings together two interests, namely those 
who have funds or are called investors and those who need funds (issuers). (Wardiyah, 2017) With the capital market, 
parties who have funds (investors) can invest in parties who need funds in the hope of getting a return (return) in the 
form of dividends, while those who need funds (companies) can take advantage of funds obtained from fund owner 
or investor. The capital market provides opportunities and allows investors to obtain returns according to the 
characteristics of the investment they choose, therefore the capital market is said to have a financial function.

The results of the normality test in Figure 2.  above can be concluded that the overall data used to measure the 
investment interest variable has a normal distribution. 
 
5.3 Validation  
In the student investment interest variable, there is a dimension that has the highest total score on the item ""before I 
invest, I find out first information about the advantages and disadvantages of the investment I will make"" getting a 
total score of 82.40%. 
 
Although students' investment interest is in the ""good"" category, it can be seen in Table 3. the percentage of the total 
score on the investment interest variable has the lowest value on the item ""I read a guide book on investing steps 
before starting investing"" getting a total score of 64.90%. 
 
Based on Table 3, the average score for the total financial literacy variable is 73.57%. The score on the continuum in 
Figure 2. is included in the good category, which means that the respondent has good financial literacy. 
In this financial literacy variable, there is an item with the highest total score, namely ""Financial knowledge helps me 
in investing for my future needs"" of 90.20%. The lowest total score on the financial literacy variable is found in the 
item ""I know how to calculate the amount of interest on a monthly credit card bill"" which is 60.40%. 
 
Based on the results of hypothesis testing (t test) the value of t count (18.927) > t table (1.971), then H_0 is rejected. 
This means that there is a significant effect of financial literacy on students' interest in investing in the capital market 
(study of residents of Bandung City with student status) with a contribution of 47.4%. While the remaining 52.6% is 
the contribution of the influence of other variables outside this study. These results indicate that the higher/better 
financial literacy, the more interest in investing in Bandung City residents who are students. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research that has been carried out on residents of Bandung City who are students about the 
influence of financial literacy on students' interest in investing in the capital market, it can be concluded as follows: 
Financial literacy in residents of Bandung City with student status as a whole is in the good category. The overall 
interest in investing in Bandung City residents with student status is in the good category. Financial literacy has a 
significant effect on the investment interest of Bandung City residents who are students in the capital market. It is 
evident from the results of the coefficient of determination (Kd) of 47.4%, while the remaining 52.6% is influenced 
by other variables not examined in this study.

1. Introduction 
Individual performance determines whether employees have the required ability to work on projects or not. 
Performance depends on a combination of ability, effort, and opportunity (Hasibuan, 2016). Performance is the result 
or output of a process (Dessler, 2020). Effective employee performance can be measured based on the quantity of 
work, timely completion that has been determined, as well as good quality of work, to achieve this requires a common 
view of the vision, mission, and goals. Human resources with competent management are one of an organization‚Äôs 
success criteria. As a result, employees play an important part in achieving organization goals (Fakhri et al., 2021). 
Employees have to take an active role in helping the organization achieve its goals with their ideas and passion. In 
order to fulfill company goals, better human resource management is a necessity, which includes paying attention to 
how employees are able to adapt with organizational culture. 
 
Previous studies mention that an understanding of organizational culture among employees is affecting their 
performance thus, it also aligns with company‚Äôs goal (Augustrianto et al., 2019; Balaji et al., 2020). A preliminary 
survey is held on employees of the state-owned bank, which yielded 57 percent of respondents perceive that 
organization culture is not relevant. Company‚Äôs cannot ignore these circumstances for the reason that they will affect 
the company‚Äôs performance. According to Robbins and Judge (2017), organizational culture can help performance 
because it creates an additional motivation for the employees. Mutual values and behaviors can create a comfortable 
situation in a work environment. Organizational culture is built as one of the strategies to motivate employees to 
achieve better performance. Thus, a good organizational culture will support the employees in exhibiting their best 
behavior at work and developing their abilities (Bakker & Schaufeli, 2008). Organizational culture normally represents 
employee‚Äôs cultivated behavior. Sometimes it appears in the form of an anagram to represent each value (Cameron & 
Quinn, 1999). The POLA PRIMA represents the values every employee of this state-owned bank comprises the value 
of optimum services wherein employee must perform with friendly and politely, innovation with perfection, being an 
exemplary employee, professional and responsible, integrity, and cooperation. However, based on the interview 
outcome, there are several values not executed properly. This situation will draw attention, especially to the 
corporation that demands the best from their employees to achieve organizational goals.

Discussion 
The percentage value of 83.50 percent as the descriptive result from respondents‚Äô responses to organizational culture 
is within good category. As a result of this variable, it can be concluded that the organizational culture employee 
state-owned bank is appropriately applied. The most significant percentage result was attained on the tenth statement 
item on the professionalism dimension, at 93.3 percent. This tenth statement item refers to the company‚Äôs emphasis 
on each employee‚Äôs competence. Meanwhile, the fourteenth statement item is the lowest within organizational 
culture, focusing on the dimension about the spirit to reach greatness has the lowest percentage value at 61.4 percent. 
This fourteenth statement item refers to the encouragement of all employees to have a passionate attitude toward 
work, which shows that employees are not as excited about the existing job. 
 
The percentage value of the descriptive result is 84.32 percent resulting from respondents‚Äô responses to employee 
performance is within very good category. The highest percentage value was found on the fourth statement item on 
the quantitative aspect dimension, at 87.1 percent. This fourth statement item refers to the maximum number of 
customers served in an hour of operation. This demonstrates that personnel can provide excellent service to 12 
consumers in a single hour of work. Meanwhile, the sixth statement item on the qualitative component dimension has 
the lowest percentage value at 80.7 percent. This sixth statement item refers to the quality of service offered by each 
employee to clients, yet the percentage achieved implies that the employee is always trying to maintain excellent 
service quality, despite the lowest percentage value presented. Hypothesis test shows that t-value (10.611) > t-table 
(1.67528) with a significance level of 0.000 < 0.05, which inferred that the organizational culture (X) affects 
significantly on employee performance (Y). 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion of the influence of organizational culture on employee performance at 
state-owned bank employees in Bandung area stated  as follows: 
 
a. 
Organizational Culture at state-owned bank employees is in a good category. 
b. Employee performance at state-owned bank employees is in a very good category. 
c. Based on the t-test results, organizational culture and work motivation significantly affect employee performance 
at state-owned bank employees.

Abstract 
 
This research aimed to determine job satisfaction among employees of the state-owned Social Security Labor 
Administration (BPJamsostek) in Jakarta, Indonesia. Primary and secondary data are gathered, and samples are drawn 
using Non-Probability Sampling. The sample for this study is 45 employees. Importance Performance Analysis is used 
to get a research conclusion. The study‚Äôs findings indicated that work satisfaction among employees did not meet 
employee expectations based on IPA analysis. A disparity between the two assessment viewpoints demonstrates a gap 
between expectation against reality. The overall performance of reality perceived value of 1.27, whilst the expectation 
indicator shows the value of 1.908. The difference between these two perspectives on assessment is within a negative 
value of -0.638. Compensation, career prospects, the work itself, and status become the primary indicators to consider.

1. Introduction 
The state-owned Social Security Labor Administration (BPJamsostek) is a public legal entity responsible for insurance 
and employment protection for all Indonesian labor. BPJamsostek recognizes that human resources are primary 
strength of an organization that every business institution must protect. In order to operate sustainably, insurance in 
the form of welfare, security, and protection for employees must be provided to increase customer sustainability 
(Kartawinata et al., 2020). Cascio (2015) explains that human resources are a critical factor because they encompass 
factors that influence an organization‚Äôs success or failure to achieve its goals. Thus, human resources should be 
managed effectively, which includes ensuring employee satisfaction. The transformation of PT Jamsostek (Persero) 
into BPJS (Social Security Labor Administration) for Employment will result in numerous changes to the company‚Äôs 
internal structure, organizational goals, work systems, and organizational culture, all of which will affect employees 
work performance. 
 
Employees must adjust their situation against this transformation (Al-Ali et al., 2017). The inability of the employees 
to adjust with changes can negatively impact an employee‚Äôs performance and job satisfaction (Bakker & Schaufeli, 
2008). Job satisfaction is a distinct issue that must be addressed, as it relates to individuals who perform work and has 
an effect on their productivity (Hoboubi et al., 2017). As a result, the business must pay attention to its employees‚Äô 
interests, including compensation, working conditions, work equipment support, and communication between 
superiors and subordinates. According to Dessler (2020), job satisfaction is an essential factor contributing to higher 
productivity and quality standards, the development of a more stable workforce, and the efficient use of human 
resources. Based on the recent observation within the company, there is an indication of unfulfilled employees 
satisfaction. Therefore a further exploration is necessary to examine any factors that contribute to dissatisfaction. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Job satisfaction is a term that refers to an individual‚Äôs feelings about their job, work situation, and relationships with 
coworkers. Thus, job satisfaction is critical for an employee to possess. It allows them to appreciate more about their 
work environment and ensure that their duties are completed properly and following company goals. According to 
Weikamp and G√∂ritz (2016), job satisfaction is an emotional state that affects how employees perceive their work as 
pleasant or unpleasant and reflects an individual‚Äôs attitude toward their job.

3538","According to the indicators‚Äô positions in each quadrant, it can be concluded that I4, I5,I6, and I9, which are located 
in the first quadrant, are indicators that do not meet employees‚Äô expectations. The indicator is considered to have a 
high level of importance but have a low level of performance, despite the indicators‚Äô high level of importance. The 
indicator in this quadrant requires intensive attention. The second quadrant contains I7 and I8. The indicator is 
considered to have a high level of significance and an already high level of performance. The indicator in this quadrant 
are already meet employee‚Äôs criteria and must be maintained. The third quadrant contains indicator I2, I10, and I12. 
The indicator is considered within low priority, and the performance is perceived within low category among 
employees. Finally, the fourth quadrant, which consists of  I1, I3, and I11 is considered as exaggerate, and it is not 
the primary focus of improvement, where the indicator has low level of importance, yet it has a high level of 
performance. The indicator perceived by the employees exceed their expectations and thus can be slightly ignored. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the research results, the descriptive value shows that the total score of reality is 57.75 percent, while the total 
score of expectation is 84.85 percent. The situation represents how BPJamsostek employees perceive job satisfaction. 
There is still a drawback, especially when the company‚Äôs achievement is considered typical. The awards only came 
as a felicitation or a simple awards charter, while employees expect more than that. 
The expectations from employees is considered as high level of importance. The gap analysis shows that achievement 
and recognition indicators are the largest gap in comparing reality and expectations value. Employees perceive that 
both indicator is still needed improvement. Thus, the company cannot ignore how they appreciate and acknowledge 
their employees, since the indicator is likely to represent employees' job satisfaction. 
The overall results show that employees expectation is not sufficient. A difference shows a gap between the two 
perspectives between the level of reality (performance) or the level of expectation (importance). The difference 
between these two perspectives is ‚Äì0.64. On the other hand, certain indicators that must be improved based on the IPA 
analysis comprise compensation attributes, career opportunities for advancement, the job itself, and employee status.

Introduction 
The XYZ convenience store in Bandung is a modern convenience company with Supermarket and Department 
Store formats. These establishments typically sell a variety of food items, beverages, and other daily necessities. 
Over 200 food products and other daily necessities are available at competitive prices, meeting the daily needs of 
consumers, particularly in West Java area. Employees play a critical role in modern convenience companies‚Äô 
profitability growth because convenience operates as marketing institutions, liaisons between producers and 
consumers, intermediaries, and image representatives (Rahmawaty et al., 2021; Kartawinata et al., 2020). Fakhri 
et al. (2021) describe that employee performance cannot be separated from the factors that affect an individual‚Äôs 
performance. Given the complexity of the issues, all parties involved must utilize available resources effectively 
and efficiently. Employees are holding a responsibility to use the company‚Äôs resources wisely, for this reason 
employee performance evaluation is essential to assess how employees advantageous company‚Äôs resources. 
 
Every six months, The XYZ convenience store in Bandung undergoes a performance evaluation. The performance 
assessment is classified into six categories based on the level of employee performance. According to employee 
performance appraisal data, employee performance has not yet reached the optimal level desired by the company. 
Many employees do not meet 100 percent of the targets and expectations set by the XYZ convenience store in 
Bandung, which means that the employees cannot complete every assigned task. The situation will impact 
organization performance, and the company must take precautions or be fully concerned with this situation since 
the employees play an important role in the company‚Äôs success. One of the circumstances that support 
organizational performance is how organizational culture is embedded inside employee‚Äôs behavior (Becker & 
Gerhart, 1996). There is a significant association between company‚Äôs performance and its organizational culture 
(Wilkins & Ouchi, 1983; Hartnell et al., 2011). The situation suggests that organizational culture can affect 
performance by allowing leaders to direct the employees in achieving company goals and facilitating them to 
discover the path to achieving organizational goals themselves (Abbas, 2017). 
 
A strong organizational culture encourages members to act and comply with the organization‚Äôs expectations. By 
adhering to the organization‚Äôs rules and policies, it is expected that employees‚Äô performance and productivity will 
be improved in line with organizational goals. Every company or organization displays an organizational culture 
as an outcome of the founders‚Äô or members‚Äô life experiences. They contribute to decision-making and the direction

The simple linear regression analysis equation in this study indicates that as organizational culture improves, 
employee performance improves as well. On the other hand, if the organizational culture diminish, it will impact 
employee performance as well. 
 
Hypothesis test (t-test) 
The t-statistical test basically shows how far the influence of one explanatory or independent variable individually 
in explaining the variation of the dependent variable. To determine the value of the t table, the degrees of freedom 
(db) must be sought first, then db = number of respondents - number of variables = 80 ‚Äì 2 = 78, and the level of 
significance (Œ±) = 5%, then obtained t table of 1,991. The statistical hypotheses of the t test describe inside table

the table 4, it shows that the correlation coefficient (R2) = 0.395. The coefficient of determination is obtained 
through the calculation of D = R2 x 100%, meaning D = 0.395 x 100% = 39.50%. Thus it can be concluded that 
employee performance is influenced by organizational culture by 39.50%, while the remaining 60.50% is 
influenced by other factors not examined in this study.

Introduction 
According to CNBC Indonesia, the culinary sector has a major contribution to Indonesia‚Äôs creative industry field. 
Based on articles from The People‚Äôs Mind, Bandung is a city that produces various culinary sectors that are 
distinctive and diverse. Therefore this city is crowned as one of the culinary tourist destinations in Indonesia. One 
of the culinary sectors in the city of Bandung that has long stood and can still maintain its existence to this day 
with its characteristics as a typical Sundanese restaurant is Rumah  Makan Ponyo. Rumah Makan Ponyo now has 
several branches in West Java, and is centered in Rumah Makan Ponyo Cinunuk Bandung. To support and develop 
its business,  Rumah  Makan Ponyo Cinunuk Bandung always pays attention to employee development, such as 
providing facilities needed by its employees. The type of attention from the company encourages to setting up 
human resource empowerment. The role of employees is very important in Rumah Makan  Ponyo  Cinunuk 
Bandung, thus the company needs to maintain its human resources.   Human resources in any organization, both 
public and business, are the main resources to achieve the organization‚Äôs goal (Dessler, 2020). Therefore, it is 
important for the employees to maintain excellent performance since it‚Äôs the primary concern for the organization 
(Choi, 2020). Employee performance results from an institution‚Äôs implementation of a planning process by 
employees and leaders who work in the institution, both private and government organizations, to achieve the set 
of goals (Fakhri et al., 2021). 
 
According to Amir (2015), in order to have high-quality human resources, employers must maximize employee 
empowerment by creating an environment in which employees feel valued. Employee empowerment combined 
with work ethics is expected to foster trust between managers and employees and between superiors and 
subordinates; employees will perform all tasks with a sense of responsibility and honesty, as its ethics guide them. 
Work ethic is a formulation of how ethical values are applied in the workplace to govern employees‚Äô merit in 
order to maximize efficiency and productivity (Moore, 2017). A business can use work ethics as a tool for social 
control and as guidelines for employee behavior in the workplace, allowing the business to be strong in arraigning 
the business competition. With the work ethic, employees are expected to strive for higher levels of performance 
and quality, ensuring that the company and its customers always receive the best services. According to the 
preceding description, a company can improve employee quality by providing and supervising a work ethic for 
its employees, where the work ethic is expected to be one of the factors affecting the company‚Äôs performance. 
 
Several interviews were conducted with the employees of the restaurants. Based on the interview results, some 
employees do not practice work ethics, such as wasting time with useless activity, gossiping rather than working, 
and postponing activity when it can be done immediately. The condition of multiple unnecessary activities tends 
to inflict a loss to the organization (Ferine et al., 2021; Pradana & Wijaksana., 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to 
conduct research to examine thoroughly how the work ethic can improve the quality of employees by providing

Conclusion 
The research result indicates that employees generally still demonstrate a lack of discipline when obeying rules 
and carrying out responsibilities. During employee meetings or briefings, the company must emphasize the 
importance of adhering to the company‚Äôs work rules. Later than, the company has to apply strict disciplinary 
measures for employees who are late or violate the company‚Äôs work rules. Moreover, the company needs to reward 
employees who demonstrate superior performance through bonuses or recognition for good performance, such as 
giving employee of the year award.

Abstract 
 
Based on the Monthly Socio-Economic Data Report for the Province of Bali in August 2021 by BPS, the number of 
international air transportation flights departing from I Gusti Ngurah Rai Airport in June 2021 was recorded as 21 
flight units. This figure is higher than the number of international flights in May 2021, which recorded 20 flights. The 
same condition and classified as worse can still be seen from comparing the record for the same month the previous 
year. On a year-on-year basis, the number of international aircraft departures decreased by 34.38 percent. Regarding 
the number of international flight passengers, no international flight passengers are departing overseas from Ngurah 
Rai International Airport. Compared year on year, the record number of passengers in June 2021 has decreased by 
almost 100 percent.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to describe the support provided by the Bali Provincial Government to increase tourism 
activities in the area. This study uses a descriptive qualitative approach, which is a qualitative study that 
aims to describe the problems discussed. The problem discussed is the support provided by the Bali 
Government to redevelop tourism activities which are constrained by the Covid 19 pandemic outbreak. 
The research data used include primary data and secondary data. Primary data was obtained through 
interviews and direct observations in the field, while secondary data was obtained from the 
documentation. The government has established five main programs to support tourism development in 
Bali after the pandemic. The five programs are Work From Bali (WFB), provision of grant funds for 
tourism recovery, providing relaxation to the tourism sector, travel bubble plan, strengthening the 
capacity of 3T (testing, tracing, and treatment), implementation of accelerated vaccination. Bali, which is 
heavily on the tourism sector, needs to open up other sectors that are still attached to Balinese society, 
such as agriculture, trade, and fishing. The community is given the understanding to slowly return to 
opening up business opportunities in other sectors so that the economy does not continue to experience 
long-term problems. However, this does not necessarily leave the tourism sector. This is the right time to 
improve yourself in the provision of knowledge, add skills and education to continuously yourself so that 
later it will be ready when the tourism sector is open and normal again.

1. Introduction 
Bali was named the first best destination in the world-beating London according to the 2021 Travelers' Choice 
Awards and one of the top tourism wish lists in 2020. It gives confidence that the existence of Bali in the world of 
tourism has received international recognition. Bali tourism has grown and developed in such a way as to make a 
major contribution to the development of the area and the Balinese people, either directly or indirectly (Purwahita et 
al. 2021).

3555","support the recovery of the tourism economic sector in Bali. Work From Bali (WFB) is a program from the 
government that is expected to invite people to work from Bali, especially in the Nusa Dua area, and help the 
tourism sector affected by the pandemic (Firdaus 2021). The next program is the provision of grant funds for 
tourism recovery because many districts or cities in Bali have been affected by the pandemic. The government 
provides relaxation to the tourism sector so that it does not get worse due to the impact of the pandemic. Another 
program is the travel bubble plan which includes Bali, Bintan, and Batam. A travel bubble is when two or more 
countries that have successfully controlled the coronavirus agree to create a bubble or travel corridor. This bubble 
will make it easier for residents who live in it to travel freely and avoid the obligation of self-quarantine. Currently, 
the government is finalizing the application of the travel bubble in the three regions, provided that the rate of 
positive cases, active cases, and hospital capacity are in a safe condition for easing public activities. In the process of 
implementing the travel bubble, the government will set certain conditions for foreign tourists entering Indonesia. In 
addition, the government will strengthen the capacity of 3T (testing, tracing, and treatment) as well as the 
implementation of accelerated vaccination. The first dose of vaccination in Bali has so far reached more than 1.5 
million people and the second dose of vaccination has reached more than 676 thousand people from the total target 
of achieving 70 per cent group immunity of 3 million people in Bali (Jagaddhita 2021). 
 
4. Conclusion 
This study aims to determine the support provided by the government to increase tourism activities on the island of 
Bali. The current condition of Bali is the worst in the history of tourism in Bali. The tourism sector and almost all 
sectors related to the tourism industry were significantly affected. The affected sectors are travel agencies, hotels, 
restaurants, souvenirs center stores, transportation (land, sea, and air), and tourism employees. The government has 
also given an appealed to the tourism industry players to implement seven strategies in the current pandemic 
conditions, such as high standard sanitation, high standard security, staycation, niche tourism, solo travel tour, 
wellness tour, and virtual tourism. The government has established five main programs to support tourism 
development in Bali after the pandemic. The five programs are Work From Bali (WFB), provision of grant funds for 
tourism recovery, providing relaxation to the tourism sector, travel bubble plan, strengthening the capacity of 3T 
(testing, tracing, and treatment), implementation of accelerated vaccination. The recovery of Bali tourism includes 3 
stages consisting of 6 main strategies or quick wins that must be immediately implemented by all stakeholders in the 
effort to restore the Bali economy involved, such preparation stage, transition stage, and recovery stages. 
Bali, which is heavily on the tourism sector, needs to open up other sectors that are still attached to Balinese society, 
such as agriculture, trade, and fishing. The community is given the understanding to slowly return to opening up 
business opportunities in other sectors so that the economy does not continue to experience long-term problems. 
However, this does not necessarily leave the tourism sector. This is the right time to improve yourself in the 
provision of knowledge, add skills and education to continuously yourself so that later it will be ready when the 
tourism sector is open and normal again. The social sector is closely related to continuing to apply health protocols 
according to government recommendations; changing life habits to be healthier, cleaner, and stay active. 
Furthermore, the environmental sector emphasizes the community, tourists, and tourism actors to increase awareness 
of maintaining and preserving nature, so that it can be utilized, not only for now but also in the future.

Abstract 
 
Osteoporosis often called ‚Äúsilent diseases‚Äù of aging because bone loss occurs without symptoms, untuil 
microarchitectural deterioration and bone fractures occurs. The common therapy to prevent the estrogen 
degrading condition is Hormon Replacement Therapy (HRT). However, HRT possessed various risks. Recent 
studies suggest the phytoestrogens may exert a protective effect against osteoporosis. This study examined 
whether treatment with phytoestrogen extract from Pandanus odoratissimus seed (PS) exerted a preventive 
effect on estrogen deficiency induced osteoporosis. Three months old female Sprague Dawley rats were 
randomly assigned into either a sham operated group or one of five variectomy (OVX) groups, Negative control, 
positive control (with Allendronate) and OVX with PS extract. Rats began receiving treatment 20 days after the 
OVX and receiving treatment for 28 days after OVX. The results showed that PS (900mg/kb bw) treatment 
prevented decrease in trabecular density while also preventing an increase in trabecular separation and PS 900 
mg/kg bw had the smallest proportion of osteoclast to osteoblast, compare to other treatment. The result of this 
study demonstrated that the potential effects of Pandanus odoratissimus seed extract (PS 900mg/kg bw) as 
herbal drug. Therefore it is suggested that Pandanus odoratissimus seed extract might be a potential alternative 
therapy for treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.

1. Introduction 
Osteoporosis often called ‚Äúsilent diseases‚Äù of aging because bone loss occurs without symptoms, until 
microarchitectural deterioration and bone fractures occurs (Deyhim et al, 2006). Osteoporosis is defined by the 
World Health Organization (WHO) as a ‚Äòprogressive systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass 
and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and 
susceptibility to fracture‚Äô (Liu et al. 2019). Osteoporosis affects 200 million women worldwide, and the 
probability of women over 50 affected by an osteoporotic fracture has been estimated to approach one third 
(Kanis, 2007). It threatens the health of middle-aged and the aged, especially postmenopausal women (Brown, 
2017). Approximately half women over the age of 50 years are expected to suffer an osteoporosis -related 
fracture over their remaining lifetime (Xu et al 2016).  
 
Post menopausal women are at high risk of developing osteoporosis because of the significant alterations in 
bone metabolism associated with estrogen deficiency (Andersen and  Kristensen 2015). The rapid loss and 
higher bone fragility that take place during menopause lead to an increased incidence of spine, hip and wrist 
fractures in post menopausal women (Wang et al 2014). People who suffer from osteoporosis commonly 
encounter fragility fracture thus create a tremendous burden on the society. 
 
Osteoporosis frequently occurs in the elderly and in menopausal woman, and the most wildly used anti-
osteoporosis drugs are anti-resorptive bisphosphonates that inhibit the activity of osteoclasts. The current 
treatments for osteoporosis include anti-absorption therapy, such as bisphosphonate, calcitonin, and selective 
estrogen receptor modulator (Jones et al. 2005). But these medications for long-term use cause severe adverse 
effects like hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, musculoskeletal pain, osteonecrosis of the jaw, breast tenderness, 
thromboembolic events, and increased risk of endometrial and breast cancer. These adverse effects of anti-
resorptive drugs warrant development of anabolic agents to treat osteoporosis. Unlike anti-resorptive agents,

mg/kg b.w) and medium dose (600 mg/kg b.w) were significantly lower than in positive control, sham and high 
dose (900 mg/kg b.w). Ovariectomized rats also had higher separation compared to other rats (Figure 2). Studies 
have shown that the withdrawal of estrogen following ovariectomy induce perforation in trabecular plates and 
loss of connectivity density which results in the deterioration of trabecular bone micro-architecture (Aslam et al, 
2010). In this study, treatment of the OVX rats with high dose (900 mg/kg b.w) POE group significantly 
increased the trabeculae density (p<0.05). However, no statistically significant difference was observed among 
positive control, sham and POE high dose (900 mg/kg b.w) regarding the trabeculae density. The increase dose 
of POE extract was followed by an increase in trabecular density, so it can be concluded that the administration 
of the extract affects the density of trabeculae in ovariectomized rats.  
 
Bone mass is normal bone tissue is generally maintaned by a dynamic balanced between osteoclast bone 
resorption and osteoblast bone formation.The maintenance of bone mass depends on the dynamic balance 
between osteoblast osteogenesis and osteoclast bone resorption (Kim et al. 2018). The results of current study 
showed that 4 weeks treatment with POE supported the previous study in which it would undergo the cell 
changes of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in rat mandibular bone Sprague Dawley, in addition, it is influenced by 
the content of the Pandanus odoratissimus seed  methanol extract, which is reported in previous studies that the 
flavonoids compounds have a positive effect on the bones with a stimulating effect on the activity of osteoblasts 
through estrogen- mediated action (Yao et al, 2008). The current study demonstrated that  treatment of the OVX 
rats with high dose (900 mg/kg b.w) POE group decreased the proportion of osteoclasts to the number of 
osteoblasts.  
 
Previous studies also showed that estrogen deficiency-induced oxidative stress with reduced antioxidase levels 
and activity in mouse bone tissue, and impaired osteogenesis and osteoblastic bone formation. The antioxidant 
NAC administration resulted in intense improvement in osteogenesis and osteoblastic bone formation in OVX 
mice (Shi et al. 2015) Current study confirmed that estrogen deficiency could induce oxidative stress and 
reduced antioxidase levels and activity, whereas POE supplement could reduce oxidative stress by increasing 
antioxidase levels and activity in OVX mice. Results from previous and this recent study, therefore, support that 
in vivo, estrogen plays a role to stimulate the osteoblastic bone formation and inhibit the osteoclastic bone 
resorption, at least partially through defense against oxidative stress.  
 
Antioxidant rich plant, such as Pandanus odoratissimus may represent a possible approach for slowing down 
age-related bone mass reduction and enhancing bone remodeling. Rahayu et al (2020) showed that POE has 
higher antioxidant capcity than ascorbic acid. This correspondence to the higher amount of polyphenols in POE. 
Phenolic compounds are found to be associated with many health benefit (Parr and Bolwell 2000). They exhibit 
a wide range of physiological properties such as anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, antimicrobial 
and antiviral (Adkar and Bhaskar 2014).  
 
To the best of our knowledge, we are the fisrt to report the ability of POE in preventing osteopenia in 
postmenopausal osteoporosis rat model. The beneficial effect of POE on bone microarchitecture may be due to 
its antioxidant property. We propose that the antioxidant activity in POE prevented the free-radical-induced 
bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency. However, considering the result of this current study, future 
tresearch should focus on isolated or mixture of active constituents to determine the mechanisms underlying the 
bone effect and to reveal the beneficial therapeutic and safety properties of its phytochemicals, as a 
complementary and alternative medicine for management osteoporosis.  
 
5. Conclusions 
To sum up, oxidative stress may promote the development of osteoporosis, and antioxidants such as Pandanus 
odoratissimus seed extract can mitigate the progress of osteoporosis. Nevertheless, we made this conclusion 
based on the rat model of osteoporosis and Pandanus odoratissimus seed extract should be evaluated for adverse 
as well as beneficial effects in clinical trials. In addition, the specific mechanism of oxidative stress in 
osteoporosis should be further investigated.

Abstract 
 
Sea cucumbers are one of the marine resources that have been exploited on the coast of Saleh Bay, Sumbawa,. 
Although they have been exploited for a long time, it is not yet known species of sea cucumbers are caught by 
fishermen. Information about the species of sea cucumbers is necessary to fisheries management. The purpose of 
this study was to determine the species of sea cucumbers caught in Saleh Bay. This research uses survey method. 
Information on the species of sea cucumbers caught by fishermen was obtained by conducting interviews with 
fishermen and observing the sea cucumbers caught. The harvested sea cucumbers are then identified to determine 
the species. The results showed that there were 22 species of sea cucumbers, namely White teatfish (H. fuscogilva), 
Black teatfish (H. whitmaei), Prickly redfish (T. ananas), Stonefish (A. lecanora), Deepwater redfish (A. echinites), 
Hairy blackfish (A. miliaris), Panning's blackfish (A. palauensis), Surf redfish (A. mauritiana), Elephant trunkfish 
(H. fuscopunctata), Leopardfish/Tigerfish (B. argus), Brown sandfish (B. vitiensis), Curryfish (S . herrmanni), 
Greenfish (S. chloronotus), Amberfish (T. anax), Chalkfish (B. marmorata), Snakefish (H. coluber), Sandfish 
(Holothuria scabra), Lollyfish (H. atra), Golden sandfish (H. lessoni), Selenka's dragonfish (S. horrens), Flowerfish 
(Pearsonothuria graeffei) and Pinkfish (H. edulis).

1. Introduction  
Sea cucumbers are harvested and traded in more than 70 countries worldwide. The use of sea cucumbers as a food 
item and a commodity began in China about 1,000 years ago, which encouraged the development of capture 
fisheries in the region. However, the rising demand of the markets in Asia led to the depletion of local sea cucumber 
populations and prompted Asian traders to solicit sea cucumbers from locations further afield (Conand, 2004; S. 
Purcell et al., 2010; Toral-Granda, 2008) 
Commercially-exploited sea cucumbers, all from the Orders Aspidochirotida and Dendrochirotida, provide a source 
of income to millions of coastal fishers worldwide (Purcell et al., 2013) and a source of nutrition to perhaps more 
than 1 billion Asian consumers. In Asia, sea cucumbers that are commonly fished are derived mainly from the Order 
Aspidochirotida under two families, Holothuriidae and Stichopodidae. Sea cucumbers belong to the class 
Holothuroidea and so are also referred to as holothurians. The majority of species harvested commercially belong to 
the order Aspidochirotida, specifically to the families Holothuriidae and Stichopodidae, and are mostly tropical. A 
few species belonging to the order Dendrochirotida, family Cucumariidae, are also fished commercially. Currently, 
sea cucumber fishing occurs all over the world with some populations reportedly over-harvested (Lovatelli et al., 
2004; Toral-Granda, 2008; Tuwo, 2004). 
Statistics on trepang exported are not separated into individual species, and therefore details on production status 
and landing trends on individual species are not available. This has been identified as a bottleneck when attempting 
to implement conservation tools in the international trade (e.g. a CITES listing) and has led to the development of 
illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) trade.  
Indonesia is one of the largest exporter sea cucumber in the world. Commercial species are usually given local 
names by the fishers, and sometimes, different trepang species are given the same local name, adding to the 
taxonomic confusion (Purwati et al., 2010).  Sumbawa is one of region in Indonesia that have sea cucumbers

The sea cucumber species found in this study were almost the same as those found in other Asian countries. In Asia, 
sea cucumbers that are commonly fished are derived mainly from the Order Aspidochirotida under two families, 
Holothuriidae and Stichopodidae. Genuses that are frequently exploited for food include Holothuria, Actinopyga and 
Bohadschia. The sea cucumber fishery in Indonesia is generally artisanal, and is scattered throughout the many 
Indonesian islands including Lampung, Java, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, Maluku and Irian Jaya (Tuwo & Conad, 
1992).  
Species found in the present study is similar to the species recorded by some authors (Natan et al., 2015; Yusron, 
2004). According to Bussarawit and Thongtham (1999), H. scabra, H. leucospilota, H. edulis, B. marmorata, T. 
ananas, S. chloronotus and S. herrmanni were collected commercially by fishermen in Rayong and Chon Buri in 
eastern Thailand. Species heavily exploited in Indonesia include: A. echinites, A. mauritiana, A. miliaris, B. argus, 
B. vitiensis, H. atra, H. edulis, H. fuscogilva, H. fuscopunctata, H. whitmaei, H. scabra, H. scabra var. versicolor, 
H. coluber, S. chloronotus, S. herrmanni, T. ananas and T. anax (Tuwo, 2004). (Purwati et al., 2010) successfully 
identified 18 species of trepang fished in Karimunjawa. (Setyastuti & Purwati, 2015), showed 21 species trepang 
from Situbondo, Jawa and Sulawesi.   
H. scabra is one of many species of sea cucumbers harvested by fishermens in Saleh Bay. Holothuria scabra 
(common name: sandfish) is largely distributed and probably supports most of the tropical captures of sea 
cucumbers for beche-de-mer. Holothuria scabra, commonly known as sandfish, is widely distributed throughout the 
Indo‚ÄìPacific, being found roughly between latitudes 30 oN and 30 oS (Hamel et al., 2001). Holothuria scabra var. 
versicolor (common name: golden sandfish) differs from H. scabra by a number of characters, including a larger 
mean size and a deeper habitat in New Caledonia (Conand, 2004, 1998, 1989). B. vitiensis lives in rather dense 
populations in shallow back reef areas, where the individuals burrow into the anaerobic sand during the night and 
emerge at the surface of the oxygenated sand in the morning around 10 A.M.  
Coastal processes are also important factors in regulating the distribution of sea cucumber species, as hydro-
dynamics influence sediment granulometry, which is a key habitat characteristic for defining the niches of 
holothurians, and larval dispersion (Massin and Doumen, 1986). 
 
5. Conclusion  
The results showed that there were 22 species of sea cucumbers, namely White teatfish (H. fuscogilva), Black 
teatfish (H. whitmaei), Prickly redfish (T. ananas), Stonefish (A. lecanora), Deepwater redfish (A. echinites), Hairy 
blackfish (A. miliaris), Panning's blackfish (A. palauensis), Surf redfish (A. mauritiana), Elephant trunkfish (H. 
fuscopunctata), Leopardfish/Tigerfish (B. argus), Brown sandfish (B. vitiensis), Curryfish (S . herrmanni), Greenfish 
(S. chloronotus), Amberfish (T. anax), Chalkfish (B. marmorata), Snakefish (H. coluber), Sandfish (Holothuria 
scabra), Lollyfish (H. atra), Golden sandfish (H. lessoni), Selenka's dragonfish (S. horrens), Flowerfish 
(Pearsonothuria graeffei) and Pinkfish (H. edulis).

Abstract 
 
Marine sponges-associated bacteria are among the wealthiest sources of pharmacologically active chemicals from 
marine organisms. Many species of endosymbiont bacteria isolated from marine sponges had been studied and 
showed significant bioactivity. Indonesia is very rich in marine sponges. However, only a limited number of studies 
have been conducted to reveal endosymbiont bacteria for their medicinal potential. This study aims to determine the 
antimicrobial potential of endosymbiont bacteria isolated from sponges collected from Kotok Kecil Island, Jakarta. 
The antimicrobial was carried out by qualitative test using the modified GIBEX method and the Kirby-Bauer disc 
diffusion method. The results showed that from 15 isolates of endosymbiont bacteria were obtained, and four 
isolates showed strong antimicrobial activity, each isolated from Petrosia sp., Petrosia nigricans, Dasychalina sp., 
and Cinachyrella australiensis. The fermented filtrate of isolates in Nutrient Broth media showed more potent 
antimicrobial activity than ethyl acetate extract. The largest average inhibition zone against Candida albicans, 
Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus mutans were 19.2 mm, 11.8 mm, and 9.1 mm, respectively. Based on the 
results, it can be concluded that endosymbiont bacteria isolated from marine sponges collected from Kotok Kecil 
Island has great potency to be further developed as a source of new antimicrobial compounds.

1. Introduction 
Infectious diseases are one of the biggest causes of death in the world. Three million deaths were caused by 
respiratory infections, including 1.4 million deaths from diarrhea, 1.3 million deaths from tuberculosis, and deaths 
from HIV/AIDS reached 1 million people (WHO, 2016). The use of antibiotics is a powerful way to treat these 
infectious diseases. However, the irrational use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, which 
is currently one of the most serious global public health threats (WHO, 2014).  
 
WHO surveyed 52 countries through the Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System (GLASS) and revealed an 
increase in resistance to antibiotics. Resistance to penicillin to treat pneumonia ranges from 0%-51%, while 
resistance to ciprofloxacin from Escherichia coli bacteria associated with urinary tract infections ranges from 8%-
65% (WHO, 2018). This fact explains the need to discover new antimicrobial compounds, including those derived 
from natural ingredients. 
 
Biodiversity that is commonly explored is from land areas, while marine areas have not been explored optimally. 
Indonesia has 75% of the territorial waters located at the intersection of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean 
(Hanim dan Noorman, 2017). This shows the rich potential of Indonesia's marine resources that can be managed and 
utilized for the nation's future, one of which is sponges. Sponges are multicellular animals of the phylum Porifera. 
They do not have organs and tissues but have pores in their bodies (ostia) and water circulation channels in the 
central cavity (osculum) (Thomas et al., 2016). Sponges live attached to the substrate of rocks, corals, and sand

3574","acetate extract isolate had the potential to inhibit the activity of fungi. These two extracts, the NB filtrate and the 
ethyl acetate extract, were generally able to inhibit the growth of C. albicans. According to Pita et al. (2016), 
bioactive compounds, especially secondary metabolites of sponge microbes, provide sponge defense against 
predators. 
 
4.5 Biochemical Characterization of Potential Endosymbiont Bacteria 
Based on the table of results of the biochemical characterization of bacteria (Table 5), it is known that isolate 1K1 
can ferment maltose, mannitol, and saccharose. Endosymbiont bacteria isolates 2K2 and 3K1 were able to ferment 
glucose, maltose, mannitol, and saccharose. Other biochemical reactions tested, such as the methyl red reaction, 
Voges-Proskauer, and citrate, 2K2 showed positive results. This proves that the 2K2 isolate produces an organic 
acid end product to form acetyl methyl carbinol and uses citric acid as a carbon source in the medium. The 5K2 
endosymbiont bacterial isolate, could only ferment saccharose and the TSIA test produced a red color in the slant 
and butt sections, which indicated that the isolate could not ferment all sugars.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the research results, the following conclusions were obtained from 5 samples of sponges collected from 
the waters around Kotok Kecil Island, Seribu Islands, DKI Jakarta, 15 isolates of endosymbiont bacteria were 
obtained. There are 4 isolates of endosymbiont bacteria that are potential sources of antimicrobial compounds: the 
sponge Petrosia sp. (1 isolate), Petrosia nigricans (1 isolate), Cinachyrella australiensis (1 isolate), and 
Dasychalina sp. (1 isolate). The largest average inhibition zone of endosymbiont bacterial NB filtrate on C. albicans 
was 19.2 mm (1K1 isolate) and 14.2 mm (5K2 isolate), on E. coli of 11.8 mm (5K2 isolate), on S. mutans by 9.1 mm 
(3K1 isolate), and 8.1 mm (2K2 isolate). The largest average inhibition zones of endosymbiont bacterial ethyl 
acetate extract on C. albicans were 9.2 mm (3K1 isolate), 8.3 mm (1K1 isolate), and 8.1 mm (2K2 isolate).

Abstract 
The development of WSN is getting advanced according to the needs of IoT. the amount of data flow in the 
system will be greater. This massive WSN requires a backbone transmission that has low latency and large 
bandwidth. Fiber optics is one solution for it. This paper proposes the Hybrid WSN using ZigBee and Fiber 
Optic system and discusses its performance evaluation and characteristics. To obtain information related to 
system evaluation, system testing is carried out by observing the performance of data transmission. The 
main system design consists of two ZigBee routers, one ZigBee gateway, two E/O media, FO cable, and a 
computer as a display monitor. Data retrieval is done by sending text data and sensor data with 1000ms in 
intervals per-each package data. The indicators analyzed for evaluation are throughput, interval delay per 
meter, package loss, and error. Data results are also compared with the commonly ZigBee to the WiFi 
system. The results were obtained from testing the throughput, interval delay per meter, and package loss 
and error. Based on the results, it can be concluded that a ZigBee-FO hybrid system is implemented, and 
results better performance in lower latency, and higher throughput than commonly WSN-WiFi systems. 
 
Keywords: Massive WSN, ZigBee over Fiber, Throughput, Interval Delay, Package loss and error. 
 
1. Introduction 
Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology is widely implemented for monitoring or controlling system. There are 
many examples of the implementation, such as water or air quality monitoring (Arya, Tri F. Faiqurahman, Mahar. 
Azhar, 2018), smart farming, smart city, etc. There are many challenges in building the WSN system (Akbar & 
Hambali, 2018; Khanh et al., 2017; Patel et al., 2016; Prihtiadi & Djamal, 2017). Facing the era of industry 4.0, wide 
applications of monitoring or controlling will be built, which will implement more sensors or nodes. For a ZigBee-
based WSN, the number of nodes that can be built in more than 1000 nodes interconnected together (Djedouboum et 
al., 2018). Therefore, the flow of the data network and capacity is raised, especially in the central system or sink node 
which will be entering the backbone network to the monitoring center. 
 
There are many kinds of system designs for such WSN applications. Usually, WSN is interconnected with the Internet 
of Things (IoT) technology so the data will be stored in the cloud and through the internet (Djedouboum et al., 2018). 
The backbone that connects between the sink node to the gateway can use many various options. Commonly, WiFi is 
used (Doherty et al., 2013) because of its high bandwidth and flexibility. However, WiFi since it is wireless, the 
connection may be disturbed by the environment, obstacles, or when the bandwidth reaches its maximum capacity.  
 
For massive WSN, with more sensor or high capacity data, it requires the backbone which has high bandwidth and 
also low latency, especially for real-time monitoring applications. Besides WiFi, optical fiber transmission can be 
used as an alternative to transmitting the data from the sink node to the monitoring center. The hybrid WSN can be 
implemented using a media converter from E/O and the opposite. The protocol, data conversion, and signal processing 
are needed to be configured for this kind of hybrid system. the performance of the WSN hybrid system also needs to 
be analyzed. This paper evaluates the performance of the WSN Hybrid ZigBee-FO. The performance observed are 
the throughput, interval delay per meter representing the system latency, and package loss and error.

3586","throughput and delay per meter value shown in figure 7, figure 8, and figure 9, and also has a good result for all of the 
tested data types. Data is successfully sent through the system proven by the 0% value of package loss and error.  
 
Discussion 1, The comparison between ZigBee-FO performance and ZigBee-WiFi performance is proofed has the 
same characteristic as the hypothesis scenario.  Proof of the state is conducted from the comparison between ZigBee-
FO and ZigBee-WiFi throughput and time transfer performance. The FO flows data is faster and with a bigger 
throughput than when the transmission uses WiFi. Proven with FO Throughput value is 105,5 to 731,7 Bytes/s (for 
100B to 900B text console) and 10,9 to 54,1 data/s (for 2 to 10 data sensor). FO Interval delay per meter value is 2,7 
to 80, 8 second (for 100B to 900B text console) and -4,1 to -47,1 second (for 2 to 10 data sensor). WiFi Throughput 
value is 107,1 to 715,3 Bytes/s (for 100B to 900B text console) and 10,8 to 52,2 Bytes/s (for 2 to 10 data sensor). 
WiFi Interval delay per meter value is 3 to 401 second (for 100B to 900B text console) and -16,7 to 70,7 second 
unstably (for 2 to 10 data sensor).  
 
From this result, can be concluded that the ZigBee-FO system can be implemented and have better performance 
(higher throughput and lower delay). 
 
Discussion 2, For comparison results between data types (text console and sensor reading), performance between it is 
shown in figure 7, and figure 8. Those diagrams in figures 7 and 8 show the result of the same characteristics. The 
characteristic result is that FO has better performance and a more stable escalation value. For better throughput, it is 
because FO does have a higher transmission bandwidth. For more stable escalation, it is because FO does not interfere 
with electromagnetics as WiFi does.  
 
As mentioned before, text console data is used as a representation of massive nodes of data, which means that this 
system design is compatible with massive nodes data. Have mentioned also that sensor reading data is used as a 
representation of an actual implementation of WSN. Since sensor reading data shows the same characteristics, it is 
proof that this system can be actually implemented as it used. From these two statements, it can be concluded that the 
ZigBee-FO system is actually can be implemented for massive nodes of WSN use. 
 
From discussion 1 and discussion 2, it can be concluded that this system is can be actually implemented and does have 
higher throughput and faster transmission. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research Direction 
Based on the results and analysis, it concludes that the Hybrid system ZigBee-FO is designed and implemented for 
the WSN system, with the performance result as: 
‚Ä¢ 
System is can be actually implemented and does have higher throughput and faster transmission. 
‚Ä¢ 
System can transmit and receive data successfully, with 0% package loss and error. Hybrid ZigBee-FO WSN 
system also shows better throughput and transmission speed compared with WiFi-based WSN system. The FO 
system throughput is up to 731.7 Byte/s while WiFi system throughput is up to 715.3 Byte/s. 
‚Ä¢ 
Throughput value is increased correspond with the number of data rate (for 100B to 900B text console, get a 
105,5 to 731,7 Bytes/s throughput and for 2 to 10 data sensor, get a 10,9 to 54,1 Byte/s). Interval delay parameter 
is also increased with the number of data rate (for 100B to 900B text console, get a 2,7 to 80, 8-second delay and 
for 2 to 10 data sensor, get a -4,1 to -47,1 second). 
‚Ä¢ 
The interval delay per meter performance for FO-based system is lower; -4,1s; -8,7s; and -47,1s, while the interval 
delay per meter for WiFi-based system is -16,7s; -16,7s; and 70,7s. 
‚Ä¢ 
In summary, the performance of Hybrid FO-ZigBee WSN is, for throughput value is 105,5 to 731,7 Bytes/s (for 
100B to 900B) and 10,9 to 54,1 Byte/s (for 2 to 10 data sensor), interval delay per meter is 2,7 to 80, 8 second

Abstract  
 
Dates were fruits have many nutrients including minerals, vitamins and active compounds as antioxidants. Bilimbi 
contains vitamin C, minerals, amino acid. Dates were usually consumed directly without any processing, bilimbi 
could not be because the taste was too sour. The purpose of this research was to utilize dates juice and bilimbi juice 
in making effervescent tablets. The combination of dates and bilimbi will make the sour taste of bilimbi diminish 
because the sweetness of the dates which were natural sweetener. Making effervescent tablets began with making 
juices from dates and bilimbi fruits and then making juices powder by freeze drying method without addition of 
sugar. The ratio of dates:bilimbi juice powder were 9:1, 8:2, and 7:3 and sodium bicarbonate:citric acid: 1:1, 2:1 and 
1:2. Effervescent tablet drinks were analyzed of its antioxidant activity (IC50), hedonic, physicochemical analysis 
(pH, color, total titratable acid, total soluble solid). The best formulation was the ratio of dates:bilimbi juice powder 
9:1 and sodium bicarbonate:citric acid 2:1 has IC50 6.79%, phenolic 19.47 mg GAE /L, flavonoids 10.17 mg QE /L. 
The average overall hedonic results was 4.6 (scale of 1-7). Dates and bilimbi can be used as diversification of 
healthy food products in form effervescent tablets.

1. Introduction  
Dates (Phoenix dactylifera L.) were fruits that widely grown in the Middle East. Dates could grow in Asian such as 
Indonesia (Rahmadani, 2017). Dates contained 20-70% (dry basis) of simple sugars so they were easily digested and 
absorbed by the body (Retnowati and Kusnadi, 2014). Dates fruit also contains many active compounds that act as 
antioxidants like flavonoids, phenolic, vitamins and other active compounds (Onuh et al.,2012) and usually were 
consumed directly without any processing. Bilimbi (Averrhoa bilimbi Linn.) was one of the Averrhoa family species 
that was widely grown in Indonesia.  Bilimbi fruit contained various minerals such as sodium, potassium, calcium, 
phosphorus, magnesium and vitamin C 24.87 mg /100 g (Dewi et al., 2014; Bhaskar and Shantaram, 2013).  Bilimbi 
has a high moisture content 95.62% which caused a relatively short shelf life and also has a very sour taste that 
cannot be consumed directly (Muzaifa, 2018). Freeze drying was one of the drying methods that aims to protect 
sensitive compounds. The principle of a freeze drying was applied a sublimation phenomenon wherein the water in 
frozen material turns into steam without the melting process of material (Zea , et al., 2013). Effervescent tablet was a 
tablet which was made by compresses the active ingredient in the form of acid and bases source. If tablet was put 
into water, then there was a chemical reaction between the source of acid and base which will produce gas in the 
form of carbon dioxide which gives the effect of freshness because it produces carbonation so that it is favored by 
society (Deasy,2003). The utilization of dates juice and bilimbi juice into effervescent tablets was one of the 
diversification of food products. The combination of dates juice in bilimbi juice will make the sour taste of bilimbi 
can be reduced by the sweet taste of dates which will become a natural sweetener, so that it does not require the 
addition of sugar in making effervescent tablets.  
 
1.1 Objectives  
The objectives of this research is to utilize two kinds of fruits, dates in the form of dates juice and juice from bilimbi 
fruits in making effervescent tablets as the healthy drinks. This diversification of food product can extend the shelf 
life of the fruits especially bilimbi fruits.

6. Conclusion  
Making effervescent tablets from dates and bilimbi fruits  is a form of food diversification. Dates in effervescent 
tablets reduced the sour taste in bilimbi with sweet taste in dates which acts as a natural sweetener, so it did not 
require the addition of sugar in making effervescent tablets. The effervescent tablet drinks with a ratio of dates

Abstract 
 
Citeko village is a potential carrot-producing village in Cisarua, this village has been able to produce seeds of local 
types that have good quality with the characteristics of red carrot color, not branching, straighter, and more 
extended. Processing carrots into syrup has a bright prospect because the taste is unique and the appearance of the 
natural color of carrots is beautiful. The business of processing carrots into fruit juice syrup has long been carried 
out. However, this business has not developed because the technology used is still simple and marketing is limited. 
In addition, the carrot and tomato juice syrup produced is not standard with low quality and is not stable 
continuously. This study aims to find the right formula for carrot and tomato juice syrup with a sugar concentration 
that suits consumers' desires. The best formula will be analyzed for quality standard parameters of carrot and tomato 
juice syrup on water content, carbohydrate content, vitamin A content, vitamin E content, and vitamin C content, 
fiber content, and total dissolved solids. These results are expected to be disseminated to the carrot syrup business 
group to improve the quality of the products produced to increase the added value of the product.

1. Introduction  
Carrots (Daucus carrota L) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are vegetables with the nickname of perfectly 
nutritious healthy intake, having a texture with the main content of water and carbohydrates (Febrihantana. 2014). 
Carrots and tomatoes are included in foods with a low glycemic index and do not cause blood sugar to spike. 
Vegetables are a very potential contributor of vitamin A to maintain eye health. Besides that, the antioxidant content 
functions as an antidote to cancer-causing free radicals. Consuming carrots regularly can increase immunity, lower 
cholesterol levels, and prevent cancer risk (Kumalaningsih. 2006). 
 
Carrots and tomatoes are easily damaged vegetables, only able to last a few days if the storage is not good, then 
spoilage will occur. Vegetables with high water content are susceptible to fungus, which causes accelerated decay. 
At certain times there is over-production which results in a decrease in prices so that farmers suffer losses because 
they cannot cover production costs. Efforts to reduce farmers' losses in Citeko Village have made innovations in 
processing carrots into several types of products, lunkhead, crackers, and syrup. Processing carrots into syrup is an 
alternative product form from carrots that has a longer shelf life. 
 
Carrots and tomatoes have similarities and differences in terms of the dominant phytochemical content. Tomatoes 
are rich in alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, and lycophene, suitable for anticancer, while carrots are high in fiber, 
carotenoids, anthocyanins, and a unique combination of three flavonoids. The mixture of tomatoes and carrots that 
will be used as raw materials for fruit juice syrup provides a complementary effect so that the benefits for the body 
will be better. It is hoped that this carrot and tomato juice syrup will give the benefits of carrots and tomatoes with a 
delicious taste and practical help, where This fruit juice syrup will be processed from fresh and original fruit without 
the use of preservatives and artificial sweeteners.

3608","of sugar due to the addition of sugar in high concentrations, namely 60% and 65%. Fitriyono (2010) states that 
sucrose is a chemical compound with a sweet taste, white color, and soluble in water. 
 
The total preference for carrot and tomato syrup showed no interaction effect between fruit juice and sugar 
concentration ratio to the total preference for carrot syrup with the addition of tomato juice. This effect indicates that 
the ratio A3 with sugar concentration G1 has the same score on the panelists' preference level on the ratio A3 
treatment with sugar concentration G2. So it can be seen here that the single effect of the fruit juice ratio has a 
significant impact on the score of the syrup preference level. The average score of the panelists' preference for the 
overall parameters of the carrot syrup observation was 3.45 ‚Äì 4.45. The highest overall preference score was in the 
A3G1 and A3G2 treatments, namely the ratio treatment of carrot juice to tomato juice = 50%: 50%. 
 
5. Conclusion  
1.  The interaction of carrot and tomato juice formula with sugar concentration on the quality of carrot and tomato 
juice syrup has the best quality is the ratio formula for water juice and tomato juice 50%: 50% with a sugar 
concentration of 60%.  
2.  The effect of carrot juice on syrup quality is that the addition of carrot juice increases the beta-carotene content of 
the syrup. In contrast, the addition of tomato juice lowers the syrup's pH to meet the SNI syrup where the pH 
meets the standard maximum of 4.0.  
3.  The addition of sugar at a dose of 60% has met the SNI standard for syrup with a sugar content of at least 65%.

Abstract 
 
Canistle contains specific nutritional so that it has potential as a functional food. One way to use fruits is to 
process them into innovative foods, such as a dessert mousse. The aims was to study the differences in the 
quality of mousse using animal and vegetable recipe formulas treated with a stabilizer substitute for gelatin. The 
study used a factorial randomized block design with two treatment factors, namely the recipe formula: animal 
and vegetable ingredients and the treatment of stabilizers: CMC, arabic gum and jelly powder. The quality 
observed included fiber and fat content also organoleptic quality of taste, aroma, texture and color. The results 
showed that the recipe formula of vegetable ingredients produced a dessert mousse that is better in term of fiber 
(1,76%) and fat content (8,53%)  as a functional food, while the stabilizer CMC produces crude fiber content of 
1.56% and fat of 11.26% and a soft textured organoleptic quality; better used as a substitute for gelatin than 
other stabilizers. The organoleptic testing resulted that interaction of the animal ingredient recipe with CMC 
stabilizer having a preferred taste and aroma with an attractive yellow-orange color.

1. Introduction 
Canistel or by another name Campolay (Pouteria campechiana) is one of Indonesia's exotic fruits whose 
existence is starting to become rare due to the absence of cultivation efforts and the on going conversion of land 
functions. Tropical fruits in Indonesia have a very high level of diversity both in terms of taste, shape, color and 
aroma, some of which are very unique and exotic that only exist on Indonesian so that they become a wealth of 
biodiversity of Indonesian fruit plants.  
 
Canistel fruit has a fairly complete nutritional content such as fiber, starch, minerals, calcium, phosphorus, 
carotene, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin A and vitamin C (de Lanerolle et al., 2008 and Warta, 2015 in 
Sutrisno et al. , 2018).  Canistel fruit also contains polyphenol antioxidant compounds, namely gallic acid, 
gallocatechins, catechins, epicatechins (Elsayed et al., 2016). Along with the times, processed foods have also 
developed a lot. Processed food is not only a main course but also a dessert. One of the dessert products that are 
often served is mousse. Mousse has a sweet taste that comes from the fruit flavor used. 
 
Mousse usually using topping cream, which is processed into whipped cream then added fresh dairy milk and 
with a bit of  gelatin as a binder (Panji et al., 2019). Gelatin can function as a gelling agent, emulsion stabilizer, 
thickener, clarifier, water binder, coating and emulsifier (Harun et al., 2015). The use of gelatin as a binder or 
stabilizer in mousse processing is a concern in this study. Most of the gelatin on the market comes from the skin 
and bones of pork or cow (Faridah and Susanti, 2018). The high demand for gelatin as a mixture of food 
products that still rely on imported products and the uncertainty about the halalness of imported gelatin 
products, which are generally made from pork skin, are very worrying for consumers, especially Muslim 
consumers.  Opportunities to use other materials that have similar characteristics to gelatin to replace the 
function of gelatin are quite open and need to be encouraged to reduce dependence on imported gelatin. 
Examples of other materials that have characteristics similar to gelatin are carrageenan, gum arabic, CMC 
(Carboxymethyl Cellulose) and jelly. 
 
As time progressed, a person's lifestyle can change, as well as their diet. The International Vegetarian Union 
(IVU) defines a vegetarian as someone who lives on a variety of plant-based products, with or without 
consuming milk and eggs and their processed products, but overall avoids the use of any kind of meat (Liu, 
2017). Vegetable foodstuffs are food ingredients that come from plants (can be in the form of roots, stems,

Based on the graph, it can be seen that 65.22% of the panelists stated that the color produced by the 
animal-based mousse recipe formula with CMC stabilizer and arabic gum stabilizer was yellow-orange to 
orange, 21.74% said the color of the canistle mousse dessert was yellow and only 13.04% said the color 
was light yellow to pale yellow.  A total of 69.57% each of the panelists stated that the color produced in 
the mousse recipe formula of vegetable ingredients with CMC stabilizer and arabic gum stabilizer was 
pale yellow to light yellow and 30.43% stated yellow to orange yellow. Further from the discussion 
above, the ranking is carried out. Based on the rankings, it was found that the treatment of animal 
ingredients recipe formulas with the use of CMC stabilizers was the best treatment for all organoleptic 
quality. Figure 8 below is the photos of the canistle mouse dessert from 6 treatment combinations

5. Conclusion 
Based on the research that has been done, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
The best interaction treatment based on its nutritional content was obtained from the treatment of vegetable-
based recipe formulas combined with CMC stabilizer containing 2.35% crude fiber and 8.83% fat.  
Based on the organoleptic test, the interaction selected by the panelists was the treatment of animal ingredients 
formula combined with CMC stabilizer where the mousse produced had a taste and aroma in the category of 
like, soft texture and attractive mousse color, namely yellow-orange.  Treatment of the recipe formula from 
vegetable ingredients resulted in a better quality dessert mousse than animal ingredients in the fat content of 
8.53% and crude fiber content of 1.76%. Treatment of animal ingredients recipe formulas is better than

Abstract 
 
Dugong (Dugong dugon) are the only marine mammals that consume sea grass as their primary food source. Since 
2019, authorities in West Kalimantan have received reports from local community members of dugong sightings, 
especially in the waters surrounding Cempedak Island. However, the actual existence of Dugong in the area was 
only confirmed in May 2020 by the Balai Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam (BKSDA) when a dugong rescue was 
carried out. From January 23 to March 23, 2021, a systematic survey of dugongs was undertaken around Cempedak 
Island in order to further assess the presence of dugongs in the area. The dugong surveys used two different 
methods: observations from the coast (edge-based) and boat-based observations. Both surveys were carried out for 
15 days each. Semi-structured interviews were also carried out in coastal communities to gather local ecological 
knowledge and perceptions of dugongs. The edge-based observations yielded 16 different sightings with a total of 
19 individuals, whereas boat-based observations resulted in 4 different sightings with a total 4 individuals. Our 
survey results revealed that the methods of observation‚Äôs used can have a significant correlation on the encounter 
rates of dugongs and should be taken into consideration in future studies. Concerningly, results from our community 
interviews indicated a decreasing trend in dugong sightings compared to previous years.

1. Introduction 
Dugong (Dugong dugon) is the only marine mammal that consume sea grass as its primary food (Priosambodo et al., 
2017; Sunuddin et al., 2016). They are found in most coastal waters across the southern hemisphere. In Indonesia, dugong 
populations are evenly distributed along the coastal regions (Cleguer et al., 2020; Nontji et al., 2012). Dugongs are known 
to the people of  Ketapang Communities as duyungor duyong fish. The dugong is a protected animal according to Law no. 
7 of 1999 and Regulation of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry of the Republic of Indonesia Number P. 
106/MENLHK/SETJEN/KUM.1/12/2018. This species is considered Vulnerable to extinction (Vulnarable - VU) by the 
IUCN, but in some specific countries, the status of this species is considered Endangered (Endangered - EN) (Marsh and 
sobtzick, 2019). 
 
In May 2020, the Dugong's habitat was confirmed by the Balai Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam (BKSDA) Kabupaten 
Ketapang when a rescue of this animal was carried out in the Kendawangan area, Cempedak Island, Ketapang Regency. 
The local community had previously reported the appearance of dugongs on Cempedak Island several times, however,

Thus, the presence data obtained from observations using a boat were less than those from edge observations, where 
there is little movement. In addition, dugong is also an animal that was very active in moving when looking for food 
(Dewi et al., 2018; Nontji, 2015). Existence based on the appearance of dugong is strongly influenced by the 
condition of seagrass in an area that is the movement and life cycle of the animal (Nurdin, 2019; Sunuddin et al., 
2016). 
 
Any dugong encountered during our observation was eating and moving to the shore. Dugong always moved to the 
shore because the seagrass ecosystem is in the coastal areas. In Bintan Islands, dugongs were most encountered at 
the shore as there are many seagrasses present. There were many captures of dugongs in coastal areas which were 
affected by the tides (Ashari et al., 2018; Juraij, 2014; Kawaroe et al., 2016). In Australian tropical regions, seagrass 
meadow has a high biomass for dugong feeding trail but just for a seagrass species lesser degree (Tol et al., 2016).  
The waters around Cempedak Island have the potential to become dugong habitat and it is also possible for other 
islands near Cempedak Island and larger ones such as Bawal Island. Cempedak Island has a fairly good type of 
marine park with a high intensity of seagrass distribution visually. However, limited data regarding the exact 
number of existing populations of dugong and seagrass meadows is one of the obstacles in overcoming existing 
conservation problems. In Johor Malaysia, the government strongly supports conservation activities related to the 
protection of wildlife, especially dugongs in their area (Ponnampalam et al., 2015). This can be an example that 
dugong conservation activities must be supported by many parties, especially the government and the community 
itself. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Research Direction 
Sighting surveys of dugongs are very useful to be used as a comparison and reference tool to determine the overall 
population on Cempedak Island. The data obtained were only findings of dugong sightings from two observation 
methods which was 20 Sightings and 23 individuals encountered. The data obtained has been verified through 
several stages such as looking at the condition of seagrass, finding the feeding trail, and interviewing several people. 
The existence of dugongs on Cempedak Island has been recognized from the data we have obtained. We also found 
that the number of dugong sightings seems to have decreased in number from several indications that we found. The 
recommendations from this research is to do other research related to the condition and distribution of seagrass 
species on Cempedak Island and its surroundings so that we can find out other indications of the existence and 
population of existing dugongs that are in accordance with the existing seagrass conditions.(Rahmawati et al., 2014). 
 
5.1 Practical Implication 
This study is very useful for Yayasan Webe Konservasi Ketapang as evidence that integrates academic and 
understanding of many perspectives. In addition, the results of this study are very useful to be used as a reference for 
similar research in the future with a wider perspective. This study also answers questions about the existence of 
dugongs on Cempedak Island. 
 
5.2 Theoretical Implications 
This study shows the fact that the survey conducted is very appropriate to the conditions in the field. this is due to 
the application of more than one method to make observations as a form of proof. Therefore, it is very appropriate if 
the results of this study can be developed by further research. In addition, many development methods can be 
adapted and reused especially in developing areas 
 
5.3 Limitation of Study 
like most researches, this research has its limitations. Some of the main limitations in this study are the 
lack of respondents, technology and costs needed to complete the research. Longer time in data collection 
is an important factor so that the data obtained is much better.  
 
5.4 Future Research 
Further research is highly recommended to further validate the results of this study as well as to enrich knowledge of 
existing weaknesses and by proposing solutions so that the existence of dugongs on Cempedak Island can be taken 
into consideration for many parties.

Abstract 
  
This study aims to find a model for strengthening technological literacy in junior high schools. Examining the 
importance of strengthening technology literacy-based blended learning in dealing with the era of the Industrial 
revolution 4.0. This era is built through Cyber Physical System (CPS) and Internet of Things and Services (IoT and 
IoS) as its main foothold. In this era of digital revolution, all information can be accessed easily and in real-time 
even very quickly and without limits (unlimited). The development of information technology and computer 
digitization has created a ""new space"" that is artificial and virtual (cyberspace) and even ""the world is flat"" the world 
is not limited by anything. Therefore, the phenomenon of technological progress must be positively addressed for 
the development and progress of human civilization, including the world of education. Strengthening Blended 
Learning based on technological literacy is a strategic and innovative step in preparing and designing future 
educational systems and patterns in the face of the culturally disrupted flow of society that continues to develop 
massively in the industrial era 4.0. This study uses quantitative research with survey method and a qualitative 
descriptive method to find a model of strengthening technological literacy by junior high school teachers. The data 
analysis technique was carried out based on the theory of Miles and Huberman, there were three stages of data 
analysis: (1) data reduction, (2) data display, and (3) data conclusion according to the researcher's interpretation. 
Based on the results of research that has been done related to the correlation between the implementation of online 
learning and technological literacy, it was found that the average value of the implementation of online learning by 
teachers is > 75% and the average value of technological literacy in online learning is > 75% and there is a 
relationship between the implementation of online learning that is teachers do on technological literacy. The 
implication of this research is that it can be applied to mastering technological literacy skills in online learning 
during learning activities. This study found a model of strengthening digital literacy through the use of e-learning. 
This model includes elements of communication and collaboration in the form of active participation in learning and 
research activities. It consists of components of individual competence in the form of usage skills, critical 
understanding, and communicative abilities. This research contributes to the model of strengthening technological 
literacy through the use of e-learning.

1. Introduction 
The Industrial Revolution 4.0 is synonymous with disruption, disruptive because almost all areas of life are 
converted from manual to digital. If we are faced with this disorganization, then Indonesia's demographic bonus in 
2045 must be prepared. Teachers must build children's literacy skills, both old literacy (reading, writing, arithmetic), 
and new literacy (data literacy, technology, and humanism). Teachers and educational institutions must strengthen in 
various aspects. Starting from curriculum, systems, management, models, strategies, and learning approaches by 
strengthening 21st century literacy skills. One of them is strengthening literacy skills for teachers and new literacy 
education institutions (data, technology, Human Resources/humanism). Indonesia is currently entering the era of the 
Industrial Revolution 4.0. The middle of this century (the digital revolution) is marked by the fusion of technology 
and blurring the lines of physical, digital, and biological spaces. In this era of the Industrial Revolution volume 4.0,

before using and utilizing e-learning communicative abilities in the learning process had not been carried out. 
Communication skills on the internet are limited to status update activities on social media that have nothing to do 
with the learning process, criticize social media outside of learning materials, and also update news from the internet 
for the benefit of increasing information for themselves. With the existence of e-learning as a virtual learning 
medium, the ability of research subjects in the communicative abilities criteria will certainly increase. The increase 
in communicative abilities occurs because learning activities will always use and utilize the internet. This is in line 
with Adawi's research which states that with the application of distance education based on computers and networks 
(internet, fax, fax-internet, etc.), the dependence on distance and time required for the implementation of education 
can be overcome. because everything needed will be provided online so that it can be accessed at any time (Adawi, 
2008). 
The reference used to determine the teacher's ability to use and utilize digital media is based on the criteria 
determined by the European Commission, Directorate General of Public Information and Media; The Media 
Literacy Unit was subsequently converted and adapted to social conditions in Indonesia. One of the most famous 
frameworks in the concept map is the Individual Competence Framework. Individual Competence or individual 
competence is the ability of individuals to media. These include the skills to use, to produce, to analyze, to 
communicate through the media. This individual competence consists of two categories, namely: (1) Personal 
competence, namely individual skills in using media and analyzing media content. (2) Social Competence, namely 
individual skills in communicating and building social relations through the media and being able to produce media 
content. Communicators consisting of basic subject teachers deliver messages (learning content) to communicants 
through e-learning media. The use of new media in the form of e-learning in the learning process is the 
implementation of communication and collaboration elements in technological literacy, in which there is an 
individual competence component consisting of use skills, critical understanding, and communicative abilities. 
Improving these three components through the use of e-learning will strengthen the literacy skills of communicators. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study found a model for strengthening technological literacy in Bogor City Junior High Schools. Strengthening 
technological literacy in Bogor City Junior High Schools implements elements of communication and collaboration 
which consist of three components of individual competence, namely use skills, critical understanding, and 
communicative abilities. Communication and collaboration is an element of technological literacy in the form of 
active participation in learning activities carried out by utilizing technological literacy applications. The use of 
technological literacy applications in learning activities at Bogor City Junior High Schools is one of the models for 
strengthening technological literacy. The existence of technological literacy makes junior high school teachers 
required to master new media so that they can indirectly improve their individual technological literacy skills. The 
contribution of this research is a model of strengthening technological literacy through the use of technological 
literacy in Bogor City Junior High Schools. Research on technological literacy in Bogor City Junior High Schools 
needs to be done to analyze the other six elements of technological literacy. Research recommendations are also 
intended for policy makers in Bogor City Junior High Schools to maximize the use of Technology Literacy 
Applications as an effort to strengthen technological literacy, especially in the communication and collaboration 
elements

Abstract 
 
The research objective was to improve the understanding and creative thinking skills of elementary school teachers 
in the learning process. The research design used is to make the teacher's group into small groups. During the 
learning process, observations on teacher collaboration during learning with multimedia media were carried out to 
assess the understanding and creative thinking abilities of teachers. The results of observations in each cycle are 
evaluated as reflection material in the next cycle to improve the understanding and creative thinking skills of 
teachers in accordance with predetermined targets. Data analysis was carried out in a quantitative descriptive 
manner. From the results of the T-test, it is known that there are significant differences. This means that the 
understanding of concepts and Science Process Skills increases after the teacher experiences the learning process 
using multimedia learning media. From these results, the average value of concept understanding increased from 
39.89 to 93.48. 98% of teachers gave a positive response, namely agreeing and strongly agreeing that the learning 
process with multimedia learning media can improve science process skills and material understanding in subjects 
for elementary school teachers

1. Introduction 
Elementary school teachers basically have a strata one education background that is universal. In learning, 
individual learning often results in uneven student learning outcomes (Suchyadi & Karmila 2019). Teachers must be 
creative in improving students' abilities, understanding and interest in learning (Suchyadi 2017). Elementary school 
teachers must have the ability to understand and think creatively well in solving various learning problems, 
especially thematic or science. Thus, students who have less academic ability can study independently and thus 
improve their academic abilities. Thinking skills and scientific processes must be developed through science 
learning with certain models and media to grow students' ability to think creatively, innovatively and productively. 
Science learning must be taught in an integrated manner, with more emphasis on the process of building knowledge 
through observation, practicum, and group discussions. Students are not always able to understand the concepts in 
science learning, sometimes students have difficulty in learning science lessons. Difficulties in learning thematics, 
especially the science family, are caused by many factors, one of which is from the students themselves, such as low 
motivation and interest in learning, not studying the material that has been obtained, not reading textbooks, lack of 
experience students as initial knowledge, and low ability to think creatively. While the content of the material in the 
science group courses is considered difficult because some science studies are cumulative, if they do not understand 
one concept, students will have difficulty following other concepts, some studies in science study objects that are

1.1 Objectives  
To overcome this problem, elementary school teachers who teach science group subjects must have creativity and 
the ability to deal with them, without reducing the essence and quality of learning. In developing the process of 
students' creative thinking skills, interactive multimedia can be developed, because in this media students are trained

3655","The results of the concept understanding test were carried out previously. 42.8% of the control class and 39.89% of 
the experimental class who managed to score above 70. In both classes, no class managed to get a score above 80. 
This initial test was used to measure the teacher's initial ability, both in control class and in the experimental class. 
Furthermore, to see how far the effect of treatment on the learning outcomes of the classroom teachers, a post-test 
was conducted on the effect of using multimedia learning chemistry media between the control class and the 
experimental class. In general, there was an increase in the percentage of test scores in both classes, namely in the 
control class 72.8% of teachers had scores above 70, none had scores below 60, while in the experimental class there 
were 93.48% of students who had scores above 70. , no one got a score below 50. If the two classes were compared 
with the percentage of the number of each class, the level of improvement in learning outcomes in both classes 
showed a significant increase in results. However, from the two classes, the percentage of teachers who scored 
above 80 was greater in the experimental class than in the control class. Thus, it can be seen that the treatment using 
multimedia learning media in the science group for the experimental class teacher has a significant effect on learning 
outcomes. The average level of learning outcomes for both classes shows that all students, both experimental class 
and control class, scored above 70, but the percentage of students who scored above 80 was still higher in the 
experimental class. The high average learning outcomes of the experimental class compared to the control class can 
be caused by the use of multimedia media in learning which motivates teachers to focus more. Based on 
observations made during learning, in general, teachers are more active in reading, observing and studying the 
material. The results of this study are in accordance with the findings of Mohler (Mohler, 2001) which states that the 
use of multimedia can improve learning outcomes, especially those related to spatial concepts that are widely found 
in science learning concepts. 
Learning media by utilizing multimedia media can help students' abstraction power. Materials that are relatively 
abstract or difficult to observe are concrete through pictures, animations and videos contained in this media so that 
students become more interested and happy to learn the material. The response of elementary school class teachers 
to the learning process using multimedia in science subjects can be observed from filling out the questionnaire. The 
results of the questionnaire received an answer of Strongly Agree as much as 55%, Agree 43% and Disagree 2%. So 
98% of the answers answered agree, while the other 2% answered less agree. This means that it can be concluded 
that the teacher's desire to use multimedia in science-based subjects to improve Science Process Skills is a positive 
response. Carind and Sund stated that the advantage of student-centered learning is that students will be trained to 
think continuously through activities to identify problems, identify problem variables, and finally find steps to solve 
problems (Carind & Sund, 2008). Learning science-based subjects in this study is intended to develop higher-order 
thinking skills for teachers. Although it has been well designed by considering the situation and class, from 
observations during the research there are still some limitations. Some of the limitations in its developed application 
are that this learning requires a computer/laptop, and depends on the presence or absence of an electrical network. 
 
6. Conclusions 
From the results of the t-test, it is known that there are significant differences between elementary school teachers 
and the use of multimedia in the learning process. This means that the understanding of concepts and Science 
Process Skills increases after the teacher experiences a science-based learning process using multimedia learning 
media. From these results, the average value of concept understanding increased from 39.89 to 93.48. 98% of 
elementary school teachers gave a positive response, namely agreeing and strongly agreeing that the science-based 
elementary school learning process with multimedia learning media can improve science process skills and material 
understanding on subject-based for elementary school teachers

Abstract 
 
Quality education can form quality human resources. It certainly has a significant correlation with the development 
process, the success of which depends on the quality of its human resources. This research, using a qualitative 
descriptive approach, focused on determining the role of the Islamic Education Foundation (YAPIS) in generating 
Educated Human Resources in Tanah Papua. The results showed that YAPIS, as an Islamic Education Foundation 
engaged in education, is a strategic partner of the government to advance the people of Papua through education. The 
Papuan people contribute exceptionally to the development of their region. Through quality education, indigenous 
Papuans will be able and ready to compete in this era of globalization. Many factors influence the success of education 
development in Indonesia, including in remote, underdeveloped, and outermost (3T) areas, such as in Tanah Papua 
(although not all of its areas are classified as remote and underdeveloped). These factors are in the form of challenges 
and opportunities. On the positive side, the more challenges they face means that there are more opportunities for 
humans to advance and develop in their lives.

1. Introduction 
Education is a process that is inseparable from human life. It has an important role in helping humans cultivate their 
individual unique potential and nature. It also helps them become educated human beings and ready to develop society, 
nation, and state. All citizens from all categories: young and old, male and female, poor and rich, physically normal 
and disabled, in urban and rural areas, as well as in urban centers and in remote areas, have the right to education 
(education for all) as mandated by the constitution saying that every citizen has the right to education (Latif, 2006) 
(Noor, 2018). 
 
All citizens from Sabang to Merauke have the right to education. The role of the community, especially in remote 
areas, appears to be very high in an effort to improve education, as marked by the establishment of the Islamic 
Education Foundation (YAPIS) in Tanah Papua whose purpose is none other than an effort to help the government to

3662","Papua; secondly, preparing educated personnel with competencies that are ready to compete; thirdly, training people 
to have Life Skills; fourthly, providing entrepreneurial skills by managing abundant natural resources available in 
Tanah Papua; fifthly, creating job opportunities and helping people work on a better social status, and; sixthly, 
encouraging people in Tanah Papua to be able to contribute to development in their regions. To maintain good quality 
educational institutions, YAPIS has designed its vision, mission, goals, and programs, implemented programs with 
strategic management, and carried out controlling through monitoring and evaluation. 
 
The existence of YAPIS is certainly a blessing in Papua. Its work through education helps the community to have a 
better social and economic status. Knowledgeable and skilled workforces with good mental attitudes certainly play a 
significant role in life, for a more advanced and better future of the nation. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Quality education can generate quality graduates. Education certainly is significantly correlated with development. 
Successful development depends on the quality of human resources; no development without qualified human 
resources and, vice versa, no quality human resources without development in education. Education is a vital aspect 
of nation-building. Therefore, almost all nations place education development as a top priority in national development 
programs. Quality human resources, which are educational products, are the key to the success of a country's 
development. YAPIS, an Islamic Education Foundation engaged in education founded by government employees and 
assigned to Papua in 1968, becomes a strategic partner of the government in advancing the people of Papua through 
education. 
 
Papuans greatly contribute to the development of their region. Through quality education, indigenous Papuans will be 
able and ready to compete in this era of globalization. Many factors, in the form of challenges and opportunities, 
influence the success of education development in Indonesia, including in remote, underdeveloped, and outermost 
(3T) areas, such as in Tanah Papua (although not all areas in Tanah Papua are classified as remote and 
underdeveloped). The positive point of view shows that the more challenges humans face, the more opportunities they 
get to advance and develop their lives.

Abstract 
 
Numerous countries compete to build and strengthen their respective economic systems in the global competition era, 
including Indonesia. In response to these challenges, the Indonesian government continuously strives to raise the ease 
of doing business rating. This effort needs to be balanced with strengthening the role of the law.  It is a provider of 
ease of doing business. It protects unfair business competition during a world economic climate that tends to be liberal 
so as not to dissolve in the vortex of the free market. It is also continuously addressed by the government to accelerate 
the rate of economic growth in all regions. This study aims to provide policy recommendations for local governments 
to increase sharia-based economic growth, especially in Lhokseumawe, Aceh Province, by implementing the 
Economic Regulation of Theory. The chain of strategic commodities in Lhokseumawe to improve the business 
climate, stimulate regional economic growth, and reduce the impact of the crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
scientific research also aims to design sustainable collaboration between the local government of Lhokseumawe, the 
community and academics, and the regional inflation control team by designing sustainable practical policy models 
to increase regional economic growth Lhokseumawe. A mixed-methodology was chosen by conducting interviews 
with the target population, namely government, Small Business Traditional Market Centers in Lhokseumawe. The 
focus group discussion is employed by inviting local officials from related offices of Lhokseumawe and Academics 
to provide input in completing the design of the supply chain model of strategic commodities and implementing the 
Economic Regulation of Theory policy recommendations in increasing regional economic growth in Lhokseumawe.

Abstract 
 
The global Covid-19 pandemic certainly has an impact on various sectors, especially in the economic sector. It also 
significantly impacts tourism and trade industries, including Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in 
Indonesia. Creative products have great potential to deliver a city industry into an advanced and independent creative 
economy. However, the use of information technology for creative product business resource management is still 
under investigation, which has administrative, financial, process, and access to banking and financial institutions 
weaknesses. Thus, this study seeks to formulate a strategy for improving the MSMEs sector in Lhokseumawe. This 
study was designed using Mix methods by conducting interviews with 200 MSMEs scattered in Lhokseumawe. The 
Economic Value-Added is applied in this study, which aims to increase the productivity of MSMEs via the 
introduction of the acceleration board and collaboration with the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Also, focus group 
discussion was conducted by inviting local officials from related Lhokseumawe and academics to complete the model 
for developing a strategy to increase MSME productivity by focusing on the Economic value-added method. Finally, 
this study provides recommendations to sustainable strategies for the MSMEs in Lhokseumawe when running their 
business during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Abstract 
 
Transit-oriented development (TOD) is an urban planning approach that facilitates building resilient cities from urban 
planning and transportation perspective. Developed countries are moving in rapid, constant steps toward switching to 
a TOD urban fabric, yet developing countries still have challenges especially in the case of introducing new 
transportation modes such as the metro for the state of Qatar. To that end, the research study analyzes TOD from a 
system perspective, it analyzes in deep the interrelation between three modules; sustainable transportation. The 
variables of the three modules, the causal Loops Diagram (CLD), then the Stocks and Flows Diagram (SFD) was 
developed, then the loops were investigated and analyzed in deeps. These assessments and modeling will crucially 
draw the lines for the policymaker for a better understanding of the interrelation between the mentioned TOD aspects 
to provide more effective policies. In this study, a conceptual system dynamics model for Transit-oriented 
development considering the sustainable built environment, sustainable transportation, and sustainable economy is 
developed. Typically, Transit-oriented development studies investigate the development around the transit node, but 
this research study investigates the interaction between defined variables of the defined modules. The main finding of 
this research study is the causality effects between the selected variables, which leads to a conclusion that the TOD 
planning should work in a closed cycle of transportation, urban, and economic aspects. Moreover, the model developed 
in this research study was applied to the Qatar case but could have broader implications in countries that have similar 
conditions as Qatar.

3678",,"The design and subsequent construction have to create a circulation system in which people can move around and 
engage with others easily. The design has to balance the needs of recreation, work, and home while also focusing on 
the fundamentals of the neighborhood, which includes togetherness and association. It is easily achieved through 
enhancing and transforming points in sidewalks. Other processes include the choice of sustainable transport, street 
furniture, shaded provisions, and shortening the walking distance routes.  The design applies to areas around the metro 
stations. The objective is to focus on car parking, bus stops, and buildings, which supports and sustains physical 
movement. It is crucial to enhance transport, for visitors, ease the travel arrangements of the visitors, design, and focus 
on density, incorporate the fundamentals of land usage diversity, and improve the economy, which easily contributes 
to the long-term development of the district and the city.  
 
In Al-Ghanim district, it is important to incorporate designs that champion the needs and rights of the pedestrian. The 
friendly urban design would easily enhance and improve the accessibility of the station. The objective is the 
improvement of transmitting performance while also improving the effect of bus transport connections, which makes 
it easier for passengers to move around. Walking into the station and walking away from the station should be easy 
and comfortable. Enhancement of bus service stops incorporates components such as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and 
Light Rail Transit (LRT), ski top service, and or limited stop.  
 
The use of mixed land use is appropriate when it comes to TOD. Affordable housing developments are usually not 
located near commercial or urban settings. It means that redesigning the area would allow the construction of economic 
housing, which would be near the facilities and services. However, the region does not have the population or target 
group that needs such structures and facilities. The existing gap in the provision of resources and services negates the 
objectives of governments and the people. Poor designs and construction of transport systems increase the costs of 
transportation such as an increase in fares while the area would not be able to generate appropriate income. Conversely, 
mixed land usage spurs economic development in addition to diversification of services and goods making them easily 
available. 
 
6. Limitations and future work  
One of the important limitations of this research effort was the lack of long-term time-series data for Qatar. Therefore, 
our methodology provides a practical solution to explain the TOD behavior in such places (no data‚Äînewly developed 
place, no long history of TOD, etc.) The authors in this research study proposed a conceptual System Dynamics SD 
framework for TOD in Qatar further research, may include building a quantitative SD model built upon the conceptual 
model proposed in this research study, by investigating similar regions in the world, with a history of TOD around 
railway stations‚Äîto further investigate the sensitivity of each policy intervention point.  Finally, each policy requires 
the allocation of resources, and the effectiveness of each policy needs to be assessed, quantitatively, throughout a time. 
The effectiveness should investigate the relationship between resources allocated for a certain policy and its long-term 
performance in terms of contribution to TOD, how much resource is allocated versus to what degree the outcomes are 
achieved.

Abstract 
 
A Driving Pattern (DP) describes how drivers drive in a given region. The DPs are obtained by monitoring a 
representative sample of vehicles traveling on roads of different characteristics and under normal conditions. A 
Driving Cycle (DC), on the other hand, is a speed time series that represent the DP, and it is used to assess the 
performance in energy consumption and tailpipe emissions of the vehicles. The construction of a DC consists in 
obtaining a speed time series whose characteristic parameters (CP*s) are similar to the characteristic parameters of 
the driving pattern (CPs). The CPs are variables derived from speed and time, such as the mean speed and mean 
acceleration. The methods to construct DC (Micro-Trips, Markov chains, and MWD-CP) are well-known and 
established. However, challenges remain with respect to the repeatability of their results, the need for a large number 
of measured trips, which is highly expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an alternative and novel 
approach to construct artificial DC representing DPs using a few measured trips and a Deep Learning (DL) model 
called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). A GAN combines two DL architectures: the generator and the 
discriminator. The generator creates candidate artificial DC as similar as possible to the real trips, while the 
discriminator distinguishes between real and artificial DC. Therefore, a competition is triggered between the generator 
and discriminator, resulting in a generator capable of creating representative candidate artificial DC.  For instance, the 
generator looks after: i) to minimize loss functions which are the relative differences between CPs of the artificial DC 
and of the driving patterns, and ii) to maximize the failure of the discriminator. In addition, the resulting model can 
be used to obtain DCs from other cities using transfer learning techniques. Transfer learning consists of reusing a well-
trained and validated model in a similar application by adjusting only the model parameters. As a case example, we 
collected second by second data of speed, fuel consumption, and tailpipe pollutants, obtained monitoring for two 
months, a sample of 16 vehicles operating in Mexico City. A GAN was trained for constructing artificial but 
representative DC of 20 minutes duration with a resolution of 1 Hz. We used that GAN to construct 10000 
representative DC and found that in all cases, the DCs exhibit CP*s within the 10% of the relative difference with 
respect to the corresponding 19 CPs that describe the DP, fuel consumption, and tailpipe emissions. According to the 
literature, 10% of the relative difference is an acceptable criterion for this purpose. Similar results were observed 
applying transfer learning to data from Bogota, Colombia.

Abstract 
 
The competence of human resources among the Indonesian National Police (POLRI) is believed to be a critical factor 
in determining the success of the POLRI organization. Therefore, POLRI has implemented an open position promotion 
program, one of which uses the Assessment Center to test managerial competence. In addition, the National Police 
Assessment Center is used to support the policy of the National Police Chief in promoting open positions at every 
level and office space in his jurisdiction following the delegation of authority. This study investigates the policies and 
impacts of the Assessment Center implementation in supporting the promotion of open positions. The study used a 
qualitative approach by applying observation as the data collecting technique, interview, and documents study. The 
result indicated that implementing the Assessment Center encourages the opening of career promotion. However, in 
a more extensive sense, the implementation of the Assessment Center is encouraging the opening of career promotion 
has not been successful and does not have a positive impact. It could happen because the Indonesian National Police, 
as a bureaucratic organization, does not have the capacity of organization as the bureaucracy's breadwinner, which 
involves the organization's structure, working mechanism, human resources, financial support, and the resources 
required for working. Therefore, those four elements are still not able to optimize the condition and encourage each 
other. In conclusion, this study has successfully investigated the success of policy implementation of Open Career 
Promotion in the Indonesian National Police Institution. In a narrow sense is by looking at the compliance of 
implementing the policies contained in policy documents (Laws, Regulations, and Programs) and following the 
existing Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

Abstract 
 
Implementing the e-Kinerja system at the Cirebon Regency Public Works and Spatial Planning Service did not run 
smoothly and optimally. Several obstacles occurred during the implementation of the e-Kinerja policy. Constraints 
that arise, such as not all employees can use electronic systems, and some employees stutter about technology due to 
the age factor. In addition, it isn't easy to adapt to new things based on electronics. Of these, the current investigation 
seeks to study the implementation of the e-Kinerja system to improve employee performance. The research method 
used is a qualitative approach with a descriptive analysis method. The theory of policy implementation used in this 
research is George Edward III. The study results concluded that implementing the e-Kinerja system at the Cirebon 
Regency Public Works and Spatial Planning Service did not make all run optimally. Therefore, judging from George 
Edward III's policy implementation model, which consists of communication, resources, the attitude of implementers, 
and bureaucratic structure, the communication factor needs to be socialized to employees.

Abstract 
 
Smart governance is an indicator of the smart city program to improve good governance, so there needs to be a 
collaboration between local government organizations, private parties, and community groups. Currently, the 
collaboration between stakeholders is not optimal regarding the implementation of smart governance in Bengkulu 
City. The research objective is to analyze collaborative governance on the implementation of smart governance. The 
research method uses qualitative methods using 6 informants, data collection techniques by observation, interviews, 
documentation, and data analysis using triangulation. The results showed that collaborative governance is quite good. 
However, there are problems in access to financial resources that are less than optimal, especially those supporting 
smart governance infrastructure, and human resources in terms of quantity still lack. It impacts carried out by the 
community on the implementation of smart governance. In conclusion, collaborative governance in the 
implementation of smart governance is not optimal because there are still some collaborative governance problems. 
This research implies that input in the implementation of smart governance and collaborative governance has an 
important role in the success of the implementation of smart governance.

Abstract 
 
Data from various regions in Indonesia regarding COVID-19 continues to color news channels ranging from 
television, social media, and print media. Social media is a concern of many parties because of the attractive 
communication model in Social Media. Today's social media has transformed into one of the tools used by many 
governments in the world to improve public services. The most popular social media is Twitter. In the pandemic era, 
the use of Twitter in disseminating information is considered quite effective, but what is interesting is that there is a 
lot of public sentiment regarding the information shared by the government through its official account. This study 
aims to measure public sentiment in Indonesia about implementing PPKM through the official account of the Ministry 
of Health of the Republic of Indonesia. The qualitative research method through a descriptive approach was chosen 
to explain the sentiment phenomenon. The unit of analysis in this study uses NVIVO-12 Plus software with sentiment 
analysis tools and word three to identify how the sentiment in the Ministry of Health's account develops. The process 
of collecting data through the NCapture feature, followed by the coding process, data visualization, and data analysis. 
The results show that the sentiment in the community regarding the policy of implementing Restrictions On 
Community Activities (PPKM) in Indonesia is relatively high. Still, through hashtags and positive tweets, the account 
of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia can suppress the negative trend towards the implementation of 
PPKM in Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
Smart City is a model for developing a city to create a better quality of life through the use of Information and 
Communication Technology in increasing awareness, intelligence, welfare, and citizen participation. Currently, many 
cities declare themselves as smart cities. Therefore, they invest a lot in information technology infrastructure to 
provide website and application-based services. However, this has not been balanced with community development 
by fostering participation in public life processes and outputs. This study aims to explore community involvement in 
the context of a smart city through a co-creation approach. This study uses a qualitative approach with library research 
techniques sourced from journals, proceedings, books, and official government websites that provide information 
relevant to the research focus. This study reveals that community participation is not difficult to find because Indonesia 
has social capital and is practiced until now in the public life of urban communities, for example, social awareness, 
deliberation, and mutual-cooperation. However, community participation is still limited to input, not yet reaching the 
process and output, where Information Technology is still limited to replacing the offline system with online. Based 
on the results and discussion, this study suggests the need to expand and increase community involvement in resolving 
public affairs and combining forms of community involvement in both online and offline systems. 
 
Keywords 
Community Involvement, Co-Creation, Society participation, Smart City. 
 
1. Introduction 
The change of the centralized to decentralized regime in Indonesia in the early 2000s marked the beginning of changes 
not only in the political system but in the central-regional government system. The economy that was previously only 
dominated in Java then spread to other areas outside the island of Java. The autonomy policy has channeled some 
development funds directly from the center to districts/cities. This is where this autonomy fund sows the seeds of new 
growth (Islahuddin, 2020). With the flow of funds from the central government to the regions as well as relatively 
large authority, a previously stagnant region has grown into a new economic center and a magnet for urbanization.

3704","Still according to Voorberg, the co-initiator dimension can be pinned on the involvement of communities as described 
before. These communities play an active role, they organize themselves and take initiatives to overcome perceived 
problems such as environmental, tourism, economic problems. Citizens organize themselves to solve social problems 
in urban areas and create shared solutions in their interactions with (or struggle against) public institutions and semi-
public networks of powerful urban actors (Lund, 2018). While Co design is appropriate to be used in viewing urban 
farming programs, the program is initiated by public actors, the city government in this case. Then it is the residents 
through their communities who develop how the farming program achieves the goal, namely food independence for 
urban residents. participation becomes co-creation, where public institutions enable citizens to be actively involved in 
social policy making and service provision, and it becomes about leveraging resources and empowering those in need 
(Papa et al., 2013). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The implementation of a smart city in the city of Bandung encourages residents to participate in city development. 
Using Voorberg's concept of co-creation, three dimensions (co implementer, co design and co initiative) can be found 
in Bandung residents. With an approach to website-based digitization, applications and social media make it easier 
for citizens to interact with the government such as submitting complaints, providing information related to public 
issues, making it easier for the government to identify evidence-based issues so that they can be used in policy making. 
Bandung residents are active in responding to public problems and do not always depend on the government, even 
lighten the burden on the government in answering public problems and in branding the city of Bandung as a creative 
city through communities engaged in activities related to creativity, art, empowerment, environment and economy. 
The weakness of this research is that it only uses literature so that it is necessary to explore the conditions and processes 
for co-creation, the characteristics of the residents and the encouragement of the participation of the citizens of 
Bandung to explore through field research.

Abstract 
 
The development of clean water resources is an important part that cannot be separated as a form of policy 
implementation to help people who do not have access to safe and proper clean water. Belu Regency is a border district 
that is included in the category of underdeveloped areas. One aspect of the left behind is the limited ability of the 
community to manage existing clean water resources to meet their basic needs. The purpose of this study is to find 
out and describe how the implementation of clean water resources development policies in Belu Regency and the 
supporting and inhibiting factors of the implementation. This research uses a descriptive qualitative research method. 
The research subjects are related stakeholders: Government, Private Parties, the business world, and non-governmental 
groups. Data were collected by using library techniques and field research through observation, interviews, and 
documentation. The results showed that the implementation of clean water resources development policies in the Belu 
Regency was effective. However, related to the achievement of goals, the implementation of the development of clean 
water resources has not been optimal. The supporting factor for implementing the policy is the participation and 
support of the community and stakeholders. The inhibiting factors are communication, resource capability, the attitude 
of implementers, and bureaucratic structure. The conclusion is that if it is managed by one region alone, there is a 
strong tendency for conflicts of interest to regulate water between residents of the two regions. For this reason, 
collaboration and cooperation between the government and stakeholders are needed by forming an integrated water 
resources management pattern involving the participation of the community, religious leaders, and the business world 
from both countries by using the general provisions of the UNDP (UN). This cooperation is an opportunity because 
of the strong emotional, cultural connection (emotional bond) between the people of the two countries.

Abstract 
 
There are still many cases of child sexual violence in Indonesia, showing how the government's dissonance in 
protecting children. Regional heads play an essential role in child protection policies, especially women's regional 
heads. In each vision, the head of the women's region prioritizes development based on gender mainstreaming. 
Unfortunately, there are still many cases of sexual violence in children in areas headed by female regional heads. The 
study focused on the perspective of women's leadership in tackling child sexual violence. This study aims to find out 
how policies deal with sexual violence in children from women's leadership. Through qualitative research methods 
combined with the perspective of feminism and gender mainstreaming as an analytical knife. Data collection 
techniques through data meta-synthesis. Data analysis uses a qualitative descriptive approach, then spelled out in the 
form of a narrative that begins with data collection, data filtering, data presentation, and conclusion withdrawal. The 
results showed that female regional heads were not a guarantee of controlling the problem of sexual violence in 
children. The failure to achieve the vision of the head of the female region in its implementation faced many obstacles, 
one of which was the social stigma attached to local women who were considered weak so that they could not protect 
children. This research suggests the need for the commitment and capability of female leaders to protect children and 
women.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 is spreading all over the world and declared by the United Nations as a global pandemic. The author 
is curious about how ASEAN member states responded to different policies based on their domestic socio-economic, 
security, and political circumstances. All the crisis caused by COVID-19 has affected research in various ways, also 
on SDGs is concerned. SDGs are ruined by complex and turbulent problems on three dimensions of sustainable 
development: economic, social, and environmental. This paper aims to discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic has 
impacted SDGs achievement and investigate the role of governance for public administration in combating COVID-
19 in Southeast Asia. The method used is a qualitative research method through analytical literature reviews. The 
pandemic has been found to severely threaten the achievement of the SDGs, while opportunities concerning selected 
SDGs can also be found. The results reveal that massive vaccination is needed for cooperative regional sustainable 
development and recovery strategies, such as the green economy. The findings provide practical guidance on policy 
implications to transform regional sustainability and push innovative strategies to achieve sustainable development 
agendas. ASEAN's government policymakers have built a sustainable strategy of combating pandemics based on the 
epidemiology of COVID-19.

Abstract 
 
Public Service Innovation enables governments to innovate in the design and delivery of public goods and services. 
However, it needs careful planning, leadership, and stakeholder coordination. In addition, officers in the public sector 
must learn to detect social and aspirational challenges. On the other hand, research into public service innovation 
efforts has only made a limited effort. It means that Indonesian public service innovation, particularly those 
acknowledged and assessed by the Ministry of Administrative Reform, has received less elaboration. This study aims 
to describe and provide an overview of an innovation in public services in the field of motor vehicle tax payments 
called SAMSAT VIRTU. This study was designed using a qualitative approach through the descriptive method by 
utilizing the two data sources, including primary data collected from interviews and secondary data used via library 
research. In addition, quality services theory consists of five crucial elements: tangible, reliability, responsiveness, 
assurance, and empathy is studied. The study results indicate that the public service innovation practice carried out by 
the Bengkulu Regional Government is considered quite successful. It can be seen from the enthusiasm and response 
of the people who come to get services at SAMSAT VIRTU. This study concludes that Public Service Innovation is 
a necessity carried out by government administrators in Bengkulu city to improve the quality of public services. 
Theoretical policy implications are related to the local government's capacity to develop Innovation, which three main 
strategies that affect the ability of government organizations to innovate, namely, leadership credibility; Strong 
management teams; and Governing board functioning. The practical implications of this research need to be followed 
up with a grand national design regarding government innovations related to the implementation of the main functions 
and tasks of government, namely the function of public services and public goods delivery.

The independent Learning Campus Policy is an effort made to improve the competitiveness of universities and the 
competitiveness of Indonesian graduates in the international world. The problems faced in Indonesian higher 
education are the increase in educated unemployment. The contents of the education curriculum are more academic. 
There is a clustering of universities by region, accreditation, legal entity status for state universities, and organizing 
bodies for private universities. Several private universities have encountered obstacles to innovate and have high 
competitiveness. In line with these problems, this research was conducted to identify the dilemma of private 
universities in implementing MBKM policies. This qualitative study uses a literature study, with secondary data 
collection and a study of government policy regulations of the independent learning campus policy.

Abstract 
 
The role of cultural heritage has proven beneficial for the development of cities. The management of cultural heritage 
areas to improve and restore the city's identity is widely recognized as solid coordination with the upgrading and 
prevention of slum in the effective planning interventions. However, as a country of many heritage cities, Indonesia 
is concerned with the erosion of cultural heritage due to the uncontrolled rapid development of slums in the cultural 
heritage area, leading to socio-economic and cultural changes. These conditions required changing the planning and 
governance systems and mediating new relationships and configurations between different actors through 
collaborative governance. Yet, guidance on designing collaborative governance for implementing the upgrading slum 
in a cultural heritage area is limited. This study aims to describe the process of collaborative governance related to 
upgrading slums in the cultural heritage area for the target location in Pulau Penyengat as a National Cultural Heritage. 
A qualitative descriptive approach is applied through in-depth interviews and literature study. The data is collected 
from purposive and snowball sampling of key informants and analyzed by interactive analysis with three components: 
data reduction, data presentation, and concluding. The results highlighted the involvement of stakeholders from 
academicians, business, community, government, and media to implement the upgrading slum in the cultural heritage 
area of Pulau Penyengat. The development applies the Pentahelix concept, classified into primary and secondary 
stakeholders and modified into key stakeholders.

concepts or ideas. The relationship between academics and media is networking. Academics and media do not require 
an intensive relationship but are interconnected in publication. 
 
Businesses or the private sector and community have a collaborating relationship. The private sector provides 
opportunities for communities to increase their knowledge and skills through technical guidance, coaching, and 
training in supporting the handling of slums. The private sector also has a collaborating relationship with the 
government. The government opens up opportunities to emerge new programs or activities that can be developed as a 
form of community services to foster socio-economic development. The private sector and media have network 
relationships through the media, providing public support for the successful implementation of the program. 
 
Community and government collaborate by sharing the responsibilities and risks of implementing the slum upgrading 
program. The government did the planning by considering the community's interest in Pulau Penyengat, while the 
community provided the inputs needed for the successful slum upgrading in the cultural heritage area. The community 
and media relations are networking. The media needs information from the community for publication regarding the 
benefit of the government, and the community needs information to follow development progress conducted by the 
government. Meanwhile, the relationship between government and media is coordinated when the media publishes 
the government's performance as information for the public and functions for monitoring government's activities so 
that it becomes feedback for the government in improving and innovating for the implementation of other slum 
upgrading programs or activities. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The success of handling slums in Pulau Penyengat depends on effective development management planning. It matters 
because the starting point of planning carries out the stages of implementing a program. This planning is important 
because it underlies the next step, where all indicators are planned to implement sustainable development. The most 
important thing in implementing this stage is stakeholder involvement in dealing with slum settlements. The slum 
upgrading program is developed for cultural heritage tourism in Pulau Penyengat. The program uses the Penta helix 
concept with five elements: academics, government, community, business or private sector, and media. It is classified 
on the level of stakeholder's interest and primary stakeholders such as central government, provincial government, 
city government, and local community; secondary stakeholders that is academics, Tourism Awareness Group 
(Pokdarwis), and media, as well as can be modified into key stakeholders regarding their highest level of interest and 
influence or power.  
 
The key stakeholders of the slum upgrading program in Pulau Penyengat are the Center for Regional Settlement 
Infrastructure of Kepulauan Riau Province, Regional Planning, Research, and Development Agency of Kepulauan 
Riau Province, and Tanjungpinang Regional Planning, Research and Development Agency, where the collaboration 
was marked with the drafting of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the three key stakeholders 
representing each government institution. Each stakeholder has its level of influence and interest. The key stakeholders 
act as regulators and controllers to function as the leader of planning, implementation, and monitoring of activities. 
The local community is an accelerator, business, or private sector. It performs as an enabler to support the program 
through the funding, academics play the role of conception by contributing concepts and ideas for development 
through research, and media acts as an expanded by promoting, publishing, and creating an image of Pulau Penyengat 
as an island rich in cultural heritage. The roles of stakeholders do not identify and form a collaborative relationship in 
the Penta Helix concept following their respective roles in the slum upgrading program. However, relationships among 
the stakeholders such as coordinating, networking, and collaborating could avert conflicts of interest and make it easier 
to determine who should be involved in the development or who needs improvement so that the program's 
implementation will run fluently.

Abstract 
 
The way to clarify the concept of the role of the community in local government affairs is to do collaborative 
governance. This study aims to analyze and describe Collaborative Governance in increasing tourism during the Covid 
19 Pandemic in Indonesia. The results show that in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, UNWTO in 2020 has revised 
the outlook for international tourist growth to negative 1% to 3%, while Asia and the Pacific will be the worst affected 
regions, with an estimated decline in arrivals of between 9% to 3%. 12%. In Indonesia, the number of foreign tourist 
visits to Indonesia is slowly decreasing. Cumulatively from January to March in 2020, the number of tourists who 
came only reached 2.61 million people or dropped dramatically by 30.62 percent; compared to the same period last 
year, which was 3.76 million people. Compared to February, the number of tourist arrivals fell by 45.50 percent; while 
compared to the same period last year, the decline was even more drastic, at 64.11 percent. Losses from the tourism 
sector are predicted to reach Rp 60 trillion. The central government through the Ministry of Tourism and Creative 
Economy tries to prepare destinations in a new normal era with excellent hygiene and sanitation. Also, they seek to 
create tourism destinations more attractive in implementing the principles of sustainable tourism development 
(resilience, sustainable, and responsible).

Abstract 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic that has occurred since March 2020 in Indonesia has had a severe impact on the condition of 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Central Java. The purpose of the study was to investigate the 
effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on MSMEs in Central Java and the need for economic recovery for Central Java 
MSMEs. The research used a descriptive qualitative method. Data were collected by electronic survey, in-depth 
interviews, and Focus Group Discussion. The results showed the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly eroded the 
profits of MSMEs in Central Java due to a decrease in sales, while production costs remain or even increase. There is 
a vulnerability to closing the business in the next one month to one year based on the subjective perception of business 
actors. When MSMEs cannot maintain their business, potential risks are bad loans, layoffs for workers and bankruptcy 
for business owners, and supply & demand drop deeper. The recovery of economic conditions during and after the 
Covid-19 pandemic for the MSME sector in Central Java includes assisting in the recovery of production functions, 
financing assistance, and access to financing; and assistance in the restoration of marketing functions by encouraging 
online marketing.

1. Introduction 
Currently, the Indonesian global economy is experiencing uncertainty and is leading to an economic recession due to 
the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic (Amirudin, Urba≈Ñski, et al., 2021; Syamruddin et al., 2021). Several major 
countries in the world experienced negative economic growth in the first and second quarters of 2020. The global 
economic slowdown will impact Indonesia‚Äôs economic growth performance in 2020 (Susilawati et al., 2020). 
Indonesia‚Äôs economic growth in the first quarter of 2020 was 1.26%, while in the second quarter of 2020, it contracted

3734","malls), gradually opening tourist attractions by implementing certain health safety procedures; (b) Further steps: 
Encouraging online platforms to expand partnerships with MSMEs, Encouraging local governments to strengthen 
local supply chain components (trading houses and regional logistics), Using research results from various institutions 
(LIPI, BPPT, etc.) to improve quality and competitiveness of MSME products, ease of importing raw materials for 
MSMEs, especially textiles, footwear, and food & beverages, as well as cheap credit for MSMEs (new and old 
prospective debtors). Therefore, the policy strategy in restoring the condition of MSMEs is (i) to implement an 
Adaptive Supply chain (for strategic goods); (ii) Increase the involvement of Non-Bank Financial Institutions (LKBB) 
in MSME financing; (iii) facilitate home trade and logistics for MSMEs, including farmers and fishers, Development 
of MSME clinics digitally based. 
 
Government policy interventions need to be adjusted to the main needs of MSMEs affected by Covid-19, including 
increasing sales and distribution, capital, and human resource capacity (Muhamad et al., 2018). Efforts to increase 
sales and distribution can intervene through corporatization policies for MSMEs. Efforts to increase capital can be 
intervened through MSME financing policies, while efforts to increase human resource capacity can intervene through 
MSME capacity policies. In line with the recommendation of  (Dai et al., 2020) that given the limited public resources, 
it is recommended that the government assist companies in resuming work and production as soon as possible. 
Supporting policies must be adapted to the unique characteristics of each sector (Klein et al., 2005). 
 
The recovery of MSMEs is directly proportional to the economic recovery. Therefore, local governments need to 
encourage MSMEs as a new economic force through sustainable and innovative development. The MSME 
development process can be carried out with 4 main strategies. First the integration of the digital financial economy 
in all aspects of the MSME business. Second, strengthening the ecosystem that supports the development of MSMEs. 
Third, synergies between related agencies, such as harmonization of policies and partnerships. Fourth, education and 
literacy in a structured and systematic way to increase the capacity of MSMEs. 
 
The results showed that the Covid-19 pandemic impacted a decrease in sales of more than 50%, a significant decrease 
in profit, and an increase in raw material costs. Therefore, there is a vulnerability for MSMEs in maintaining their 
business. Measures to maintain business are carried out by seeking new markets/consumers, finding cheaper raw 
material suppliers, reducing labor, and applying for credit delays. The balance will not return. Naturally, a strong and 
measurable government intervention is needed as an appropriate recovery step (Berke et al., 2014; World Health 
Organization, 2021). The recommended strategies for strengthening MSMEs are short-term and medium-term 
strategies. Short-term strategy: By loosening people‚Äôs movement to do business and work, local governments absorb 
MSME products gradually open and reorganize commercial centers and tourist attractions. 
 
Meanwhile, the long-term strategy includes encouraging online platforms to expand partnerships for MSMEs (Adam 
et al., 2022; Mayangsari et al., 2020; Yosep et al., 2021). Government policy interventions need to be adjusted to the 
main needs of MSMEs affected by Covid-19, including increasing sales and distribution, increasing capital, and 
increasing human resource capacity. Efforts to increase sales and distribution can intervene through corporatization 
policies for MSMEs. Efforts to raise capital can be intervened through MSME financing policies, while efforts to 
improve human resource capacity can intervene through MSME capacity policies. 
 
Based on discussions with experts and stakeholders in the MSME sector in Central Java, the identified needs for 
economic recovery during and after the Covid-19 pandemic for the MSME sector in Central Java were (1) Assisting 
to restore production functions, (2) Providing assistance in procurement of production inputs, (3) Standardized 
production training (HCCP), (4) Financing assistance and access to financing, (5) Encouraging non-cash transactions, 
(6) Assistance in the restoration of marketing functions by encouraging online marketing, facilitating online platforms 
to partner with MSMEs, (7) Marketing access assistance. In line with the research results of Sugiri (2020), the recovery 
of economic conditions, especially MSMEs from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, a short-term strategy is needed 
related to the application of strict health protocols, providing opportunities and encouraging digital services to support 
MSMEs, socializing business associations, simplifying administrative processes as well as efforts to encourage 
changes in business strategy. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly eroded the profits of MSMEs in Central Java due to a decrease in sales, 
while production costs remain or even increase. As a result, there is a vulnerability to closing the business in the next 
1 month to 1 year based on the subjective perception of business actors. Potential risks when MSMEs are unable to

drop deeper. The needs for recovery of economic conditions during and after the Covid-19 pandemic for the MSME 
sector in Central Java include aiding in the recovery of production functions, financing assistance and access to 
financing, and assistance in the restoration of marketing functions by encouraging online marketing.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays, the COVID-19 pandemic has debilitating effects in many areas of human life. The psychological effect of 
a pandemic could be the outcome of direct consequences from the biological nature of the virus or indirect 
consequences such as socioeconomic factors affected by COVID-19. Despite the increased mental health problem that 
has been detected during the pandemic, many analyses emerged that we would face pandemic aftermath named the 
‚Äútsunami‚Äù of psychiatric illness. Mental health resources insufficiency in developing countries has been known before 
the pandemic. From this study, we want to describe a few examples of innovative public psychiatry approaches needed 
to anticipate burden increase in the mental health system as a ‚Äútsunami‚Äù of psychiatric illness predicted to become a 
reality. This study used the narrative review method to include various literature sources related to anticipating post-
pandemic psychiatric burden from public psychiatry perspective and ‚Äúagile governance‚Äù theory. We found that 
telemedicine still has limitations, especially in developing countries where technological infrastructure cannot be 
widely accessible in rural areas. We also found that reformulating the care system, as we found in the Collaborative 
Care Model, may be more feasible to be applied and adapted in Indonesia. We conclude that the Collaborative Care 
Model developed by American Psychiatric Association could be considered by policymakers to be adapted in 
Indonesia‚Äôs psychiatric service in anticipating pandemic aftermath named ‚Äútsunami‚Äù of psychiatric illness.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is a large country that has a large water surface and land area. Various areas are almost found on the surface 
of the area. The natural potential has not been touched as a whole in the transportation sector. Water transportation 
management is still limited to certain areas. The potential for water transportation can still be developed widely, 
including tourism potential. The use of floating homes as a means of transportation will develop well if there is 
innovation and management of water transportation in the territory of Indonesia. Variations Structures and designs 
that adapt to the natural conditions of certain areas will further enhance other potentials and must be carried out from 
now on. In addition, it is also necessary to increase reliable human resources for the development of floating ship 
transportation and the availability of good port infrastructure adjustments.

Abstract 
 
This paper investigated: (a) how end-users use online media towards becoming consumer entrepreneurs conducting 
business models on channels; and (b) how technology companies can generate the whole consumer entrepreneurship 
everything into the stream of revenue, using a mix of qualitative studies and agent-based computation. Because end-
users have typically been classified as passive and solvated participants in digital business models, complete 
knowledge of their business transactions, as well as a feasible revenue model to commercialize this growing consumer 
behavior, is required. Consumers make extensive use of services to the users to promote their goods, engage with end-
consumers, and collect cash, according to our qualitative research. These business enterprises are mainly carried out 
for free on websites, although they may normally generate cash. Our computational results show that two charging 
schemes generate virtually comparable earnings over a period.

This paper reviews and analyses the use of LWA (light-weight aggregates) and precursor materials as cement 
substitutions from unused waste materials that partially cause environmental pollution. The purpose of this 
research is to find out, identify and analyse efforts to improve the quality of environmentally friendly structural 
lightweight concrete through a review of mechanical characteristics, workability, permeability, durability and 
lightweight concrete microstructure. Basically, the use of LWA as a concrete building material lowers the quality 
of concrete, but some precursor materials with certain compositions are able to improve the quality of concrete, 
in addition to the material. Method and composition of the mixture also affect the quality of concrete. Research 
showed the substitution of cement with nano silica, increases quality regarding the percentage of nano silica in 
the mixture, in addition to the pozzolan reaction between cement particles and nanoparticles, depending on the 
concrete ages. The microstructure of lightweight concrete can be repaired and refined. It is hoped that through 
this writing it is able to improve and innovate prospective researches and the industrial sector in the development 
of environmentally friendly structural lightweight concrete in the future.

1. Introduction 
Concrete is one of the most widely used building materials due to the rapid increase of construction. The use of 
normal concrete is considered less effective, because the weight of the contents of concrete is quite large, 
especially in Indonesia, often hit by earthquakes, that needs to be considered and get special treatment in the 
context of the use of concrete as an effort to design earthquake-resistant buildings. The use of cement in the 
concrete production process produces a lot of carbon dioxide gas (CO2) which is one of the factors that cause the 
greenhouse effect. In addition, the number of materials produced both natural and artificial that do not have added 
value, unused and some potentially cause pollution. Because of this problem, there has been a lot of researches 
on environmentally friendly lightweight concrete. 
 
According to (SNI 03-2847-2002, 2002) Lightweight concrete has a density of less than 1900 kg / m3.  There are 
several ways to make lightweight concrete including using light aggregates, not using sand and making air 
cavities. According to research (Wongkvanklom et al., 2018) generally light concrete composed of light 
aggregates including pumice stone, scoria, volcanic ""cinder,"" diatomite, expanded or the result of clay burning, 
shale, slate, perlite, vermiculite, slag or coal and the results of combustion residue. (Lee et al., 2019) through the 
use of Oil Palm Boiler Clinker (OPBC) and Lightweight Expanded Clay Aggregates (LECA) with 
superplasticizers capable of producing lightweight concrete with high quality above 40 MPa. The same thing is 
shown (Huda et al., 2018) through the use of palm waste in the form of Oil Palm Shell (OPS) and Palm Oil Clinker 
(POC) with superplasticizer and w / c of 0.35 capable of producing lightweight concrete with a quality of 30-50 
Mpa. (Dolatabad et al., 2020) use LWA in the form of perlite, scoria, and LECA in the manufacture of lightweight 
concrete using superplasticizers capable of producing concrete with a quality of 20-35 MPa. The following 
material is an aggregate that has a light density, which dominates the composition of concrete as a light concrete 
production effort. In addition, the use of cement substitution uses cementitious material as an effort to improve

4. Conclusions 
Based on the analysis and review of various research references related to efforts to improve the quality of 
structural lightweight concrete conducted on a review basis, it can be concluded in this writing that: 
1. 
In an effort to improve the quality of structural lightweight concrete needs to be used cementitious materials 
including silica fume, metakaolin, micro silica, rice husk ash, fly ash and GGBFS. The results of analysis 
from previous research showed that the use of the material was able to increase the mechanical characteristics 
of concrete and lower the density of structural lightweight concrete except with GGBFS. The increase in the 
percentage of GGBFS shows a less satisfactory result where compressive strength, and splitting tensile 
strength decreases, but the density of concrete can be reduced, this is evidenced by the specific gravity that 
is smaller than cement. According to the authors of cementitious the most optimal material in terms of 
improving the quality of lightweight concrete is nano silica with a percentage of substitution below 10% 
against binders. 
2. 
The use of Lightweight Aggregates (LWA) both natural and artificial lightweight aggregates including 
LECA, EPA, EPS, PA, OPC, OPBC significantly determines the mechanical characteristics, workability and 
density of structural lightweight concrete. Broadly speaking, the use of light aggregates (LWA) shows the 
result of the percentage of LWA substitution against fine aggregates, as well as coarse aggregates inversely 
proportional to the compressive strength, flexural strength, splitting tensile strength, density and slump of 
structural lightweight concrete. According to the authors, the most optimal material for use as a structural 
lightweight concrete constituent is OPS or palm shell shown through research (Aslam et al., 2017) with a 
composition of 100% OPS able to reach a compressive strength of 53 MPa with a density of 1790 kg / m3 
3. 
Through the concrete microstructure from relevant references, it can be seen that the use of lightweight 
aggregates makes the composition of concrete more porous than normal concrete, while the use of precursor 
materials gives a significant influence along with the age of concrete where the pores, sticking power 
becomes better, which affects the mechanical characteristics of lightweight concrete, porosity, permeability 
and durability of lightweight concrete.

1. Introduction 
Jakarta as the capital city of Indonesia, is an area that has been built quite massively, so that until now green open 
space is only 14.9% of the entire city area. To achieve 30% green open space, the efforts made are to utilize every 
open space to be planted with annual and perennial plants. Therefore, PT Indonesia Power Priok POMU n which a 
power generation company operating in the North Jakarta area, committed to conduct plantation and conservation 
program, both in office area and community housing. The main aims of the company is to build a harmonious 
relationship in the midst of a sustainable environment and can provide the widest benefits to meet the expectations of 
stakeholders, and always operates in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and even seeks to exceed 
them. 
 
In line with the implementation of conservation programs in the Taman Hati, Sunter Agung, Priok POMU, and 
Warakas areas, Priok POMU considers it necessary to collect data and evaluate information on the status of 
biodiversity that has been managed in these programs by external parties and is expected to describe the 
implementation of the program. objectively and provide a new perspective in improving the program. The company 
committed to participate in the protection of biodiversity. This commitment is the implementation of environmentally 
sound development policies according to Law Number 32 of 2009 concerning Environmental Protection and 
Management and Regulation of the Minister of the Environment of Indonesia Number 3 of 2014 concerning the

6. Conclusion 
There are several things that can be concluded from the Biodiversity Protection Program, namely: this program has 
an important role because it is in line with local government programs to develop green open spaces and urban 
agriculture. Program management has been carried out with a comprehensive approach, with the involvement of other 
parties such as local governments, companies, community organizations, and universities in implementing programs 
that have been running well. The continuity of the program is very important to improve and develop the sustainability 
of the capital's biodiversity which must be maintained for the sustainability of the succession of life. 
 
By looking at the significant impact of the biodiversity protection program, several things need to be developed in the 
future. Recommendations for the Development of Mangrove Coastal Protection Areas in the PT Indonesia Power POMU 
Priok Area: The need for additional types of annual plants such as fruits in coastal ecosystem areas, special maintenance 
of mangrove plants and the addition of new types of mangrove plants and quick response actions when erosion occurs 
when planting seedlings new mangroves. Recommendations for Tabulampot Development: development of post-harvest 
techniques and cultivation, improvement and maintenance of plants and procurement of seedlings from Tabulampot 
saplings to be planted in various places. Recommendations for the Development of Nurseries and Hydroponics: 
development of post-harvest and cultivation techniques, Development of organic nutrition from local raw materials, 
improvement and maintenance of plants and verticulture and improvement and maintenance of plant seeds are needed 
specifically and intensively. 
 
Recommendations for the development of the PKK RW 05 liver garden: addition of plant species, increased 
production with intensive cultivation techniques and verticulture and development of post-harvest techniques. 
Greennesia Warakas Village Development Recommendations: addition of plant species, increased production with 
intensive cultivation techniques and verticulture and development of post-harvest techniques.

Abstract 
The bad stigma in traditional markets has resulted in some of the visitors looking for alternative shopping places. 
Existing market management has not been able to anticipate changes that occur in society. The existence of modern 
retail rivals traditional markets. The emergence of several new business models such as e-commerce and market places 
has made consumer spending patterns shift from conventional to digital. The purpose of this study is to analyze the 
internal and external factors of traditional markets, formulate traditional market competitiveness strategies using the 
SWOT matrix and formulate traditional market priority competitiveness strategies using the analytical hierarchy 
process (AHP). This research was conducted in the traditional market of Cicurug, Sukabumi Regency, Indonesia. The 
sample used in this study were 4 market experts. The sample was selected by the judgment sampling method. The 
method used is descriptive exploratory. The data is processed using AHP. The result of IFE calculation is 3.093 and 
EFE is 2.82975 so it can be concluded that market conditions are in quadrant IV in the IFE and EFE matrix with 
suggestions for using a diversification strategy. The weighting using the AHP method shows that the strategy with the 
highest value is the strategy (SO).

1. Introduction 
The development of digital technology and the presence of innovations in the digital field have changed many things 
in life. This digital innovation effect causes massive disruption. Disruption is a digital innovation, disruption replaces 
old technology that is all physical with digital technology that produces something new and more efficient and more 
useful (Prihanisetyo, et al., 2018; Andria, et al., 2021). Various activities underwent changes, these changes turned 
out to provide comfort to users due to the speed and ease of access offered. One of them is consumer behavior in 
shopping that wants to be more practical, it can be noticed that people have started to get used to shopping online 
(Natasuwarna, 2019). Eriyanto (2018), said that the trend of online shopping occurred with the rapid development of 
e-commerce companies and market places. 
The development of this transaction has a disruptive effect on the conventional market. When the platform changes, 
consumers also move indirectly (Tsaniyah and Ayu, 2019). Most of businesses are failed due to the lack of innovation, 
or innovative capacity, as well as, lack of technology adoption and or disruptive technology aiding on overall firm‚Äôs 
performance (Muharam, 2020). The advantages of the online shopping system make the conventional market begin 
to dim. Conventional markets are physical places where buyers and sellers gather to exchange goods and services 
(Suryani, 2016). One of the conventional markets is the modern market. Examples of modern markets are 
supermarkets, hypermarkets, supermarkets, and minimarkets. According to Rusham (2016), the modern market for 
consumer goods is retail. Currently in the world, there are so many modern markets that open online shopping places 
because they are afraid to be disrupted by digital innovation, and start joining e-commerce and market places.  
Similar to modern markets, traditional markets need to keep up with the times to improve their competitiveness. The 
concept of traditional markets which are identical to dirty, slum, smelly, causes people to be uncomfortable shopping 
(Sari and Indra, 2017). Such conditions have made many traditional markets revitalized into semi-modern markets by 
the government to increase their competitiveness. According to Yunesa (2017), semi-modern markets are markets that

Furthermore, after selecting a strategy (SO), the strategy (SO) can be assessed for the advantages and disadvantages 
of each alternative by sorting the alternative local priority values for each sub-criteria, a high priority value indicates 
the advantages of the alternative and vice versa. The consideration of determining this strategy is supported by the 
advantages of the strategy (SO), which is always high in value compared to other strategies.

Abstract 
 
The capital market is a long-term financial instrument that can be traded: debt securities (bonds), equities (stocks), 
mutual funds, derivatives, and others. It is the companies and other institutions' investment activities. Currently, 
Indonesia Stock Exchange was traded the securities automatically using computer facilities, namely Jakarta 
Automated Trading System Next Generation (JATS-NG). Thus, the study's primary purpose is to formulate an 
investment strategy to avoid macroeconomic risks in the Indonesian capital market. So that more people can trade in 
financial instruments of the Indonesian capital market using an integrated online transaction system. The design of 
this study is a quantitative approach involving 20 State-Owned Enterprises (BUMN) listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange taken from 2016 to 2020. The data source is annual financial statements and analyzed using Moderated 
Regression Analysis (MRA) by assisting statistical software, namely E-VIEWS 10. The results of this study indicated 
the inflation rate has a significant effect on capital market investment returns in Indonesia. Also, the stock trading 
transaction model with the JATS-NG method has dramatically facilitated stock trading transactions.

Abstract 
 
Employee performance refers to a person's success during a certain period in carrying out tasks compared to various 
possibilities, such as work standards, targets, goals, and criteria. The employee's performance is affected by the work 
environment, quality of work-life and organizational commitment. This study aims to analyze the mediating role of 
organizational commitment in the relationship between work environment and quality of work-life on employee 
performance. This research is designed using a quantitative approach through a survey questionnaire on 400 
respondents. This study found that Work Environment and Quality of Work Life have a significant effect on Employee 
Performance. Therefore, organizational commitment mediates the relationship between Work Environment and 
Employee Performance. Meanwhile, Organizational Commitment does not mediate the relationship between Quality 
of Work Life and Employee Performance. Thus, we concluded that organizational commitment plays an essential role 
in mediating between Work Environment and Employee Performance. Also, Work Environment and Quality of Work 
have significantly predicted employee performance.

Abstract 
 
Job transfer is a way for an individual to obtain more experience and exposure. Because fewer individuals inhabit each 
successive layer as they ascend the organizational hierarchy, it is frequently more available than a promotion. Various 
strategies for implementing activities continue to be developed by both Human Resources (HR) practitioners and 
researchers who regulate the organizational structure, human capital, employee performance, employee satisfaction, 
and task execution. Many studies have been conducted to identify the factors that influence employee transfer 
positions. This study aims to provide an overview of other factors that can encourage the success of job transfer. This 
study explicitly analyzes the content and context of the relationship between job transfer and organization, resources, 
learning and development, rewards, and employment relationships. This study uses a qualitative method by reviewing 
27 journals from previous researchers. This study showed an association between variables such as organization, 
resources, learning and development, remuneration, and employee relations on the transfer of positions either directly 
or indirectly through motivation as an intermediate variable. Furthermore, this study found that organization, 
resources, learning and development, remuneration and employment relations, remuneration and employment 
relations affect directly or indirectly the transfer of positions. Thus, we expected to provide a new theory in predicting 
employee performance improvement through job transfers for improving organizational performance.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has been changed the view of poverty, and it is very fast and urgently requires affirmative 
policy. The COVID-19 has a significant impact on the economy and health, children's education, and unemployment. 
The Central Bureau of Statistics reported that the number of low-income families in Indonesia's urban and rural areas 
in 2020 was 26.42 million. The figure was increased as many as 5.09 percent compared to 2019 is 25.14 million. This 
issue is difficult to overcome due to budget constraints. Many policies have been implemented to reduce poverty 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its efforts do not show significant results. This study aims to analyze the 
implementation of poverty alleviation policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pekalongan Regency, Indonesia. 
This mixed methodology study was collected data by conducting surveys with 150 respondents and in-depth 
interviews with 10 low-income families, community leaders, and local government actors. The results showed that 
poverty alleviation policies during the COVID-19 pandemic had not been fully implemented. The inhibiting factors 
are the accessibility of the poor to poverty programs and activities, the high number of poor people affected by 
COVID-19, and the priority of local government funds being diverted to deal with COVID-19.

Abstract 
 
Education in Islamic boarding schools, general education, and accounting education prioritize ethics and morals in 
educating their students. This study wants to identify the products of Islamic boarding school education, general 
education, and accounting education related to the ethics of preparing financial statements. This paper examines the 
differences in perceptions between boarding school caregivers, students majoring in accounting, and non-accounting 
students on the ethics of preparing financial statements. Indicators for the ethics of preparing financial statements are 
earnings management, misstatement, disclosure, cost-benefit, and responsibility. The survey data was collected from 
9 Islamic boarding school caregivers, 21 accounting students, and 64 non-accounting students at Islamic boarding 
schools, Al Bismi, Central Java. ANOVA analyses were employed to test the hypotheses. The ANOVA test results 
showed no difference in perceptions between the boarding school caregivers, students majoring in accounting, and 
non-accounting students on the ethics of preparing financial statements. However, there are differences in perceptions 
of Islamic Boarding School Accounting PSAK in the group of students majoring in accounting and non-accounting 
students. Furthermore, the perceptions between boarding school caregivers and students majoring in accounting and 
non-accounting students differed in responding to Law Number 18 of 2019 concerning Islamic Boarding Schools.

Abstract 
 
Today, some children in kindergarten are slowly in speech development and need a learning method to develop their 
speaking skills in early childhood, aged 4-5 years old. The purpose of this study was to investigate the application of 
role-playing in developing speaking skills and identify the supporting and inhibiting factors to develop speaking 
children aged 4-5 years in Kindergarten Samarinda, Indonesia. This qualitative study utilized data collection 
techniques of observation, interviews, and documentation. Data sources were taken from primary data, namely 
principals, homeroom teachers, and representatives of the curriculum section, while secondary data were taken from 
the documentation. The data were analyzed using the Miles and Huberman method, using three stages: data reduction, 
data presentation, and conclusion. The results showed that role-playing in developing speaking skills of children aged 
4-5 years in kindergarten is determined by the theme, sub-theme, topic of activities, and the playing tools. A rolling 
system implements it, and the teacher explains the role that the child will play and gives examples and the rules of the 
game about what will be done later when playing.  The teacher then invites the children to choose their roles and then 
reads the children's storyline. After the child understands the activities to be carried out, the teacher invites the child 
to play. Then the teacher's task is to supervise while asking questions to obtain information about the child's playing 
experience while providing examples of communicating by delivering the correct vocabulary. Evaluation in role-
playing is indirect observations while children are playing, the results of children's work, notes while observing 
children's development, and indicators that are the targets of learning.

Abstract 
This research is about the design, development and implementation of a Bluetooth Technology Controlled (BTC) 
wheel chair. The wheelchair was developed to solve the mobility challenges faced by disabled. Though manual 
wheelchairs provide some solution, they pose the challenge of high physical strain. Extensive literature review has 
shown that the existing powered wheelchair technologies have some limitations. These includes requirement of 
complex repetitive body movement and inability to control the wheelchair over a distance. In this regards, this work 
develops a Bluetooth Technology Controlled (BTC) wheelchair which provides the disabled a cost-effective option 
of controlling the wheelchair over a distance, using an input method that is dependable. The design of the electric 
circuit is prepared and used as a guideline for subsequent development stages. A Bluetooth module is used to receive 
input from an android mobile phone. The received signals are processed, and the corresponding actuating signal is 
sent. The completed work is a Bluetooth control system with an android phone as an input device to send signal to 
electric motor that actuate the wheelchair with no requirement for manual propelling by the user or another person. 
The BTC wheelchair is cost efficient compared to existing powered wheelchairs of the same caliber

1. Introduction 
Different types of wheelchairs are designed to meet the need of different users. The most popular distinction is between 
motorized wheelchairs and manually propelled wheelchairs. Manual wheelchairs can either be propelled by the user‚Äôs 
hands or by a third party. It requires constant and strenuous application of upper body muscles of the users.  Thus, 
there is constant demand for an easier method of controlling wheelchairs. According to [1], manual wheel chair has 
been in existence before the advent of motorized wheelchairs. However, inability to navigate through one‚Äôs own house 
single handedly without any assistance is demoralizing [2]. A motorized wheelchair is a wheelchair that is propelled 
by means of an electric motor and can be controlled by the user [3]. They are automated system and involve the use 
of synergistic integration of various components. For instance, the Head Movement Tracking Technique(HMTT) is a 
common method used to control powered wheelchairs. In this method, head movements are proportionately 
transformed into cursor movements on the screen and the motion parameters are calculated by using accelerometer. 
However, disabled with cerebral palsy ailment cannot move their head comfortably. This limits the application of this 
method [4].  
 
A system was proposed by [5] that uses a small camera mounted very close to the user‚Äôs hand, which tracks the small 
movements of user fingers to understand the direction of movement of the wheelchair. A gesture recognition system 
which identifies the gesture is then interfaced to the wheelchair control system in order to move it to the desired 
location. Nevertheless, this product was limited as it required complex and continuous hand motion by already 
disabled. [6] presented a reliable means for human-computer interfacing based on hand gestures made in three 
dimensions, which could be interpreted and adequately used in controlling a remote robot's movement. The authors 
discussed the development of a novel architecture of an intelligent wheelchair working on wireless hand gesture 
control and not by the usual method of keypad for the physically handicapped people. The locomotion of the 
wheelchair was controlled by a microcontroller. This work‚Äôs limitation was its constant requirement of a cellular

Therefore, a battery supplying a Voltage of 1.2 Volts with at least 1.6 Ampere Hour (AH) ratings will supply the 
required power to the motor. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
5.1 Proposed Improvement 
To improve mobility, safety and accessibility, the latest digital technology can be applied for improvements. Using 
the concept of digital twinning which is stored on a cloud computing platform, a detailed map can be accessed on the 
wheelchair, allowing it to navigate its way round its environment safely.  
5.2 Validation 
To validate the accuracy of the system developed in this work, a manual wheelchair and the wheelchair developed in 
this work were given to 2 individuals with difficulties in walking. The individual with the wheelchair developed in 
this system experienced ease in navigating rather than using a manual wheelchair. It was seen to be less tiring and 
durable over a period of time. 
6. Conclusion 
Manual wheelchairs have failed to provide a dependable and easy to use option for disabled. This problem brought 
about the development of the motorized wheelchair with various methods of input mechanisms. The BTC wheelchair 
is developed with the knowledge that a large percentage of the population makes use of android devices, any of which 
would function properly at no additional costs to the user. The BTC wheelchair provides a cheaper and reliable 
alternative to existing in accordance with the aims and objectives that were earlier stated. The BTC wheel chair is 
therefore recommended over the existing motorized wheel chair.

Abstract 
 
After the Tsunami in Aceh, the conflict between the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and the Government of Indonesia 
that had lasted more than 30 years could be resolved. The conflict resolution reached a common ground after both 
parties agreed to implement asymmetric decentralization or special autonomy in Aceh. Furthermore, the 
implementation of Special Autonomy is regulated in Law Number 11 of 2006 concerning the Government of Aceh, 
namely the use of the Flag and Emblem for Aceh. This study examines the causes of differences of opinion between 
the Central Government and the Government of Aceh regarding Qanun No. 3 of 2013 concerning the Aceh Flag and 
Coat of Arms. The study is designed using a qualitative approach by interviewing 15 informants in-depth. The results 
indicated that the conflict between the Central Government and the Aceh Government concerns the Aceh Flag and 
Coat of Arms due to perceptions and interpretations of the Crescent Star flag and the Bouraq-Lion symbol, which 
have similarities with the flag and logo used by the Aceh Movement. Merdeka (GAM) and Government Regulation 
Number 77 of 2007 concerning Regional Emblems. Conflict resolution is deadlocked because the two parties involved 
in the conflict still maintain their respective views. This conflict resolution deadlock has impacted the form of illegally 
raising the moon and star flag by Acehnese people, decreasing Acehnese support for the Aceh Party, and strengthening 
the seeds of the disintegration of the Aceh region. This study indicates the special autonomy area is applied as part of 
the consensus on conflict resolution may occur if the previous agreement is not carried out as agreed.

Abstract 
 
The government has given special autonomy (OTSUS) to the Papua province in managing funds and implementing 
self-government based on independence. Special autonomy aims to increase the trust of the Papuan people in 
improving their welfare. However, the huge special autonomy funds have not been able to impact development in 
Papua Province significantly. Various problems still occur in Papua, such as poor nutrition, measles, uneven 
development, and a high poverty level. This study aims to analyze the management of special autonomy funds from 
a good governance perspective in Papua Province. This type of research is descriptive with a qualitative approach 
carried out by literature studies on scientific journals, books, documents, websites, and other sources. The results show 
that the Papuan government has not fully implemented the basic principles of good governance, namely transparency, 
participation, accountability, law enforcement, and anti-corruption. The development of the Papua Province requires 
better governance so that the Papua Special Autonomy policy runs more effectively, efficiently and has a broad impact 
on improving the welfare of the Papuan people.

Abstract 
 
American society is multicultural due to many ethnicities, cultures, religions, and denominations besides applying 
democratic principles as the cornerstone of its social-political system. It does not happen spontaneously, though. 
American multicultural society is a result of a long historical trace since its colonial era. One of the colonies assumed 
to have contributed to the presence of the early American multicultural society is the Pennsylvania colony. In this 
regard, this paper then intends to propose some strategies William Penn conducted as the proprietor in founding the 
Pennsylvania colony for such multicultural fact. This paper uses Nash Smith‚Äôs interdisciplinary approach through 
which two perspectives are coming up, i.e., historical and literary ones. This study found that William Penn conducted 
three strategies, namely: (1) promoting an equal relation through friendship, (2) providing a clause of toleration in the 
First Frame of Government serving as a constitution of the colony, and (3) acknowledging each ethnic group‚Äôs life 
and liberty. The first was conducted to persuade the ethnic groups, particularly the Indians, to willingly live peacefully 
with the white people, as depicted in a poem, Treaty of Penn. The second was designed to provide a legal basis that 
guaranteed all people to live with mutual trust. The last functions are an applicative form of the second and real proof 
of William Penn‚Äôs commitment issued in his letter written in London before founding the Pennsylvania colony. These 
strategies appeared due to the influence of William Penn‚Äôs conviction in Quakerism that generally taught him to look 
all human beings equal regardless of any differences such as race, sex, nation, religion, language, and others.

Abstract 
 
This study discusses the use of big data and artificial intelligence in policy making in Indonesia by focusing on the 
ability of policy makers in policy making. The method used in this paper is qualitative research with a literature study 
approach. We reviewed articles with related themes as many as 25 articles published in the last five years from 
ScienceDirect. The result of this research is that the dynamics that exist in the implementation of public services 
require appropriate and fast decision making, considering that this is a community demand. Therefore, public leaders 
need to disrupt themselves in public services so that these services can be served quickly by enriching skills in big 
data and artificial intelligence. In conclusion, big data and artificial intelligence can help public leaders make decisions 
to deliver the best policies.

Abstract 
 
Recently, Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) has garnered considerable attention due to intensified 
sensitivity towards environmental protection and social responsibility. Since that the suppliers are at the first entity 
any supply chain network, organization should carefully select their suppliers towards sustainability to achieve SSCM. 
Moreover, in recent years, an increasing awareness has encouraged the incorporation of sustainability and circular 
economy (CE) thinking in supply chain paradigms. Therefore, this study conducted upon reviewing literature a list of 
23 supplier selection criteria towards sustainability performance in the context of CE with four dimensions (Economic, 
Environment, Social, and Circular). In order to evaluate the literature gap in practice, an empirical analysis about the 
process of selecting suppliers towards sustainability and CE in practice is verified through five in-depth interviews in 
large multinational firms in different sectors followed by undertaking a questionnaire survey with 46 experts in the 
field of supply chain management to measure the importance levels of the proposed criteria and to what extent they 
can be used in real-life practice. To analyze the data of the questionnaire, various statistical techniques were applied 
(Relative Importance Index (RII) and Mann-Whitney U-test). The results of the RII showed that the 23 criteria 
categorized as High and High-Medium levels. Furthermore, according to the analysis of Mann-Whitney U test, it 
showed that there is a significant relationship between the importance levels of the proposed criteria and the 
applicability of them to be implemented in real-life corporate practices.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, particularly with the competitive worldwide showcase, most of the business organizations have 
emphasized how it is imperative to their business to engage to sustainability in their operations (Gaziulusoy and 
Brezet, 2015). This is due to the increasing of customer knowledge and awareness beside the ecological pressures 
from markets and various stakeholders (Luthra et al., 2017). In addition, there have been new regulations for carbon 
and waste management which increase the awareness about the sustainability issues which force such organizations 
to reconsider their supply chains with respect to the sustainability objectives ‚ÄòEconomic, Social and 
Environmental‚Äô(Vahidi et al., 2018). Supply chains are arrangements of firms that work together in a network that 
continuously need to overhaul their operations both upstream and downstream(Mavi and Shahabi, 2015).  
 
Coordination between supply chain partners within the frame of effective communication is a must for effective supply 
chain towards sustainability (Kusi-Sarpong et al., 2019). Moreover, organizations have to coordinate sustainability on 
their supply chains as a cruel of managing their supply chain risks such as environmental harms and work debate, 
which may result in supply chain disruption (Gouda and Saranga, 2018).  While managing the supply chain, the 
process of supplier selection is one of the critical issues faced the purchasing managers to assist organizations retain 
their competitive position (Chen, Lin and Huang, 2006). Moreover, commodity and price-based supplier relationships 
are no longer acceptable for suppliers of critical materials or for organizations that seek to introduce innovative supply 
chain management issues, especially those that focus on sustainability concern (Bai and Sarkis, 2010). Therefore, 
supplier selection has received broad consideration in the literature (Gold and Awasthi, 2015; Orji and Wei, 2015; Li, 
Diabat and Lu, 2020). Simultaneously, in recent years, an increasing awareness has encouraged the incorporation of 
sustainability and circular economy (CE) thinking in supply chain paradigms (Chain and Zanin, 2019; Pieroni,

ABSTRACT 
 
 
Apartment development projects in Surabaya must be under their use and meet the requirements of 
safety, health, comfort, convenience, and efficient use of resources. It will not work well if its position as a source of 
energy for the community does not function actively, with excellent capabilities. One of the reasons for the success 
of the architectural development blueprint is the ability of its workforce. By implementing occupational safety and 
health programs on construction projects, workers will feel safer while improving their abilities. Researchers 
interviewed, monitored, and distributed questionnaires to 52 apartment construction project workers to obtain test 
information. The elasticity measured is the variable of work safety (X1), occupational health (X2), and work 
productivity (Y). The analysis uses several methods, namely experimental research instruments (validity and 
reliability), classical assumptions, multiple linear regression analysis, experimental f, and t. Here, the impact of the 
implementation of the occupational safety and health program on the work productivity of PT. Tata Bumi Raya in 
the Surabaya apartment development project has reached 90%. The results of the calculation of R squared, which are 
processed with SPSS 22, is 0.898. So, the X1 variable of health and safety X2 influences the Y variable of work 
productivity.

1.   The impact of the application of occupational safety and health programs on the work productivity of 
PT. Tata Bumi Raya in the Surabaya City Apartment construction project is already 90%. The result 
of the calculation of R squared processed with SPSS 26 is 0.898. 
2.   Work safety (X1) and occupational health (X2) variables provide positive results. As a result, the 
company's program implementation is positive. 
3.   There is an important influence between occupational safety, health programs, and productivity. 
From the calculation results, we can see F of 216.492 with a significance number (sig) of 0.00 < 
0.05, and F arithmetic > F table (216.492 > 3, 18). So, Ho is rejected, which means the work safety 
(X1) and occupational health (X2) programs together have an important participation in labor 
productivity (Y).

Abstract 
 
This study aims to analyze the performance of XYZ Private Higher Education when measured using the 
Balanced Scorecard with four perspectives, that are Finance, Customers, Internal Business Processes, and 
Learning and growth. The research uses a qualitative descriptive approach with a case study approach. 
The research was carried out in the period from May 2021 to the end of June 2021. The populations in 
this study were Lecturers, Educational Staff, and Students in PTS XYZ. This research was conducted 
using mixed quantitative and qualitative methods. The results show that the financial, consumer, and 
internal business approaches can show good performance, but the learning and growth approach shows 
poor performance. Based on the performance measurement of PTS XYZ, in general, the performance 
shows success, but from the perspective of learning and growth, various breakthrough strategies are still 
needed to improve PTS XYZ's performance in the future.

universities are supported by fees paid by students for their education, there is a natural link between student 
satisfaction and the existence of these institutions. There are a lot of elements that have inspired this research and 
have come out of it that isn't related to it. (5) Budget control is one of the simplest and most critical aspects of an 
organization's existence and development. Budget control should be assigned with strategic goals and by the 
situation; the organization's goals policy should be used. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The conclusions that can be drawn in this study are: 
1) That PT XYZ is currently running operations using a Quality Management system based on ISO 9001:2001 as a 
work standard to ensure quality procedures for processes that have been established and run well. Succeeded in 
maintaining certification for 6 consecutive years. 
2) The implementation of the Balanced scorecard for the performance evaluation and assessment system is more 
complete so that the University can conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation on four perspectives, 
namely the Financial perspective, the Customer perspective, the Internal Business Perspective, the Growth, and 
Learning perspective. 
3) A balanced scorecard produces measures of factors and strategic objectives that have been successful and 
factors that have not been successful so that the University can take various strategic actions to achieve the 
vision and mission that have been set. 
Some things that can be suggested by researchers on the results of this study are as follows. 
1) The application of the balanced scorecard, in general, is suitable to be applied at PT XYZ 
2) Evaluation of the success of strategic policies on the balanced scorecard should use a shorter period, for 
example using the semester, mid-semester, or month period. So that short-term strategic actions can be taken 
immediately. 
3) The target set for each strategic measurement in this study is based on the achievements in the previous period, 
it is better to consider the presence of competitors in the future so that the University is finally able to win its 
business competition.

ABSTRACT 
The management of a building facility will begin after the construction of a  building is completed and submitted 
to the owner of the building. It is an ongoing process for the cycle of a building. The main purpose is to ensure 
that the function of all facilities in the building can run optimally such as equipment, space, furniture, and others 
so that if the management and maintenance of all facilities in a building / Building are not done properly, 
correctly, and scheduled will cause many problems, especially for the owner and manager of the building. So that 
all facilities in the building/building must always be maintained and maintained so that it is always in good 
condition and not damaged. Because if negligent in the maintenance process it will be able to cause losses for the 
owner and building.  Judging from the background above, at this time there is a technology that can help in the 
management of existing facilities, namely BIM (Building Information Modelling) technology.   Building 
Information Modelling (BIM) is required as one solution to provide information,  geometric models, and 
information about the interests (rights, limitations, and obligations) attached to building objects. Three-
dimensional geometric models can be obtained through a system-using approach to Building Information 
Modelling (BIM), as they are considered feasible and have the potential ability to model three-dimensional 
ownership rights. The three-dimensional framework of the building can be obtained from modeling from 
Autodesk Revit Software  (one of the wearable software).  The application of BIM methods in 3D (three-
Dimensional) integration, provides information directly related to assets,  building utility systems,  as well as other 
information such as type, dimensions, and other semantic information attached to permodelan created. The 
collection of attributes of the 3D model can be used as information for facility management needs as well as 
information that supports the management of facilities such as asset management/inventory of space/building 
and standardization in the management of facilities based on Building Information Modelling (BIM).

1. BACKGROUND 
The management of a building facility will begin after the construction of a building is completed and 
submitted to the owner of the building. It is an ongoing process for the cycle of a building. The main purpose 
is to ensure that the function of all facilities in the building can run optimally such as equipment, space, 
furniture, and others. A building cannot run well without good facility management because it includes all 
activities that integrate between administration, asset management, maintenance, contract management, 
renovation, repair, and others. Judging from the background above, there is currently a technology that can 
help in the management of existing facilities, namely BIM (Building Information Modelling) technology, 
where this technology has been widely used in the phase for design or planning, especially in detecting 
integration between each work to minimize disputes/clashes between these jobs, but very little research is 
used.  Bim technology is carried out in the operational and maintenance stages of abuilding.   BIM  
(Building Information Modelling) technology is an approach that is done thoroughly in the design 
and planning phase, currently widely used in that phase. But in the management of facilities in a 
building, the use of  BIM Technology (Building Information Modelling) has not been done optimally, 
case studies and documented literature have identified a lot of data information made in modeling is often 
misinterpreted so that the input provided gives a false perception so that data input in the form of models 
cannot provide solutions.  Better especially during the design and construction phase so that in the later stages

5.1. CONCLUSION 
Based on the research that has been done, BIM technology is widely discussed and thoroughly 
researched only at the planning, design, and construction stages. While in the stage of managing existing 
facilities in the framework of maintenance and others BIM technology is still considered a new field. 
Understanding, challenges, and the potential added value of BIM technology for Facility Management 
is very large, so to explore this requires literature studies and case studies, especially those we conducted 
in this research, which through this research is expected to provide solutions for the management of this 
Facility Management.  This research provides evidence that the potential of BIM Technology for 
Facility Management is very necessary, this is mainly derived from  3D Modeling produced through 
BIM technology so that it can provide information that can be used for the management of 
Facility Management so that all sets of attributes/codes or 3D models produced can be used to support 
the management activities of facilities in the Building/building.  So that there will be a management of 
building facilities based on Building Information Modelling (BIM). 
 
5.2. SUGGESTION 
However, some challenges inhibit the exploitation of BIM in Facility Management, the main challenges 
include: 
1. Lack of understanding and knowledge methodologies that show the real benefits of Building 
Information Modelling (BIM) technology in Facility Management, which is reflected in the lack of 
demand and use of bim technology for facility management by building owners/building managers. 
2. Limited knowledge of the requirements for the application of BIM to Facility Management (e.g. 
what information will be provided, when and by whom); Lack of open systems, standardization that 
can be used as a bridge between BIM technology and Facility Management. 
3. The lack of roles, responsibilities, and clear frameworks for bim management, as well as the lack of 
skills of managers and stakeholders to use bim technology in the management of facilities 
management, and there are still many rigid industrial culture approaches to adopting new processes 
and technologies.  
 
The development of BIM specifications and technologies for the management of Facility Management 
that suits the needs of each organization is identified as a key factor for utilizing bim technology-based 
facility management and enabling the organization and its supply chain to work by structured Facility 
Management processes. BIM technology for Facility Management must meet the requirements of the 
building owner, meaning that managers need to understand and articulate the BIM requirements 
including the level of detail required. The different ages of technology, as well as buildings, indicate 
that there are standard technological requirements that need to be considered. The results presented in 
this paper add contributions that can be used by researchers/practitioners to develop BIM methodologies 
and technologies for facility management that can later meet the needs of each building 
manager/organization that suits their individual needs because this is very important for the successful 
implementation of BIM and Facility Management.

Abstract 
 
Within the processing of sulphide ores, there are problems related to the quality of products and the efficient 
use of technological equipment. Usually, such issues are resolved due to the engineering experiences and 
based on mathematical modeling of processes. The mathematical model for optimizing such operating 
mode is a very difficult program. Performing calculations is required a fairly large investment of time and 
resources. In our case, the program of the mathematical model for optimizing the operating mode of the 
processing equipment‚Äôs for sinter firing was replaced with a neural network by implementing the process 
of training the neural networks. The results obtained showed that technologies based on the neural network 
models given a more accurate and adequate results than mathematical models, which made it possible to 
solve processing of ores optimization problems of great complexity. The use of neural networks for 
modeling technological processes has made it possible to increase the efficiency of product quality control 
systems and automatic control systems for the firing of sulfide ores.

1. Introduction 
This part is presented the relevant work and studies of other researchers and practices on the considering questions of 
research. 
 
1.1 Background of Research 
The modeling of complex technological processes in the metallurgical industry is a promising area of application of 
the tools of the theory of artificial neural networks. In this area the using of mathematical models of technological 
processes are necessary for the application of effective modern methods and tools for studying the influence of 
technology on the properties of the final product of the appropriate quality. It is important too for the tasks of 
optimizing control and making high-quality decisions in the processing of the sulphide ores.  
 
In industry productions usually the mathematical models are often simplified, that limiting their actions to certain 
assumptions. Now days in the literature does not provide examples of the widely use of neural networks for modeling 
this kind of dependencies (in particular, in the lead-zinc production of non-ferrous metallurgy), the flexibility of neural

Thus, according to the numerical experiments and the applying the trained neural network, it was possible to get the 
comparative analysis of results of the training and calculation according to the program that provides the determining 
of the surface temperature of metal ores at the end of firing. 
 
 As the result, we have obtained the following outcomes of the training and of the deviations: 
- the neural networks calculation errors in the pallets number in the firing furnace ranged from 11% to 24%; 
- the neural networks calculation errors in the time of firing of pallet blanks ranged from 0.2% to 7%; 
- the neural networks calculation errors in the surface temperature of the pallet blanks were from 0.09% to 3%.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The use of neural networks to simulate technological processes of firing of sulphide ores in metallurgical production 
is provided an increase in the efficiency of product quality control systems and automatic control systems for roasting 
of sulfide polymetallic ores, optimizing production costs by 3%. Also, it increased the efficiency of energy 
reproducing. The optimizing the operating mode of equipment is provided the increasing of effectiveness 10%. 
 
Thus, from the above results, it is obvious that the obtained neural models adequately describe the real processes 
during the processing of sulphide ores and its firing. And it is proving that the research goals of this work are obtained. 
Future, it can be recommended to use for study the process of the firing of the other ores on the metallurgy plant and 
for calculating the design features of a heating and power plant. It can also be used to make forecasts and make instant 
decisions in the designing of any other heat-energy equipment and its optimal control.

Abstract 
 
The problem of purchasing decisions by consumers is based on several things that are no less important. 
Because the purchase decision is the initial door for the company to prove that the product offered is a 
quality product with a level of service that satisfies consumers. Talking about purchasing decisions, the 
company should be able to know the factors that motivate consumers so that they can decide to buy a 
product. The data used in this study is quantitative by using multiple linear regression analysis of the 
finite population, namely all customers of PT. Japfa who made transactions at PT. Japfa, which amounted 
to 55 respondents. Research in the form of a survey is used to obtain data from customers of PT. Japfa is 
natural (not artificial), but the researchers carried out treatments in data collection, by distributing 
questionnaires and structured interviews. The results showed that the service, price, and product quality 
simultaneously had a significant effect on the purchasing decisions of PT. Japfa is the most dominant 
influence on consumer purchasing decisions PT. Japfa is a price variable.

1. Introduction 
The demand for fulfilling customer satisfaction is one of the missions that must be fulfilled because without 
customers any business venture will be meaningless (Pakur√°r et al., 2019). Customer satisfaction is the result of the 
accumulation of consumers or customers in using products and services. Customers will be satisfied if after buying 
the product and using the product it turns out that the quality of the product is good. Satisfaction will occur if the 
company can provide products, services, prices, and other aspects by expectations or exceeding customer 
expectations. Customers will be satisfied if their expectations are met or will be very satisfied if their expectations 
are exceeded (Almsalam, 2014). Five main drivers make customers feel satisfied, namely: product quality, price, 
service quality, emotional factors, related to costs, and ease of obtaining products and services (Zhafirah et al., 
2021). The basic needs of human life include physical needs consisting of food, clothing, and shelter. Where a 
person will try to meet these needs as before meeting the needs of others. PT. Japfa is one of the links in the food 
supply chain, namely poultry feed, especially chicken and eggs. 
However, economic conditions are getting weaker, wherein in 2014, the world bank lowered its projection for global 
economic growth from 3.2% to 2.8% and developing countries from 5.3% to 4.8%. Asian countries, including the 
ASEAN region, are feeling the impact of the weakening economic conditions in the United States and Europe 
(Capannelli, 2014). However, even though economic growth slowed slightly in 2014, developing countries in 
ASEAN remained the fastest-growing region in the world. Indonesia is one of the countries experiencing the impact 
of the global economic slowdown. In addition, Indonesia's economic condition is influenced by the attitude of most 
investors who choose to wait and see towards the Government's work program for the next five years. 
These conditions have an impact on the Indonesian economy in many aspects. Some of the impacts experienced by 
Indonesia were falling commodity prices, lower than expected government spending, slow credit expansion 
followed by an increase in interest rates, a decline in Indonesia's exports abroad, depreciation of the rupiah against 
foreign currencies, and high inflation. These impacts ultimately reduced the purchasing power of consumers in 
2014. Thein consumer purchasing power in 2014. The company faced problems with the declining purchasing 
power will certainly affect the people's purchasing power of poultry. The price of doc and broiler chickens

decisions. Then the smallest average is the performance indicator (X3.1) with an average value of 3,291. Here it 
can be interpreted that performance makes product quality tend to be less good. The relationship between this 
research and management is that management should further improve product quality, especially those related 
to reliability, namely the possibility of failure to use. This can be done by improving product quality, such as a 
better composition of raw materials so that product durability can be accounted for by customers. 
5) Variables that have a dominant influence on customer satisfaction 
Based on the results of multiple linear regression calculations, wherefrom the results of these calculations each 
independent variable consisting of service quality variables (X1), price (X2), and product quality (X3) partially 
all have a significant effect on decisions purchase. Then from the results of the t-test, it is known that the price 
variable has the most dominant influence on consumer purchasing decisions of PT. Japfa in Sidoarjo. About 
management, management should be able to calculate in such a way that it can meet market needs. Please note 
here that the average consumer is a company or product that will be used as one of the raw materials for 
livestock. So that the element of competitive price becomes a separate calculation for consumers. The results of 
this study are in line with the research of Janice et al. (2017) which shows that price is the dominant factor that 
consumers consider when buying a product. This price is related to the economic sacrifices made. 
 
5.  Conclusion  
Based on the results of data analysis and discussions that have been carried out, the conclusions that can be drawn 
from the research are as follows: 
1) The variables of service quality, price, and product quality simultaneously have a significant effect on 
purchasing decisions of PT. japfa. This is by the proof of the hypothesis in the previous chapter, which is 
evidenced by the results of calculations using the multiple linear regression method where the R square (R2) 
number is 0.816 or 81.60% which shows the contribution or contribution of the service quality variable (X1), 
price (X2) and product quality (X3) together or simultaneity on purchasing decisions (Y) is very strong. While 
the rest (100% - 81.60% = 18.40%) was contributed by other variables that were not taken into account in the 
study. And the results of these calculations are also supported by the results of the f test which states that the 
calculated F value is 75,400. Then based on the table value, it is known that the F table in DF (3:51:0.05) is 
2,786 so the calculated F is greater than the F table. Furthermore, from the significance level, it is known that 
the significance value of 0.000 is far below the number (Œ± = 5%) indicating the effect of service quality (X1), 
price (X2), and product quality (X3) together on purchasing decisions (Y) is significant. So that in terms of 
policy determination about purchasing decisions, management should use the variables that exist in the current 
study. 
2) The variables of service quality, price, and product quality partially all have a significant effect on customer 
satisfaction of PT. Animal Feed As evidenced by the t-count for the service quality variable (X1), the t-count 
value is 2.197 > t-table 2.006. The second for the price variable is shown t-count for the price variable (X2) 
shows the t-count value 2.568 < t-table 2.006 and the third for the product quality variable is indicated by the 
results of the t-count calculation for the price variable (X2) shows the t-value. The count for the product quality 
variable (X3) shows the t-count value of 2,277 > t-table of 2,006. 
3) Among the 4 independent variables studied which consist of product quality, price, service quality, and 
distribution variables, the most dominant influence on consumer purchasing decisions PT. Japfa is a price 
variable. This means that price is the main component that can provide a decision in making a purchase. 
4) Among the 4 independent variables studied, which consisted of service quality, price, and product quality 
variables, which had the least effect on the purchasing decision of PT. Japfa is a service quality variable.

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of leadership style and work environment on work motivation to 
improve employee performance. The approach used is parametric quantitative with the method of Structural Equation 
Model. The object of the research is the employees of the production division of PT Suparma Tbk. The results of this 
study indicate that leadership style has no significant positive effect on work motivation; the work environment has a 
positive and significant effect on employees' work motivation; leadership style has no significant negative effect on 
employee performance; work environment has no significant positive effect on employee performance; and work 
motivation has a positive and significant effect on employee performance. The intervening variable Y, namely work 
motivation can be explained by exogenous variables, the leadership style variable (X1) and the work environment 
(X2) of 55.4%, and the remaining 44.6% is a variable outside model. While the endogenous variable Z, namely 
employee performance, can be explained by the variable work motivation (Y), work environment (X1), and leadership 
style (X2) by 94.1%, and the remaining 5.9% is explained by variables outside the model. By calculating the sub-
structural equation 1 is Y = 0.053X_1 + 1.065X_2 + 0.833, and the calculation of the sub-structural equation 2 is Z = 
-0.193X_1 + 0.529X_2 + 0.723Y + 0.338.

Introduction  
The Company as a business entity is an organizational unit with input resources in the form of materials and labor that 
are combined and processed to produce output in the form of production of goods and services to meet customer needs 
(Rivai, 2008:2). Based on this definition, the company is seen as an organizational unit that does not only aim to 
maximize profits and meet the needs of society. As an organizational unit, the company also wants to maintain its 
business continuity and the desire to develop. To achieve this goal, a company management is needed that manages 
and combines the existing production factors (inputs) effectively and efficiently.  
 
Along with the development of the business climate and management science, human resource management is 
becoming an increasingly important function in a company's business organization. This is due to a change in views 
on labor factors, in this case employees. Employees used to be considered only as one of the factors of production 
such as machines. But now, along with the increasing role of employees in carrying out company functions, employees 
are now seen as one of the partners to achieve company goals. (Robbins,2009:250) Good management of human 
resources (HR) will have a positive impact on the company's overall performance and the company's efforts to achieve 
its goals. Good management of human resources is intended to mean the success of management to synergize the 
perceptions and perspectives of employees with the company's goals. Gibson (1997) states that the performance of an 
organization is determined by the contribution of individual and group performance within the organization. This 
means that when the performance of a company's employees is good, it will improve the company's overall 
performance.  
 
Employee performance is an employee's individual achievement which is measured based on the standards and criteria 
set by the company both in quantity and quality. Robbins (2008: 313) states that, there are three criteria that are

Direct and Indirect Effect  
Analysis The effect is intended to see how strong the influence of an independent variable on the dependent variable 
is either directly or indirectly. The interpretation of these results will provide input in the selection of a clear strategy. 
As the theoretical study and hypothesis testing that have been described previously, the work environment and 
leadership style will have a direct or indirect effect on employee performance. The indirect effect is the influence of 
work environment variables and leadership style on employee performance through employee work motivation. The 
results of testing the direct and indirect effects can be summarized as follows:

Based on the comparative results of the calculation of direct and indirect effects in table 4.18, it can be seen that the 
direct and indirect influence of the work environment on employee performance is much higher when compared to 
leadership style which does not significantly affect employee performance either directly or indirectly.   
 
The direct influence of the work environment on employee performance is 0.529 while the indirect effect is 1.788. 
This shows that the employee's work environment will be able to improve employee performance mediated by work 
motivation factors.  
 
 
 
Conclusions and Recommendations  
Conclusion  
1. leadership style has a positive effect not significantly influence employee motivation PT Suparma Tbk  
2. work environment is positive and significant impact on employee motivation PT Suparma Tbk  
3. style of leadership, significant negative effect on the performance of employees of PT Suparma Tbk  
4. work environment positive effect was not significant to the performance employees of PT Suparma Tbk  
5. Work motivation has a positive and significant effect on the performance of employees of PT Suparma Tbk.  
 
Suggestions  
1. For the company, based on the results of this study, PT Suparma Tbk is advised to:  
a. Improve the competence of the production team leader in managing the production employees who are his 
subordinates.  
b. Improve the management of Hygiene factors which are the determinants of the motivation of production 
employees in improving their performance.  
c. Improve interpersonal relationships between superiors and subordinates to create a conducive work 
environment  
  
2. For future research, based on the results of this study, it is hoped that future research will:

Abstract 
 
This study aims to describe the Thematic Community Service Program (KKNT) activities that have been carried out 
by Maarif Hasyim Latif University (Umaha). This research uses a descriptive qualitative approach. Collecting 
activities are carried out using documentation, namely collecting various information, data, and documents that 
support thematic KKN activities. Data collection is also done using interviews. Interviews were conducted with 
students and field assistant lecturers who were involved in thematic KKN activities. Data analysis was carried out 
using qualitative descriptive analysis. KKNT's activities in the field of digital entrepreneurship are in line with 
current conditions. Digitizing MSMEs is the process of using technology and information in business processes, so 
business processes are not just reported on what MSME business processes are, starting from analysis, design, 
promotion, marketing, transactions, and customer satisfaction. Learning in the Merdeka Campus, especially the 
KKNT program provides challenges and opportunities for the development of creativity, capacity, personality, and 
student needs, as well as developing independence in seeking and finding knowledge through realities and field 
dynamics such as ability requirements, real problems, social interaction, collaboration, self-management, 
performance demands, targets, and achievements.

Abstract 
 
As the volume of data recorded from systems increases, there is a need to effectively analyse this data to gain insights 
about the system. One such analysis requirement is anomaly detection. Data-driven approaches such as machine 
learning, are by construction, able to learn (to some degree) the underlying representations in the data and consequently 
identify a hyperplane which separates the normal point states from the anomalous ones. In most cases the data is not 
linear in the parameter space, does not possess apparent trends or periodic seasonality and is noisy. In this work, we 
develop models for anomaly detection analysing data obtained from the networking devices of the ATLAS Data 
Acquisition System (comprising approximately 10 000 interfaces polled at 30 seconds intervals). The selection of 
algorithms was based on robustness and interpretability of the models. Ultimately, the deep learning architectures as 
well as those inspired by biological networks and those that employ transformations that linearise the measurement 
space were chosen. Preliminary results indicate that we are able to model the system to some degree and the anomaly 
detection solution is generic for a multiple parallel suite of time series data, somewhat independent of its origin. As 
such these concepts and results are also applicable to the energy space, for example, monitoring data streams from a 
power station. Successful development would imply new insights into how anomalies occur in a system and/or when 
they will occur and would allow for in-depth analyses such as Root Cause Analysis. The combination of an 
interpretable model and Root Cause Analysis would lay foundations for developing a Reinforcement Learning based 
system in which the system could take active decisions on certain anomaly encounters.

1. Introduction 
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) (Figure 1) located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is 
a circular particle accelerator providing proton to proton collisions at approximately forty million times per second 
(Aad et al., 2008; Pozo Astigarraga, 2017). The protons circulate around the accelerator and interact at several points 
along the LHC ring where different particle detectors study the results of these interactions. ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC 
ApparatuS) (Figure 2) is one of the general purpose detectors and Trigger and Data Acquisition (TDAQ) is responsible 
for the transport and storage of the selected complex event data resulting from the collisions (Aad et al., 2008; Pozo

3892","based architectures are able to benefit from the time horizon for each of the data points and as such can learn underlying 
patterns which cannot easily be observed even by a human expert. In the literature [10], it is observed that HTM 
models continuously learn over time and that a presence of false positives early on levels out as more data is seen by 
the model. For the use being investigated HTM models meet the requirements because they are able to learn sparse 
data representations as well as being able to recall the patterns they have learnt for the data. 
 
In essence anomaly detection is the comparison of a forecasted future value vs the true value for that time step. The 
predictive power and robustness of the model influences the forecasted value and as such if the model is a poor 
predictor of a future value there is high likelihood that the model will cause the triggering of false positives and false 
negatives resulting in the system alerting for anomalies when there are no anomalies or not alerting for anomalies 
when there are actual anomalies. The models presented above attempt this anomaly detection task in different ways 
and from each of them we draw some deductions. From the artificial neural network models (LSTM and 1D CNN) 
we gather that increased model complexity does not offer you any better solutions if the system cannot be accurately 
represented. From the spectral methods (Koopman) we gather that the prior is very important for the location of 
Koopman invariant subspaces. From the biologically inspired models (HTM) we gather that sparsely drawing data 
from all measurement horizons assists in producing more robust models. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The aims of this paper were to present our findings on the development of anomaly detection algorithms for the 
ATLAS TDAQ high throughput network. The number of dimensions requiring resolution implied that an approach 
capable of tackling a multivariate input be chosen. In addition, the data possessed an asynchronous time variable 
intended to aid the solution in better understanding the behaviour of a particular node on the basis of when a device 
had been polled and to also allow for seasonal patterns to be drawn. The volume of data requiring processing per 
second implied that methods capable of handling streaming data be considered. Based on all the above factors, data-
driven techniques were employed for the solution. In testing these methods only one metric was retained for simplicity 
(the solutions scale across metrics). We observed that neural network architectures though capable of learning 
underlying representations of data could not find learnable patterns in the data beyond learning the average of the 
dataset. Biologically inspired models yielded the best results of the developed methods due to that they were able to 
not only capture the seasonal trends of the data, but also predict closely what future values would be. Linearised 
measurement space models yielded partial results due to requiring increased orders of data points to fully define the 
underlying patterns. Similar to neural network-based architectures, both models assumed that the data recorded fully 
modelled the system‚Äôs behaviour and based on the linearised measurement space results we observe why the neural 
architectures were not successful at finding the approximate path for future values of the measurements. 
 
The models presented above are all class agnostic and as such can be applied to different domains once the data has 
been pre-processed to follow the formats required by each of the algorithms. One useful application would be in the 
energy sector where power plants are always expected to operate at optimal efficiency. Two avenues exist whereby 
there is a real-time anomaly detection system or the case whereby failure has occurred and there is a need to analyse 
the data from the failure. Robust anomaly detection algorithms would allow for early detection of system failures and 
also offer an avenue for root cause analysis in the cases when failure has already occurred. 
 
We conclude by noting that the algorithms developed in this paper are generic and thus are applicable to different 
domains.

Abstract 
 
This work presents a model for measuring supply risk based on the financial impact on the company caused by a 
supply-side disruption that will result in the non-delivery of a purchasing material. A research action methodology is 
used to develop the model and to illustrate its application on a real case company to manage the SARS-CoV-2 
coronavirus supply chain disruption. The model allowed to quantify the potential impact of a disruption of individual 
purchasing parts and thus to correctly funnel and prioritize risk mitigation activities to overcome the possible 
disruptions.

1. Introduction 
Sourcing and manufacturing globally allow companies to take advantage of differences in cost of labor, cost of capital, 
infrastructure, the availability of skilled labor and raw materials as well as tax laws, among others. The internet makes 
it easy to share information worldwide and to find adequate suppliers in distant countries. Low shipping and logistic 
costs add to the attractiveness of sourcing globally. These factors contribute to the supply chains become more global 
but at the same time, more complex and have a higher level of risk than domestic supply chains (Manuj and Mentzer, 
2008). While a global supply chain may have the benefit of the lowest overall cost, this comes with the disadvantage 
of increased individual supply risks derived from supplier failures or supply market occurrences (Zsidisin, 2003; 
Kƒ±rƒ±lmaz and Erol, 2017). There is a higher exposure to a diversity of political, regulatory, and geographic settings, as 
well as longer transportation routes. A breakage in any one of the added risk factors may lead to large disruptions and 
could cause the entire supply chain to fail. Thus, today‚Äôs supply chain managers are in the challenging situation of 
having to find the right balance between risks and rewards (Chaudhuri et al., 2018) like the task of a financial portfolio 
manager.  
 
Supply chain risk management aims to reduce risks and enhance the recovery time after such disruptions. In recent 
years this theme has been the subject of many studies. Rajagopal et al. (2017) reference 21 reviews in supply chain 
risk management. Fan and Stevenson (2018) in a systematic literature review mention a high growth rate of publication 
in this field, 68% of the papers their sample were published between 2011 and 2016.  Bier et al. (2020) also notice a 
substantial increase in the number of publications related to supply chain risk management 
 
Among the different definitions of supply chain risk management, the one proposed by Fan and Stevenson (2018) 
provides a holistic definition that intends to guide researchers towards solving a real business problem: ‚ÄúThe 
identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring of supply chain risks, with the aid of the internal implementation 
of tools, techniques and strategies and of external coordination and collaboration with supply chain members so as to 
reduce vulnerability and ensure continuity coupled with profitability, leading to competitive advantage‚Äù.

data protection and confidentiality, a factor was used to mask the real data. 
As a further step, all the remaining purchasing materials which were not on the current tracking list and which had a 
CMIP(PMj) greater than 10% were checked for their status. These were 58 materials, out of a total of 727 purchasing 
materials. They were checked because of their high impact in case they were also affected. For example, it could be 
that some raw materials for these parts were coming from affected regions. This cannot be seen just by looking at the 
country of origin. Also, this step allowed the company to focus on the most critical items. 
In addition to analyzing the desired outcome of the mitigation actions by the new VaR after their completion, the 
evolution of the current VaR towards the desired state was also being tracked. This was done by calculating and 
documenting the sum of the current VaR over all affected purchasing materials on a daily basis. It allowed us to see 
any progress made by implementing the mitigation actions. 
Note that taking the sum of the current VaR only yields the correct result for the total contribution margin impact if 
all the purchasing materials on the list go into different sales products. If two materials are used in the same sales 
product i, then the CMIP(SPi) is counted twice and the sum of the current VaR is overestimated. Nevertheless, this 
value can be used as a KPI to see if the risk exposure is growing or shrinking and where the company is standing on 
the way towards the desired state. 
6. Conclusions 
The growing complexity and globalization of supply chains make them more vulnerable to disruptions. This leads to 
a substantial increase in risk and makes it mandatory for companies to have an effective supply chain risk management 
system. At the same time, resources for risk mitigation and crisis management are limited. Hence, on the supply-side, 
a system is needed to focus the available resources on the most important purchasing materials and risks. A common 
approach is to use the amount spend on the material as an indicator of its importance. It has been argued that this 
approach is flawed, and a better solution is needed. In this paper, a quantitative model for assessing supply-side risks 
has been developed and implemented at Sensirion Holding AG and successfully tested during the SARS-CoV-2 
pandemic. The model allowed the company to quantify the potential impact of a disruption of individual purchasing 
parts and thus to correctly funnel and prioritize risk mitigation activities. Especially during crisis management, the 
ability to prioritize and focus is essential. Based on the same model, a process to assess the effectiveness of proposed 
mitigation actions and to track their progress during the implementation has been presented. A cost-benefit analysis 
shows its financial viability. The model has been described in a general way so that it can also be implemented and 
used by other companies.  
This research has been limited to describe supply-side risks. For a complete supply chain risk management, also 
company internal risks and customer-side risks need to be considered. Most notably, the calculation of the potential 
impact of a purchasing material disruption is based on the sales forecast. However, sales forecasts are inherently 
inaccurate. The model could be developed further to account for such customer-side risks present in the sales forecast 
and, for example, consider several sales forecast scenarios. 
Moreover, the model to describe risk events was intentionally kept simple and thus assumptions were made that might 
not hold true. A more enhanced model could be used to better describe the realistic course of a disruption. Specifically, 
the time-to-disruption and the impact factor are probably dependent on each other. A model could be developed to 
describe this dependency. Lastly, a quantitative approach to assess the probability of certain risk events is desirable 
because human judgment is prone to heuristics in decision making which regularly leads to misjudgments.  
While it‚Äôs undoubtedly necessary and beneficial to know what the major risks are and how to handle them in case 
needed, some risks are not foreseeable. Fires, for example, occur frequently and it would be foolish not to prepare for

3913","such a scenario beforehand. At the same time, probably no risk manager reasonably imagined a scenario like the 2011 
Japan earthquake and consequent tsunami that would cause a nuclear meltdown and almost lead to the evacuation of 
Tokyo, until it happened. Luckily, the response to a disturbance mostly follows the same basic principles and 
processes. This idea is also what the concept of supply chain resilience is based on. Hence, it is not necessary to foresee 
all risks and to prepare for each one specifically. Rather, by building the supply chain on the principles of flexibility 
and redundancy, a company can greatly enhance its ability to recover from any kind of disruption in a short time. 
Thus, to further enhance the long-term stability of the company Sensirion Holding AG, several additional adequate 
resilience practices are currently being implemented.

Human resources (HR) is one of the main factors in business development. Similarly, in small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs), HR in SMEs has an important role in improving business. The low quality of human resources 
is one thing that needs to be addressed in the problem of SMEs. Especially amid this Covid-19 pandemic, SMEs 
must be smart and creative in developing their human resource capabilities so they can continue to survive amid a 
pandemic. According to Kuncoro (2001) problems faced in developing SMEs are (1) weak in gaining market 
opportunities and expanding market share, (2) weak in capital structure and limitations in obtaining capital 
channels, (3) weak in organization and management of human resources, (4) limited business networks between 
entrepreneurs, (5) business climate is not conducive, (6) coaching is not integrated, and (7) lack of trust and 
community care. Some other SMEs problems are mostly caused by the ability of human resources (HR) in 
implementing strategies in utilizing HR appropriately. Innovation as a concept in the application of new ideas, 
products and processes, can be used as a key in developing SMEs, including in developing human resources. This 
is very necessary in improving the performance of SMEs businesses. Online-based sales required SMEs 
practitioners to innovate and improve the ability of HR in the field of Information Technology (IT) in order to 
operate SMEs supporting applications. In this case, the research method used is descriptive method in which the 
results of the study will describe descriptively about the strategy of developing the capabilities of SMEs HR amid 
Covid-19 pandemic. The results of this study are expected to be input for SMEs in improving HR capabilities.

Abstract  
 
Corona pandemic that occurred in 69 countries including Indonesia, encouraged the government to issue regulations 
on Large-Scale Social Barriers and Work from Home. This regulation has an impact on the decline in sales and the 
emergence of raw material problems in MSME activities. Even though the government has prepared ways to help 
MSMEs, such as providing social assistance, tax incentives, relaxation and credit restructuring, working capital 
assistance program and as an output offtaker, MSMEs still need to implement strategies in order to survive in this 
pandemic era. This paper aims to explain the strategies that need to be carried out by SMEs to be able to maintain 
sales and overcome the problem of raw materials. The way to do this is to use the concept of collaborative value 
chains.

Strategy, Value chain collaboration, MSME, Covid 
 
1. Introduction 
Based on data from The GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data), at least 69 countries in the world 
are infected with the corona virus, including Indonesia. The case of corona in Indonesia originated from the presence 
of a dance party participant at the Paloma and Amigos clubs who contracted it from other participants from Japan 
(Fadli, n.d.; Wajdi et al., 2020). The trend of corona cases in Indonesia from day to day continues to increase. Based 
on government data (up to July 19, 2020) there are currently 86,521 people confirmed positive, counting the first 
patient registration poems on March 2, 2020 (Yahya, 2020). 
To accelerate the handling of corona cases in Indonesia, the Government issued regulations. Minister of Health 
Regulation No. 9 of 2020 regulates Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB). Large-scale social restrictions are 
restrictions on certain activities of residents in an area suspected of being infected with Corona Virus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) in such a way as to prevent the possibility of spreading Corona Virus Disease 2019. These restrictions 
are followed by the closure of schools and workplaces, restrictions on religious activities, and or restrictions on 
activities at public places or facilities. 
This regulation has an impact on the sustainability of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). According to 
TM Zakir Sjakur Machmud, Chair of the Universitas Indonesia, UKM FEB Center , this regulation has caused MSME 
entrepreneurs to not be able to meet suppliers of goods or buyers so that UMKMs cash flow is disrupted. This happens 
because the product produced is a consumer product that is sold directly to the buyer. In addition, the work rhythm of 
MSME actors is daily. If sales do not occur within one day, then cash flow will be affected (Kristianus, 2020). The 
same thing was expressed by Teten Masduki, Minister of Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(KUKM), that the existence of PSBB resulted in the loss of the market for MSMEs (Nurhaliza, 2020). 
 
2. Literature Review  
Research conducted by the Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas) shows that there is a decline in 
sales in almost all MSMEs. 36.7% of respondents said there were no sales at all, 26% of respondents experienced a

3917","Makmur Tbk , Bogasari Division as the first and largest flour mill in Indonesia will continue to support the growth of 
MSMEs through various coaching programs they have. The fostered activities carried out are product education, 
promotion and marketing strategies and licensing. The activity is carried out through seminars, culinary festivals and 
customer visit (Gunawan, 2020). 
Another partnership is between BGR Logistics and DANA in terms of increasing the inclusiveness of digital 
technology for MSME actor in order to survive. By utilizing digital technology, stall owners and all SMEs can easily 
do non-cash transactions, or grocery stores to get supplies of raw materials at affordable prices. The SMEs can 
purchase raw materials from ordering to payment without having to physically mobilize (Wuri, 2020). 
 
Collaboration with customers 
The existence of social distancing and to remain at home, resulting in more consumers choosing to shop online to 
meet household and food needs. Efforts made by MSMEs are in collaboration with large companies such as Grab. 
Grab has launched a program called GrabMart. With this program, Grab invites traders in nine traditional markets to 
become partners, and helps traditional traders switch to digital platforms. Grab has also provided training on how to 
sell online and teaches how to package products to ensure the freshness of the products it sells. This program also 
provides added value for customers. With the Mix and Match feature, customers can make purchases at a number of 
different traditional market traders and the items purchased can be sent simultaneously to their address (Wijaya et al., 
2020). 
During this pandemic, consumers also need more health equipment. The need for medical equipment is increasing in 
213 countries, which includes the need for Personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, drugs to ventilators. MSME 
began to see this opportunity and began to produce it. The NextDev Telkomsel, namely Jahitin and Kostoom realize 
collaboration with MSMEs to produce those needs; PPE for medics and cloth masks is produced by a number of local 
tailors (Mulyawan, 2020). 
 
Collaboration with competitors and complementors 
The Joint Shop, BERSAMA (Berih, SehAt, MAju). This shop has initiated by the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small 
and Medium Enterprises (Kemenkop and UKM) of the Republic of Indonesia in collaboration with UKM Center 
Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Indonesia (UKM Center FEB-UI), Coca-Cola (PT Coca-Cola 
Indonesia and Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia), and QASA. This movement was formed because the main problems of 
MSMEs in the COVID era were declining sales and the difficulty of raw materials. The purpose of this movement can 
arouse enthusiasm and restore the strength of the shop or shop businessman (Sugandi, 2020).  
Development of the concept of Cloud Kitchen. This concept arose because many restaurant businesses failed in the 
first year. They have to close down their businesses, even though they have incurred considerable investment costs; 
rent buildings, interiors, kitchen equipment, food equipment, tables and chairs. Provision of cloud kitchen business 
people can save investment costs. In Indonesia, Gojek is one who invests in this field, in accordance with its 
commitment to provide solutions to the challenges and needs of the informal sector and society. This service is 
dedicated for MSMEs to accelerate the growth of their business. MSMEs can utilize this cloud kitchen facility as a 
first step to get technology assistance and kitchen facilities as well as delivery service providers. Thus, MSMEs can 
save on investment costs for equipment purchases and rental premises and MSMEs remain business owners 
(Noviyanti, 2020). 
 
6. Conclusion  
During this pandemic, due to the PSBB and Work from Home regulations, the impact of declining sales and the 
difficulty of supplying raw materials for most MSMEs. In order to survive, MSMEs can use collaborative value chain 
strategies. Collaborative value chain is a strategy to establish cooperation between suppliers, customers, competitors 
and complementors. 
Collaboration with suppliers can provide value-added benefits; cost efficiency of raw materials, availability of raw 
material supply in the long run, product development assistance through process innovation. An example is PT 
Indofood Sukses Makmur, developing a program for MSMEs. The built program can help in terms of product 
innovation, promotion and marketing strategies as well as licensing. BGR Logistics and DANA also provide support 
to MSMEs in developing digital technology for MSME shop owners. 
Collaboration with customers provides an opportunity to find out what consumers want. In the current pandemic, 
consumers need online shopping and medical equipment. This opportunity can be used by MSMEs to work with Grab

Telkomsel succeeded in producing PPE and masks. 
Collaboration with competitors and complementors, allows the purchase of raw materials in large quantities, resulting 
in cost savings. In addition, another benefit is being able to use assets together. One way is to use cloud kitchen and 
stalls together.

This study aims to evaluate tax incentive strategies related to tax holiday policies to increase investment during 
the Covid-19 Pandemic in Indonesia. The research approach used in this research is qualitative with data collection 
techniques using in-depth interviews, observation, literature study/documentation, and source triangulation. The 
study results found that every year there was an increase in the number of investment requests, but in fact, only a 
few received tax holiday facilities. Even in 2017, practically no new registrants were interested in the tax holiday 
scheme. This study concludes that the tax holiday policy has so far been quite effective in increasing investment 
in Indonesia, but its achievement has not been optimal. In implementing the tax holiday policy, especially during 
the Covid-19 Pandemic, there has not been any significant change in its incentive policy to attract investors to 
invest in Indonesia because it is still facing several obstacles. One of the main obstacles in the regulation is the 
provision of tax holiday decisions apart from the coverage of the 18 pioneer industrial sectors, only allowing other 
industries to apply for tax holiday facilities as long as there is an academic study which can prove that it can be 
categorized as a pioneer industry. The problem faced in obtaining approval from the Directorate General of Taxes 
is the process that will take a long time if the investment is not included in the scope of the list of pioneer industries. 
According to the mandate of Article 5 PMK. 150/2018, it must go through inter-ministerial discussions. These 
discussions are coordinated by BKPM and involve the Ministry of Finance and Ministries from related sectors.

1. Introduction 
Historically, the Tax Holiday regime existed in Indonesian taxation when Law no. 1 of 1967 was issued 
simultaneously with Law no. 11 of 1967 concerning Foreign Investment (PMA). This rule regulates various tax 
breaks. Our country used to implement this Tax Holiday policy before the 1983 tax reform, which was given to 
the upstream industry in the 1980s and succeeded in creating an upstream industry with high added value. 
However, the provisions on Tax Holiday were revoked with the enactment of the Income Tax Law No. 7 years in 
effect since January 1, 1984. From statistical records, it turns out that this policy has attracted many foreign 
investors' interest to invest heavily in Indonesia, which can be seen in the increase in foreign direct 
investment/domestic investment entering Indonesia, which increased from year to year. The implications of this 
policy turned out to have a positive impact on the Indonesian economy, increasing employment rates and income 
taxes on employee income and more small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that grew and developed related to 
FDI/PMDN investment [1].  Business actors are in great demand for tax holiday incentive facilities. The number 
of entrepreneurs who receive this facility continues to grow. Hestu Yoga Saksama, Director of Counseling, 
Services, and Public Relations, said that from mid-2018 to the end of August 2019, DGT had approved tax holiday 
incentives for 36 investors, ""he told DDTC News, Thursday (10/10/2019) [2].  
 
It is understandable how angry President Jokowi when he received a note from the World Bank regarding 
Indonesia's investment performance because 33 Chinese companies relocated their factories out of China, none of 
them entered Indonesia, 23 companies chose to build factories in Vietnam, while the rest moved their factories to 
Malaysia, Thailand, and Cambodia. In 2017, of the 73 Japanese companies that relocated factories, 43 companies 
moved to Vietnam, 11 to Thailand and the Philippines, and 10 to Indonesia. From this note, the President of the 
Republic of Indonesia Jokowi considered that the problem occurred due to internal factors [3]. Several reasons 
foreign investors prefer to invest in other countries such as Vietnam than in Indonesia are because of labor costs, 
office rent, and the income tax rate (PPh) of business entities in Vietnam is cheaper than Indonesia. The average 
wage for Vietnamese manufacturing workers is USD 3,673 per year, while in Indonesia, it is USD 5,421 per year. 
Office rent in Vietnam is cheaper than in Indonesia, which is USD17/m2/month for grade A offices in Ho Chi 
Minh, while in Jakarta, it is USD50/m2/month. The corporate income tax rate in Vietnam has been 20% since 
2016, while Indonesia's rate is 25%. The Vietnamese Government has discounted corporate income tax rates for 
investment in underdeveloped areas to 17% and in very disadvantaged areas to 10% [4]. From the other side, we

years given but covering various sectors in the economy, and also deregulation or other reforms that can return 
momentum to investment realization"". But the problem is, according to an informant from DDTC saying that if 
they were not included in the pioneer industry, still in PMK 103/2016, he could submit an academic paper that 
shows that if he is a pioneer industry, now it's difficult because the KBLI is clear. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The effectiveness of taxation policies in providing tax holiday facilities to increase foreign investment in BKPM 
in 2018 is quite effective but not optimal enough to attract foreign investors to invest in Indonesia. It can be 
indicated by a decrease in the realization of foreign investment receipts, even though in 2018, the number of foreign 
investors receiving tax holiday facilities has increased compared to previous years. Ironically, Indonesia, an 
archipelago of maritime country, does not even have a tax holiday facility at PMK. 150/PMK.010/2018 given to 
the shipping industry sector (shipbuilding) even though this sector is needed to support realizing the vision and 
commitment stated by the President of Indonesia to realize Indonesia as a world maritime axis. 
 
The World Bank recommends that Indonesia focus on attracting a lot of investment, where foreign investment 
(FDI) to Indonesia is still low compared to other ASEAN countries. The Government must immediately take 
strategic steps to overcome all investment obstacles, as stated above, regarding obstacles to investment in 
Indonesia. To expand investment, among the main obstacles in the regulation of tax holiday decisions apart from 
the coverage of 18 pioneer industrial sectors stipulated in PMK 150/PMK.010/2018, other sectors can still get tax 
holidays as long as they are able to prove that their sector meets the criteria to be categorized as a pioneer industry. 
Therefore, during the Covid-19 pandemic should be a good momentum for Indonesia to stimulate Indonesia's 
investment optimism. Regulations must be simplified and made in such a way as to attract investors to invest in 
Indonesia. Therefore, it is better to cover more pioneer industrial sector being held so that there will be an 
expansion in business/investment opportunities and employment. However, to ensure legal certainty, the addition 
of these new pioneering industrial sectors must be stipulated in the minister of finance regulation. 
 
Other obstacles in the application of tax holiday policies are inefficient bureaucracy and government regulations, 
the inconsistency of the Government regarding the determination of tax holiday regulations, and weak regional 
autonomy, including constraints in terms of providing land permits for investment locations and other factors such 
as political stability, labor costs which is expensive and so on. Another obstacle is that the investors themselves 
are not right in applying for a tax holiday with the realization of their investment. 
 
Researchers recommend that the tax authorities revise the current tax holiday scheme policy by adding other 
business fields in the pioneer industry, which can guarantee legal certainty, and make several efforts to overcome 
obstacles such as simplifying business licensing, limiting the decision to get Tax Holiday approval in BKPM level 
that does not need to involve DGT. The other recommendations are improving the integration of central and 
regional policies, expanding the socialization of Tax Holiday and Licensing Services for Integrated Business 
Electronically or Online Single Submission, supervision, and inspection of taxpayers who perform Tax Avoidance 
or Tax Avoidance must be increased so that state tax revenues can be optimized. 
 
Indonesia, an archipelagic or maritime country, does not even have a tax holiday facility for the shipbuilding 
industry sector. The Indonesian Government must be committed to the President of Indonesia's vision and 
commitment to realize Indonesia as a world maritime axis that aims to make Indonesia a large, strong, and 
prosperous maritime country. By restoring Indonesia's identity as a maritime country, securing maritime interests 
and security, empowering maritime potential to realize economic equality in Indonesia, reviewing the tax holiday 
policy, which is also based on maritime countries, the maritime sector (including the shipbuilding industry) will 
progress better. 
 
The government or related institutions should improve and review the licensing process's integration at the central 
and local levels. Although the tax holiday itself does not have obstacles at the central level, other constraints that 
have an impact on increasing investment from foreign investors must be corrected, especially licensing problems 
in the regions because the Government must guarantee investors to obtain business permits and land where a 
business is easy to run. In addition, related institutions must be more active in foreign investors' needs for the tax 
incentive itself, especially for tax holidays. BKPM and the Directorate General of Taxes must carry out adequate 
supervision and regular field inspections so that investors comply with applicable regulations. 
 
With this less optimal OSS system, it is hoped that BKPM will continue to update the system to make it easier for 
foreign investors to access the system. In addition, the omnibus law is needed as the only primary law regulating 
licensing, to integrate policy content (recodification) and rationalization of various licenses spread across 70 sector

Abstract 
 
The adoption of e-filing in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic occupies a crucial position for taxpayers because it 
makes it easier for taxpayers to fulfill their tax responsibility. This study uses the factors of information quality, system 
quality, service quality, and collaboration quality to predict taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction and intentions when using e-filing. 
Taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction and intention will determine the success of e-filing. Based on the above background, this study 
aims to test the success of using e-filing applications in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of e-filing quality. 
Individual taxpayers who understand the use of e-filing in carrying out their tax obligations are selected to be 
respondents in this study. Based on empirical data collected through questionnaires to 150 taxpayers, the results of 
this study indicate that the e-filing system quality and the e-filing services quality partially are factors that affect 
taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction and intention, which then have an impact on e-filing success. Taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction and 
intention will increase along with system quality and service quality. The information quality and the collaboration 
quality still have not succeeded in influencing the taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction and intention to use e-filing.

1. Introduction  
The adoption of the e-filing system not only provides convenience for taxpayers, but also supports the economic and 
business systems. The government strives for a system in which the public can carry out their obligations conveniently, 
efficiently, and effectively. The government aims to raise Indonesia‚Äôs ranking in the list of the Ease of Doing Business

3933","same thing that the intention to use e-filing had a more dominant and significant influence on taxpayers‚Äô compliance 
than taxpayers‚Äô knowledge and satisfaction. 
The e-filing collaboration quality has no effect on taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction. Of the three other e-filing quality variables, 
the collaboration quality has a fairly high average value of respondents‚Äô answers, which is 3.96. The highest mean 
value generated from the respondents‚Äô answers is 4.17 on the statement item which states that ‚ÄúE-filing facilitates 
annual tax return reporting‚Äù. It can be said that taxpayers are dissatisfied with the collaboration quality which is 
considered not significant enough in providing convenience in reporting annual tax return. Otherwise, the research 
from Chen et al (2013) which stated that the collaboration quality affected the use and satisfaction of e-commerce 
users. 
The e-filing collaboration quality on users‚Äô intention has an indirect effect on taxpayers‚Äô intention to use e-filing. With 
the existence of e-filing, taxpayers should feel the ease in filling and reporting annual tax return. The excellent 
cooperation between DGT and taxpayers is believed to be able to minimize operational costs so that taxpayers‚Äô 
satisfaction can be achieved. Therefore, it is very unfortunate that the collaborative quality doesn‚Äôt have an influence 
on the taxpayers‚Äô intention even though if the collaboration quality is managed properly, it can be a motivation for 
taxpayers to use e-filing. The lowest mean value generated from the respondents‚Äô answers is 3.75 on the statement 
item which states that ‚ÄúE-filing makes it easy to communicate with DGT‚Äù. Taxpayers feel that e-filing doesn‚Äôt make 
communication with DGT easier because it is difficult for taxpayers to contact DGT. 
When the online tax reporting system can build consumers‚Äô satisfaction, then consumers will tend to reuse the system. 
Taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction can be formed through taxpayers‚Äô experience when using e-filing. Taxpayers who are satisfied 
when using e-filing will have the desire to use e-filing again. The stronger the individual‚Äôs desire to take action, the 
more likely the action will be realized (Ajzen, 1985). The result of this study supports the research of Wang et al 
(2008) which showed that in his research, users‚Äô satisfaction had a positive effect on intention to reuse e-filing. 
Therefore, if users‚Äô satisfaction increases, so does the users‚Äô intention to reuse e-filing. 
The benefits of e-filing can increase if there is awareness on the DGT party to emphasize the advantage in terms of 
benefits and convenience. First of all, taxpayers will get used to the e-filing system first, then start enjoying using e-
filing, then taxpayers will be able to feel the benefits of e-filing. Thus, it can be concluded that the higher the benefits 
received by e-filing users, the satisfaction felt by taxpayers also increases. Likewise, if the obtained benefits are low, 
then the taxpayers may feel discontented, and as a result, the taxpayers will be reluctant to use the e-filing system 
again. 
This result of this study is in line with the research conducted by Pamugar et al (2014) that explained that users‚Äô 
intention definitely exists and affects the net benefits of technology. Thus, it can be interpreted that the easier it is to 
use e-filing, the interest in using e-filing will also increase greatly. Likewise, if the use of a system is difficult and not 
easy to understand, the users will be less interested in using e-filing. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of data acquisition and processing, and data analysis, the e-filing information quality has no effect 
on taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction and taxpayers‚Äô intention in using e-filing. The taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction and taxpayers‚Äô 
intention are strongly influenced by the e-filing system quality and the e-filing service quality. The e-filing 
collaboration quality has no effect on taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction and taxpayers‚Äô intention to use e-filing. The use of e-
filing by taxpayers has a positive influence on taxpayers‚Äô intention to use e-filing. Taxpayers‚Äô satisfaction with e-filing 
has a positive influence on e-filing success. Likewise, taxpayers‚Äô intention has a positive effect on e-filing success. It 
is expected that the obtained results can be taken as input for DGT to improve the e-filing quality which has not been 
put into its maximum capacity to provide satisfaction and encouragement for taxpayers to use e-filing. The e-filing 
collaboration quality can actually have a positive impact in the use of e-filing, so it is expected that DGT can emphasize 
good relationship management with taxpayers. The collaboration between the two can create harmony so that the use 
of e-filing can be a pleasant experience for taxpayers. 
There are some limitations in this study that should be noted. First, this study was conducted only based on the 
perception of individual taxpayers as a sample and the relatively short timeline limited to the time of the Covid-19 
pandemic only. Second, the data collection technique in this study utilizes a questionnaire survey, therefore, there is 
a possibility of bias on the produced data due to cognitive differences between the researchers and the respondents to 
the questions given. Third, the discussion in this study on each aspect of the variable is still broad and cannot be done 
in depth. Last, the researchers expected that the studied number of respondents would be 170, but only 150 respondents 
were collected. In regards to the limitations of the study mentioned above, the suggestion that the authors would like 
to propose for further research is to expand the research timeline to observe the extent to which e-filing applications

not limited only during the Covid-19 pandemic but will continuously become a taxpayers‚Äô tax lifestyle.

1. Introduction 
The quality of education in Indonesia continues to change and develop over time. Current developments include 
the advancement and sophistication of technology and information. Many educational platforms both 
government and private are provided for students to learn. And this educational platform has been integrated and 
takes advantage of the sophistication of science and technology. 
 
The advancement and sophistication of science and technology must be in line with the demands of the 
education world today which focuses on higher-order thinking skills. Thinking skills are an ability to carry out 
thought processes which are very important to be used and applied in life (Sulaiman, Aziz & Mok: 2011). 
Thinking skills are a thought process which includes the formation of concepts, analysis, application, syntax and 
evaluation of existing information with observations, experiences and reflections (Ball & Garton: 2005). 
Thinking skills are also defined as an ability that combines cognitive processes and the ability to complete 
existing tasks (Milvain, 2008).

ABSTRACT 
 
Global warming and climate change are forms of decreasing environmental quality. The main cause of global 
warming is the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon dioxide emissions will increase along with industrial 
growth. Increased industrial growth as a form of increasing economic growth. This is explained in Kuznets 
theory that there is a relationship between economic growth and environmental quality. Therefore, empirical 
studies are needed to analyse the effect of economic growth and openness on environmental quality. This study 
uses a quantitative method with panel data regression estimates in 10 ASEAN member countries during the 
2010-2020 period. The variables used are carbon dioxide emissions as the dependent variable and population, 
economic growth, economic openness and foreign investment as the independent variable. The results of this 
study indicate that economic growth has a negative and significant effect, then exports and foreign investment 
have a positive effect on carbon dioxide emissions. Meanwhile, population and import variables have no 
significant effect on carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, to improve the quality of the environment, the 
government in each country is advised to take advantage of its economic growth as an effort to improve 
environmental quality.

Abstract  
 
Investment is an attempt to invest capital to gain profits and avoid the risk of purchasing an asset. One investment that 
has considerable appeal is investment through investing in shares. Investment in shares listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange is one of the investments with a high rate of return. The problem that arises is that not all stocks generate 
significant profits, because of this need, investors need an observation system screening which can support decision 
making with the use of modified analysis screening Piotroski and Greenblatt for portfolio investment stock with 
combination in several stocks growth in LQ 45 index and BUMN sectoral stocks. This study uses The Analytical 
Network Process method to accommodate the results of individual stock decisions. This research produces individual 
stock rankings that can be used as stock selection recommendations for investors.

1. Introduction 
Investment is currently growing rapidly in Indonesia, in addition to having benefits, every investment also has risks, 
so every investor must have sufficient knowledge about the investment to be chosen and explore information or see 
investment opportunities that will provide huge profits in the future (Amin and Mustikasari, 2019). 
 
One investment that has considerable appeal is investment through investing in shares. Implementation of stock 
analysis can be done using an economic approach, including fundamental and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis 
is an analytical method based on the economic fundamentals of a company. Individual stock selection analysis 
conducted by investors has limitations in determining productive and profitable stocks in the future. 
 
The lack of public information about the selection of the ideal investment leads to inappropriate and inappropriate 
decision making, resulting in investment losses. Measuring investment returns as expected value and quantifying 
investment risk as variance, under a certain variance limit of portfolio returns under a certain expected value limit 
(Guo, Yu, Li, & Kar, 2016)] becomes a problem for investors. As stated by the weakness of conventional methods, 
generally it is not easy to understand and difficult to interpret the ratio as stated by Treynor, KPMSD, 2013. Lack of 
information about choosing the ideal investment causes people to be less precise in choosing the right investment, 
causing losses. 
 
Method Analytical Hierarchy Process (ANP) is used to analyze and select individual stocks. The ANP method can 
produce criteria weights and evaluate the weights of decision alternatives. The ANP method can combine qualitative 
analysis and quantitative analysis based on multi-criteria decisions (Ogiana, 2017). Evaluation of criteria and 
alternatives using the ANP method produces an individual ranking of financial ratio analysis. 
The ANP approach is used because this method has a structured technique that can analyze complex decision making 
by determining various weighting factors and accurate evaluation factors (Megawan, 2011). One of the advantages of

6. Conclusion  
The identification problem in investment stocks arises when involving various factors and it is not entirely relating to 
generate significant profits. Investment decision-making is a typical kind of multi-criteria decision-making. Investors 
should take many different kinds of factors into consideration to achieve the optimal decision. In this paper, we use 
the theory of Analytic Network Process, consider the interaction and restriction relationship between indices, and set 
up a multi-criteria decision-making indices system and decision-making for portfolio investment. 
 
These studies combine screening methods of Lynch, Piotroski and Greenblatt to define the stock alternatives in market 
with expert investment analyst. As a result, The ANP model‚Äôs matrix has strong mapping high return to be used in 
portfolio products either accommodate the results of individual stock decisions support as recommendations for 
investors.

Abstract 
 
This study seeks to examine the causes of employees committing accounting fraud. Researchers used multiple 
regression as a method on 152 employees of the organization. Results The analysis found that individuals are the 
biggest cause of accounting fraud. This happens because of subjective desires and behaviors that have implications 
for organizational culture and the emergence of accounting fraud. The way to overcome this is to create a control 
system and media for reporting, as well as providing penalties for perpetrators. Periodic audits and the prohibition of 
collusive practices can also eradicate accounting fraud.  
 
Keywords:  
Fraud, Individual, Organizational Culture  
 
Introduction 
An organization is a gathering place for a group of people to carry out economic activities, be it production or 
marketing, with the aim of generating profits and achieving company goals and meeting the interests of shareholders 
(Asmah, Atuilik, & Ofori, 2019; Finnerty, Hegde, & Malone, 2016; Ghafoor, 2016). , Zainudin, & Mahdzan, 2019; 
Ismail & Abdelmoniem, 2013). In achieving the main goals of the organization, company owners need qualified 
human resources who can run their business, which are generally placed in management positions. However, 
sometimes the existence of management (agents) in relation to shareholders (principals) often results in conflicts of 
interest. This is in theory referred to as agency theory or agency theory. One of the phenomena related to agency 
theory occurred in a leading company in the UK, namely British Telcom in early 2017 (warta Ekonomi.co.id, 2017). 
This large company in England was shocked by the occurrence of accounting fraud in its business line in Italy. The 
cheating mode is by doing income increasing by making contract extensions, bills, and fake transactions with related 
vendors. British Telcom management created inflation in the company's profits over several periods through unfair 
means with the company's clients and financial services. As a result of the fraud, British Telcom must be held 
responsible by providing tax compensation for the fictitious profit created and reducing GBP 530 million. In fact, 
British Telcom had to take preventive measures as a result of the fraud by cutting its current cash flow by 500 million 
GBP to cover debts created due to SDMnya fraud (Source: wartaekonomi.co.id). 
 
Morally, management has an obligation to encourage optimal profit for shareholders, then compensation for 
shareholders will be given in accordance with the performance of managers in accordance with the contract that has 
been made. This fact represents the dualism of interests when the shareholder (principal) wants profit while the 
management wants compensation in order to achieve the prosperity of their respective lives which results in the 
emergence of asymmetry between the two parties. Doig (2018) and Liu & Li (2015) argue that agency theory is based 
on the creation of conflicting understandings and interests on the part of agents and principals. When managers in 
their roles obtain valid and accurate information and know how the company's prospects are better than shareholders, 
Management can easily manipulate data to please company owners in order for management to get compensated. 
 
These frauds not only occur in profit-oriented organizations, but also occur in non-profit organizations such as 
educational institutions. In July 2018, a staff at an educational institution, Riau University to be exact, was proven to 
have cheated in the construction of the UNRI FISIPOL building. The perpetrators conspired with the commissioner 
of a company working on the project. The UNRI FISIPOL building was valued at Rp9 billion, but was eventually 
abandoned due to the fraud. Due to the fraud, the state is estimated to have suffered a loss of up to Rp. 950 million. In 
addition, there are cases of fraud committed by students at the University of Indonesia. The fraud carried out in the 
form of falsification of the test answer sheet which was carried out repeatedly which caused the suspect to be dropped

Abstract 
 
Indonesian MSMEs currently have very serious challenges and problems that are different from the previous 
economic crises that occurred in Indonesia. MSME performance has decreased during the Covid-19 pandemic 
by 30%. However, the Bungo Regency MSME Business Performance has decreased with a smaller percentage 
of 20% when compared to the percentage decline at the national level. There are still many MSME actors who 
are reluctant to innovate even though innovation is very important and only 10% of MSMEs use digital 
marketing even though government policies lead to an increase in the use of technology, at least 17.2% of 
MSMEs must be technology-based. The purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of innovation and 
digital marketing on the performance of MSMEs directly and indirectly and to analyze the effect of 
government policy as a moderating variable. The sample in this study amounted to 85 MSME actors. Data 
were analyzed using SEM PLS. From the test results, it is found that innovation does not directly affect the 
performance of MSMEs, but has an indirect effect on the performance of MSMEs through digital marketing. 
Meanwhile, digital marketing variables and government policies directly affect the performance of MSMEs. 
Government policy variables are not able to moderate the influence of innovation and digital marketing 
variables on MSME performance. MSME actors will innovate and use digital marketing at the pressure of the 
environment that requires them to adapt and not because of policies from the government.

1. Introduction 
Indonesia's Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) currently have very serious challenges and 
problems that are different from the previous economic crises that occurred in Indonesia. In 1998, when 
the financial crisis occurred due to the drop in the rupiah exchange rate and the loss of market and public 
confidence, Akatiga (1999), conducted a study on the impact of the economic crisis by conducting a survey 
of 800 MSME actors in West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, North Sulawesi, and North Sumatra. . This 
study found that export market-oriented SMEs with locally sourced raw materials actually experienced an 
increase in profits. 
 
In 2008 there was another crisis in Indonesia and in the world. In 2008 global financial crisis triggered by 
the collapse of the property market in the United States (US). Findings from several studies state that 
MSMEs are relatively unaffected. This is due to the limited linkage of MSMEs to the global market, the 
absence of foreign debt taken by MSMEs, and the orientation of MSMEs to the local market. Only MSMEs 
related to the export market are relatively affected. 
 
This is different from the two previous crises where MSMEs were still relatively able to operate normally. 
The crisis that occurred in 2020 until now started from the health sector. The instructions to comply with 
the health protocol to maintain social distancing and not to gather that the government has implemented to 
reduce the spread of the corona virus have narrowed the opportunity for MSME actors to operate. Business 
performance, especially for MSMEs, has decreased during the Covid-19 pandemic. Many business 
industries that have good business performance are unable to survive, especially those engaged in services 
and manufacturing. Data shows that there has been a 30% decrease in MSME performance during the 
Covid-19 pandemic (Amri, 2020). However, Bungo Regency's MSME Business Performance has decreased 
with a smaller percentage of 20% when compared to the percentage of decline at the national level 
(Cooperative Office, UMKM, Bungo Regency Industry and Trade, 2021).

From the test results as shown in Table 6 above for the effect of the moderating variable, a smaller value is 
obtained than t table so that the conclusion is H6 and H7 are rejected. This means that government policies are 
not able to moderate the influence of innovation and digital marketing on the performance of MSMEs. 
 
Discussion 
Testing the effect of the innovation variable on the performance of MSMEs in this study obtained insignificant 
results. This is because during the COVID-19 pandemic, MSME actors think that by innovating, they will 
increase spending because innovation requires additional costs. In addition, MSME actors are afraid of failure 
and do not dare to take risks to do something new. During a pandemic, surviving with old products is better than 
exploring, but it doesn't necessarily work. This is in line with previous research, namely the research of 
(Cucculelli and Peruzzi, 2020)(Oyedele et al., 2020) who said that innovation had no effect on business 
performance. 
 
The results of the research on the influence of digital marketing on the performance of MSMEs obtained 
positive and significant results. The use of digital marketing has a positive impact on the performance of 
MSMEs. The existence of government policies that require social distancing and prohibition of gatherings, 
urges MSME actors to make changes in marketing so that they can still reach their consumers. Digital marketing 
has brought new insights and new markets for MSMEs to reach consumers wider than ever before. Some of the 
benefits that are felt directly from the use of digital marketing are the savings in promotional costs. With content 
sharing and electronic word of mouth that consumers do without being asked, it has strengthened the 
performance of MSMEs. This is in line with the research conducted by (Istianingsih, Harahap and Ali, 
2020)(Meloviƒá et al., 2020)(Low et al., 2020). 
 
Although innovation does not directly affect the performance of MSMEs, placing digital marketing as a 
mediating variable can change the influence of innovation on MSME performance through digital marketing. 
This is also in line with research conducted by (Kristinae et al., 2020) that innovation does not directly affect 
business performance but has an indirect effect after being mediated by digital marketing. 
 
Tests on the moderating effect of government policies, both the effect on innovation and digital marketing, do 
not have an effect on the performance of MSMEs. This means that there are or no government policies, to 
innovate and use digital marketing is a form of encouragement from the environment they feel for the progress 
of their business (Yuhertiana and Fatun, 2020). Although the government has launched policies to encourage 
MSMEs to innovate, such as training on the use of production equipment, packaging improvements or activities 
that encourage innovation, MSME actors are still reluctant to change. Meanwhile, the urge to use digital 
marketing is not an effect of government policies that direct marketing strategies through the Go digital MSME 
program that was echoed several years ago. 
 
4.  Conclusions and Recommendations 
4.1 Conclusions 
From the test results, it is found that innovation does not directly affect the performance of MSMEs, but has an 
indirect effect on the performance of MSMEs through digital marketing. Digital marketing and government 
policies have a direct effect on the performance of MSMEs. Government policy variables are not able to 
moderate the influence of innovation and digital marketing variables on MSME performance. 
 
4.2Recommendations 
The government should better understand the condition of MSMEs and focus more on identifying what are the

This study still has shortcomings such as the number of samples used is still relatively small. For future 
research, it is expected to increase the number of samples and add technical analysis such as the use of mix 
methods in order to obtain comprehensive conclusions.

Abstract 
 
Partnership-based creative industries in business improvement are needed when demand is increasing. However, 
many small businesses are not ready to meet market demand when the demand increases. The purpose of this 
research is to provide solutions from the training and mentoring model in overcoming the problems of 
partnership-based business. This research uses a case study-based qualitative method. The results of the study 
indicate that the existence of training on a partnership basis is able to bring a more mature level of readiness to 
meet market demand. Mentoring is very necessary to support the results of the training. The assistance provided 
comes from universities and the local government. The university provides training and assistance as a form of 
implementing the tri dharma of higher education. The local government can provide support in the form of 
capital assistance and policies that support community businesses.

Abstract 
 
The expansion of Indonesia's healthcare business is currently overshadowed by its low resilience. To explore more 
about the topic, this study aims at examining the relationship between digital patient experience, innovation, and 
patient satisfaction with dental health care facilities in West Java, Indonesia. A survey of 100 patients from all around 
West Java was conducted to collect relevant data. Next, path analysis and regression approaches were used to examine 
the data. The results found an indirect relationship between digital patient experience and patient satisfaction through 
innovation. On the other hand, it was also found that digital patient experience does not directly influence patient 
satisfaction. Patient satisfaction can be increased using digital patient experience-based innovations as digital 
technology can help patients to receive health services easier. The novelty of the study is obtained by analyzing the 
relationship between innovation, digital patient experience, patient satisfaction in one model. Furthermore, the 
implementation of health service facilities in West Java as the unit of analysis also increases the novelty of this study.

1. Introduction 
Health is a vital aspect of life and society's primary necessity, including for the people of Indonesia. Accordingly, the 
healthcare industry in Indonesia continues to expand at a rapid pace. Based on the data from the Central Statistics 
Agency or Badan Pusat Statistik (2020), the health industry is expected to develop at a pace of 15.3%, the highest 
among all sectors. This data demonstrates that the health sector can grow. 
 
The healthcare industry has issues in maintaining its sustainability amid continuous growth. This is concerning 
because according to data from the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (2016), from 2004 to 2015, numerous economic 
actors in the health sector were unable to survive and the health industry's resilience continued to deteriorate. Customer 
satisfaction is one factor that can contribute to a low level of resilience (Cuevas-Vargas et al., 2019; Otto et al., 2020). 
The patient is one of the customers in the healthcare industry who receives services from healthcare institutions and 
rates their satisfaction.

Abstract 
Currently, the form of tourism favored by millennials in the new normal period of the COVID-19 pandemic is the 
backpacker form, which is a form of travel with information independence, both information related to tourist 
locations, culinary places, places of activity, places of worship, transportation, itinerary, and even hidden places 
though. Bali is a tourist that has advantages for backpacker tourism. Unfortunately, platforms, applications, and 
websites have not provided sufficient information regarding this in one platform. The tourists from within the country 
and abroad still have to prepare for a very long trip. Therefore, this research was conducted to develop a bilingual 
backpacker healthy platform (application) for backpacker tourists to Bali. This platform is expected to provide access 
to beneficial travel information during the pandemic in one click in one platform for tourism in Bali and make it easier 
for backpacker tourists to come to Bali. Information that can be provided is information about hotels, food, tourist 
attractions, culture, transportation, how to exchange money, places of worship, malls, gas stations, ATM locations, 
clinics, itineraries, tourist villages, life museums, Balinese food cooking shows, natural use. in Bali, Balinese souvenirs 
(from agriculture and the creative economy), information on staying at people's homes, and hospitals. The steps to be 
carried out are divided into seven stages. Identification of problems with Bali tourism, literature study, system analysis, 
system design and design, application programming, system testing, implementation.

1. Introduction 
Tourism in Bali is a tourist destination that references backpacker tourists, both from abroad and 
domestically. Currie et al. (2011, p.47) stated that backpacking is a way to achieve a complete tourism experience. 
Tourists who take this form of tourism want to try everything in the tourist location without paying much money. 
Therefore, this backpacker tourist does not use the services of a tour leader or tour service to travel to Bali. Maritha 
(2010, p.1) believes that the factors that cause the increase in the number of backpacker tourists are the decrease in 
transportation costs and the existence of communication media via the internet, making it easier for tourists to travel 
alone to a place. Based on research from Menuh (2015), Most backpacker tourists came from Europe (59%), 
Australia (19%), America (18%), and Asia (4%) with an age of 23-28 years and a travel time of 8-15 days. The 
existence of backpacker tourists can improve and restore the economy of the lower class in Bali's tourist areas during 
the pandemic. They will prefer the type of cheap lodging, local restaurants owned by the community, and public 
transportation rentals, such as traveling as a backpacker can reduce crowds when traveling together. Unfortunately, 
foreign and local tourists have not received integrated information in one click and application. Therefore, this 
research was conducted to develop a platform in an application called Bali Backpacker. Due to a large number of 
backpackers from abroad, 
The platform developed contains all the information backpackers want for a healthy backpacker tour during 
the pandemic. Information that can be provided is information about hotels, food, tourist attractions, culture, 
transportation, how to exchange money, places of worship, malls, gas stations, ATM locations, clinics, itineraries,

Implementation is a process that is carried out after the system design is completed. The results of this 
implementation are in the form of a prototype that can be run as a trial of the Smart Bali Backpacker application by 
integrating the database that has been created previously. 
 
5.1.Account List 
Before using the application, if the user does not have an account, the user must first create an account on the 
signup page. To create an account, users need to enter their email data, username, and password. After filling in the 
data on the signup page, the user will be directed to the ""Add Profile Picture"" page. On this page, the user can install 
a profile photo for that user account or skip this step if the user does not want to install a profile photo. Users can take 
pictures from a gallery or take photos with the camera. If the user already has an account, the user can use the 
application by entering the registered email and password. If you forget your password, the user can click ""Forgot 
Password."" Then the user is asked to enter the email for the account that has been registered. Then, users can check in 
the email inbox for a link to change their password. After the link is opened, the user is asked to fill in the latest 
password. After that, a notification will appear that the password has been successfully changed. Users can log in 
using the latest password, with the final display as shown in Figure 10. a. 
 
5.2. Main page 
After logging in, the user will be directed to the dashboard page. There is a list of 3 favorite tourist attractions on 
the dashboard page. Then, the contents of the dashboard page are Tourist Places, Hotels and Villas, and Places of 
Worship. Group chat is a feature that is presented to users to interact with other users who have the same preferred 
choice of tourist attractions and are looking for information or are planning the same thing while at that location. This 
feature can only be accessed when the user enters the tourist attractions detail page. 
After pressing the Join OnGoing Group button, the user will be added to an existing group. If there is no such 
group (a new place is added), the application will automatically create the group according to the tourist attractions 
information. The group will be included in the Group List in the Chats menu; users can view group information in the 
name, picture, and last chat. If the user clicks on the group list, the user will enter the group chat room. 
In the group chat room, the user can send the contents of the message he wants to convey to the group; besides, 
the user can also view detailed group information and the number of members registered in the tourist group. There is 
info to display the group name, group photos (photos of tourist attractions), a list of group members, and their number 
in each group. In the group, each member has their role, the available positions and their functions are as follows: 
Admin (Can invite users to the group, Can remove members from the group, Can make members an admin, Can talk 
in group chat rooms), Member (Can speak in the group chat room), with the final result look like Figure 10. b. 
 
5.3. Settings 
In the Smart Bali Backpacker Application, the user also gets several settings that the user can adjust to the 
preferences of each user, some of which are: Edit Profile, Notification Features, Application Theme, Language 
Preferences, Logout (out of the current account).On the edit profile page, the user can perform several options to 
reconfigure his account information, including Changing the account picture of the user profile, Changing the user 
username, Changing the user password. 
Suppose the user selects the ""Change Profile Picture"" menu. In that case, the user will be offered a dialog box 
with menu options: Take a picture from the camera, Take a view from the gallery, Delete the photo (if the image 
already exists). If the user selects the ""Change Password"" menu, the user will be directed to the next page, which 
contains several validation forms to change his password. After all the validation forms are filled in and confirmed 
correctly, the new password will be entered into the database in the form of an account update action; then, the user 
will be returned to the edit profile page and directed to press the ""Save Changes"" button so that all configurations 
(profile image, username, password) saved and has been updated into the user database, with the final display as 
shown in Figure 10. c.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is a country that has a large Muslim population. The country has many religions, such as Islam, Christianity, 
Buddhism, Confucianism, and Hindi, but Muslims are the majority. Many Indonesia people who embraced Islam, 
they need a role model such as a Muslim religious figure who can teach religious studies, be moderate, tolerance, 
respect differences of opinion and belief, be sociable, be fair, and not be extreme. The problem is that currently the 
notions of extremism, radicalism, and terrorism are spread by religious figures through social media where the target 
is mostly young people to adults. Therefore, this study proposes to explore tweets uploaded by Indonesian Muslim 
religious figures or certain communities on Twitter that lead to moderate or radicalism. Text visualization analysis 
and word cloud were used to reveal all the things hidden behind the tweet. The data collection is obtained through 
Twitter's API (Application Programming Interface) authentication using the Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, access 
token, and access token secret. The polarity scores of each tweet are applied using VADER sentiment analyzer to get 
the polarity, subjectivity, and sentiment labels. The words are conveyed by the two Muslim religious figures with the 
highest frequency of words were quite positive. The word frequency of Muslim religious figure A and B tweets which 
conveys the word such as bless (370), Allah (250), good (237), and upon (204), God (102), Islam (48), Muslim (41), 
and love (36). However, we found some use of vocabulary related to radicalism as found in Muslim religious figure 
B such as caliphate (17), radical (13), migrate (hijrah) (13), terror (10), terror (7), and caliph (7) which the keywords 
in 1-gram. The difference percentage of between both Muslim Religious Figure A and B for positive sentiment are 
12.56%, neutral sentiment are 17.77%, and negative sentiment are 5.2%. Total Muslim Religious Figure A Tweets is 
999, while the total Muslim Religious Figure B Tweets is 1274. The use of morphological vocabulary from Muslim 
religious figure B about accusations of radicalism have a relation with Muslim religious figure B tweets. For the next 
research, the analysis is not only limited based on the morphology of the word but based on the intent and implicit 
meaning of the sentence.

1. Introduction 
Sentiment analysis is the partial scope of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which has the aim of analyzing text 
to extract, explore, also classify sentiments and opinions from the text information (Hearst et al., 2020)(Chaturvedi et 
al., 2018). Furthermore, sentiment analysis starts from the basic analytical techniques which applied to combine 
various information from the text and the other form such as visualizing data (S√°nchez-Rada & Iglesias, 2019). The 
principal task of sentiment analysis can be categorized as a text classification problem because the process can include 
several operations that conclude and classify the text to determine whether it has positive or negative sentiments. 
Generally, sentiment analysis may seem an easy process, but in fact, it is necessary to consider many NLP subtasks

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
After getting the sentiment classification, we get how the percentage of positive, neutral and negative sentiment. 
However, we need to see how the word cloud visualization looks like on each Muslim religious figure tweets. Figure 
7 show the word cloud visualization based on Muslim religious figure tweet A and B. There are some differences in 
words that stand out in both of them in using positive and negative vocabulary. The word ‚Äòpeace‚Äô looks big in the 
word cloud on Muslim Religious Figure A tweets, while the word 'flow' looks big in the word cloud on Muslim 
Religious Figure B tweets but it means about religious sect.

5.4 Validation 
The experiment result show that there are differences in the choice of vocabulary used by both Muslim Religious 
Figures. Both convey positive messages about religion, but Muslim religious figure B morphologically conveys 
religious messages related to radicalism such as caliphate, caliph, radical, terror, liberal, communism, secular, 
Islamophobia, anti-pancasila (ideology of Indonesia), and even discussed banned organizations such as Hizbut Tahrir 
Indonesia. It is suspected that the analysis results of the use of morphological vocabulary from Muslim religious figure 
B about accusations of radicalism have a relation with Muslim religious figure B tweets which are indicated by 1-
gram as many as 79 words and 2-gram as many as 16 words. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The research problems of the proposed research about moderate and accusations of radicalism to Muslim religious 
figures in Indonesia which are retrieved from Twitter by conducting sentiment analysis to present positive, neutral, 
and negative words using the word cloud visualization. The data collection is obtained through Twitter's API 
(Application Programming Interface) authentication using the Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, access token, and

ABSTRACT 
 
The use of black soldier fly or maggot black soldier fly (BSF) as a degrading agent for organic waste 
has begun to be developed to reduce the volume of organic waste. BSF maggot used to degrade 
organic waste also has a valuable protein source for animal feed to the alternative to conventional 
feed. Therefore, this study aims to produce a BSF maggot product that can be used as fish feed and 
analyze its feasibility based on SNI 01-4266-2006 concerning Artificial Feed for Carp (Cyprinus 
carpio L.) on an intensive aquaculture scale. The results showed that BSF maggot is an alternative 
feed used as fish because it is rich in water, protein, fat, ash, and fiber content.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Garbage is the most common problem in developing countries such as Indonesia. The production of 
waste, especially organic waste, continues to increase with people's consumption patterns. It is 
exacerbated by the fact that Indonesia is the fourth country with the largest population globally (Sari et al., 
2018). 
People use many alternatives to treat organic waste, such as using incineration and composting 
techniques. In the incineration technique, waste is burned into gas, but this technique will produce residues 
and harmful gases. In contrast, the composting process converts organic waste into a stable product, where 
any residue produced can be used in a new product. 
In recent years, the cultivation of Maggot Black Soldier Fly (BSF) has become an alternative for 
processing organic waste because it has no adverse side effects on the environment. This method is not 
like the gasification process, which still produces emissions, although the emissions produced are less than 
the direct combustion model (Falatehan & Sari, 2020). It also does not require a large land area to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, such as biogas installations (Sari et al., 2019). In addition, this method can 
minimize environmental health problems and public health problems caused for areas that do not have 
facilities and means of transporting waste to the trash (Sari et al., 2018). 
BSF larvae can be an alternative to conventional feed. Feed formulations have been widely used, but 
the price is relatively high. BSF larvae can be fed with various foods such as kitchen waste, fruits, 
vegetables, liver, fish waste, urban waste, human waste, and animal waste (Yuwono & Mentari, 2018). 
Maggot BSF can decompose organic waste containing 60% to 90% water content. In addition, maggot 
black soldier fly food is high in protein and carbohydrates, suitable for larvae for nutritional needs. Several

The conclusion drawn from the study is that the results of laboratory tests on the use of BSF larvae as 
fish feed showed that the water content, protein, fat, and ash content values were following the quality 
standard values used. The crude fiber content is relatively high so that the value of the natural fiber content 
exceeds the quality standard. According to researchers, BSF maggot is an alternative feed used for fish 
because it is rich in water, protein, fat, ash, and fiber content.

1. Introduction 
Since the enactment of Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia November 6 of 2014 concerning Villages, the 
Village has an important role in moving the regional or regional and national economy wheels. Article 1 
number 1 of Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Number 6 of 2014 states that what is called a village is a 
village and customary village or what is called by another name, hereinafter referred to as a village, is a legal 
community unit that has territorial boundaries that are authorized to regulate and manage government affairs, 
the interests of the community. based on community initiatives, origin rights, and/or traditional rights that are 
recognized and respected in the system of government of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia 
(Anonim, 2014). 
 
To realize the vision and mission of the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Mr. Jokowi, the village is one 
of the targets of the realization of the vision and mission. The village is a community-based area (self-
governing community and local self-government) whose position is within the district/city territory but does 
not necessarily become subordinate to the district/city (Puspitasari et al., 2019; Putra, 2015). Villages are in 
the form of community government or community-based government and villages are not identical with 
village government (Kurniawan, 2016; Puspitasari et al., 2019; Sofiyanto et al., 2017). Pasal 3 of Undang-
Undang RI Number 6 of 2014 concerning Villages stipulates the principle of recognition and subsidiarity for 
Villages. The principle of recognition as an acknowledgment of the right of origin and the principle of 
subsidiarity as the determination of local-scale authority and local decision-making for the benefit of the 
Village (Harmiati & Zulhakim, 2018; Kurniawan, 2016; Puspitasari et al., 2019; Putra, 2015; Sofiyanto et al., 
2017).

Table 6 shows that the alternative strategies that need to be carried out to manage Bumdes are first, the SO 
strategy, in the form of restructuring the Bumdes management, a strategy for developing Bumdes 
qualifications, and the commitment of Bumdes managers. Second, the WO strategy, in the form of conducting 
training for Bumdes management, adding productive business units and increasing promotions. Third, the ST 
strategy, in the form of conducting training for Bumdes management, adding productive business units and 
increasing promotions. Fourth, the WT strategy is to increase promotions, cooperate with other parties to 
expand networks. 
 
From these results, a suitable strategy was chosen in managing and developing Bumdes, namely: first, the 
strategy for managing Bumdes in the form of the need for a Regent's Regulation on Bumdes, restructuring the 
Bumdes organization in accordance with PP. 11 of 2021. Second, the strategy to develop Bumdes, in the form 
of innovation and creativity of business units, coordination and collaboration with village heads and BPD, 
promotions, establishing collaborative networks with associations or Bumdes communities both inside and 
outside the Jombang area. 
 
The results of this research are in accordance with research conducted by (Asiyah, 2017; Delita et al., 2017; 
Fahmi et al., 2018; Istiqomah & Andriyanto, 2018; Romadona & Setiawan, 2020; Tamara, 2016). In addition, 
the results of this research also support research from (Sayekti Suindyah D, 2015) which was conducted in 
2011 in Tulungagung Regency. 
 
The strategy for restructuring the Bumdes management in accordance with PP No. 11 of 2021 is urgently 
needed. This is in accordance with research results from (Aradea et al., 2010; Glensor, 2010; Harkness, 2000; 
Harminingtyas, 2010; Latilla et al., 2020; Lewin, 1947).

Conclusions 
Based on the research results, conclusions can be drawn about the management of change in the management 
of Bumdes using strategies, including the Bumdes management strategy, in the form of the need for a Regent 
Regulation on Bumdes, organizational restructuring of Bumdes in accordance with PP. 11 of 2021, and 
strategies for developing Bumdes, in the form of innovation and creativity of business units, coordination and 
collaboration with village heads and BPD, promotions, establishing collaborative networks with associations or 
Bumdes communities both inside and outside the Jombang area. 
. 
Recommendations 
The implementation of these strategies cannot be carried out alone by the district government, sub-district, 
village and Bumdes parties, but requires coordination and collaboration between these parties, as well as 
cooperating with the wider community.

Abstract 
 
The competitive advantage of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has been identified as a key topic for scholars 
studying SME internationalization. Even though firm competitive advantage has long been discussed as a 
determinant of international performance, few studies have examined the determinants of firm competitive 
advantage and their potential mediating role in the relationship between organizational capabilities and SMEs' 
international performance. As determinants of competitive advantage for exporting SMEs, there are four hypotheses 
of crucial export capabilities (market intelligence, product innovation, price, and marketing communications). The 
results of SEM with Smart PLS on a sample of 100 active exporting Indonesian SMEs show that three of these 
characteristics lead to competitive advantage. The main conclusion of this research will be useful for SMEs and 
startups who want to explore prospects in foreign markets.

1. Introduction 
In Indonesia, small and medium companies (SMEs) play an essential role in both economic growth and job. Despite 
the growing importance of emerging countries in global commerce, 34 OECD member countries continue to 
contribute 5662 percent of the value of global merchandise exports between 2010 and 2018. (ITC, 2019). Large 
corporations, as opposed to small and medium-sized businesses, are better suited to capitalize on trade possibilities 
(SMEs). For example, SMEs in the United States, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China, and 
Japan contribute at 30-38 percent of total national exports (Hammers and Stamps, 2010). SMEs contribute much 
more to exports in emerging countries. SMEs in ASEAN member countries, for example, only donate with an 
average of 23% of overall exports (Wignaraja, 2012; Yoshino and Wignaraja, 2015). Similarly, in Indonesia, the 
percentage of SMEs (including micro-companies) in overall exports is quite limited, given the fact that they are the 
primary source of business establishment, employment opportunities, and added value production. SMEs account 
for around 99.99 percent of total business entities, generate more than 97 percent of job possibilities, and contribute 
over 60 percent of Indonesia's GDP (Indrawan, 2019). On the other hand, despite a consistent increase in the total 
value of Indonesia's annual exports, the share of SMEs in non-oil and gas exports has continued to fall, from around 
18.5 percent in 2005-2007 to 16.9 percent in 2008-2010, and then to 15.4 percent between 2011 and 2013. (Ministry 
of Cooperatives and SMEs, 2015). In 2017, SMEs accounted for 97.3 percent of all business establishments in 
Indonesia, contributing 37 percent of the country's GDP and 66 percent of total employment. Because exporting 
allows SMEs to increase their market coverage, the Indonesian government enthusiastically promotes SMEs to 
explore the overseas market for possible company growth. This has never been an easy task, though. To compete 
with other industry players around the world, SMEs must gain a competitive advantage. The majority of the research 
on export performance has focused on the links between capabilities and performance, but few studies have looked 
at the impact of organizational capabilities on competitive advantage. Further, research on the determinants of 
international success yielded mixed results when it came to the effects of competencies on firm performance 
(Beleska-Spasova, 2014). The internationalization environment is complicated, a step-by-step understanding of 
whether inconsistent capability-performance results are due to some organizational capabilities failing to provide 
competitive advantages has likely been neglected. Because firm competitive advantage and business performance

Abstract  
 
 
This research aims to describe the E-learning platform used by teachers to assess students' performance in English 
class. Industrial revolution 4.0 has changed various aspects of the education system. The educational institution needs 
to produce human resources that can compete and contribute globally. This research reveals the E-learning platform 
used by teachers in the teaching-learning process, in pandemic covid-19, especially platform used in assessing 
students‚Äô performance. There are four teachers of English from different senior high schools as the research subjects. 
They are the four biggest schools in Sidoarjo, East Java, Indonesia. Descriptive qualitative is applied in this research. 
Observation and questionnaires are the instruments used for gathering data from the subjects. The research found that 
the teachers of English have not used various platforms of assessment yet. All teachers used Google forms to assess 
the affective domain. For the cognitive domain, they used Google Forms, Google Drive, and Quizzes, while WhatsApp 
group, YouTube, and Google Meeting were used to assess the students‚Äô performance in the psychomotor domain.  
Only a teacher has ever applied Kahoot! and Quizizz. They need more knowledge and training about various E-

1. Introduction  
The fourth industrial revolution contributes to and has a significant impact on the world of life. Of course, 
this has a huge impact on education, particularly in Indonesia. This influence causes changes in previously face-to-
face interactions in class, resulting in metabolism with the internet (online). The activity in learning evaluation is no 
exception, in the form of facilities that can support learning activities in the classroom and are connected to the internet 
network as a collaborator to integrate face-to-face activities with the internet network.  
Learning content in the twenty-first century must always adapt to changes, including those in the industrial 
era. 4.0. The learning content is expected to fulfill 21st-century skills (21st-century skills) in the form of a) mastering 
diverse knowledge and skills, learning and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, communication and 
collaboration, and creativity and innovation; b) Information literacy, media literacy, and ICT literacy are examples of 
digital literacy skills; and c) career and life skills include adaptability and flexibility, initiative, social and cultural 
interaction, productivity and accountability, and leadership and responsibility.  
The teachers must design the educational goals containing 21st-century skills. According to Bloom's 
Taxonomy, educational goals are divided into three categories: cognitive domain, affective domain, and psychomotor 
domain. The categories reflect the students‚Äô competence which necessitates setting satisfactory performance 
expectations for students as they progress through the curriculum. The teachers could identify the students‚Äô 
performance by doing an assessment.  
Assessment of student performance provides students with feedback on what they have or have not learned, 
as well as information that teachers can use to make student progress decisions. Assessment refers to the process of

recently. The teacher starts familiar with Microsoft Teams and another did not yet.  
 
 
6. Conclusion 
The knowledge and skills of teachers in using E-Learning platforms are limited. Most of them just use the 
communication platforms and Google in teaching and assessing. They do not know another variant of E-Learning 
platforms for assessing the students‚Äô performance except WhatsApp, YouTube, google forms, and Google drive. Just 
one of them has ever used Quizizz. The teachers need to improve their knowledge and skills in technologies for the 
teaching-learning process.

 Every company has a vision and mission, as well as a desire to meet the goals it has established. These short- 
and long-term goals can be met in a variety of ways. As a result, the companies require a well-defined plan to 
attain their objectives. Increased corporate value, for example, in terms of increased profits, is one of the goals 
that is frequently met. Employees, managers, company owners, and investors all have problems when it comes 
to running a firm. Conflicts of interest and many types of interests from diverse roles inside the company, for 
example. This poses ethical concerns that affect the company's internal as well as external environments. This is 
a qualitative study that employs a literature review methodology. The findings of this study offer a new way of 
looking at ethical issues and corporate strategy: the corporate value approach. As a result, the contribution of 
this research gives a solution for businesses that are experiencing similar issues. 
Keywords: Economics, Business Ethics, Corporate Strategy. 
INTRODUCTION 
Developments in the financial services industry, especially those that are directly related to the global banking 
industry, have prompted many shareholders, company owners, and other financial institutions as well as 
stakeholders to question the moral obligations of companies. Moral obligations and business ethics are an 
integral and important part of the strategic management process in a company (McManus, 2011). The failures of 
companies such as Lehman Brothers and scandals such as Adelphia Communications, Arthur Andersen, Enron, 
and WorldCom have contributed greatly to providing a perspective in building and maintaining shareholder and 
business trust. 
 
For example, a study conducted by Barnard highlighted the leadership of a company CEO to be able to have a 
sense of moral responsibility (Barnard, 1968). Barnard laid out some of the basic principles of strategic 
management including the management of individual and corporate objectives. Barnard argues that the 
executive management process is not based purely on an intellectual perspective; it must be in accordance with 
aesthetics and morals, which involves a sense of self-confidence and appropriate responsibilities. Barnard 
further suggests that organizations survive in proportion to the extent of morality they have set in the 
organization. Executives have a moral responsibility to those they serve. The CEO/ leader also has a 
responsibility to inspire through leadership and by creating trust through shared understanding and purpose. 
 
Early pioneers of strategy and strategic thinking such as (Chandler, 1990) and (Ansoff, 1965) provided support 
for ethical decision-making. Ansoff, in his book dealing with Corporate Strategy establishing a practical system 
for strategic decision making in business firms, identifies a prescriptive methodology for determining general 
ethical objectives in strategy formulation. Herbert Simon, Nobel Prize in Economics, shared his views on 
common goals by explaining that administrative decisions in an organizational context always have ethical and 
factual content (Simon & March 2006). 
 
In line with Chandler's thinking, Andrews argues that corporate strategy is an organizational process in building 
its business and in many ways cannot be separated from the structure, behavior, and culture of the company, 
which in essence provides the basis for corporate strategy by defining the context in which the company will 
operate both in terms of human and economic (Andrews, 1971). Furthermore (Schendel & Hofer, 1979) also 
describes the results of their analysis related to a corporate strategy that will connect the organization with its 
social and political environment in the same way as the company's strategy interacts with industrial structures 
and the economic environment. Schendel strongly supports more pragmatic research in this domain. To some 
extent, their arguments represent a call for a more rigorous understanding of the ethical and social characteristics 
that dominate decision-making in companies.

4068","Therefore, building a good relationship with the Owner of everything is something that must be done by all 
employees in our company. In addition, if the company wants to grow, the community must also grow. This 
must be in line with the economy, meaning that the company's economy is good, so the community must also 
have a good economy (eg in terms of income). In terms of an employee, welfare must be considered, salaries 
must be paid on time. Islam teaches to pay wages on time. That's the principle we hold in running the company's 
business. So employees can focus on work without thinking about anything else."" 
From the results of the interview, several things that can be revealed related to the company's ethics and 
business strategy are as follows:

Closeness to the owner of 
everything (Allah SWT) 
Ethics in business is based on a 
relationship with Allah SWT. So that in 
running a business the guidelines are 
generally accepted rules and religious 
teachings (may and may not). The 
company's business strategy is based on 
business development from three 
perspectives, namely a business strategy 
built with Allah SWT, a strategy built with 
the community, and a strategy built with 
the environment. In theory, it is generally 
related to social and environmental ethics

From the results of the research presented in table 2, it is true that in carrying out the company's strategy, it does 
not only look at individualistic interests or based on certain interests. However, there are values that must be 
held by the company, its owners, and its employees so that the company can survive and grow in business 
competition. Therefore, companies need to have a strategy based on three perspectives of business 
ethics; including (1) religious perspective, (2) owner perspective, (3) employee perspective, and (4) community 
perspective. This can be used as the basis for maintaining the direction of the company's vision and mission. So 
that the strategy carried out by the company has a value that can be beneficial for both the company and external 
parties related to the company. 
  
 
CONCLUSION 
Cases that affect large companies such as Enron, Lehman Brothers, and WorldCom are caused by conflicts of 
interest within the companies. In addition to carrying out the vision and mission, the company should have 
values that can be used as a guide in carrying out its business activities. Value in this study is an ethical

4072","perspective that can be a reference for companies in maintaining their business activities so that they can run 
properly and correctly. 
The ethics that must be maintained by the company include: 
1. Ethics of relationship with God 
This ethics is a company procedure to run its business in accordance with religious rules. Rules made 
by humans are very vulnerable to be manipulated so that by adopting religious rules in running a 
business, it is expected to maintain good values in doing business. 
2. Ethics of the Company Owner's relationship with God 
This ethic is a procedure for leading a company based on the owner's relationship with God. The 
existence of faith that is owned by the leadership is expected to maintain every decision-making in 
accordance with the company's goals in a good direction. 
3. Ethics of Employee and Leadership Relations 
It is an employee-leadership relationship that is moderated by belief in God. So that in carrying out 
work activities there are religious values in it which are expected to maintain the quality of employee 
work. 
4. Ethics of the Company's Relations with the Community and the Environment 
Companies, the environment, and society cannot be separated. If none of the three are harmed by each 
other, then the company's activities that develop will be in line with the integrity of the environment 
and the welfare of the community.

Abstract 
 
The Merdeka Learning-Merdeka Campus (MBKM) policy triggers Narotama University Surabaya to carry out 
innovative and creative teaching and learning activities. All parties involved, ranging from students, lecturers, 
and universities in general, enthusiastically welcomed the offers of new programs, one of which was the 
internship program. It is a way in the construction sector to finish all jobs with the help of digital tools and 
software. This study aims to describe the implementation of construction internships in the construction and 
infrastructure industry's digital era. It is seen from the point of view of university assessments in general. 
Crosstab analysis is used to see whether there is a relationship between effectiveness and the resulting benefits 
to the policies and processes of apprenticeship activities. The results prove that the Civil Engineering Study 
Program has run it well. Other study programs have also understood the concept of digital internships to 
improve soft skills.

1. Introduction 
The MBKM activity is a framework to prepare students to become solid and relevant graduates to the needs of 
the times, which is carried out based on the Minister of Education and Culture Regulation No. 3 of 2020. It 
consists of four central policies (Tohir, 2020): study programs, higher education accreditation system, changing 
university status to a legal entity, and student learning rights. The last one gives the right to study for three 
semesters outside the study program, both within one faculty, on- and off-campus, and even in the field, namely 
in industry and society.

6. Conclusions 
The results of the crosstab calculation on the Chi-Square test of all study programs indicate a relationship 
between the Civil Engineering Study Program and others in understanding the MBKM internship program. In 
general, they can receive and run the internship program well. Internship experience for six months can improve 
soft skills and be used for work after graduation.Information Systems and Management Study Program showed 
high enthusiasm in the digital internship program. In addition, the University has facilitated student internship 
progress reports on the Simnaro online internship guidance page. Students can see the obstacles in the project 
and then learn how to solve them.Thus, the implementation of the MBKM program for digital construction 
apprenticeships can be accepted by all parties.

Abstract 
 
Traveling to various countries and cities is usually fun and tiring. The same is true for urban residents whose 
transportation needs are very high. Speed of accessibility is very urgent in the lane between potential passengers and 
vehicle owners. With the presence of information technology such as FinTech it has become more convenient and 
beautiful. An accurate digital payment method can make a real difference from the previous one. With digital 
payment technology it has become fast and accurate for many people living in urban areas. In Indonesia, the 
percentage of fintech users for payment and online vehicle applications proliferates, providing fresh air for 
entrepreneurs and loyal customers. In Indonesia, the percentage of fintech users and online vehicle applications is 
growing rapidly, how the providers strategies for giving services to their new and loyal customers. This paper aims 
to enhance Fintech services with online vehicle applications in urban areas around Jakarta.

1. Introduction 
The increasing number of motorized vehicles in urban areas will increase congestion in big cities, especially those 
that already use digital services as online transportation (Brandt et al., 2020). To support high community mobility, 
an effective mode of transportation is needed to get to work insufficient time (Indra, 2017, Purba 2020, Tan et al 
2019). Urban transportation problems generally include traffic jams, parking, public transport, pollution and traffic 
order problems. As stated by (Munawar, 2007) the, congestion always has a negative impact, both on the driver 
himself and in terms of the economy and the environment. Negative impacts on the environment in the form of 
increased air pollution due to CO toxic gas and increased vehicle noise, beside it caused congestion that consumes 
time and fuel for running vehicles. 
 
Since the emergence of online transportation services for the first time in 2014 in Indonesia, it has changed how 
urban residents, especially residents of Jakarta and other urban areas move in their activities (Agostino et al., 2021) 
(A. Purba & Purba, 2020) (Tan et al., 2019). Most of the residents of Jakarta admit that this service is an alternative 
mode of transportation to avoid traffic jams that often occur in the capital (A. Purba et al., 2019)(J. T. Purba et al., 
2020). In addition, convenience, flexibility, and affordable prices are some of the main reasons why this service is 
multiplying in recent years (Arshad & Su, 2015). Now, this service does have not only transportation services but 
also food and beverage delivery services and documents (Nielsen, 2019)(Primahendra et al., 2021). Unfortunately,

smaller than 0.90; therefore, this analysis AGFI value is marginal fit with result 0.676 < 0.90. Measurement of

5. Conclusion 
In this study, the researchers wanted to prove how digital technology supports the community to survive during 
strict restrictions during the pandemicCov-19 in the Jakarta Bogor Tangerang Bekasi, in Indonesia. This study uses a 
model with a research framework as discussed in this study. The literature review leads to the development of five 
hypotheses according to the proposed framework. The presence of digital technology gives support to the financial 
technology payment with an available platform for food delivery feature in the mobile application of the consumers.  
 
This study found that Fintech providers as companies engaged in e-commerce and digital money in building 
relationships with their customers are very dependent on the ability of their customers to use internet technology. 
This technology becomes the revolution to supply chain and others that applied to respective consumers with digital 
technology. Such technology application is a new civilization that forced the people to use in the force majeure 
situation. The core of this business always emphasizes online or non-cash, both for payment for buying and selling 
goods and payments for bills. 
 
This technology can be installed for both operations in IOS and android mobile devices that provide an online 
ordering that is safe, comfortable, useful, and efficient and the delivery of goods and other services available in this 
application technology.

1. Introduction 
The main objective of a firm is to maximize the value of the firm or wealth for shareholders. Firm value is an 
investor's perception of the firm that is often associated with the share price of a firm. The higher the share price, the 
higher the value of the firm, on the contrary if the share price is lower, the lower the value of the firm (Henriansyah 
and Dharmayuni, 2017). 
 
Automotive and component companies are part of the manufacturing industry in Indonesia. The automotive industry 
is one of the flagship sectors that continues to prioritize its development because it plays a big role in national 
economic growth (Baihaqi et al., 2019). The development of the automotive industry needs to continue because the 
automotive industry has a wide association with other economic sectors and also has considerable domestic market 
potential. With a lot of investment from the world automotive industry so as to contribute positively to the national 
economy and the absorption of professional labor in Indonesia as well as improving the competitiveness of 
Indonesian automotive products. 
 
However, during the last five years, 2015-2019, automotive and component companies experienced fluctuating 
share prices. This share price volatility is very interesting to study further, because it will have an impact on the 
value of a company. In 2016 the firm average share price decreased by 1.30%, in 2017 decreased by 12.49%, in 
2018 it increased by 2.32% and in 2019 experienced an increase of 3.88% (idx.co.id, 2021). Therefore, it can be

4092","Based on the partial test, dividend policy with dividend payout ratio (DPR) proxy affects the Firm value with PBV 
proxy with the direction of influence given is positive. This is because the size of the dividend policy will affect the 
share price. If the dividend paid is high, then the share price will tend to be high so that the value of the firm is also 
high. Signalling theory explains that dividend payments are a sign that firms have predictions of high cash flow 
potential in the future and otherwise low dividends contain signals that the firm cash flow is limited. 
This research is in line with research conducted by Akbar and Fahmi (2020) which states that dividend policy has a 
significant effect on the value of the firm, but this result is not in line with research conducted by Utama and Dana 
(2019) which states that the dividend policy has no effect on the value of the firm. 
 
6.5 Effect of Investment Opportunity Set, Firm Size, Institutional Ownership and Dividend Policy on Firm 
Value 
Based on the test results above, it was found that Investment Opportunity Set, Firm Size, Institutional Ownership 
and Dividend Policy simultaneously affect the Firm Value. It can be a concern for the firm to pay more attention to 
these four elements. Investment Opportunity Set, Firm Size, Institutional Ownership and Dividend Policy may affect 
the Firm Value. These four elements can make a firm value go up or even down. 
 
The results of this research are in line with research conducted by Kartasukmana (2015) which states that Investment 
Opportunity Set, Institutional Ownership and Dividend Policy have an effect on the Firm Value and research 
conducted by Firmansyah and Suwitho (2017) which states that the Firm Size and Dividend Policy affect the Firm 
Value. 
 
7. Conclusion  
Then the researcher took some conclusions as follows: 
1. Investment Opportunity Set has no effect on the Firm Value in Automotive and Component Companies listed 
on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019.  
2. Firm Size affects the Firm Value in Automotive and Component Companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019. With the direction of influence given firm size the value of the company 
is negative.  
3. Institutional Ownership affects the Firm Value in Automotive and Component Companies listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019. With the direction of influence given firm size the value 
of the firm is negative.  
4. Dividend Policy affects the Firm Value in Automotive and Component Companies listed on the Indonesia 
Stock Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019. With the direction of influence given firm size the value of the 
firm is positive.  
5. Investment Opportunity Set, Firm Size, Institutional Ownership and Dividend Policy affect the Firm Value in 
Automotive and Component Companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the period 2015 ‚Äì 2019.

Abstract  
 
The development of organizations in Indonesia is increasingly rapid and competitive. One of the growing 
organizations in Indonesia is a cooperative. Cooperative is a form of business that is characterized by togetherness 
or based on kinship. In Indonesia, cooperatives are engaged in various fields to achieve community welfare. At first, 
cooperatives were a collection of people who had a lower level of the economy, where through cooperatives they 
both wanted or had a goal to improve their welfare. Nationally, the number of registered cooperatives is more than 
adequate to support the people's economic movement. This means that if the existing number has a paradigm, 
ideology, and a real cooperative spirit, it will become a very large force and provide guarantees for economic 
sustainability that is based on the spirit of self-help and cooperation. This condition actually became the ideals of the 
founding fathers of the nation when they had to choose the economic model to be built when the world was divided 
into 2 (two) models, namely capitalism and socialism. Cooperatives have similarities with the original social system 
of the Indonesian nation, namely collectivism. The Indonesian gotong royong community likes to help each other.  
 Keywords:  
Cooperatives, People's Economy, Business Entities, Family, Gotong Royong. 
 
1. Introduction

strengthening and empowerment cooperatives in economic recovery during the Covid-19 pandemic in Bogor Regency.

accelerating economic recovery in the form of institutional strengthening and empowerment as well as cooperative 
movement efforts as the driving force for Bogor Regency with new breakthrough ideas. Provide

2. Literature Review 
In-Law Number 25 of 1992 it is explained that ""A cooperative is a business entity consisting of a person or a 
cooperative legal entity, by basing its activities on the cooperative principle as well as a people's economic movement

4105","Who masters information technology, he will lead the world'. Microsoft strengthens MSME information technology 
with application training to strengthen competitiveness and effectiveness in production and marketing aspects 
(Tosida et al. 2018, Tosida et al. 2019). Thanks to the digital ecosystem, everyone has no boundaries anymore. Big 
companies are not necessarily better than smaller companies. Likewise in cooperatives, quantitatively large and small 
scale cooperatives do not guarantee their durability against qualitative digitalization and automation. Now everyone 
can take on the role they want in the ‚Äúeconomic cake‚Äù that has been presented (Figure 6). 
 
Figure.6. Information Portal UMKM Bogor Regency 
 
To meet the needs of the economic progress of the people of Bogor Regency, especially in the field of Micro, Small, 
and Medium Enterprises, the MSME Cooperative Service cooperates with the Communication and Information Office 
and the Industry and Trade Office in realizing strategic marketing in the digital era. This strategy can declare to be 
validation technique for this research. 
In the latest breakthrough web address umkm.bogorkab.go.id, there are many features offered. Such as making the 
profile of the business unit itself, e-catalog, detailed products that are marketed. Entrepreneurs are also given the 
opportunity with a blog facility where they can review their MSME activities. Another advantage that can be obtained 
is supporting the marketing strategy. With the existence of a special web portal in such a way, industry activists can 
interact and support each other to be able to market their products not only on a national scale but also contribute to 
the international arena. 
Of the many things described earlier, of course, data collection on the community's industry is very important for 
regional economic progress. Because according to Christian Messakh, the number of industrial units in the Bogor 
district is estimated at more than 10,000 units. Until now, from the results of direct involvement in the field with the 
relevant agencies, the local government has confirmed that 2000 MSME units have been registered on the MSME 
special web. This data collection will continue to be carried out consistently by conducting socialization and inviting 
industrial community activists to participate. 
In addition to entrepreneurs getting strategic points in marketing, registered MSMEs will be given guidance and 
training by the government. With this provision, it is hoped that the local community's economy can be much more 
effective and advanced. It is planned that the debriefing is scheduled after July with a target of 1000 participants and 
will continue as needed. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Cooperatives and MSMEs, especially micro, must build the synergy of the two institutions to be necessary. Because 
the potential for micro-enterprises, especially those associated with cooperatives, is quite large. First, the dominance 
of economic activity in Indonesia in terms of a large number of MSMEs. Second, micro MSMEs have the fighting 
power to survive in a difficult economic era. This is verified by history. Third, MSMEs when they join cooperatives 
have strong bargaining power with third parties. Because cooperatives with legal entities will easily access capital, 
provide guidance to their members and have the opportunity to prosper together. Fourth, there are requirements for 
synergy, namely improvements to cooperatives so that regulations are strong enough, professional management, 
access to capital opportunities, and assistance from both central and regional governments.

very limited so that innovative business actors by utilizing digital technology have far more potential to access better 
markets. With assistance from the government local, technically it accommodates the role of the parties in digital 
marketing and educates business actors to have the capacity to take advantage of access to digital marketing.  
It is necessary to formulate policies that are implementable in the form of programming and activities by the 
Department of Cooperatives and MSMEs in Bogor Regency to strengthen and empower cooperatives, in the form of

Introduction 
Optimization of Regional Original Income (PAD) became a phenomenon that appeared in almost all districts / cities 
in Indonesia after the enactment of the era of regional autonomy. The local government can manage and manage its 
own government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and auxiliary duties and each region is given the 
authority to manage finances derived from the Regional Original Income (PAD). According to (Rahmawati, Somaji 
and Adenan, 2019) Broadly speaking, the implementation of fiscal decentralization is one form of solution undertaken 
by the government to improve and equal the welfare of the community by transferring power from the central 
government to the local government through authorities in the government financial sector. increase in Regional 
Original Income (PAD) becomes one of the fiscal instruments that can not be avoided in building the regional economy. 
According to Mardiasmo (2002), Regional Original Income is revenues obtained from the local tax sector, regional 
levies, the proceeds of regionally owned companies, the results of the management of regional wealth that is separated, 
and other legitimate local revenues.  
One of the efforts to improve the ability in the field of funding the implementation of local government for economic 
growth development is to increase and explore every potential that exists in each region, and small medium enterprises 
(SMEs) in telematic field is one of the sector which is potential to develop according to industry 4.0 (Tosida et al. 
2018, Tosida et al. 2019, Tosida et al. 2020) . According to (Akmaliyah, 2013) The amount and increase of adequate 
PAD contributions will determine the level of independence of the District /City Government in its regional 
development so that it does not always depend on assistance from the Central Government and provincial governments. 
The effort is always carried out by the Bogor City Government by always trying to increase the Regional Native 
Income (PAD) and Economic Growth. Various obstacles faced by the Bogor City Government in optimally improving 
regional native income and economic growth in the city of Bogor, including efforts made by the Bogor City 
Government during the covid-19 pandemic which is an extraordinary event that must be as soon as possible to find a 
solution to every problem that exists. According to Bima Arya, the Mayor of Bogor, at the PAD Evaluation Rackor 
mentioned that pad evaluation rackor is not just pursuing the annual routine target, but is intended to build a system so 
that pad Bogor city can be improved for the benefit of the community (Kotabogor.go.id, 2019). The following is the 
report on the Realization of The Original Revenue of Bogor City in the Regional Revenue Report showed in Figure 1.

the H1 is rejected. Thus it can be concluded that the Regional Native Income partially has no significant effect on 
Economic Growth. 
 
The coefficient of determination (R2) describes how far the model can go in describing dependent variables. The 
coefficient of determination is zero and 1 or ( 0 < x < 1). A small R2 value means that the ability of independent 
variables to describe dependent variables is very limited. A value close to 1 in independent variables gives all the 
information needed to predict dependent variable variations. The results of determination coefficient test showed in

The data table above describes the model summary, which consists of multiple correlation results (R), determination 
coefficient (R Square), adjusted determination coefficient (Adjusted R Square) and measurement of prediction errors 
(Std Error of The Estimate), among others: 
The coefficient of determination of R Square (R2) or the square of R is 0.747. From the output obtained a coefficient 
of determination (R square) of 0.559, which contains the sense that the influence of free variables (Regional Native 
Income) on bound variables (Economic Growth) is as large as 55.9%.   
The F test or regression coefficient test is jointly used to determine if the va riabel is dependent. All independent 
variabbels can be said to have a mutual influence on dependent variables. The simultaneous test results showed in

This study does not require a regression coefficient test (Test F), because this study only uses 1 independent variable 
namely Regional Native Income (X) and 1 dependent variable namely Economic Growth (Y), which there are no other 
variables together to be tested against dependent variables that are economic growth. 
 
5.   Conclusion 
This study aims to determine the optimization of Regional Native Income to Economic Growth in Bogor City in 
Fiscal Year 2015-2020 (Covid-19 Pandemic). By using 1 variable X namely PAD and 1 variable Y namely Economic 
Growth. Based on the discussion that researchers have discussed dibab previously the author concluded as follows: 
1. Bogor Municipality always strives to improve PAD, starting from service to the community, which is now not 
only conventionally available to bapenda offices but taxpayers can pay their taxes through banks, post offices,

PPOB bayarin aja. In addition, prospective taxpayers can also report sppt through online websites. Then, by the 
time of 2020, pandemic comes and the economy is very down. Including regional income, because during the 
pandemic all are limited to quarantine and freeze activities in order to break the chain of the covid-19 virus. Bogor 
City Government continues to find ways to keep regional revenues running even during pandemics like this. 
Therefore, there is a policy of leniency in paying taxes for taxpayers such as extended tax payment period, 
reduction of tax payable by BPHTB, free of UN fines, free of administrative sanctions on payment of local tax 
receivables (self), reduction of BPHTB payments, unanized tax discounts P2 and others. The waivers are done to 
relieve the taxpayer but the area still has the usual regional revenues.

and growth in the field of services and trade. Bogor City Government utilizes the resources owned by the City of 
Bogor, namely the tourism sector that is a mainstay in exploring the potential of the city. Bogor city is considered 
as an independent city and has the highest economic growth rate among other cities and districts around it. Bogor 
City is a city of services and tourism industry and creative economy so that the Bogor City Government prepares 
infrastructure that support it. Therefore, the city of Bogor has local destinations with their own characteristics that 
can attract tourists to the city of Bogor which will later increase economic growth in the city of Bogor. But at the 
time of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, economic growth in Bogor city dropped and even touched a negative 
percentage of -0.53.  Apart from that, bogor city government always strives to restore the economy that is now 
gradually rising through MSME activities and vaccinations conducted in the ballrooms of malls in Bogor City 
which one of the objectives is to attract visitors to make purchases of goods and services. 
3. Regional Original Income has no positive effect on the Economic Growth of Bogor City in Fiscal Year 2015-
2020. This is evidenced by the significance value of 0.088 which is greater than 0.05 of thitung of 2.250 < 2.77645. 
It hereby shows that the PAD level in the Bogor City Government has no significant effect on Economic Growth. 
This is an indication that the impact of PAD and Economic Growth on the impact of the pandemic that is sweeping 
around the world, especially the city of Bogor.

1. Introduction  
The progress or destruction of a country depends on the youth, this has been felt by Indonesia which was able to 
achieve independence thanks to the struggle and role of the youth. Since the time of independence until now, youth 
organizations in Indonesia have continued growing and take various forms. One form of youth organization in 
Indonesia is Karang Taruna. Karang Taruna is a forum for the development of the non-participant young generation 
that grows on the basis of awareness and a sense of social responsibility for the community, especially the younger 
generation in the village or sub-district area or an equal social community engaged in social welfare (Salmah et al., 
2020).  
As a youth social organization, Karang Taruna is a forum for fostering and developing as well as empowering in an 
effort to develop productive economic activities by utilizing all the potential available in the enviroenment, both 
human resources and existing natural resources (Baesti, 2017). Karang Taruna is a forum that can help the government 
in solving social problems that exist in the community and can also be a forum for the development of rural 
communities. The purpose of establishing youth organizations is to provide guidance and empowerment to youth in a 
village or region in the fields of economy, sports, skills, religion and the arts (Angkasawati, 2018). In addition, youth 
organizations were established together youth workers and channel their potential to develop and become supporters 
in the development of a village or region.  
One of the Youth Organizationa located in Cibinong Village, Bogor Regency, West Java, Indonesia, named Karang 
Taruna Cibinong Village. Realizes how important the role of youth in the area is build the welfare of the community. 
However, the background of the youth in Cibinong Village who only graduated from high school makes many youths 
in this village are still unemployed. The low level of education of the youth makes it difficult for them to find work. 
In addition, the lack of soft skills from the youth makes them less confident to apply for jobs because they will compete 
with graduates from diploma and undergraduate programs. Turistiati and Ramadhan (2019) Soft Skills are abilities 
beyond technical and academic abilities that prioritize intra and interpersonal skills. Soft skills include motivation, 
character, attitudes, self concept, values, self confidence, communication skills and others.

5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the discussion that has been stated above, it can be concluded that there is an increase in the 
soft skills of the Karang Taruna youth in Cibinong village. This can be seen from the increasing understanding of each 
training variable given. The highest increase in the first order is in the psychological test variable, the second is the 
grooming variable, the third is general questions, the fourth is interview techniques and CV making, and the fifth is 
the use of social media to apply for jobs. Young people think that by participating in preparatory training to enter the 
world of work, their knowledge will be improved and the process of applying for jobs can be carried out more 
effectively and efficiently.

ABSTRACT 
 
One of the government's efforts to realize a responsive law is to implement laws such as the implementation of 
Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine. The problems studied are how to apply criminal 
sanctions in Law Number 6 of 2018 for violators of Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) in the Jabodetabek 
area and what obstacles are faced in implementing criminal sanctions against PSBB violators and what are the 
solutions. The research method used is normative legal research which is supported by empirical research, while 
the data collection technique uses library research and field research. The results of the study indicate that the 
application of criminal sanctions in Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine is in the form of 
imprisonment and fines. Obstacles encountered in the application of criminal sanctions against violators of 
Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) and efforts to resolve them include unclear references to articles 
regarding criminal threats in regional regulations regarding PSBB. Another obstacle is the lack of precise 
application of criminal sanctions against PSBB violators. As an effort to overcome this obstacle, namely, the 
application of criminal sanctions against PSBB violators is the ultimum remedium or last resort.

1.  Introduction 
Indonesia's national development aims to promote the general welfare, to create a just and prosperous society 
based on Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia (UUD 1945). To achieve this goal, 
the Government of Indonesia seeks to develop and strengthen all sectors of people's lives, including health. This 
is in accordance with the right to live needs of Indonesian citizens as reflected in Article 28H paragraph (1) of 
the 1945 Constitution, which states that: Everyone has the right to live in physical and spiritual prosperity, to 
have a place to live, and to have a good and healthy living environment and has the right to obtain Health 
services are realized through the development of the health sector. Health development according to Article 3 of 
Law Number 36 of 2009 concerning Health, aims to increase awareness, willingness, and ability to live healthy 
for everyone, to realize the health status of the community as high as possible, as an investment for the 
community. development of human resources (human resources) that are socially and economically productive. 
 
In realizing health development, of course, it is accompanied by the development of law in it, because all 
implementing instruments and their enforcement require legal instruments. Legal development can be 
interpreted as fostering the law and improving legal policies in a better direction. Therefore the law must be able 
to carry out the role of guarding the realization of the desired development goals, which in the development of 
the law include the development of legal materials, legal structures including legal apparatus, legal facilities, 
and infrastructure as well as legal awareness and culture. 
 
One of the government's efforts to realize a responsive law is to implement laws such as the implementation of 
Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine. This law is used as a legal umbrella to prevent the spread 
of the pandemic Corona Virus Disease 19 (Covid-19), namely by implementing Large-Scale Social Restrictions 
(PSBB). As is known, on December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) China Country Office 
reported a case of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On January 7, 2020, 
China identified pneumonia of unknown etiology as a new type of coronavirus (coronavirus disease, COVID-
19). On January 30, 2020, WHO has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
(KKMMD/PHEIC). The increase in the number of COVID-19 cases is happening quite quickly and has spread 
between countries.

4134","Data on reports of PSBB violations throughout 2020. Of the total 8,345 reports that were accommodated in the 
Rapid Community Response (CRM) system, as many as 8,155 or 97.7% were successfully followed up by the 
ranks of the Jakarta Government. 
5.2 Obstacles Faced in Implementing Criminal Sanctions Against Large-Scale Social 
Restrictions Violators and Efforts to Get Out 
Article 93 of Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine has clearly stated that anyone who does not 
comply with the implementation of health quarantine and/or hinders the implementation of quarantine health to 
cause a public health emergency shall be punished with a maximum imprisonment of 1 (one) year and/or a 
maximum fine of Rp. 100,000,000.00 (one hundred million rupiah). However, in practice, the implementation of 
these criminal sanctions still encounters several obstacles. The following is a list of these obstacles and their 
solutions. 
1. 
The unclear reference to the article regarding criminal threats in the regional regulation on PSBB; 
If you examine Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine, PSBB is indeed a form of 
implementing health quarantine which is explained in Article 15 of the law that PSBB is a form of activity 
from health quarantine at the entrance and in the region. However, what must be considered in Article 93 
of Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine is the next element, namely causing a public 
health emergency. 
 
To ensnare someone with a criminal threat, every element in the criminal article must be fulfilled, Article 
93 contains an element of consequence, that violations of actions in the PSBB can be punished if they 
cause a public health emergency. Meanwhile, what is meant by a public health emergency in Article 1 
number 2 of Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine is an extraordinary public health 
incident marked by the spread of infectious diseases and/or events caused by nuclear radiation, biological 
pollution, chemical contamination.  bioterrorism, and food that poses a health hazard and has the potential 
to spread across regions or across countries. This means that PSBB violations in the form of not complying 
with or hindering the implementation of PSBB can be punished only if they result in extraordinary public 
health events marked by the spread of infectious diseases that have the potential to spread across regions or 
across countries. 
2. 
The lack of precise application of criminal sanctions against PSBB violators in the PSBB Covid-19 
pandemic situation 
Is one manifestation of the health quarantine. In DKI Jakarta, the Police have enforced the regulation, even 
though the PSBB in DKI Jakarta was only effective on April 10. A total of 18 (eighteen) people were 
arrested for not heeding the call for social distancing at Bendungan Hilir and Sabang. The article imposed 
in Article 93. This sanction article was criticized and deemed inappropriate. In a press statement Number: 
012/Humans/KH/IV/2020 dated April 8, 2020, Komnas HAM stated that instead of imprisonment, PSBB 
violators should be punished with sanctions and/or social work. 
 
The main reason is that the current condition of the prison is overcapacity. The Ministry of Law and 
Human Rights even released 30 (thirty) thousand inmates for that reason. It would be contradictory if, on 
the one hand, the government gave freedom, the apparatus actually carried out arrests and imprisonment. 
Another reason is that the application of sanctions is not in accordance with the principle ultimum 
remedium (criminal law being the last resort of law enforcement). In addition, sanctions for fines and/or 
social work are considered more appropriate to raise awareness, be more useful, and encourage solidarity 
among others. 
3. 
The difficulty of implementing Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine in all regions 
In its implementation, Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine will be difficult to apply in all 
regions. This is because the condition of each region has a different level of vulnerability so that it affects 
the policies taken by the region. 
 
As an effort to solve the problems above, local governments can make policies in the form of regional 
regulations, so that they can overcome various problems that arise due to the spread of Covid-19 in their 
regions. The Covid-19 pandemic not only requires solutions from the health and economic fields but also 
responds with a socio-cultural approach because the increasingly wide spread of the virus and the difficulty 
of overcoming this pandemic are more of a socio-cultural problem than a health problem.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The application of criminal sanctions in Law Number 6 of 2018 concerning Health Quarantine for violators of 
Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) in the Greater Jakarta area is in the form of imprisonment and fines.

4141","The imposition of criminal sanctions on violators of PSBB rules must be applied objectively, rationally and 
proportionally as a means of deterrence and public education to realize the impact of Covid-19 as well as a 
means of social control so that people comply with the rules of social distancing and physics distancing. 
Obstacles encountered in the application of criminal sanctions against violators of Large-Scale Social 
Restrictions (PSBB) and efforts to solve them include unclear references to articles regarding criminal threats in 
regional regulations regarding PSBB. In the context of accelerating the handling of Corona Virus Disease 2019 
(Covid-19), which must explain precisely what actions in the PSBB, if not implemented, will result in a public 
health emergency, only then can regional regulations implement PSBB in accordance with clear boundaries. 
Another obstacle is the lack of precise application of criminal sanctions against PSBB violators in the Covid-19 
pandemic situation. As an effort to overcome this obstacle, namely the application of criminal sanctions against 
PSBB violators is an ultimum remedium or last resort.

Abstract 
 
One of the factors that hinders development in both Indonesia and many other countries is the problem of 
narcotics. This paper purposes to analyze the impact of the use and trafficking of narcotics in Indonesia and 
law enforcement on narcotics crimes in Indonesia. The method used is socio-juridical using a statutory 
approach, case approach, and criminology. The data used are primary and secondary data through 
interviews, literature study and document study. All data collected were then analyzed qualitatively. The 
results showed that the direct impact of drugs on the human psyche/mental is causing mental depression, 
serious mental disorders/psychotic, causing suicide, and causing crime, violence and destruction. The 
factors causing narcotics crimes in the jurisdiction of the Kutai Barat Police Department, which the authors 
managed to get from the field study, could be caused by many factors, both internal and external factors. 
Law enforcement is an effort to bring the ideas of justice, legal certainty and social benefits into reality. 
The efforts made by the Kutai Barat Police Department in overcoming narcotics crimes that occurred in the 
Kutai Barat Regency and Mahakam Ulu Regency were carried out in two ways, namely preventive and 
repressive.

Abstract 
The growth of population and road users is increasing every year, and road network development that has not been 
carried out optimally has had a significant impact on the current congestion. This condition can be seen in several 
roads that experience an increase in vehicle's morning and evening rush hours. This situation makes the government 
have to implement traffic restriction policies congestion can be unraveled. One of them is the application of Electronic 
Road Pricing (ERP). This paper will discuss ERP system implementation plan. This research method was carried out 
through a field survey by collecting data from the ERP road section of the Blok M-Kota corridor with a sample of 
Jalan Medan Merdeka Barat. The analysis is carried out to determine the level of road services and the cost of 
congestion before and after ERP implementation. The results showed that the road service level on Jalan Medan 
Merdeka Barat is E, where the road characteristics have unstable currents, low speed, and vary, the volume is close to 
the road capacity. ERP is calculated to have the potential to reduce congestion costs by Rp.221,788/hour with a 
reduction in vehicle volume by 19% if ERP is implemented. 
Keywords: Electronic Road Pricing, Traffic, Congestion Charge.  
 
1. Introduction 
Every year the growth of motorized vehicle users has increased relatively high. Until now, the government has carried 
out various kinds of traffic restriction engineering to reduce congestion. The government has been made to implement 
a 3 in 1 (three in one) and odd-even system (Hanna et al., 2017). However, the efforts that have been implemented 
seem to be still ineffective in its implementation, so that the DKI Jakarta Government must find a solution in 
overcoming the congestion that occurs. One of the emerging discourses is the implementation of an ERP system. ERP 
is the term for a system that implements congestion pricing in  a road segment area. Where the goal is to reduce 
congestion that is happening at this time. The purpose of implementing an ERP system is to reduce the volume of 
vehicles passing through a road segment to solve congestion problems by installing the On-Board Unit (OBU) tool as 
a means of payment transactions. (Senapati & Najid, 2020).  
Based on the paper Gu et al. (2018), identifying factors that influence public acceptance in the road pricing scheme 
are (1) privacy issues for road users because travel data will be recorded; (2) the problem of equity because there are 
socio-demographic differences among road users; (3) the complexity of the road pricing scheme, especially during 
the system trial process and the learning process for road users; and (4) uncertainty especially in the allocation of 
revenue from road pricing and its effectiveness. In the end, vehicles crossing these roads will be charged according to 
the level of congestion that occurs. The higher the congestion level, the higher the motorists' rate when traveling on 
roads with this ERP system.  
This research was conducted in a more centralized manner and gave good results in avoiding problems beyond the 
researcher's reach. By only examining road users with light vehicles, heavy vehicles, and motorcycles, the survey 
implementation time was only during morning rush hours at 07.00-09.00 and in the evening 16.00-18.00 on Jalan 
Medan Merdeka Barat, and calculating the cost of congestion based on the results of field data calculations. 
The purpose of this study is to determine the condition of the existing road and the impact that occurs when a traffic 
restriction system is applied to a predetermined and concise road segment into a summary regarding the 
implementation of the ERP system on the Medan Merdeka Barat. Further research is recommended for special 
attention from the government on alternative roads that motorists will pass if they want to avoid road points that 
implement ERP. 
Based on the background, it is necessary to analyze the implementation of the ERP system, which will impact 
alternative road users around the Medan Merdeka Barat. So it is necessary to conduct a more in-depth impact review 
to implement the ERP system.

5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the research on the analysis of the implementation plan of the ERP system on the Jalan Merdeka 
Barat, it is concluded that the road conditions have a service level of E, where this value explains that the characteristic 
conditions of the road have unstable currents, low speed and vary, the volume is close to road capacity. For the impact 
due to the implementation of this system, it can be seen that ERP can save costs by Rp. 217,788 / hour and the potential 
to reduce congestion levels by 19%. However, the implementation of the ERP system will also impact alternative 
roads around Jalan Medan Merdeka Barat, where the alternative road will experience an increase in congestion costs 
for each volume of vehicles that pass through it.

Abstract 
One of the characteristics of an excellent urban environment is a friendly environment for pedestrians. Pedestrian facilities 
that meet the standards are required in the central business district, where most activities are walking. In recent years, 
Jakarta, as a business city, has continued to improve its pedestrian facilities. Of course, these improvements must be 
examined whether they are following the community's needs or viceversa. This paper aims to find out about the level of 
comfort and level of service at the new pedestrian facilities in the Metropolitan City of Jakarta. The research method was 
carried out through a survey and a questionnaire. Data was collected in the Mega Kuningan Business District with repaired 
pedestrians. The number of respondents was 100 people. The analysis carried out is Importance Performance Analysis 
(IPA) and Level of Service (LoS) analysis. The results of this study indicate that the newly built pedestrian has met level 
A. Based on the analysis of interest, it is still necessary to increase security. Meanwhile, based on the comfort analysis, 
additional lighting and shade are required. This study shows that pedestrians' improvement in the business district in the 
Metropolitan City of Jakarta is good and needs to be developed in other locations.

1. Introduction 
Cities have various functions, such as a place to live, commercial activities, education, work, and others. In most cities as 
a central business area, the area is much mobilized by foot. Walking is an environmentally friendly mode of transportation 
for short trips. Walking makes people healthy because walking burns calories or does not emit greenhouse gases. 
Moreover, walking is an ideal transportation method in urban areas because it does not require parking space (Muhamad 
Isradi et al., 2020). 
Figure 1. Pedestrian in Metropolitan City 
The existence of sidewalks encourages people to walk instead of using other modes of transportation; this, in turn, reduces 
pollution and improves physical condition and health. As a result, various activities are created, and social relations are 
enhanced due to people's presence in suitable spaces on the street. (Osman, 2016) 
Safety, security, convenience, and comfort is a fusion system that is necessary so that pedestrians can 
comfortably(√ñzyilmaz K√º√ß√ºkyaƒüci, 2018). Good pedestrian facilities see Figure.1 encourage people to want to walk, 
while inadequate, pedestrian facilities prevent using the area or geometrical roads. This creates a need to assess pedestrian 
facilities' performance is very important (Cepolina et al., 2018).

The results of the research on pedestrian density in this case study do not exceed capacity. The condition of the sidewalks 
can be categorized as having level A service standards. Although sometimes, they are still disturbed due to waiting for 
public transportation, crossings, and other activities. 
The improvement of sidewalk facilities carried out by the city government has a perfect effect on pedestrians. It can be 
seen that only two indicators need improvement. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on some research beforehand, the conditions pedestrian in Jakarta Metropolitan City are not in standards, but when 
this city of Jakarta continues to improve with arranging pedestrian to be comfortably used for pedestrian foot. The study 
results have demonstrated that LoS is on a scale of A. By using IPA, it is still necessary to repair shading and lighting 
facilities.

Abstract 
 
The construction of Trans Sumatera Toll Road aims to facilitate transportation and industrial sector development 
along the Sumatera region. This research aimed to uncover the pavement thickness of Trans Sumatera Toll Road 
on Pekanbaru-Dumai section, obtain the asphalt thickness for each asphalt overlay method, compare the AC-WC 
in terms of thickness results and heavy equipment productivity, and determine the more effective method of AC-
WC overlay. This research used the field survey to gather primary data on the field and also collect secondary data 
from several institutions. The road pavement was analyzed using the MDPJ 2017. Meanwhile, the heavvy 
equipment productivity was analyzed using direct single overlay and double overlay methods. The heavy 
equipment specifications and productivity calculations were measured using AHSP 2017. The analysis results 
showed that the flexible pavement thickness on the Trans Sumatera Toll Road Section Pekanbaru-Dumai were: 
300 mm LPA, 105 mm AC-Base, 60 mm AC-BC, and 40 mm AC-WC. The AC-WC thickness with direct single 
overlay method was 98.7% and it needed 6 hours of Asphalt Finisher work. Meanwhile, the AC-WC thickness with 
double overlay was 99.2% and it needed 18 hours of Asphalt Finisher. In terms of AC-WC overlay productivity, 
the direct single overlay method was more effective. However, in terms of thickness, the double overlay method 
was more effective.

1. Introduction 
Toll roads are public roads that are part of the road network system and as national roads whose users are obliged 
to pay a certain toll fee (BPJT 2005). The development oftransport road network in achieving national development, 
economic development, and growth and brings notable social benefit (Fani et al. 2020). Toll roads are built with 
the aims of accelerating the realization of road networks in which part or all of its funding are from the road users 
for the sake of easing government‚Äôs burden, smoothen traffic in developed areas, improve equitable distribution of 
development results and justice, and ease government fund burden through road participation (Irfan, Rasyid, and 
Handayani 2018). Toll road services target the smoothness, safety and comfort of its service users (Hadiwardoyo, 
Sumabrata, and Berawi 2012). In order to achieve such target, there are operational benchmarks defined in the form 
of service time at the substation, toll road travel time, level of smoothness, level of facilities, level of customer 
complaints and standards of road level (Ruiz and Guevara 2020). 
According to PT Hutama Karya, the construction of Pekanbaru-Dumai Toll Road is a part of the Trans-Sumatera 
road that connects Pekanbaru and Dumai in Riau province. This toll road has 6 sections: Section I Pekanbaru-Minas,

Abstract  
 
In order for higher education entrepreneurship education to be able to make students have a productive and efficient 
entrepreneurial attitude, a learning process with the right strategy is needed, to provide broad opportunities for students 
to construct meanings for the entrepreneurial concepts they learn in relation to the learning experiences they get in 
life. daily. Such a learning strategy requires a contextual approach. In its application, it is felt that it is efficient if real 
phenomena that exist in students' daily lives can be presented in the classroom through a technology-based PBL 
learning model. This study was designed as an experimental study, which populated on 236 students of the Economic 
Education Department STKIP PGRI Jombang. The number of research samples was 129 students. The data collected 
were analyzed using Multiple Linear Regression. The results prove: there is an effect of technology-based PBL 
learning models on entrepreneurial attitudes , there is an effect of learning methods on entrepreneurial attitudes , there 
is an influence of motivation on entrepreneurial attitudes  and Simultaneously there is an influence of the PBL learning 
model based on technology, learning methods, learning motivation on entrepreneurial attitudes.

1. Introduction  
21st century learning has influenced the education system, the education system in the world including in Indonesia. 
The quality of learning must be improved through innovation and educational development. The education system in 
Higher Education with the Merdeka Campus program is designed to encourage higher education lecturers and students 
to disrupt themselves and transform agile. Higher education must be ready to produce graduates who are flexible, 
adaptive, self-directed, creative, complex problem solver, and cannot be separated from strong characters (PKKMB) 
2020, Universitas Indo Global Mandiri (UIGM). 
 
Tertiary Education Institutions focus on 8 (eight) indicators that have the potential to bring out the potential of higher 
education including their resources to interact intensely with the industrial world and the world of work, by inviting 
industry to enter higher education, and vice versa (Dwi Ratnadi, 2020). In line with the existence of an independent 
campus, students are required to have special skills that students must have for their field of study and skills that they 
must master when they graduate. This expertise is not only theoretical knowledge but also the ability (competence) of 
students to be active, creative, and innovative in their field of study. Every student should be able to use their 
knowledge to be applied in everyday life. Therefore, the application of learning methods must be in accordance with 
the teaching and learning process (Setiadi Wira Buana, 2011). 
 
According to Taha (2008), the learning process in the classroom is focused on memorizing information. students need 
to remember information but are not required to understand the information that is applied in everyday life. As a result, 
student learning outcomes are not always achieved because student knowledge is rich in theory, but students' 
understanding and experience in applying this knowledge in practice is very lacking.

4172","interests, motivations and talents. In this way students can find for themselves the knowledge and information that 
they will use to analyze situations and facts to obtain values that are useful for their lives. 
 
The findings of this study are supported by Merrill Pysicall (1995) who reports that the results of research that show 
the success of technology-based Problem Based Learning are those that develop a positive attitude, increase awareness 
of differences of opinion, and increase the ability to solve problems. 
 
It cannot be denied that the technology-based Problem Based Learning model can shape students to work on authentic 
problems with the intention of compiling their own knowledge, developing inquiry and higher-order thinking skills, 
developing independence and self-confidence ‚Äù. This finding is supported by previous research, among others, by 
Bekti Wulandari (2013) Herman DS (2013), several studies that show that the benefits of technology-based Problem 
Based Learning for students have an influence on student learning outcomes. 
 
So it is suggested that the role of lecturers is very important with suitable learning methods in accordance with 
competency standards and basic competencies that are in the adaptive entrepreneurship curriculum. So that in this 
finding it can be seen that there is an effect of the Problem Based Learning model on entrepreneurial attitudes at 
STKIP PGRI Jombang. 
 
Based on the results of the multiple linear regression test, it shows that there is an effect of the Problem Based Learning 
model, learning methods, motivation on entrepreneurial attitudes. This shows that the learning process of a lecturer 
can use the Problem Based Learning model in various groups of students both for students whose learning methods 
are very efficient, efficient, quite efficient, inefficient or very inefficient, motivation is very high, high, medium, low 
and very low. In other terms, the use of the Problem Based Learning model in the learning process is based on the 
learning method and the level of student motivation, especially for STKIP PGRI Jombang students. In fact, it is 
expected that the use of the Problem Based Learning model can improve learning methods and learning motivation 
which in turn can improve students' entrepreneurial attitudes. Therefore, the use of the Problem Based Learning model 
in this study has a positive impact on students' entrepreneurial attitudes. So it is suggested to use the Problem Based 
Learning model after knowing how to learn and student learning motivation with the hope that the use of the Problem 
Based Learning model can be optimal and ultimately the learning process can be effective and efficient. 
 
The results of the analysis show that the multiple linear regression model shows an R Square of 0.195 or 19.5%, this 
means that entrepreneurial attitudes in the Economic Education Study Program of STKIP PGRI Jombang are 
influenced by the use of technology-based Problem Based Learning models, learning methods, learning motivation 
by 19. 5%. 
 
These findings prove that the entrepreneurial attitude of students is simultaneously influenced by the use of the 
technology-based Problem Based Learning model, learning methods and learning motivation (especially 
entrepreneurship learning) in the Economic Education Study Program of STKIP PGRI Jombang. Optimally, it is 
recommended to pay attention to the learning method and the level of student learning motivation, while the R Square 
which cannot be explained by the multiple linear regression model is (100% - 19.5%) = 80.5%, meaning that 80.5% 
of the achievement of student entrepreneurial attitudes is not influenced by the use of the Problem Based Learning 
model, learning methods and learning motivation levels are thought to be influenced by other factors such as the ability 
of lecturers to teach, school environmental conditions, talents, stimuli or stimulants of students, socioeconomic 
conditions, students' initial abilities and no less important. parents towards the education of their son and daughter. 
Therefore, in addition to the use of the technology-based Problem Based Learning model, learning methods and 
learning motivation need to be examined for the relationship of these factors with the attitudes of student 
entrepreneurial achievement in entrepreneurship learning, especially in the Economic Education Study Program of 
STKIP PGRI Jombang. 
 
6. Conclusion and Suggestion

4179","6.2 Suggestion 
Based on the conclusions of the research results as mentioned above, several suggestions can be made as follows: 
1. The use of technology-based PBL learning models can improve student entrepreneurial attitudes, preferably higher 
education institutions, especially the economic education study program STKIP PGRI ombang, as far as possible 
can improve the teaching and learning process by using the technology-based PBL Learning Model so that the 
teaching and learning process can be achieved optimally and students can be active, creative and innovative 
2. The level of student learning motivation and student learning has an influence on entrepreneurial attitudes in 
entrepreneurship learning, especially in the economic education study program STKIP PGRI Jombang, so it is 
suggested that at the beginning of learning it is necessary to know the level of learning motivation and student 
learning methods for the materials to be taught with giving initial questionnaire. By knowing the level of student 
learning motivation and student learning methods, then the form of learning can be selected (both models, media, 
systems, etc.) in accordance with the hope of encouraging student study groups in the learning process, especially 
student study groups who have low motivation and lack of learning methods. efficient, so that learning objectives 
can be achieved optimally. 
3. Because factors such as the ability of the lecturer to teach, social environmental conditions, socio-economic 
conditions, student background, students' initial abilities are factors that have not been researched by researchers 
and this is the weakness of the researcher, it is suggested that further researchers conduct further research on factors 
-these factors.

Abstract 
 
This research focused on the language mastering of mentally retarded student in terms of the speaking skill at 
SLBN 1 Jombang. This research problem was formulated how the speaking skill could be mastered by third 
grade mentally retarded student at SLBN 1 Jombang. Speaking skill means a skill taught to students to be able 
to speak well in reciting each letter in alphabet, each consonant, then each word, and how to pronounce them 
correctly.  It aimed that student has no difficulty to pronunce the articulation by using manipulative media to 
facilitate students‚Äô understanding in speaking as well as analyzing the speaking skill of mentally retarded 
student. It was conducted to facilitate the teaching learning process in the classroom, to communicate in the 
community and to introduce how mentally retarded students pronounce letters and words. The researchers chose 
one research subject from one of the mentally retarded students, Aisyah. The method employed in this research 
was descriptive qualitative method because they tried to describe the pronounced words, mimicked words for 
speaking skills by introducing the letters while interviewing the subject. The results showed that the learning 
outcomes of Aisyah had good development. It was prooved by Aisyah‚Äôs better performance seen from Aisyah‚Äôs 
learning book note, Cindi‚Äôs learning in speaking. Cindi‚Äôs learning development can be known by knowing the 
letters and vocabularies‚Äôpronunciation obtained when interacting with teammates, teachers and family 
environment.

1. Introduction 
              Language mastering is a process of mastering a language naturally performed by children when they 
learn their native language. There are several factors that affect children's language mastering both internally 
and externally. Internal factors are influenced by readiness in a child such as language instincts. In addition, 
there are several external factors that affect language mastering in children, for example, the child's environment 
is good the school environment, family and community. When a child acquires language, there are two 
processes experienced by a child, namely; process performance and process competence. 
 
 
Furthermore, the discussion of the language mastering related to previous topics because how 
humans can perceive and understand the utterance of others. It is the first element that must be mastered by 
humans in language. Humans can produce utterances if they know the rules that must be followed obtained 
since childhood. Language skills include four aspects: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Based on the 
four skills, the main skills of this research are reading and writing. Mentally retarded children can learn 
well. They must be able to speak. Children with special needs because of natural intelligence limitations  
become introvert, shy, and difficult in studying lessons in their schools. Such this situation is not like normal 
children ininteracting in theirbsociety . 
1.1. Objectives 
The objectives of this research was to facilitate the teaching learning process in the classroom, to communicate 
in the community and to introduce how mentally retarded students pronounce letters and words. Thus, Language

Table 3 showed the student‚Äôs development of language mastering in terms of answering the teacher‚Äôs questions. 
Aisyah answered by mentioning the the lines according to the specified line so that it is not difficult in moving 
the hand to mention several lines. She dictates and bolded the lines from the  slash to the curved line. The 
process of bolding is not so neat when Aisyah  is imitating the lines in her book. Aisyah is able to remember the 
names of the lines printed on the book such as mentioning sleep lines, curved lines, slashes. Aisyah is very 
happy because she can learn to remember the letters of the alphabet and learn to draw in bolding letters. Aisyah 
has no difficulty to imitate the letters of the alphabet because she is able to write capital letter (X) and small 
letter (x) well and write capital letter (Y) and small letter (y).  
Aisyah also mentioned and bolded the letters of B and D very well and correctly and bolds the letters of C and D 
well. She has a little difficulty to differentiate the capital letter of (B) and small letter of (b) because of the same 
shape but in differentiating the capital letter of (D) and small letter of (d) is easy. Her ability to bold and dictate 
letters is good, even though the teacher must give an example first because she sometimes forgot the process of 
remembering the writing and mastery of letters. The development of the student‚Äôs learning process in learning to 
bold capital letter (P), she could bold it well but she has a little difficulty to bold small letter (p) because of the 
curvature in its letter. In bolding the capital letter (V) and small letter (v), Aisyah could bold well because the 
letters are almost same but the small letter of (v) has a slight curve. 
 
  
6. CONCLUSION 
Based on the results of research on the language mastering of mentally retarded students on speaking skill 
at SLBN 1 Jombang, it can be concluded that the mastering of speaking skill, dictating and imitating the reading 
of letters, in mentally retarded students at SLBN 1 Jombang can be proved from student‚Äôs notebook in the 
school. This can be seen from the student‚Äôs understanding the material through the media used by the teacher to 
find out how the student has mastered writing skill and reading skill. 
Thus, mentally retarded student or mental retardation is any condition of intellectual development experiencing 
problems so that they do not reach the stage of development well and optimally when they are compared to 
other normal students. Mentally retarded students can get good learning in schools if they are trained with media 
to speak starting from consonants to good pronunciation. This activity influences their developments in learning 
activities in their school.

Abstract 
Mathematics learning certainly involves interaction between teacher and students. The interaction can be teacher gives 
promoted-actions and students will give respons. When the teacher‚Äôs promoted-actions can stimulate students‚Äô 
mathematical ideas, students will communicate their thinking verbally or non verbally. The way students communicate 
their ideas is called mathematical representation. Students‚Äô representation becomes important thing to evaluate 
learning because mathematical representation indicates students‚Äô understanding of mathematical concepts. This 
research aimed to describe student‚Äôs mathematical representation on accepting teacher‚Äôs promoted-action. This 
research was a qualitative research with two students in high and middle mathematical ability (HA-MA) as subjects. 
Data was collected through online observation and interview. The validity of the data was checked by using time 
triangulation. The results showed that HA-subject‚Äôs representation was appear when teacher stimulates students to 
answer verbally then subject pronounce mathematical object frequently and correctly, and when teacher gives an 
exercise then subject write the mathematical expression correctly. MA-subject‚Äôs representation was appear when 
teacher stimulates students to answer verbally then subject pronounce mathematical object correctly in several times, 
and when teacher gives an exercise then subject write mathematical expression.

Abstract 
He existence of the disruptive era has made many new products launched tend to be innovative due to market 
competition that pursues excellence. The purpose of this study is to determine and explain the effect of the disruptive 
era on innovative product launches. This study conducted sampling with a simple random sampling approach and used 
data collection techniques through a questionnaire method that was given to the general public who met the criteria of 
respondents, by determining the criteria for respondents, namely the wider community who was more than fifteen 
years old and using product or services. The variables used in this study are the disruptive era as variable X1, new 
products as variable X2, and innovative product launches as variable Y. The results of the analysis using the linear 
regression method show that there is a significance between the disruptive era variable (X1) and the innovative product 
variable (Y) where the value of sig is 0,000 < 0,05 and the value of tcount is 4.120 > ttable is 2030 which shows that the 
disruptive era has an effect on the launch of innovative products, then the test results of the analysis of new product 
variables (X2) have a significance for the innovative product launch variable (Y) shows the value of sig is 0,000<0,05 
and the value of tcount is 7,840 > ttable is 2030 shows that the existence of a new product also has an influence on the 
launch of innovative products.

1. Introduction 
Along with the changing times, old or new companies are competing continuously not only because of the very 
competitive conditions, but also because of the demands for increasingly advanced technological developments. 
technological developments are accompanied by human thinking that is increasingly effective and efficient in all 
respects. Effective and efficient thinking certainly makes technological developments increasingly and very much-
needed. The technological capabilities will be more advanced because those that are able to integrate traditional old-
fashioned transformations become universal. 
 
The digital world has a major influence on the era of globalization in the ability to develop increasingly new 
technology to replace the old ways that are less efficient so that there are many innovations being 
developed. The  technological developments application is free to do and enforced by all corporate companies, both 
beginner and old companies. Company competition in the current era of globalization requires companies to act 
quickly and precisely in facing this competition. 
 
Today, Indonesians often hear about the emergence of actors in the business world who disturb the existence of old 
players. Basically, these new competitors have unique advantages when compared to incumbent actors. There are 
many examples, for example those that are still pros and cons, namely the phenomenon of online motorcycle taxis 
that have replaced conventional taxis. Another example is the online hotel booking technology that replaces

(Atuahene‚ÄìGima, 1997). Thus the innovative product launches are expected to supply the volatile market. With the 
innovative products, the market competition will synchronized rigorously. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The disruptive era affected the launch of innovative products. The influence given from the disruptive era on the 
launch of innovative products is quite large, in other words, the disruptive era has increased the launch of innovative 
products. The existence of new products also affects the launch of innovative products. This study has similarities 
with previous research, this means that the results of previous studies are still in line with the results of this study. 
Suggestions that can be given by the author for similar research in the future are to try to provide more detail from the 
case studies raised, in other words that are smaller than the research space so that the research results obtained can be 
more accurate and more in line with the needs of the study in the future.

Abstract 
 
Employee performance is very important for an organization, especially for universities to improve the quality of 
education and to achieve goals. For this reason, every university needs to evaluate factors that can improve employee 
performance in the organization in order that organization can achieve its goals. This research was conducted at the 
Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekonomi Mulia Pratama (STIE MP), a higher education in economics located in Bekasi, Jakarta, 
Indonesia with the aim of examining and analyzing the influence of leadership on employee performance,  examining 
and analyzing the effect of job promotion on employee performance,  examining and analyzing the effect of leadership 
on work environment, examining and analyzing the effect of job promotion on work environment, examining and 
analyzing the effect of work environment on employee performance. The population in this study were employees of 
Sekolah Tinggi Ilmu Ekonomi Mulia Pratama with a total of 50 employees. The sampling technique used a total 
sampling technique. Data analysis used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) Partial Least Square (PLS). The results 
showed that leadership has an effect on employee performance,  job promotion has an effect on employee performance, 
leadership has an effect on the work environment, job promotion has an effect on the work environment, work

1. Introduction 
In this era of globalization and increasingly fierce business competition, human resources are the most important asset 
of the company because of their role as the subject of implementing policies and company operational activities. 
Resources owned by the company such as capital, methods and machines cannot provide optimal results if they are 
not supported by human resources who have optimum performance. Human resources are one of the main capitals in

4197","Based on the data presented in table 5 above, it can be seen that of the seven hypotheses proposed in this study, they 
are as follows: 
The influence of leadership on employee performance has a P value of 0.001 or less than 0.05. This means that the 
leadership variable has a significant effect on employee performance. Thus hypothesis 1 is accepted. Employees 
generally like good leadership in the company. Good leadership will make employee performance more focused and 
clear. If the leadership is done well, then the employees who work at the company will be more enthusiastic in 
completing their work. Conversely, if the leadership carried out in the company is bad, then employees will be less 
enthusiastic in carrying out work. In accordance with the descriptive data of the respondents' answers, although there 
are some respondents who have a low average score of employee performance, the overall average score of the
