0,The Paradox Of Budget Transparency In Reward-Based  Crowdfunding,"we investigate how budget disclosure affects the funding outcome of reward-based crowdfunding campaigns. we show that information transparency can hurt campaign managers, reducing funding. to investigate the mechanism of such an unexpected finding, we investigated the details of the budgets, showing that the operational costs increase the funding while marketing costs reduce it. we also show that budget disclosure can increase the operational performance of campaign managers.","budget, transparency, reward, crowdfunding",,"ehsan bolandifar hsbc business school peking university, china",
1,Component Procurement Under Unobservable Contracts  Ehsan Bolandifar,"this paper studies the optimal component procurement structures of two competing oems that rely on a joint contract manufacturer to produce two partially substitutable products. the contract manufacturer, in turn, needs to procure its components from a supplier. we investigate whether the oems should delegate component procurement to the contract manufacturer or control it when contracts are unobservable. when the supplier has pricing power, we show that under procurement control, all supply chain members might benefit from contract unobservability if the downstream market competition is moderate, while under delegation, all supply chain members benefit from contract unobservability unless the market competition is extremely fierce. we also demonstrate that component procurement control for both oems arises as the equilibrium, in contrast to the observable case. when the supply market is competitive, we show that both oems prefer to delegate their component procurement to the contract manufacturer to benefit from the discount aggregation. while procurement control might also emerge as an equilibrium, we show that it is pareto dominated by the delegation strategy. we develop a new theory to explain different procurement strategies adopted by oems to procure different types of components, uncovering the informational role of different procurement structures under unobservable contracts as it shapes the equilibrium procurement structure.","component, procurement, unobservable",,hsbc business school peking university china,
2,Comparative Analysis Of Thin-Walled U-Shaped Ss 304  Bellows-Type Expansion Joint Profiles Formed Through,"this study investigates the impact of employing single-stage versus multi-stage mandrel cold-forming techniques to fabricate ss 304 u-shaped thin-walled metal bellows-type expansion joint profiles, with a specific focus on post- forming thickness variations and profile precision. the aim is to discern the variations in thickness following the convolution profile formation in single-stage and multistage mandrel forming procedures. there are noteworthy distinctions between the profiles produced using these forming methods, providing valuable insights for manufacturers.","metal bellows, mandrel forming, thickness","When considering SS 304 U-shaped mandrel cold forming for metal expansion joint-type bellows, multi-stage forming has superior profile precision and a diminished percentage of variation in thickness. The findings from this study show that multi-stage forming consistently either matches or improves upon the thickness observed in single-stage forming. Notably, pronounced thinning, marked by a minimum thickness of 0.719 mm, is evident in single-stage forming at the convolution curve. In contrast, multi-stage forming exhibits a more moderated thinning, peaking at 9.6%, as opposed to the 11.25% observed in single-stage processes. This observed profile consistency in multistage forming further emphasizes its aesthetic and functional advantages. 0.7 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74 0.75 0.76 0.77 0.78 0.79 0.8 LC2 LC3 LC4 LC5 LC6 LC7 LC8 (a) At 0 O Single Multi 0.7 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74 0.75 0.76 0.77 0.78 0.79 0.8 LC2 LC3 LC4 LC5 LC6 LC7 LC8 (b) At 90 O Single Multi 0.7 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74 0.75 0.76 0.77 0.78 0.79 0.8 LC2 LC3 LC4 LC5 LC6 LC7 LC8 (c) At 180 O Single Multi 0.7 0.71 0.72 0.73 0.74 0.75 0.76 0.77 0.78 0.79 0.8 LC2 LC3 LC4 LC5 LC6 LC7 LC8 (d) At 270 O Single Multi 9","single and multi-stage mandrel forming processes agraja magesh and raji sundararajan department of engineering technology purdue university west lafayette, indiana, usa magesha@purdue.edu, raji@purdue.edu umamagesh ganesan and arasu sekar lsi-mech engineers pvt ltd chennai, india lsi-mech@lonestarindia.com and research@lonestarindia.com","References

3,Understanding Asbestos Free Brake-Pad: Using Carbon  Nanotube Derived From Waste Rice Husk,"this paper investigates the development of asbestos-free brake pads utilizing carbon nanotubes derived from waste rice husks. the aim was to replace the hazardous asbestos with an eco-friendly composite. the study implemented an experimental research design approach. the sol-gel method was used in the production of carbon nanotubes (cnts) from rice husks. the composition of the brake pads was developed by varying the cnts (0.5–1.5 wt. %). about five (5) weight percent caco3 obtained from oyster shells served as a filler. in addition, five-(5) weight percent graphite served as a friction material, which was added to the mixture of epoxy and hardener. wear, thickness swelling in sea oil and water, hardness values, and microstructure are among the properties that were examined. the results show that the brake pad from the cnts formulation at 1.5 wt. percentage was not only effective but also comparable to conventional brake pads in performance. therefore, the research proposes the use of cnt grade derived from rice husks as a convenient alternative material for the production of asbestos-free brake pads. 14thannual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management dubai, united arab emirates (uae), february 12-14, 2024 publisher: ieom society international, usa published: february 12, 2024 doi: 10.46254/an14.20240014 12",,"This research looked at how asbestos brake pads can be replaced using novel friction materials made of carbon nanotubes from rice husk, CaCO3 from oyster shell, and graphite from old batteries. The brake pads were made using the solution-stir-cast method. The optimal conditions were achieved at 1.5 wt% carbon nanotubes manufactured from rice husk. These conditions comprised a wear rate of 2.15 mg/m and a coefficient of friction of 0.42. The values obtained are within the acceptable range for brakes with high friction. As a result of the strong interfacial bonding between the particles and the binder, higher frictional brake pads were attained in this research. The use of these innovative materials will eliminate the primary issue with brake pads made of asbestos.","paul amaechiako (formerly ozor) department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 534 auckland park, south africa department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering, university of nigeria, nsukka, nigeria paul.ozor@unn.edu.ng, pozor@uj.ac.za victor sundayaigbodion faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 534 auckland park, south africa africa centre of excellence for sustainable power and energy development, ace-sped university of nigeria nsukka nigeria department of metallurgical and materials engineering, faculty of engineering, university of nigeria, nsukka, nigeria victor.aigbodion@unn.edu.ng charlesmbohwa department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 534 auckland park, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",

The following conclusion may be drawn from the work: In general, the hydrophobic CaO nanoparticles and the PDMS substrate collaborated to develop more advantageous hierarchical topologies with lower surface energy. The PDMS substrates led to the highest super-hydrophobicity (SCA > 150°). It was therefore shown that the materials' ability to self-clean and exhibit superhydrophobicity was significantly influenced by surface chemistry, drying and CaOnp types. The innovative coating's super-hydrophobic and self-cleaning qualities should be investigated for long-term stability or durability. 22","unveiling the super-hydrophobic and self-cleaning properties of cao nanoparticles derived from oyster shell for electrical sheathing insulator applications victor sunday aigbodion department of mechanical engineering science faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 534 auckland park, south africa africa centre of excellence for sustainable power and energy development, ace-sped university of nigeria nsukka nigeria department of metallurgical and materials engineering, faculty of engineering, university of nigeria, nsukka, nigeria victor.aigbodion@unn.edu.ng paul amaechi ako (formerly ozor) department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 534 auckland park, south africa department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering, university of nigeria, nsukka, nigeria paul.ozor@unn.edu.ng, pozor@uj.ac.za charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 534 auckland park, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

5,Systemic Approach For Risk-Based Third-Party Inspections  Of Fire Alarm Systems,"the proposed conference paper addresses a systemic approach for risk-based third-party inspections of fire alarm systems. in the first part of the article, there is a comprehensive literature review of what the status is regarding current research on the use of risk-based inspection methodology on fire alarm systems. this is followed by an explanation of the chosen methodology. the paper then evaluates and presents the results of expert interviews with manufacturers of fire alarm systems as well as the results of surveys among recognized experts for the inspection of fire alarm systems in germany. the evaluation is carried out by means of a qualitative content analysis. using the results from these surveys as well as the findings on defect occurrence-statistics from previous work by the authors, a systemic approach for the risk-based test content to be selected for third-party inspections of the systems by technical experts is then presented. the results serve as a basis for an optimized inspection concept to increase efficiency in the operation of the systems while maintaining or improving availability. furthermore, suggestions are made as to which inspection contents must be included or given increased attention due to technical innovations as well as a changed risk situation. the last part of the conference contribution is a discussion of the results and a summary of the most important findings.","testing, fire alarm system, safety","In this study, we demonstrated a systemic approach for risk-based determination of the depth of inspection of third- party inspections of fire alarm systems. The approach presented is based on the prioritization of inspection contents or the inspection depth / number of samples of the individual inspection contents based on risk factors. As a basis for the work, the contents of the current tests were analyzed in accordance with the chosen methodology and, based on the assessment of technical experts, expanded to include additional test contents that have arisen, for example, due to technical innovations. The risk priority factors used to create a risk-oriented approach are based on the product of the probability of occurrence, the potential extent of damage and the probability of detection of defects in the course of plant operation. These factors were determined qualitatively and are presented in the article. The approach shown provides experts who perform third-party inspections of fire alarm systems with a guideline for the first time on how to systematically adjust the inspection depth on the basis of an individual risk assessment. This enables a more efficient execution of the inspection, which is optimized with regard to the effectiveness of the inspections. In the context of planned future work, a deepening of the approach is planned. Especially with regard to further external risk factors, which are based on the individual protection goal of the fire alarm system as well as the building structures. 35","stefan siegfried veit doctoral student, faculty of electrical engineering university of west bohemia pilsen, czech republic tüv süd industrie service gmbh munich, germany veit@fel.zcu.cz, stefan.veit@tuvsud.com frantisek steiner professor, faculty of electrical engineering university of west bohemia pilsen, czech republic steiner@fel.zcu.cz","References

6,Unbalanced Bidding In The Jordanian Construction Industry  Khaled Hesham Hyari,"unbalanced bidding is a widely used practice in competitive bidding and is often associated with unit price contracts. this practice has attracted the attention of researchers for more than seventy years due to its impacts on the owner and the contractor. this paper presents the results of a survey targeting construction contractors in jordan to ascertain the root causes of this practice, common forms of unbalanced bidding, owner’s prevention strategies to mitigate this practice, and detection methods for unbalanced bidding. the study indicated that discrepancies in the owner-provided quantities of work and the utilization of unit pricing for items that are difficult to estimate their quantities accurately are the most enabling circumstances for unbalanced bidding. the study also revealed that the most common types of unbalancing bids in the jordanian construction industry are front-end loading and increasing the unit prices of items that have underestimated quantities while simultaneously decreasing the prices of items that have overestimated quantities. the survey respondents indicated that the top-ranking strategies that owners can utilize to reduce the extent of this practice are ensuring accurate estimating of quantities in the bill of quantities, and timely processing of progress payments. the findings of this study are beneficial to both owners and contractors. owners will be better aware of the current utilization of unbalanced bidding by contractors and can improve bidding rules and instructions to mitigate this practice. contractors will also have a better understanding of their competitors' utilization of the imbalance in their submitted bids.","unbalanced bidding, contractors, unit pricing","Unbalanced bidding is a common tactic adopted by contractors bidding competitively for unit price contracts. This practice is controversial because it is promoted in a large number of research publications, although it is an undesirable practice in many public bidding regulations and may lead to the rejection of the sub-mitted bid as a nonresponsive one. This paper presented the results of a survey that targeted construction contractors in Jordan to obtain their perspective on unbalanced bidding. The respondents ranked errors in the quantities of work provided by the owner in the bidding documents as the most important factor that enables bid unbalancing. The two most commonly used types of unbalanced pricing are front-end loading and quantity error exploitation. According to the survey's respondents, the 42","professor, department of civil engineering, faculty of engineering the hashemite university, zarqa, jordan hyari@hu.edu.jo thamer alamayreh mostaqbal engineering & environmental consultants amman, jordan","References

9,Digital Kanban For Agile Production Planning And  Scheduling In Automotive Supplier Industry,"dealing with production planning and scheduling in modern production networks becomes more and more complex. globalization and mass customization are two megatrends influencing this trend especially in automotive suppliers’ industry due to the high internationality of plants and factory of an industrial company as well as the heterogeneous product portfolio. however, there are some tools, methods and principles which can counteract this trends and help making production planning more agile digital. during this paper, a digital and automated kanban solution will be implemented at a certain process in an automotive supplier’s plant. to make the effects visible, the current process and its weaknesses are visualized in a value stream map of the current situation with conventional kanban planning during the analysis phase. thus, the future, optimized value stream with the use of a digital and automated kanban solution is designed and mentioned in the results. in summary, the introduction of this kanban solution can lower the costs of the planning process. in the example used in this paper, the total costs for this quantity of kanban can be decreased by over 50%. further, other weaknesses of this process could be erased as well. those results are differentiated in a practical and a monetary comparison. 14thannual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management dubai, united arab emirates (uae), february 12-14, 2024 publisher: ieom society international, usa published: february 12, 2024 doi: 10.46254/an14.20240025 69",,"In addition to the recording of material and information flows, a data analysis of the key figures of the Kanban system was also carried out. Through the methodology of value stream design, it was possible to identify weaknesses and framework conditions. Based on these requirements for the target concept could be derived. The first step was to optimize the of the Kanban system within the framework of the value stream design. Automated Kanban calculation was considered as a solution. For this purpose, the prerequisites for implementation and application were created. These consisted of the re-dimensioning of the areas, the parameterization of calculation profiles and control loops. This enabled the system to perform the calculation system, so that the results obtained could then be compared with a with a common formula in the literature. Despite a discrepancy of both results of approximately 10 %, caused by the distorted system situation, a practical and monetary comparison showed the potential of the Automatic Kanban Calculation. If the target concept created is compared with the principles of Lean Management, the following is achieved through the automatic Kanban calculation and the omission of Excel planning the principle of integration is made possible. Further, the principles of flow, clock and pull are supported and improved by the Kanban system. Thus, the complete design of an electronic Kanban system can be realized. Physical cards and manual Kanban cards can thus become obsolete. This outlook corresponds to the endless principle of perfection and the necessary striving for continuous improvement.","johanna lang undergraduate study program in logistics and digitalization university of applied sciences amberg-weiden weiden in der oberpfalz, germany lang.johanna@outlook.de andreas dörner industrial engineering and management university of west bohemia pilsen, czech republic and4509@students.zcu.cz electrical engineering, media and computer science university of applied sciences amberg-weiden amberg, germany a.doerner@oth-aw.de stephanie abels-schlosser weiden business school university of applied sciences amberg-weiden weiden in der oberpfalz, germany s.abels-schlosser@oth-aw.de",

11,Maintenance Model Based On Lean And Tpm To Increase  Machine Availability In An Sme In The Plastic Sector,"the plastics industry has grown in recent years due to growing demand in sectors such as construction and transportation, contributing 4% of the industrial gdp and employing more than 200,000 workers in the country. however, it has been identified that companies in the sector operate with low availability (70.83%) due to various production problems, including hours lost due to lack of machine maintenance. on the other hand, because of these problems, demand exceeds supply due to the low availability of the companies in the plastics sector. the literature review suggests that lean manufacturing (smed, standardization of work, 5s) and the tpm (total productive maintenance) technique are necessary tools to solve these problems. finally, the implementation of these tools will allow solving the mentioned problems by increasing availability by 90%.","lean manufacturing, 5s","After carrying out this investigation, it can be concluded that the implementation of Lean Manufacturing techniques can lead to an increase in efficiency in a certain area of a company in the manufacturing sector. The findings reveal that all the parameters suggested to evaluate the current situation of the company have undergone significant improvements. Through the use of the Problem Tree, Pareto Diagram and Value Stream Mapping (VSM), it was possible to show that indicators such as the percentage of machinery stoppages (74.26%) and power outages (26.74%) were the two main causes of the low availability of machinery (70.83%) which negatively influences the Total Efficiency of the Equipment (55.88%). After analysing the main root causes, it is concluded that the injection area is the one that presents the greatest problems in the plant that impairs the production of caps. This is because the main unproductive hours of machinery are affected by the lack of maintenance of the same. Therefore, with the improvement proposal using the 5s and TPM methodology in the simulation, a better result of efficiency and availability of the machinery was obtained by 64.94% and 78.64% respectively, By properly applying the principles of 5S and standardized work in the area of injection and tools, it was possible to reduce tool search times by 80% while the percentage of tools and equipment classified and organized increased to 85.94%. The accuracy of the simulation model was confirmed by testing it under three different scenarios over different time periods. The results obtained in each scenario were favourable, indicating that the project is viable and suitable for implementation in the business environment.","jorge sebastian abad-mendoza faculty of engineering and architecture, university of lima, perú 20182194@aloe.ulima.edu.pe miguel angel palga-condori faculty of engineering and architecture, university of lima, perú 20183027@aloe.ulima.edu.pe martin fidel collao-díaz research professors faculty of engineering and architecture, university of lima, perú mcollao@ulima.edu.pe",

The results show that all the indicators have improved significantly based on the current situation of the company. Using the Pareto diagram and the root cause analysis, it can be seen that indicators such as stockouts (65%), low product quality (25%) and missed deadlines (10%), are the three main reasons for the low level of service (70%). The correct application of the 5s in the finished product warehouse managed to reduce the number of imperfect orders delivered. In summary, the percentage of orders delivered in an erroneous way was 25% thanks to the 5S philosophy, reduced to 7%. The economic losses presented by the company are based on, which generates losses of material and orders. Therefore, it is sought that through the implementation of MRP, 5S and Jidoka it will be possible to save a total of 25,363.53 soles with respect to the current situation monthly.

13,Production Model Based On Lean Manufacturing Tools To  Reduce Delivery Times In A Small Manufacturing Enterprise,"the foam furniture paint industry, belonging to the manufacturing sector, has experienced a decline in recent years due to the covid-19 pandemic. this situation has negatively impacted production capacity and has generated significant challenges. among them, reprocessing has occurred due to undesired tones in the paints, the presence of residues in the machines, as well as errors in machinery programming and delays in the start of production. these factors have hindered the manufacturing sector from reaching its pre-crisis economic level. consequently, delays in the delivery of the final product arise, leading to economic losses for the companies, which hinder their development. to address these issues and thereby reduce product delivery times, the production improvement model based on lean manufacturing tools is proposed. the model consists of tools such as 5s, poka-yoke, and standardized work. the model was validated through the implementation of pilot tests and simulation using arena software.","lean manufacturing, 5s, poka-yoke","In conclusion, the implementation of the 5S tool has been pivotal in reducing delivery times, leading to a significant improvement, and positioning the company competitively in the market. The positive transformation in space and resource management has boosted productivity and adherence to agreed-upon customer deadlines. Likewise, the use of Poka-Yoke has proven effective in preventing errors and defects in the process, with employees showing commitment to identifying sources of error and proposing solutions, fostering a culture of continuous improvement within the company. Furthermore, through flowcharts and detailed documentation, rigorous sales control has been achieved, resulting in a substantial reduction in fines due to delivery delays. This has minimized errors and ensured consistent and high-quality production. Work standardization has had a positive impact, providing greater consistency in the company's results. In summary, the implementation of these three tools has generated a positive impact on Onyx International, leading to efficiency, quality, and profitability. The waste reduction from 5S, the use of Poka-Yoke to prevent errors, and the work standardization with detailed documents have been key in satisfying the company's customers.

The results demonstrate that the random forest excelled compared to other algorithms, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately classifying transformer health. The high precision, recall, and F1-score values for both the ""No Fault"" and ""Fault"" categories underscore the robustness of the Random Forest model. Through local explanations, we gained valuable insights into the model's decision-making process for individual data points. Specific features and their values were examined to understand their influence on predictions. Furthermore, we employed global explanation techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to understand feature importance at a broader scale. Notably, features like 'OLI' (Oil Level Indicator), 'VL23' (Voltage Line 2-3), and 'OTI' (Oil Temperature Indicator) were identified as significant factors in transformer fault classification. XAI techniques like SHAP and LIME enhance the transparency of complex machine learning processes, fostering trust and confidence in AI-driven decision-making. Applying XAI techniques is vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of power systems. In conclusion, our research provides a data-driven approach to preventing failures and improving power transformer reliability. Machine learning algorithms, interpretability techniques, and domain-specific knowledge work well to enhance transformer fault diagnosis and maintenance practices. As the power sector continues to evolve, integrating AI and XAI will be pivotal in ensuring the stability and efficiency of power distribution systems. As we look to the future, several exciting avenues exist for further research and development in transformer fault diagnosis. One of the promising directions is the exploration of ensemble models and hybrid approaches. These ensemble models can effectively capture diverse patterns in the data, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy.

18,Maritime Crime And Security: Pivotal Issues  In A Global World,"maritime security in the 21st century is a pressing global concern, with multifaceted challenges ranging from piracy to environmental crimes. this article delves into the complexities of maritime crime and security, emphasizing their global implications. contemporary maritime threats have evolved in scale and intricacy, necessitating comprehensive and adaptive responses. underlying factors, including economic disparities, technological advancements, and maritime infrastructure vulnerabilities, contribute to these threats. the international legal framework, while foundational, faces challenges in enforcement and adaptability. past interventions offer lessons, underscoring the importance of international cooperation and interdisciplinary approaches. maritime crime has profound global repercussions, influencing trade, economies, and environmental sustainability. economic ramifications include inflated insurance costs and trade disruptions, while environmental consequences threaten marine ecosystems. addressing these challenges demands international collaboration, as maritime issues often transcend national boundaries. the article underscores the significance of maritime security in our interconnected world, advocating for continued research, international cooperation, and decisive policy actions. the future of our oceans and global security hinges on collective resolve and action.",,"and Recommendation Within the vast expanse of the world's oceans, the intricate tapestry of maritime activities holds a central role in shaping global geopolitics, economies, and environmental sustainability. This article has illuminated the fact that maritime crime and security transcend regional boundaries and are, in fact, global imperatives demanding immediate attention and concerted action. Several crucial takeaways emerge from this review. First and foremost, contemporary maritime threats, spanning from piracy to environmental crimes, have evolved in both complexity and scale, necessitating a multifaceted and adaptable response. The underlying factors contributing to these threats, including economic disparities, technological advancements, and vulnerabilities in maritime infrastructure, underscore the imperative for comprehensive strategies to counteract them. While the international legal framework governing maritime affairs boasts robust foundations, it faces considerable challenges in terms of enforcement and adaptability to evolving threats. Nevertheless, past experiences, marked by both successes and failures, offer invaluable lessons. These lessons underscore the significance of international cooperation, interdisciplinary approaches, and the need for continuous adaptation to the ever-changing maritime landscape. The global repercussions of maritime crime, spanning economic and environmental dimensions, are profound. As maritime activities wield influence over global trade, economies, and ecological equilibrium, the stakes are undeniably high. The economic consequences, ranging from inflated insurance costs to trade disruptions, ripple through global markets. Simultaneously, environmental impacts, encompassing issues such as illegal fishing and oil theft, pose a direct threat to marine ecosystems and the broader sustainability of our planet. Addressing these multifaceted challenges demands a united effort on multiple fronts. International cooperation and collaborative partnerships emerge as paramount. Given that maritime challenges invariably transcend national boundaries, a coordinated, global response becomes imperative. As highlighted by Bueger et al. (2019), maritime security in the 21st century represents an interlinked set of challenges of growing global significance, encompassing national, environmental, economic, and human security concerns. It is in acknowledging this interconnectedness and embracing a holistic approach that we can endeavour to safeguard the maritime domain and, by extension, the well- being of our interconnected world. 164","engr. festus uche uwadia, dr. emmanuel innocents edoun, prof. anup pradhan and prof. charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and built environment department of quality & operation management university of johannesburg, south africa, 55 beit st, doornfontein, johannesburg, 2028, south africa festus_u@yahoo.com, edounsen@hotmail.com, anupp@uj.ac.za, c.mbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

23,A Comparative Study On Heuristic Methods For  Transportation Problem,"transportation cost accounts for one to two-thirds of the logistics cost for many organizations. so, minimizing the transportation cost in a transportation problem (tp) would help the organization to maximize profit. though there are various methods, such as linear programming approach, network approach, transportation method, etc., available for addressing tp, the transportation method – particularly any simple and efficient heuristic method (which is expected to give very near optimal solution to tp) – is widely used as this type of method could easily be coupled with any another logistics/supply chain decision-making methods/tools to have an integrated decision-making process. due to this, many researchers are continuously proposing simple heuristic method(s) for solving tp to get near-optimal solutions. however, from the analysis of the literature, it is observed that there is no good comparative study with good computational experiments considering all heuristic methods, which are (a) claimed as relatively ‘better heuristic method’ and published in reputed journals during the year 2013-2022, (b) evaluated using a large number of tiny test data taken from the literature, and (c) evaluated with large scale test data - generated from popular experimental design available in the literature. to address this research gap, this study considers 10 ‘better heuristic methods’ reported in the literature and proposed 4 heuristic methods. further, from the detailed performance analyses carried out using 640 randomly generated problem instances, this study identified the ‘best’ heuristic method(s) and the same is reported with insights.",heuristics,"This study presents a comparative analysis of the recently published heuristic methods for a traditional transportation problem (TP). A total of 10 existing heuristic methods along with 4 newly proposed variants of the existing heuristic methods are considered in this study. For this, a suitable performance analysis of all the 14 heuristic methods considered for the TP is carried out considering 640 randomly and systematically generated problem instances, which are generated from a suitable experimental design. The two variants of the recently published heuristic method SSM: SSM – TCM and SSM – TOCM are topping the first two places out of all the 14 heuristic methods considered in the study.

24,Multicriteria Decision Making Methods For Supplier  Selection Problems In Construction,"estimates for materials costs create significant variability in the final ‘as built’ cost of construction. getting estimates close to accurate from the beginning of a project reduces conflict, litigation and additional financing costs. furthermore, accurate cost estimates go a long way towards ensuring the client is ultimately satisfied with the project on hand over. consequently, the task of identifying “best” supplier(s) of materials is central to construction procurement decision making. the construction team needs to know who is most able to supply materials at the right cost, quantity, quality as well as with a high degree of certainty of delivery in order to achieve success. supplier selection is therefore a multiple criteria decision making (mcdm) problem. this study utilizes a five step research process; (i) to identify a comprehensive set of supplier selection criteria (ssc) by conducting a wide ranging literature review, (ii) to determine ‘vital ssc’ by applying ‘pareto analysis’, (iii) to apply integrated ahp (analytical hierarchy process) -bwm (define bwm) methods for understanding ‘best versus worst ssc’, from the given set of ‘vital ssc’ by applying an ahp method to establish optimal weightings for each ‘vital ssc’, (iv) to determine optimal weights for a given set of suppliers around each ‘vital ssc’ using the ahp-bwm method, and (v) establish rankings for suppliers. the proposed five step process is demonstrated by collecting the required pairwise importance score for the set of ‘vital ssc’ and suppliers from 10 experts. the novelty of this study is to combine the mcdm methods: ahp and bwm in order to enhance the decision-making process and provide a more robust and comprehensive approach for ssp in construction projects.","mcdm method, ahp","In this study, we initially examined the use of MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision-Making) techniques in the context of construction industry. From the various available MCDM methods, we specifically selected AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and the Best Worst Method (BWM) to determine the prioritization of factors influencing supplier selection in the construction industry. Our aim was to triangulate the results by using both of these methods. It is observed from the results that: the most important supplier selection criterion (SSC) in the construction industry is Quality (S3). It is also observed that the least important criterion is the reputation/past performance/buyer-supplier relationship (S5). Further, three suppliers were selected and evaluated on the basis of the ‘vital few’ SSC. Based on the optimal weights of the ‘vital few’ SSC obtained from AHP and weights obtained for each supplier w.r.t the ‘vital few’ SSC, the best supplier was identified.

25,Electric Vehicle Routing Problem With On-Demand  Charging System,"many logistics operators predominantly rely on diesel-powered vehicles for their delivery services. however, the adverse external effects of internal combustion engine vehicles have led governments and city authorities to enact more stringent regulations governing freight transportation within urban areas. these initiatives promote the transition to alternative fuel vehicles, with a primary focus on electric vehicles (evs). consequently, it is anticipated that evs will make up a substantial portion of logistics operators' vehicle fleets. inadequate charging infrastructure has been a significant impediment to the widespread adoption of evs. charging at the depot is a practical solution in real-world logistics operations due to limited recharging infrastructure in many regions and the uncertainty surrounding charger availability. while there may be numerous public recharging stations in the area, not all are suitable for commercial vehicles, especially trucks. furthermore, some companies prefer charging their evs at their depots due to factors like high energy costs at public stations. nevertheless, this approach can result in operational inefficiencies, especially for deliveries in peri-urban and rural areas. to address this, offering charging services for evs, such as deploying mobile chargers (mcs), can enhance the efficiency of ev usage. in other words, a flexible recharging system with an on- demand mobile charging approach can be recommended. we introduce the electric vehicle routing problem with on-demand charging system to tackle these challenges. mcs recharge ev batteries at customer locations along their routes when necessary. we have developed a matheuristic algorithm that combines the variable neighborhood search (vns) and an exact method.","electric vehicles, mobile charging",,"i̇hsan sadati faculty of engineering and natural sciences, sabanci university, istanbul, turkey smart mobility and logistics lab, sabanci university, istanbul, turkey msadati@sabanciuniv.edu bülent çatay faculty of engineering and natural sciences, sabanci university, istanbul, turkey smart mobility and logistics lab, sabanci university, istanbul, turkey bulent.catay@sabanciuniv.edu",

This model, strategically selected after rigorous evaluation, can serve as a potent tool for insurance companies seeking to fortify their defenses against fraudulent activities. The proposed solution offers a versatile framework that strikes a balance between simplicity, enabling efficient processing of vast datasets, and complexity, ensuring a robust and reliable detection mechanism. The findings of this research provide a compelling pitch for Moroccan insurance companies to adopt and customize the model to seamlessly integrate with their existing systems. The overarching goal is to empower these companies with a tailored solution that aligns with their unique operational requirements. By incorporating such a sophisticated yet user-friendly model, Moroccan insurance companies can elevate their ability to accurately identify and mitigate fraudulent claims, thereby contributing to the integrity and sustainability of the insurance industry in the face of evolving economic landscapes.","sidi aly mouna and kissani ilham school of science & engineering al akhawayn university, 5300, ifrane, morocco m.sidialy@aui.ma, i.kissani@aui.ma",
27,Artificial Intelligence (Ai) In Engineering Research: An  Ethics Perspective,"whilst history shares that engineering is a discipline practised in a social context with engineering projects contributing to the well-being of communities around the world, academic engineering research is the lifeblood and future of any academic tradition and discipline and none more so than for engineering. the importance of academic, engineering research and its direct impact on our daily life cannot be underestimated but what is providing cause for concern amongst engineering ethicists, is the computer technology used by engineers to interpret, analyse and communicate their results from their academic research.whilst we can marvel at the design and utility of brunel’s clifton suspension bridge a first of its kind in victorian times, have perhaps personally enjoyed the thrill of flying supersonic on concorde, daily drive a car built by robots and make continual use of a laptop in our professional and personal life; we can equally appreciate the ground-breaking engineering research carried out by those involved in the manhattan project and the way in which it was used to bring about an end to world war two and the engineering research that led to landing a man safely on the moon in 1969. however, in so doing, perhaps what we have failed to consider is the level of direct human involvement in these engineering examples. historically, academic engineering research has been facilitated by human interest and the need through direct application of engineering breakthroughs to improve daily life. such engineering innovation has undeniably been the direct result of human effort, intellect, foresight and vision with technology playing a supporting role, rather than a leading role. this paper examines the ethics of undertaking academic engineering research in contemporary times and the challenge artificial intelligence (ai) presents to the critical need to maintain academic excellence and intellectual and research integrity in the pedagogy and output of this academic discipline through human interest, abilities and facilitation.","engineering, research integrity","It is perhaps to MacIntyre (2002) the contemporary philosopher who has revived the study of Aristotelian virtue that we find ourselves intrinsically drawn when viewing contemporary dilemmas in academic research in engineering.

28,Renewable Resources & Green Hydrogen  Sharaf Fahed Al Wakeel,"over the past decade there has been a call for action to reduce the emissions which have contributed to global warming and climate change. many countries and organizations have invested in renewable resources like solar, wind and hydropower to produce energy in a sustainable way. in recent years, an interest has been taken in hydrogen. this paper highlights the benefits of hydrogen and more specifically green hydrogen which is hydrogen produced using renewable resources. it highlights the current challenges such as production of hydrogen at large scale and the cost of production. during research, the benefits of hydrogen were discovered and the lack of knowledge especially in the public sector were observed. to help create awareness and highlight the future prospects of hydrogen, microsoft power bi data visualization tool was used to create an interactive dashboard which can be used to create awareness between the users and to encourage them to adopt renewable energies. certain countries and companies were highlighted for taking the prominent role in the production of hydrogen and paving the way for others to follow with their findings. with the increase in awareness between communities, it is predicted that government and other entities will be encouraged to explore clearer energy such as hydrogen. it was recommended that in the future when the cost of hydrogen has decreased it can be used to tackle large sectors like heavy duty industrial and transportation.","green hydrogen, emissions, net zero","& Recommendations To conclude, the issue of global warming and climate change have become increasingly relevant with the impact now more visible to the human population. Several international organizations have pushed for investment in renewable energy like green hydrogen. This papers looked into the benefits of green hydrogen which range from being carbon neutral to being a great source of energy storage. Data was collected from organizational databases and filtered. It was communicated through the Microsoft Power BI software which is a data visualization software. It was used create an interactive dashboard which presented information on emissions reduction, production of hydrogen, economical potential of green hydrogen and forecasted data relevant to use of green hydrogen. From the data it was summarized that hydrogen is a great source which can help make industries like transportation reduce emissions. However, at the current time the challenges include producing hydrogen at a large scale and at an economically feasible price. 96 % of world’s hydrogen in 2021 was produced using non-renewable resources. However, with a push on sustainability around the world, many researchers have started to look into ways in which hydrogen can be produced, stored and utilized for different industries using renewable energies only. The forecasted date reflected that the hydrogen storage market size is bound to continue increasing with the technological advancements and new information gathered about hydrogen. The dashboard was also used to present data on countries which have the highest number of hydrogen facilities and companies which are leaders of hydrogen producers currently. Further research was carried out on specific countries like the US where the growth in the number of alternative fueling stations in the United States is a positive development. In addition, the data shows that the number of AFVs in operation is growing steadily. It is a sign that the country is moving towards a more sustainable transportation system. However, there is still more work to be done. One of the biggest challenges facing the alternative fueling industry is the high cost of building and maintaining alternative fueling stations. This is especially true for EV charging stations, which can be very expensive to install. The article discussed many challenges surrounding adoption of green hydrogen such as but not limited to cost, grid integration, technological advancements, developing infrastructure and lack of market development. Another challenge facing renewable energies and green hydrogen is the lack of public awareness. Many people are not aware of the benefits or the potential of green hydrogen as an energy source. The government can play a role in addressing these challenges by providing subsidies and other financial incentives for the construction and maintenance of alternative fueling stations and funding projects for hydrogen. The government can also raise public awareness of alternative fuel vehicles and green hydrogen through education and outreach campaigns. While challenges remain, the data suggests a promising future for hydrogen as a key component of the global energy landscape. Continued investments and policy support are crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability and growth of hydrogen infrastructure.","department of industrial & mechanical engineering qatar university doha, qatar sa1303487@qu.edu.qa syeda manahil akhter department of industrial & mechanical engineering qatar university doha, qatar sa1603854@qu.edu.qa",

30,Identifying A Catalyst For Competitiveness For Family-Owned  Enterprises In Manufacturing Using Supplier Selection,"this paper analyses supplier selection criteria—economic, environmental, and social—to discover which criteria is a possible catalyst toward competitiveness in family-owned manufacturing enterprises. family enterprises are essential to the national and even international economies. enterprises are now forced to look beyond the conventional approach of decision-making, which was based on intuition and past knowledge, due to the extremely competitive market. an enterprise must be competitive to guarantee that the clients obtain greater value from the enterprise than from competitors. the rapid growth of competitiveness has changed the economic landscape for many industries, especially manufacturing. a survey questionnaire was created to perform quantitative research among the employees of family- owned enterprises in the manufacturing sector of south africa. employee assessments of their comprehension of the terms ""competitiveness"" and ""supplier selection criteria—economic, environmental, and social"" served as the analytical unit. the questionnaire included 154 respondents as a sample. a path analysis is employed to test these constructs. the research objectives are to evaluate the impact of supplier selection on competitiveness, particularly in manufacturing family-owned enterprises, and to identify potential catalysts between supplier selection criteria and competitiveness. although supplier selection research is becoming more prevalent, it is still in its infancy in south africa. by including supplier selection criteria, competitive aspects like quality, delivery, price, dependability, and flexibility have been reinterpreted. the scope of this unit of analysis is inherently limited. this study only took into account family-owned manufacturing enterprises located in the west rand district of gauteng province, south africa. this study has brought to light which of the criteria is a catalyst on competitiveness. this will support decision-making for supply chain professionals in family-owned enterprises.","competitiveness, supplier selection, economic criteria",,"criteria – case from south africa ndivhuwo nemtajela lecturer, department of operations management college of economic and management sciences university of south africa pretoria, south africa nemtan@unisa.ac.za jan-harm christiaan pretorius and andre vermeulen department of engineering management, faculty engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za, avermeulen.research@gmail.com",
31,A Branch And Bound Algorithm To Optimize Multiobjective Competitive Multi-Agent Scheduling With,"encompassing a subset of multi-objective scheduling challenges, the multi-agent scheduling problem involves various agents, each entrusted with a unique set of tasks while striving to optimize their individual goals. recent inquiries in this field have predominantly spotlighted variable processing times, employing methods like the 𝜖𝜖-constraint approach to optimize one agent's function without compromising the other’s limit. our study takes an innovative approach, delving into a two-agent single-machine scheduling problem influenced by concurrent learning and deterioration effects. the primary aim is to minimize the overall weighted completion time for both agents, preventing any job delays for the second agent. to address this, our research amalgamates the 𝜖𝜖-constraint and linear combination approaches, presenting a unique proposition in the current research landscape. we introduce a two-stage methodology: a heuristic method for near-optimal solutions followed by a branch-and-bound algorithm, integrating specialized dominance rules to achieve optimal solutions.",learning effect,"This paper presented a methodology designed to address the challenging multi-agent scheduling problem involving jobs subject to the simultaneous influence of learning and deterioration effects. The primary objective of this problem was to minimize the total weighted completion time for all agents while enforcing the constraint that no tardy jobs were permissible for the second agent. The proposed methodology was structured into two key phases: an initial heuristic for generating an initial solution and a subsequent branch-and-bound algorithm for refining and optimizing the solution further. To enhance the efficiency of the branch-and-bound algorithm and reduce its computational complexity, a set of dominance rules and pruning rules were introduced. The computational results showcased the effectiveness of the branch-and-bound algorithm, particularly when coupled with the initial heuristic solution. Notably, this approach demonstrated commendable performance in terms of the number of nodes generated and execution time across a range of experiments. The methodology was rigorously tested with up to 15 jobs, revealing that its success was notably influenced by factors such as a smaller learning coefficient, a larger deterioration coefficient, and reduced slack time intervals for jobs belonging to agent B. In summary, this study offers a promising methodology for tackling complex multi-agent scheduling problems characterized by the simultaneous influence of learning and deterioration effects. The proposed approach, combining heuristic and branch-and-bound techniques, provides a robust foundation for efficiently solving such problems, with its performance particularly favorable under certain parameter conditions. 290","simultaneous log-linear position-based learning and time- based deterioration effects tugba danaci fatma senses vs business administration department member, public university-industry collaboration committee kirikkale university kirikkale, turkiye deda technology investment ltd ankara, turkiye","References

AS9100, as an extension of the ISO 9001 framework, introduces additional requirements covering configuration management, risk management, product safety, and prevention of counterfeit parts. The complexity of AS9100 necessitates thorough documentation and process management, emphasizing a nuanced focus on risk management, continuous risk assessment in dynamic sectors, and the critical importance of supply chain management. The standard underscores the necessity for meticulous supplier selection, evaluation, and collaboration, placing a strong emphasis on product and service safety, especially in sectors where reliability is paramount. The meticulous documentation and continuous monitoring intrinsic to AS9100 highlight the multifaceted challenges it poses for organizations, embodying an industry-specific, process-oriented, risk-focused, and supply chain-centric nature. Despite the growing adoption of EQMS among AS9100-certified firms, the limitations of off-the-shelf EQMS products in achieving seamless compatibility with AS9100 standards hinder the attainment of optimal performance. Consequently, there is a noticeable trend where organizations are increasingly turning to the development of customized software solutions. This shift from off-the-shelf EQMS products is driven by the need for alignment with the intricacies of the organization's production processes, structural nuances, and overarching priorities.This study centers on the development of a tailored EQMS for a company operating in the defense industry. The company, classified as a Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) with approximately 200 employees, specializes in offering composite ceramic products in the defense and aerospace sectors. Possessing certifications for ISO 9001, ISO 18001, ISO 14001, and AS 9100 quality management systems, the company currently employs ERP and MES systems. The research is situated in the context where the quality management module in the ERP system falls short of fully meeting the requirements of AS9100. In response to this inadequacy, the company has undertaken the development of a customized Enterprise Quality Management System (EQMS). The developed EQMS comprises modules such as 328","quality management software design for as9100 compliance in defense and aerospace advanced ceramic manufacturing tugba danaci fatma senses vs business administration department member, public university-industry collaboration committee kirikkale university kirikkale, turkiye deda technology investment ltd ankara, turkiye","References

Geographical distributions revealed that the waste bins were not evenly distributed throughout the city. Standard distance analysis indicated that a significant portion of the bins were located within a relatively small area, highlighting the need for a more balanced distribution. Directional distribution analysis showed that the distribution pattern of waste bins in the city had an oval shape, with the major axis extending from the northeast to the southwest, influenced by the city's flat topography. To achieve more efficient and sustainable waste management, it is essential to develop strategies that result in a more even distribution of waste bins across the city. The proposed smart waste management system based on GIS analysis provides a valuable tool for city planners and waste management authorities to optimize waste bins placement and collection routes, ultimately contributing to 339","a gis-based smart waste management for assessing spatial distribution of waste bins in the city of bisha, kingdom of saudi arabia ghadah m khushail, ghaida fahad alqarni, refan m alshahrani and reema m almotawa undergraduate student in mechanical engineering department-industrial engineering program, college of engineering, university of bisha bisha 61922, saudi arabia 440802539@ub.edu.sa; 440802540@ub.edu.sa, 440802548@ub.edu.sa, 440802553@ub.edu.sa khaled ali abuhasel full professor in mechanical engineering department-industrial engineering program, college of engineering, university of bisha, bisha 61922, saudi arabia kabuhasel@ub.edu.sa","References

36,An Innovative Strategy To Reduce Carbon Dioxide  Emissions Resulting From Stopping At Traffic Lights: A Case,"the rising levels of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions, notably from idling vehicles while waiting at traffic lights, have evolved into a pressing global issue that requires urgent attention. this comprehensive research delves into the relationship between the distribution of traffic signals and the emission of carbon in bisha, saudi arabia. . this study investigates the correlation between traffic signal distribution and carbon emissions in bisha, saudi arabia. data was collected through fieldwork, gps tracking, and emissions measurements. the research reveals that the city's traffic signals are concentrated on main road axes, contributing to increased traffic congestion and emissions. private cars dominate the vehicle types, followed by taxis and heavy goods transport. the findings show a significant connection between the city's traffic signal placement and the surge in carbon emissions, particularly in the context of bisha. the research brings to light that a significant concentration of traffic signals is found along the city's primary roads, worsening traffic congestion and contributing to a substantial increase in carbon emissions. furthermore, the investigation argues that the leading vehicle category in bisha consists of private cars, followed closely by taxis and heavy goods transport vehicles. these findings provide a valuable perspective on the environmental and societal consequences of this critical issue.","smart strategy, carbon dioxide, traffic lights, safety","The study conducted in Bisha, Saudi Arabia, shows the significant challenges stemming from the increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with idling vehicles at traffic lights. Bisha, serving as a sample of broader urban trends, struggles with rising traffic congestion and emissions driven by rapid urbanization and population growth. These research findings emphasize the urgent need for implementing sustainable strategies to mitigate the environmental and societal impacts of this issue. The implications of this research extend beyond Bisha, becoming a global concern. Addressing CO2 emissions resulting from idling vehicles has become a moral and environmental obligation with immense consequences for public health, air quality, and the fight against climate change. The study illustrates the need for collaborative efforts to combat climate change and align with the Sustainable Development Goals. As Bisha's urbanization continues rapidly, the challenge of reducing CO2 emissions remains pressing. The findings of this study inform policy and urban planning, not only in Bisha but also in other urban areas facing similar challenges. Embracing sustainable urban planning, improving traffic management, and promoting eco-friendly transportation options are critical steps in mitigating the environmental impact of idling vehicles at traffic lights. Taking action now is essential to protect the environment and ensure the well-being of current and future generations.","study in bisha, saudi arabia maha n alshehri, hadeel a alshahrani, maali sh alshahrani, sheikha m alshehri and abeer h alaklobi undergraduate student in mechanical engineering department-industrial engineering program, college of engineering, university of bisha, bisha 61922, saudi arabia 440802533@ub.edu.sa; corresponding author, 440803181@ub.edu.sa, 440803183@ub.edu.sa, 440800539@ub.edu.sa, 440802535@ub.edu.sa khaled ali abuhasel full professor in mechanical engineering department-industrial engineering program, college of engineering, university of bisha, bisha 61922, saudi arabia kabuhasel@ub.sdu.sa",
37,Exploring The Manufacturability And Quality Of Small-Scale  Hole Via Fused Deposition Modeling Technology,"fused deposition modeling (fdm) is a 3d printing process that builds parts layer by layer by selectively depositing melted material in a predetermined path. fdm has gained popularity due to its low cost, ease of use, and wide material availability. however, there are still challenges to overcome, especially when it comes to producing small-scale features with high precision and quality. small-scale features are essential in many applications such as microfluidics, microelectronics, and biomedical devices. the ability to produce high-quality small-scale features with fdm can significantly expand its potential applications. this paper aims to assess the manufacturability of small holes using 3d printing-fdm technology. benchmarking specimens contained holes with varied sizes are designed and fabricated with different parameters (layer height and building direction). the results of this study provided an insights into the limitations and capabilities of fdm technology for small-scale holes fabrication and help to identify potential areas for improvement.","3d printing, small features",The aim of this study is to evaluate the manufacturability and the quality of small holes via FDM 3D printing technology with different layer heights and building directions. The following conclusions are drawn based on the results: • The minimum printable hole in the horizontal direction is 0.3 diameter mm and 0.8mm in vertical detraction. • The minimum printable diameter pin is 0.9mm and any diameter less than 0.9mm didn’t appear in the fabricated part. • The printing direction has a significant effect on the hole manufacturability and quality and the vertical build direction perform well better than the horizontal build direction. More studies can be conducted in the effect of printer parameter on the process capability on fabrication the other small features and. Also different materials can be used and the rules can be developed for each materials.

38,Quality Assurance Machine For Software Using  Machine Learning,"extending the work of downing & badar (2022), this paper presents the history of software, artificial intelligence, software quality assurance, and a software qa architecture called the quality assurance machine (qam). using design science research (dsr), the qam was extended to support software containing ml models. using descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing, this paper answers the research question: is qam effective for assuring the quality of software containing ml? future dsr efforts will add a process quality engine to the qam to monitor and improve the processes used to create software and models.","quality assurance, machine learning, design science","The first author of this paper has worked in the software industry for decades, and until two years ago knew as much about AI as was advertised in mass media. Even for a software professional, what AI was, the impact it was having, the impact it would have, was unknown. Twenty years ago, the Google search engine was like magic, and today it is slightly annoying, users having to piece together bits of information from multiple sites while negotiating more adds than relevant content. Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT and Bard are similar to the Google magic of the past. Incredibly efficient and strangely effective, they are merely an example of where technology, not just the software industry, but technology, is heading. They have issues, and taking an LLM response as truth is risky business. That will change, and the change will likely be faster than anticipated. The software industry and the businesses that use software are experiencing a rapid paradigm shift, perhaps too rapid for the companies creating AI. The quality processes and teams needed to support the transition to AI are immature at best, ad hoc most likely. The literature does not support it, but from a quality perspective a possible bridge between the age of software and AI-enabled software is to lean into tradition. SQA solutions like the QAM are effective for assuring product quality in software containing probabilistic models, and follow-on research will attempt to prove they are also effective for improving the quality of the processes that create it. This research did not directly address two concerns with products containing ML models, those being model maintenance post-production release, and approaches to shifting model testing left, that is, closer to the model development phase. ML models are trained on a labeled set of data, but it is not the entire population of data; it is a sample. In a production environment models process new data, and that data may change over time compared to the static training data. Financial data, weather data, population data, these are examples of changes in a data set. A model’s response to this changing data can cause its accuracy to degrade, and this is known as model drift (Gama et al., 2014). Addressing model drift from a quality perspective is an opportunity for further research.

40,"Effective Forecasting And Vmi For Critical Maintenance  Non-Repairable Parts In Residential Facilities In Riyadh,","vendor managed inventory (vmi) has been one of the most valuable strategies that provides a number of benefits for both suppliers and customers. there was an impact on the proposed improvement practices listed, including vmi that enhanced and smoothened spare parts supply chain management. for suppliers, it can help to improve customer satisfaction by ensuring that they always have the products they need in stock. it can also help to reduce inventory costs by eliminating the need for the supplier to carry excess inventory. for customers, vmi can help to free up resources that can be focused on other areas of the business, such as sales and marketing. it can also help to improve inventory visibility and accuracy, and reduce the risk of stockouts. in this study, the services provided at residential complexes of the case study in riyadh, saudi arabia have been listed, and then have found the most critical services to the tenants by conducting a scoring questionnaire. these services have been analyzed and listed the most common issues and have went through their supply chain process to rate the supply chain interruption risk. the highest rated risk service has been picked up as an example to apply the forecasting methodology. the historical data has been used for the elevators main board to draw the curve of occurrences probability. the curve equation has been found in order to use it as a forecasting tool. the finding shows the upcoming year expected demand using the mathematical calculations.","supply chain, maintenance","Effective supply chain management plays a very important role to ensure the continuity of the services provided in residential complexes, and therefore stopping them or operating inappropriately will directly affect the satisfaction of the residents and affect the reputation and thus the commercial value and profits. Accurate demand forecasting and proper VMI helped facility managers to: • Reduce costs by avoiding the need to order and stock unnecessary parts. • Avoid holding cost and inventory risk and transfer it to the supplier. • Improve efficiency by ensuring that the right parts are available when they need them. • Reduce downtime and disruptions to services. • Improve resident satisfaction.

41,A Calculation Method Of The Dish Similarities Based On  Ingredients And Seasonings For Automatic School Lunch,"according to a survey conducted by the ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology, 99.1% of elementary schools in japan provide school lunches. nutrition teachers prepare school lunch menus at monthly meetings. because nutrition teachers need to consider a large number and variety of constraints, it requires a lot of time and effort to prepare menus. therefore, it is highly significant to introduce an automatic menu creation model for school lunches. in the school lunch standards, nutrition teachers are expected to expose students to various foods. from the viewpoint of dietary education, nutrition teachers are also required to expose students to a variety of ingredients and tastes. therefore, it is necessary to consider the dishes diversity in terms of ingredients and seasonings. for automatic school lunch menu creation, the similarities between dishes are important to provide an appropriate combination of various foods. there were previous studies that calculated dishes similarity considering ingredients and food groups and grouped similar dishes considering the main seasoning. in our previous study of automatic school lunch menu creation, the inter-dish similarities were calculated based on the categories and the gram amounts of ingredients and seasonings in each dish. based on the inter-dish similarities, similar dishes were classified into the same group, and constraints on the frequency of serving were created for each similar dish group to create an automatic menu creation model. the issue of the previous study was that the grouping of similar dishes was based solely on the same ingredients and seasonings in the end. in other words, the results were not sufficiently based on human senses. for example, the main ingredients of two dishes are different for beef and pork, respectively, but are the same meat food group. in addition, if their seasoning combinations are very similar, humans may judge these two dishes as similar. considering the food groups of main ingredients, the grouping is expected to become close to the human senses. the purpose of this study is to propose a calculation method of inter-dish similarity that considers the dishes similarities based on the food group of the main ingredients and combination of seasonings. in this study, the main ingredient in each dish was determined based on the number of ingredients in each dish and their gram amounts. 14thannual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management dubai, united arab emirates (uae), february 12-14, 2024 publisher: ieom society international, usa published: february 12, 2024 doi: 10.46254/an14.20240094 392",,,"menu creation yating liu department of industrial engineering and management, graduate school of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202370178wx@jindai.jp yuki mekata and hideki katagiri department of industrial engineering and management, faculty of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan yuki-mekata@kanagawa-u.ac.jp, katagiri@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
42,Life-Cycle Environmental And Economic Impacts Of  Alternative Fuel Buses,"this study undertook a comprehensive analysis of the eco-efficiency and economic viability of various city buses, focusing on their environmental impact and life cycle costs. using life cycle assessment (lca), the environmental footprints of buses, considering their type and recycling country, were assessed. results highlighted the generally lower environmental impacts of compressed natural gas (cng) buses compared to diesel and electric buses. furthermore, life cycle cost (lcc) evaluations showed diesel buses as the least economical, with chinese cng buses emerging as the most cost-effective over their lifespan. additional analysis using the pca-dea model indicated the superior efficiency of certain bus units, especially both the chinese cng recycled in china and india. sensitivity analysis further revealed that environmental categories with higher sensitivity ratios can achieve complete efficiency with modest improvements. overall, the findings suggest that cng buses, particularly those from china, present an eco-friendly and economically sustainable choice for urban transportation.",february 12-14,,"noura elagouz research assistant, qatar transportation and traffic safety center college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar noura.elagouz@qu.edu.qa nuri onat associate professor, qatar transportation and traffic safety center college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar onat@qu.edu.qa muhammet enis bulak assistant professor, department of industrial engineering, uskudar university istanbul, turkey muhammetenis.bulak@uskudar.edu.tr murat kucukvar associate professor, department of business ethics and legal studies, daniels college of business, university of denver denver, co, usa murat.kucukvar@du.edu","References

43,Production And Cooperation Strategies In A  Remanufacturing System Involving Knowledge Spillover,"in this study, we explore how firms determine production and remanufacturing strategies considering knowledge spillover, which is unavoidable in nowadays remanufacturing systems in practice. the remanufacturing system considered in this study consists of an original equipment manufacturer (oem) and a third-party remanufacturer (tpr). the oem produces and sells an innovative product for which the innovation-knowledge cannot be directly observed by the tpr. thanks to the spillover of oem’s general knowledge about product design and production his remanufacturing processes, the tpr not only remanufactures used products but also produces new products under his own brand. he sells remanufactured and new products in the same market as the oem. in response to the potential market share cannibalization from tpr’s products, the oem collaborates with the tpr by granting the latter a remanufacturing authorization. the spillover of oem’s innovation knowledge takes place under this cooperation. in examining the effect of general and innovation knowledge spillover on two firms’ production and cooperation strategies, we consider two scenarios in this study, including i) pure competition and ii) remanufacturing authorization cooperation. we develop and analyze several game theoretical models. our results highlight the conditions under which the tpr engages in new product production without remanufacturing in pure competition and cooperation scenarios. an interesting finding is that although innovation-knowledge spillover motivates the tpr to engage in new product production and weakens the competitiveness of oem’s products, both firms can be better off when compared to the pure competition scenario. moreover, both consumer surplus and environment can be improved by remanufacturing authorization cooperation.","co-opetition, lille-paris",,"nannan wang ieseg school of management, f-59000, lille, france n.wang@ieseg.fr linda l. zhang ieseg school of management, univ. lille, cnrs, umr 9221 - lem – lille economie management, f-59000 lille, france l.zhang@ieseg.fr",
44,A Conceptual Framework For Understanding Impostor  Phenomenon In Entrepreneurs,"the article attempts to understand the impostor phenomenon in the innovation ecosystem, where high-achieving individuals, despite their accomplishments, experience a sense of intellectual phoniness. they constantly fear being unmasked as frauds and struggle to acknowledge their own success. a systematic literature review is conducted to explore the antecedents and consequences of the phenomenon in entrepreneurs. research on the impostor phenomenon is extensive and provides valuable insights regarding the impostor phenomenon in various professions and age groups. however, the impostor phenomenon within the innovation ecosystem is stint that hampers our ability to confidently derive clear conclusions in both research and practice domains with respect to the entrepreneurs who are the actors of the innovation ecosystem. there is also a lack of research on mediating and moderating variables in the relation between the impostor phenomenon and entrepreneurial performance. as a result, numerous fundamental questions remain unanswered, like why entrepreneurs believe they don’t belong in the entrepreneurial sphere. the innovation ecosystem provides an interesting context, with human capital, social capital, and financial capital as its elements. these factors set the context for the causes of the impostor phenomenon in entrepreneurs. the article suggests pertinent mediators and moderators that may enrich the understanding of the impostor phenomenon. the nature of the impostor phenomenon, innovation ecosystem and entrepreneurs provide a conceptual framework to understand the impostor phenomenon in entrepreneurs. the proposed framework is discussed, and relevant propositions are provided. the possibilities for future research are also highlighted.","impostor phenomenon, fear of failure",,"mehak student, department of management studies indian institute of science bangalore, india mehakahuja@iisc.ac.in anjula gurtoo professor, department of management studies chairperson, centre for society & policy indian institute of science bangalore, india anjula@iisc.ac.in",

46,A Roadmap For Intelligent Agriculture In Africa A Case  Study Of Sub-Saharan Africa,"this paper examines the barriers to the adoption of intelligent agriculture (ia) in sub-saharan africa in response to the global challenge of food insecurity. ia offers a long lasting solution to enhance agricultural productivity and food security globally. however, its adoption faces significant obstacles. this study aims to bridge this gap by identifying and offering practical and theoretical solutions to these barriers. this study adopted a quantitative method using a questionnaire. the research identifies 13 barriers to ia adoption in sub-saharan africa (ssa), encompassing issues related to financial constraints, credit access, data accessibility and operability, cyber-attacks, communication, internet access, technical expertise, planning, policy, requirements, cultural factors, and infrastructure. using exploratory factor analysis (efa), these barriers are categorized into four distinct dimensions: financial and resource constraints, policy and cultural challenges, communication, planning, and cybersecurity issues, and technological and regulatory barriers. these dimensions underscore the multifaceted nature of the challenges in ia adoption. however, a rank- order analysis was used to analyse the data that is related to the suggested solutions to the barriers to adoption of ia in ssa. the result showed that the participant most prioritised solution is financial support. this study is limited by the sample size as the dimensions extracted can be improved beyond 4. moreover, the method of extraction can be also improved. policy-related obstacles can hinder the alignment of ia with sustainable development goals and regional commitments, making a comprehensive approach essential. participants prioritize financial support, education, and collaboration among stakeholders as top solutions to these barriers.","sub-saharan africa, industry 4.0",,"anthony anosike and pouria liravi centre for supply chain improvement derby business school, university of derby derby, united kingdom a.anosike@derby.ac.uk, p.liravi@derby.ac.uk udoka silas globaia research 11 caithness crescent, derby, united kingdom udoka.silas@globaia.co.uk",
47,Reducing Risks In Maintenance Of High-Voltage  Transmission Lines,"the objective of this research was to reduce the risks associated with the maintenance operations of high-voltage transmission lines, which covers preventive maintenance (pm), corrective maintenance (cm), and enhancement of transmission system equipment (improvement maintenance; im). considering that the task involves numerous steps and requires teamwork of approximately 8-12 individuals per operation, any errors in execution could result in injuries, fatalities, or repercussions on the electricity supply, potentially causing widespread power outages. the study was conducted with an emphasis on risk management and job safety analysis (jsa) based on the peme (people- equipment-material-environment) principle. then, tasks with medium to high-level risks were further assessed using the failure mode and effect analysis (fmea) to identify preventive measures or risk control methods, ensuring that the risks were either prevented or kept within the organization's acceptable range. the results from this research provided insights into risk management practices for high-risk tasks based on risk assessments, facilitating the reduction of losses in human resources, assets, and the electricity production process. this, in turn, reduces the chance of missed opportunities in power distribution within the operational unit. it was also found that a work with a high severity value has a small chance of being conceived. risk can be decreased to an acceptable level for 19 jobs within the organization. in this regard, there are 7 new procedure manuals and improved operating procedures.","transmission system, high-voltage, risk assessment, fmea",,"nuttanicha panich and jittra rukijkanpanich department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, chulalongkorn university bangkok, thailand nuttanicha.mn@gmail.com, jittra.r@chula.ac.th","References

48,A Cost-Effective Approach For Inventorytransportation To  Address Carbon Tax Policy,"the growing concern regarding global warming has resulted in the implementation of regulations aimed at progressively diminishing the volume of greenhouse gases released by industrial sectors and their associated supply chains. this research study concentrates on quantifying the carbon emissions within a two-tiered supply chain, in which a single supplier distributes a single product to different retailers, while also coordinating the many elements of the chain including transportation and inventory. a mixed integer programming (mip) approach has been developed to attain this goal. this model considers decisions such as the time and quantity of replenishment for each retailer, the types of transportation vehicles employed, and the number of products transported by each vehicle. the goal of this optimization model is not only a reduction in transportation expenses and inventory management costs but also carbon emissions across the supply chain which can be reduced by regarding tax as a leverage.","supply chain, transportation, inventory","In this article, we delved into the intricacies of transportation and inventory planning within a 2-layer, multi-product, multi-time network, with a specific emphasis on mitigating carbon emissions. Specifically, we consider the definite and dynamic demand of retailers and the decision-making responsibility of the supplier regarding the quantity and timing of goods sent. This decision-making is facilitated by an inventory management system implemented by the seller. This model introduces several innovations, including taking into account different modes of transportation, utilizing different modes of transportation, accounting for fluctuating carbon emissions, and integrating the dimensions and mass of goods into the modeling process.

49,A Revised Formulation For The Airline Fleet Assignment  Problem,"the fleet assignment problem (fap) deals with assigning aircraft types to the scheduled flights based on fleet capabilities, aircraft availabilities, flight requirements, and operational costs. due to high operating costs, the large number of flights scheduled each day, and the dependency of the following processes in the airline scheduling processes on fap output, solving the fap has always been a challenging task for the airlines. in this work, a revised integer linear programming model is proposed for solving the daily fap. the model has an objective function of minimizing the operating cost of assigning a fleet type to a specific flight. in addition, the proposed model of the daily fap aims to satisfy the following constraints: flight cover, aircraft type balance, fleet size, flight traffic (demand), flight flying altitude, and runway length requirements. the proposed model was successfully applied on a real-world dataset related to a national airline and solved using gurobi software. furthermore, sensitivity analysis has been performed to show the effect of changing different fap parameters on the obtained results.",airline scheduling,"The Fleet Assignment Problem (FAP) has a major effect on airline operating costs and satisfying passengers’ demand; therefore, optimizing FAP is crucial. FAP is the problem of assigning the right fleet type to each flight in the airline schedule. More specifically, it aims to assign as many flights as possible in the schedule to one or more fleet types, while optimizing an objective function and meeting various operational constraints. In FAP, airlines typically operate several different fleet types. Each fleet type has different characteristics and costs. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to solve the daily FAP, where it is formulated as an integer linear programming model. The model’s objective function is to minimize the total operating costs. A set of constraints are included in the model, such as flight cover, aircraft type balance, fleet size, flight traffic (demand), flight flying altitude, and runway length requirements. The applicability of the proposed model has been demonstrated by a real-world dataset related to a national airline, which was solved using Gurobi optimization software. In addition, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to evaluate the effect of changes in problem parameters on the model results, where two scenarios were evaluated. In the first scenario, changing the number of passengers is assessed. While in the second scenario, flights’ timings of some flights have been changed, along with changing the number of passengers of some flights. In these scenarios, the total operating costs and the assigned fleet types for some flights have changed. The total operating cost increased by 36.6% in the first scenario and decreased by 39.1% in the second scenario. Also, the required number of aircraft of some fleet type has changed in the second scenario. As further work, the following is proposed. Taking the fleet maintenance time into consideration and, hence, not all aircraft would be available all the time. Furthermore, including more than one objective function such as minimizing the costs and maximizing the utilization of aircraft. Finally, utilizing a metaheuristic approach to solve the model in a suitable computational time, especially for large datasets.","alaa ahmed, bassant nabil, hadi fors, and ahmad e. elhabashy production engineering department alexandria university alexandria, 21544, egypt es-alaaahmed2022@alexu.edu.eg, es-basantnabil2022@alexu.edu.eg, hadifors@alexu.edu.eg and ahmadelhabashy@alexu.edu.eg",

60,Duration Estimation Of Steel Framing Activities Using An  Artificial Intelligent Algorithm And Top Risk Scores For,"underestimation or overestimating activities’ duration in construction projects leads to many problems like lack of funding or procrastination. however, estimating duration accurately for construction projects is difficult because of many factors like identified and unidentified negative risks. this paper tried to estimate realistic durations of steel framing activities in a high-rise building using a combination of artificial neural networks (anns) and fuzzy logic algorithms with data from five similar projects. initial planned durations and the top five pure risks are the inputs, and estimated actual durations are the outputs. the data from the first four projects was for training, and the fifth one was for simulation. then, the estimated expected actual durations under uncertainties are compared to the actual durations of the project. the results showed that about 75% of the fifth project’s activities had errors of less than three days compared to the actual durations.","risk, most likely","Trying to have accurate durations for activities in construction projects helps contractors avoid many problems like lack of funding or procrastination effect. Although precise estimation of the durations, because of many factors like identified and unidentified negative risks, also are difficult always to try to have better estimation using past data. In this paper, artificial intelligence algorithms using neural networks and fuzzy logic methods have been constructed to estimate steel framing activities. Data from four similar high-rise buildings were used to train the network. Data, as inputs included initial planned durations and actual scores of the five top risks for each project, and the outputs, were the actual durations of those activities. The network had eight input nodes with one output node. MAPE criteria were utilized to identify the number of nodes for the hidden layer. Based on the criteria, 9 nodes had the best performance and were consequently selected. Two membership functions were considered for the fuzzy part to calculate the error and send it to the neural network as feedback for online training and output improvement. For simulation, data from the fifth project was used. The inputs to the trained network were initially planned durations of the fifth project with their scores of five top risks. After that, the outputs (expected actual durations of the activities) were obtained. The obtained results were compared to the actual durations of the activities of the fifth project. According to the comparison, about 75% of 49 steel framing activities of the project had differences with the actual durations of less than 3 days. And the maximum difference was 8 days. The results showed the proposed algorithm can be used for other similar projects with the same characteristics.","high-rise buildings dima jawad associate professor, engineering management graduate program, faculty of engineering and applied science ontario tech university oshawa, ontario, canada seiyed hamid mousavi master of engineering in engineering management, engineering management graduate program, faculty of engineering and applied science ontario tech university oshawa, ontario, canada",

62,Logistics Of Ev Batteries In Germany State Of The Art  Max Plotnikov,"in order to counteract climate change and thus herald the mobility transition from combustion engines to battery electric vehicles in germany, the german government has set the target of registering a total of 15 million electric vehicles by the end of 2030. this is accompanied by enormous demands on battery logistics, as car manufacturers generally decide to have the finished battery systems installed in the bodywork at physically separate locations. both the transportation of lithium-ion batteries as hazardous goods and their storage are subject to a large number of regulatory requirements. in particular, the handling of critical or critical/defective batteries is complex from a logistics perspective in terms of regulation. in order to keep lithium-ion batteries in the cycle for a correspondingly long time and to ensure that a circular economy can function in general, several stakeholders from different groups must collaborate with each other. once the battery has reached around 80% state-of-health, the end of the automotive application has been reached. however, this does not mean that it has to be recycled immediately in line with the circular economy. the aim is to extend the life of the battery, for example as second-life energy storage. other so- called ""r strategies"", e.g. reuse or remanufacturing, are also conceivable alongside recycling, depending on the state of health determined. once the end-of-life of the battery has been reached, it must be recycled using various processes so that critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt or nickel can be recovered.","ev batteries, logistics, circular economy",,"department of software & information engineering research associates fraunhofer institute for material flow and logistics, dortmund 44263, germany max.plotnikov@iml.fraunhofer.de",

64,Management Model Applying Lean Six Sigma To Improve  The Performance Of An Sme In The Professional Services,"the concepts of lean manufacturing and six sigma have been applied in manufacturing companies with greater frequency. however, there are few records of its implementation in companies in the service sector. this sector in peru represents more than 50.6% of the country's gross domestic product and it is composed mainly of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). nevertheless, this kind of businesses are characterized by having low productivity, lack of organization and monitoring of performance indicators to make good decisions. therefore, different techniques are required to maintain their efficiency and productivity over time to meet the expectations of the consumers. in this research, the objective is to propose a management model by applying lean six sigma in order to improve the performance of an sme in the professional services sector. through the dmaic process, a diagnosis of the company was carried out, finding the root causes of its main problems, lean tools such as 5s and virtual kanban were applied in a pilot test in the organization. after implementation, 100% efficiency was obtained, a productivity improvement of 75.56% and a decrease in order delivery time of 42.30%. finally, the pilot test was validated using a statistical analysis of variance test and demonstrated consistency with the management model applying lean six sigma. this work contributes to practical knowledge with the application of a lean six sigma tool model and to be expanded in future work in companies in the service sector.","lean six sigma, lean manufacturing, lean service, 5s",,"sector axel díaz guevara facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima, peru 20183840@aloe.ulima.edu.pe mariel perez reyes facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima, peru 20184287@aloe.ulima.edu.pe rafael chavez-ugaz facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima, peru rchavezu@ulima.edu.pe",
65,A Simulation-Optimisation Approach To Assess The Impact  Of Covid-19 Movement Control Orders On Supply Chain,"the covid-19 pandemic has impacted economies worldwide, particularly the supply chains (scs) of various industries. this research was aimed at investigating the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the manufacturing sc in malaysia. the study employed an optimisation model to simulate the effects of various movement control orders (mcos) on the sc. through an analysis using the sc disruption simulation model, it became evident that an optimal recovery plan depends largely on both the recovery duration and manufacturing capacity. the longer the recovery duration, the longer the optimal recovery plan that is needed if the manufacturing capacity is not considerable. moreover, the number of backorders and sales lost will increase as well if the disruption cannot be recovered within a short period of time. based on the simulation results, some suggestions have been proposed to mitigate the impact of an adverse disruption and strengthen the sc. these include having emergency stock to prevent stock-outs and utilising inventory strategies to overcome the issue of raw material shortages. in addition, manufacturers can reduce the total cost of recovery by adjusting the optimal manufacturing capacity to ensure customer demand can be met with minimal losses.","supply chain, covid-19, individuals","The impact of disruptions to the performance of SCs in relation to Covid-19 during the pandemic was investigated. The SC disruption model revealed that the recovery duration and manufacturing capacity were proportional to the optimum recovery plan and total costs incurred. Although the backorders increased with recovery duration, the lost sales decreased. Therefore, it can be concluded that the longer the recovery duration, the higher the cost that will have to be borne by the manufacturer. Several suggestions have been discussed to overcome this scenario. Manufacturers should have a safety stock in their warehouses to avoid a significant surge in demand. Moreoever, a match capacity strategy can be applied to manage manufacturing and production capacities based on demand during a pandemic. Future research can be conducted to create simulation models with multi-stage SCs that include suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and consumers in order to replicate a more realistic situation. Furthermore, this model can be improved with more than one supplier and retailer to align the SC with reality.

In a highly complex industry, the generation of radical and incremental innovations is required. A culture of innovation in SMEs reconciles and integrates the attitudes and behaviors of reative people to respond to the demands of the aerospace industry. The key is to implement this type of culture by the management and encourage employee participation. The results show that organizational culture has a positive influence on innovation activities, which is consistent whit previous research (Tang et al., 2020; Lijauco et al., 2020; Dabić et al., 2019; Sánchez-Báez et al., 2019). The research has some limitations, first, the analysis focused only on SMEs dedicated AI. Medium and large companies were not taken for the study. Secondly, the study was applied in SMEs only in the state of Queretaro, there are other states that are developing innovation capabilities in Mexico. The third limitation, the sample size is relatively small to apply other types of analysis (for example, statistical analysis or quantitative models). Future research emerges from this study, it is feasible to apply the study in medium-sized, large enterprises and leading companies in the AI worldwide that are located in Mexico (for example, Bombardier, Safran, Airbus, Aernnova).

69,Reliability And Maintenance Optimization At A Saudi Glass  Production Plant,"the increase in automation due to the changing market and the expansion of product diversity has led to an increase in the demand for more sophisticated equipment. as a result, the dependability and maintainability of equipment have become critical in managing the quantity and quality of the products produced. therefore, preventive maintenance (pm) should be performed during the manufacturing process in order to ensure the stipulated reliability and dependability of the production process specifications. unscheduled pm, on the other hand, can have detrimental financial implications for the company, as well as a reduction in the overall production line reliability. this work considers a realistic multi-objective pm scheduling problem in a production line at a local saudi glass plant. the reliability of the production line, maintenance costs, and system downtime are measured as multiple objectives, and different thresholds are applied for the available budget and maintenance periods. the aim is to apply a mathematical model to maximize the system’s reliability and minimize overall costs. the results of the multi-objective model have shown a significant decrease in cost of about 12%.","reliability, maintainability, optimization, production","and Future Work In this article, we study production line systems and how to improve reliability and maintenance activities while decreasing maintenance costs. The reliability of the system in a production company is an essential factor in measuring the performance of any company. Therefore, in this work, quality improvement and reliability optimization approaches have been used to find the best maintenance policy for the given problem. The current work focused on a segment of a production line with a total number of 35 components in a local glass plant to implement our approach; in fact, we tried to cover different components with divergent quality and reliability characteristics to gain a better understanding of the reliability of the whole system. Mathematical optimization is the most common approach to designing the best possible outcome for industrial problems; indeed, that was the case for the current problem. In this work, a multi-objective PM scheduling problem is considered in a production line at a local Saudi glass plant. Reliability of the production line, maintenance costs, and system downtime are measured as multiple objectives, and different thresholds are applied for available budget and maintenance periods. It is found that applying a near-optimal preventive maintenance plan to the factory can reduce downtime and reduce unnecessary costs by at least 12%, resulting in about 400,000 SAR savings. For future work, genetic algorithms could be used to overcome the computational obstacles faced due to the size of the problem, especially if the problem grows in size by adding a higher number of components. Moreover, applying machine learning approaches, such as clustering techniques, is among future directions that would help overcome the computational burden of reliability optimization and maintenance scheduling problems. In addition, developing a stochastic nonlinear model with random adjustment and replacement times can also be one of the future directions of the current work.","meshary f. alsaif, fahad b. al-askar, and basem a. alkhaleel* department of industrial engineering king saud university riyadh 11421, saudi arabia balkhaleel@ksu.edu.sa","references with evolutionary algorithms.

70,Size Controlled Palladium Nanoparticles For Liquid Phase  Transfer Dehydrogenation Of Alcohols,"the transformation of alcohols to aldehydes or ketones is one of the most essential reactions in organic synthesis. an interesting alternative to aerobic conditions to produce oxygenated products, such as aldehydes and ketones, can be the dehydrogenation of alcohols under anaerobic conditions with the utilization of unsaturated organic molecules as hydrogen acceptors, instead of molecular oxygen. in this case, the oxidative dehydrogenation is changed to transfer dehydrogenation, which overcomes the safety limitations of aerobic oxidation. the influence of varying the stabilizer type (pva, pvp, and thpc) during the synthesis of palladium nanoparticles via sol-immobilization technique on the resulted particles, and their catalytic activity on the liquid phase transfer dehydrogenation of 1-phenylethanol (1-phet) has been investigated for the first time. the chemical composition and morphology of the fresh and used catalysts were determined using xrd, xps, bet, sem-edx, and tem. by evaluating the catalytic activity of the series of 1% pd/tio2 catalysts prepared using different pva/pd weight ratio, the results illustrate that two main parameters can mainly control the catalytic activity of 1% pd/tio2 in the liquid phase transfer dehydrogenation of 1-phet, these are pd(0)/pd(ii) ratio and the particle size of the catalyst. the results show that two different regimes can be identified during the liquid phase transfer dehydrogenation of 1-phet. at the initial time, the particle size parameter appears to control the catalytic performance of 1-phet while the effect of pd oxidation state starts to take place after reaching iso-conversion, where the percentage of pd(0)/pd(ii) increases while the reaction proceeds.","1-phenylethanol, palladium, nanoparticles",,"reem albilali assistant professor of physical chemistry, department of chemistry, college of science, imam abdulrahman bin faisal university, p.o. box 1982, dammam 31441, saudi arabia ralblali@iau.edu.sa",

The study also has some limitations. Despite being highly useful for firms and researchers, the study cannot be generalised because due to a smaller number of respondents and just a few representative sectors. The results could further be validated through an empirical study or case studies from various sectors. Based on the results, the study groups the factors in cause and effect. These factors can then be used to propose a model which can be quantitatively tested using structural equation Modelling and qualitatively verified using semi-structured interviews.","jaya priyadarshini, rajesh kumar singh management development institute gurgaon, haryana, india fpm21jaya_p@mdi.ac.in, rajesh.singh@mdi.ac.in",
72,Incremental Feature Selection And Interpretable Learning:  An Application For Glioma Grading And Detection,"this study presents a diagnostic framework for healthcare using explainable artificial intelligence and machine learning. previous studies show that the ability of prediction models greatly depends on the relevance and independence of the feature set. hence, various feature selection methods are presented in the literature. moreover, the previous medical diagnostic models using neural networks offer accurate predictions, however, without generating explicit decision rules. a novel research framework with incremental feature selection and interpretable machine learning is proposed. first non-redundant and relevant features are selected. further, the initial weights obtained during feature learning are fed to the interpretable neural network to obtain global and local explanations. this proposed research framework is demonstrated with an open-source medical dataset related to glioma, and the best-fit model is obtained. moreover, an app for glioma grading is developed with the underlying predictive model to offer decision support to physicians and patients.","medical diagnosis, feature selection, rappon","This study presents incremental feature selection and interpretable learning using neural network. The proposed framework is demonstrated using glioma dataset and the results are compared with the benchmark performance measures. It is found that the proposed method outperformed other feature selection methods, learners and their different combinations of these. This framework is applicable for performing prediction modelling in any problem domain. Future researchers can deploy this framework to solve prediction problems with varying number of dimensions and instances. However, the choice of the feature selection method should be based on the dimensionality and heterogeneity of the instances.

73,Revolutionizing Last-Mile Delivery: Integrating Social  Media And Deep Learning For Optimized Traffic Prediction,"effective traffic prediction is crucial due to a surge in deliveries by commerce and urbanization. this has led to a notable rise in traffic within megacities, causing route delays to the final destinations and countless vehicle accidents. e-commerce has been in a constant boom, as buying something online and having it delivered to the front door is easier than going to the store. as more people engage in this activity, e-commerce platforms' challenges are more complicated and need to be addressed faster. however, these challenges escape the delivery company's scope when external factors influence the objective of optimized deliveries, for example, traffic issues or bad weather during the last mile, issues that are only exacerbated where traffic sensors are not widely used (i.e., underdeveloped countries). the main contributions of this research are to (1) provide a contextual foundation of current frameworks used for traffic prediction, (2) use social media and multi-modal traffic-related data (weather, points of interest, calendar of events) by leveraging social network analysis to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction, and (3) to show a methodology that can be used for partially observed traffic. the proposed methodology includes deep learning tools like long-short term memory networks, attention mechanisms, graph convolutional networks, and social media tools like sentiment analysis.","social networks, deep learning",,"in e-commerce valeria laynes fiascunari, luis rabelo department of industrial engineering and management systems university of central florida orlando, florida, usa va584101@ucf.edu edgar gutiérrez-franco center for transportation and logistics massachusetts institute of technology cambridge, ma, usa",
74,Exploring Information System Disruptions In Government  Operations,"this study investigates the complex landscape of information system disruptions within government organizations, exploring challenges, opportunities, and their implications. organizations and information systems practices are still plagued by the high failure rates of information systems development (isd) projects. for many years, the information systems discipline has been deeply concerned about this situation, which has led information systems researchers to concentrate on and thoroughly investigate isd project failure. isd project failure scholarship is being challenged by the growing complexity and unpredictability of isd projects and modern system development procedures. in this paper, we pose the following questions: what are the strengths and shortcomings of the current body of literature on isd project failure and success? what directions might the isd literature go in the future? in order to address these issues, we first provide an overview of the literature that evaluates the contributions made by researchers within the three main schools of thought on isd failure: rationalist, process, and narrative. even if the current body of study from all angles adds a great deal to our understanding, we discover that researchers are still fixated on ""project failure"" as the culmination of an isd effort. when difficult circumstances arise during isd initiatives before they collapse, they pay little attention to them. we then make the case, based on the review and criticism of the literature, that it is highly advantageous to shift the focus of research from isd project failure to ""isd project distress,"" which we define as a detrimental project condition involving a dynamic and fluid constellation of critical issues that are challenging to recognize, comprehend, and address. isd project distress is a problem that is becoming more dangerous and significant, but little is known about its characteristics and possible remedies. drawing on the literature on sensemaking, the study recognizes the increasing reliance on information systems in modern governance and aims to comprehensively analyze the multifaceted impacts of disruptions on government operations. employing a mixed- method approach, the research combines qualitative insights from interviews and document analysis with quantitative data from surveys. the qualitative analysis uncovers common challenges such as employee resistance and technical complexities, while quantitative data quantifies the impact on government functions. findings reveal a spectrum of disruptions, ranging from data security concerns to innovative practices and opportunities for citizen-centric services. the research contributes to the field by offering actionable recommendations for government organizations, enhancing governance practices, and facilitating cross-border knowledge transfer. this study not only illuminates the intricacies of information system disruptions but also paves the way for informed strategies and policies in the evolving digital landscape of government operations.","information system, disruption","will serve as the foundation for developing sophisticated data security and privacy procedures inside government agencies. These steps are intended to lessen vulnerabilities and guarantee stringent data adherence. Government organizations are poised to leverage the opportunities identified in this research to introduce innovative practices and prioritize citizen-centric services. Innovation and Citizen-Centric Services The outcome is a shift toward more user-friendly and efficient services aligned with citizen expectations. The implications arising from this research are expected to inform policymakers and stimulate the development of responsive policies and governance frameworks. These policies will be designed to adapt to the ever-evolving nature of information system disruptions within government organizations. (Vishwanath & Barnett, 2011). The international and comparative perspectives embedded in this research are anticipated to facilitate cross-border knowledge transfer Cross-Border Knowledge Transfer. This knowledge transfer will enable government organizations across different countries to adapt and implement successful strategies for managing information system disruptions, leading to improved governance worldwide. 5.2 Validation The backdrop against which this research is framed is anchored in the ever-evolving landscape of information technology within government organizations. In recent decades, the reliance on information systems has experienced exponential growth as governments endeavor to harness technology for enhanced efficiency and transparency. However, this rapid integration of technology has concurrently given rise to disruptions, complications, and opportunities that warrant comprehensive examination. (Christensen, 2017). First and foremost, the rapid pace of technological advancement is a central driver of information system disruptions. The ceaseless evolution of technology necessitates perpetual adaptation within government organizations. Outdated legacy systems frequently necessitate replacement with new implementations, thereby disrupting established processes.

75,Selection Of An Artificial Intelligence Forecasting Approach  For Pv Panel Prices,"as the world moves towards renewable energy sources, solar energy is becoming more widely recognized. this impacts photovoltaic (pv) panel prices, which requires deeper analysis to shape strategic planning. this paper fills a gap in pv panel price forecasting by utilizing machine learning models for multivariate time series forecasting, offering a more robust, comprehensive, and adaptable approach. based on literature review, feature analysis, and linear regression, pv panel prices factors were identified, and data was collected. the dataset consists of 26 monthly time series features covering january 2018 to july 2023. the study's methodology consists of two phases: phase i involves applying machine learning models (cnn, knn, random forest, svr, xgboost) to forecast prices, resulting in the selection of the random forest model as the most effective based on performance metrics and comprehensive evaluations. phase ii utilizes the aforementioned model, along with forecasted features from the sarima model, to predict future pv panel prices. forecasts indicate a stabilized pv panel market for 36 months from july 2023, with slight price fluctuations. this stabilization hypothesis aligns with other research findings, suggesting industry agreement. as the solar industry is dynamic, regular market analyses and model calibrations are essential.overall, the research enhances the understanding of solar energy price time series forecasting, merging data gaps, and outlining pivotal price-influencing factors, offering stakeholders direction towards a sustainable energy future. recommendations include using a broader dataset, improving methodology, exploring more models, applying a hybrid model, and continually updating forecasting methods in alignment with industry dynamics.",february 12-14,", this paper analyzed and determined factors that influence PV panel prices, through literature review and correlation analysis. To refine the data, a feature analysis using linear regression optimized error loss. As a result, 26 features over 67 months were selected. Phase I: The study applied five machine learning models: CNN, KNN, Random Forest, SVR, XGBoost for multivariate time series forecasting. Each model underwent a detailed evaluation including actual vs. predicted graph analysis, various performance metrics (SMAPE, MAPE, MAE, RMSE, MSE, and Huber loss), and residual distribution analysis. All models showed impressive performance. Based on the comprehensive analysis conducted, Random Forest and XGBoost models emerge from the comparison of actual and predicted performance. Among the performance metrics, the Random Forest model performs best, with the lowest SMAPE and impressive RMSE, followed closely by the SVR model. Furthermore, residual distribution analysis demonstrates that Random Forest can effectively capture underlying patterns without introducing significant bias.While XGBoost, SVR, and other models were competitive in certain aspects and had specific strengths, the Random Forest model offers the best overall performance across multiple evaluation criteria and is most suitable for the given dataset and forecasting requirements due to its balanced performance. Phase II: Implementing the Random Forest model and integrating forecasted features from the SARIMA model, predictions indicate relative price stability in PV panels for the next 36 months starting July 2023. Although there are minor fluctuations in the predicted prices, these changes remain within a consistent range, indicating a stabilized market. The observation is further supported by comparable findings from an online platform and other research institutions, which indicate the industry is in agreement that prices will stabilize. Furthermore, the decline in PV panel prices, the narrowing price gap between products of different manufacturing tiers, and the ease of inventory pressures all point to a stabilizing market. However, the dynamic nature of the solar industry requires regular market analysis and model reassessments. Given that models like Random Forest rely heavily on recent data trends, periodic updates with new data are essential. This study provides insight into the complexities of solar energy time series price forecasting, bridging gaps in data and highlighting factors that influence PV panel prices. By integrating tailored machine learning models, the study also provides valuable insights for stakeholders, steering them towards a sustainable energy future. 6.3 Recommendations and Future Work In this study, 26 features have been analyzed for 67 months, which is a small sample size for time series forecasting. Therefore, using a larger dataset will enhance and improve forecasts. In which, instead of monthly data it would be more beneficial to use weekly, daily, or hourly datapoints. Data collection was limited due to the few available sites that give data for free. Therefore, it is advised to find a company or online source that gives valid data for a reasonable price. This will ensure a longer dataset. Also, expanding the study's geographical scope beyond China could offer a more comprehensive view of PV panel prices. 674","aisha alhosani department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, 127788, uae 100052398@ku.ac.ae saed amer faculty member, department of management science and engineering khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, 127788, uae saed.amer@ku.ac.ae andrei sleptchenko associate professor, department of management science and engineering khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, 127788, uae andrei.sleptchenko@ku.ac.ae","References

76,Ecosystem Of Goods And Value Creation  Eugene Hakizimana,"this paper investigates how the interconnectedness of goods within an ecosystem determines their values independently of the price system. while this aspect has roots in old classical economic theory, it has periodically been overlooked in the development of consumer theory. it draws inspiration from the assertions by m. douglas and b. isherwood that nothing possesses inherent value, and focuses on approaches of making correct choices by g. gigerenzer, as well as examples drawn from the marketing systems of supermarkets, superstores, hypermarkets, and mega malls, where a diverse array of products is made available to buyers. the findings of this study suggest that interconnected goods within an ecosystem establish standards of exchange-values that significantly contribute to consumer choice.","ecosystem of goods, exchange value, value creation","The work investigated how possess inherent intrinsic values and through the assemblage of goods in the market system, these values form an ecosystem of hierarchy of values that provide physical and visible statements to which affect customer choices. These representations help customers to make choices by using simple mental calculations that facilitate to order those complex hierarchy of values. This shows that goods are not neutral in the system of consumer choices. This conceptual consideration of goods helps to understand how goods are valuable which can help to achieve sustainable consumption. 6. Contribution The contribution of this work is as follows: • This paper helps to understand how goods are interconnected and form an ecosystem that determines values that can be referred to determine price system. To understand this process helps the analysis of value determination, pricing and choice decisions. • By understanding the functionality of this ecosystem, provides certainty in the consumer choices. • It contributes to sustainability development as it helps in attribution of real value to goods.

In response to the question of whether the marketing systems of supermarkets, superstores, hypermarkets, and mega 
malls provide a perception that aids in the mental calculation of product value, the survey results indicate that 37% of 
respondents agree with this statement. On the other hand, 20% disagree, 15% strongly agree, 14% are neutral, and 
14% strongly disagree. There seems to be a correlation with consumers who still strongly believe in the price system; 
however, a growing majority of consumers are recognizing that product networks, through the ecosystem of intrinsic 
values, play an essential role in consumer decisions (Figure 4).

79,Sustainability Of Second-Hand Fast Fashion: Sentiment And  Content Analysis On Consumer Attitudes On Social Media,"major fast fashion companies have recently launched resale platforms for second-hand shopping. although many experts consider these initiatives as a greenwashing strategy, it is unclear whether consumers agree with that or rather find such initiatives sustainable. thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine consumer attitudes towards the sustainability of second-hand fast fashion. accordingly, instagram reels and posts related to second-hand fast fashion are identified and all comments under those contents are extracted. next, these comments are analysed with a sentiment analysis and a content analysis. results show that consumers express more positive sentiments towards resale companies that ban fast fashion items than towards resale companies that specialize in fast fashion. comments referring to companies banning fast fashion resale show consumers’ predominant support of the ban, while companies doing fast fashion resale receive strong criticism on social media. consumers are specifically concerned about the quality of second-hand fast fashion items as well as express social and ethical concerns towards fast-fashion resale. the resulting practical implication is that companies should consider discontinuing second-hand fast fashion.","circular economy, pre-owned",,"nusrat jahan raka and stanislav chankov constructor university, bremen, germany nraka@constructor.university, schankov@constructor.university","References

81,Single Objective Functions In Location Routing Problems: A  Comparative Case Study,"this research explores the location routing problem (lrp), a complex np-hard problem that combines facility location and vehicle routing to minimize operational costs. the focus is on a variant of lrp with covering constraints. the primary objective is to investigate the impacts of different single-objective functions in lrps, contrasting the traditional approach of minimizing combined opening and transportation costs with objectives prioritizing either the minimization of the number of facilities or the total distance. a mixed-integer programming (mip) model is developed to analyze the effects of these objectives on facility location and routing efficiency. the methodology involves running the mip model under various objective functions and observing the changes in total distance and number of facilities, including the use of preemptive goal programming. results from small and large problem instances reveal that focusing on minimizing the number of facilities significantly reduces their count but increases the total travel distance. on the other hand, prioritizing distance minimization shows minimal distance reduction but a slight increase in the number of facilities compared with the traditional approach of minimizing combined opening and transportation costs, but this may be due to the proneness to the scale of data. a pareto analysis shows the trade-offs between these objectives. this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the importance of objective selection in lrps, offering valuable insights for decision-makers in adapting lrp strategies to specific operational priorities.",facility location,,"osama alotaik industrial engineering department king saud university riyadh, saudi arabia oalotaik@ksu.edu.sa","References

82,Assessing Centralized And Decentralized 3D Printing  Manufacturing: A Comparative Study Of Customer Demand,"3d printing (3dp) is a revolutionary manufacturing method that enables rapid prototyping, customization and local production of parts, hence reducing waste of resources. a new paradigm in the supply chain could be then realized by capitalizing on 3dp, that is: decentralized manufacturing, characterized by geographic dispersion and enhanced resilience to risks and disruptions, while also offering customers numerous benefits, including faster fulfilment of personalized orders. however, optimizing the allocation of customer demands is a complex challenge, especially in the context of decentralized 3dp shops operating under limited capacity constraints. by optimizing based on delivery distance, it is possible to reduce resource consumption and environmental impact while also shortening overall delivery time, thereby achieving better realization of the advantages of decentralized 3dp. this research firstly addresses the challenge of efficiently allocating customer demand to decentralized 3dp shops, optimizing delivery distances while considering capacity constraints by leveraging on mature mixed integer linear programming (milp) based 3dp optimization techniques and innovative combination with monte carlo simulation. furthermore, the study analyzes quantitatively and qualitatively the superior probability and difference in overall delivery distance between decentralized 3dp shops and hypothetical centralized 3dp hubs across various sub-scenarios with massive, randomized customer instances in the greater cairo region in egypt. through this research, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding on the advantages of decentralized 3dp on a much broader scale.",demand allocation,", idealized parameters, and insufficient consideration of 3DP specific variables and constraints as scheduling tasks, types of 3DP material and technology used. A hybrid system could also be devised to shift customers demand allocation to hubs when the 3DP facilities’ capacity is reached, altering between two systems. A more nuanced customer demand could thus be modeled as well. We also recommend the expansion of the model to include other variables such as carbon footprint, transportation costs, constraining the hub’s capacity, and proposing other hub locations. Finally, we suggest the replicability of our study by capitalizing on alternate algorithms on the same data set from Cairo, Egypt. Additionally, apply the established model and analysis parameters to different cities and datasets to enhance the findings as well as reaching a more generalized conclusion.","allocation and delivery distance optimization in egypt mohamed osman transport systems and logistics faculty of engineering university of duisburg-essen 47058 duisburg, germany email: mohamed.osman@stud.uni-due.de fengkai xu faculty of engineering university of duisburg-essen 47058 duisburg, germany email: xu.fengkai@stud.uni-due.de",

88,Optimization And Standardization Of The Sales Process In A  Service Sector Company Through Lean Tools,"lead times in the design and implementation of spaces in lima represent 42% of the causes of customer dissatisfaction in the sales process. therefore, the research focuses on the optimization of lead times, as they are usually very high in small companies (smes) and with non-standardized and therefore inefficient processes. a model is proposed that delineates a standardization plan for a process. initially, it is necessary to map the existing state of sales process, recommend a new mapping of the quotation process using value stream mapping (vsm), locate the critical path using pert-cpm, and identify the activity that is causing the greatest amount of process delay. to make the process of identifying standards simpler, data is then gathered and categorized. after standardizing the sales procedure and validating the proposal with arena simulator, the outcomes are assessed. a 20.26% reduction was obtained with respect to the total time of the sales process of the initial model. then, through the collection of non-consolidated data, it was possible to create a database with standardized items to make customer service more efficient completing two more projects in the same amount of time and reducing 6.26 days the average time of each project.the standardization of the sales process in the case study allows them to optimize and standardize it through a proposed model based on lean tools. furthermore, small and medium-sized businesses (smes) could adopt and adapt the application of lean service tools to identify their most inefficient processes.","standardization, lean service, services, interior design","of other studies. The project is specifically based on research on companies in the service sector that use process simulation to reduce processing times. According to Kusrini et al. (2019), there was a 16.25% decrease in uptime, i.e., 136.36 minutes less. Hidayati et al. (2019) have conducted a relevant study suggesting a new business process that decreases the number of activities from 21 to 14 and processing time from 8 to 4 days. Their findings show a staggering 50% decrease in total processing time. In comparison, our study shows a 20.26% reduction. The overlap between these investigations and ours reveals shared themes in the quest for process optimization in the service sector. Although each study takes a different approach, together they highlight the importance of streamlining tasks and shortening processing times. Based on these observations, our study contributes to a 20.26% reduction in process duration. Respect to the limitations that might emerge during the use of the suggested approach, staff members are needed for the duties of collecting and analyzing data as well as creating different standardization recommendations for the business. Employees must also receive training in order to guarantee teamwork and adherence to particular policies intended to achieve process uniformity, which is also known as a work philosophy. 831","alonso parodi and sergio montañez university of lima, industrial engineering career lima, peru 20181403@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20181220@aloe.ulima.edu.pe rafael chavez ugaz university of lima, faculty of engineering lima, perú rchavezu@ulima.edu.pe","References

90,A Hybrid Approach To Prescribe A Dynamic Operational  Location For Stationing A Delivery Truck Of Lpg Cylinder,"last mile delivery (lmd) relates to all product delivery activities to the end customer in the supply chain. timely delivery of products to customers is one of the primary objectives of businesses rendering lmd services. lpg cylinder distribution in india is one such business that provides lmd to its subscribed customers through delivery agents employed by distributors. as per the existing system, the cylinders are brought to the office premises from the warehouse using delivery trucks (dt) and are delivered to customers using small delivery vehicles (sdv). the orders delivered each day by the sdv exceed their stock holding capacity. so, sdv must reach the office location from the last delivered customer’s location to restock. this current practice of restocking increases the overall distance travelled by sdv and increases. further, this increases the delivery lead time, which directly affects customer satisfaction. to overcome these logistics issues in the existing system, this study proposes a dynamic operational location (dol) for stationing each dt around the area, where the delivery is going to happen each day, considering the customers ordering pattern, instead of all the dt stationed at the office premise. to prescribe dol for stationing each of the dt this study proposes a hybrid approach and does efficient lmd of lpg cylinders. the proposed hybrid approach involves a multi- step process. in the first step, a forecasting model is developed to analyze the customer’s order interval pattern and predict their next ordering date range (i.e., the next order interval). customers whose next ordering date range is within the next ten days from the decision-making epoch/date are segregated and clustered in the second step. the total number of clusters equals the total number of dt operated. in the final step, the centroid location of the generated cluster is prescribed as the dol to station a dt. based on the proposed dol for each dt, the sdv will stock the cylinders from the dt and proceed for lmd. the proposed hybrid approach is demonstrated using real-life data from a large-scale lpg cylinder distributor in a metro city in tamilnadu. accordingly, the dataset used for this study has the customer’s unique consumer numbers, geocoded addresses, and order placement dates for the past five years. using data pre-processing and feature engineering techniques, the ordering intervals for each customer are obtained, and a forecasting model is developed to predict the next order interval for each customer. customers’ geolocations with predicted ordering date range within the next ten days are clustered using the k-means clustering algorithm, and their centroid location is prescribed as dol for each dt. finally, both existing practice and the proposed hybrid approach for lmd are compared in terms of the distance travelled by an sdv in the current system with the proposed system.","lpg cylinder, last mile delivery, forecasting","This study has proposed a hybrid approach to prescribe the DOL for temporarily stationing the DT every day in the LMD of LPG cylinders. The hybrid approach has a machine learning-based forecasting model developed using the RFR algorithm, and a clustering model developed using the K-Means clustering algorithm. A data augmentation process called the sliding window technique was used to train the RFR forecasting model with the available small dataset. The forecasted order interval was adjusted with the model’s MAE to determine the ordering date range for each customer. The customers whose ordering date range falls within the next ten days from the decision-making date were segregated and clustered. The centroid location of each cluster was prescribed as DOL for each DT. The distance travelled by an SDV from the DOL prescribed by the proposed system was identified to be less than the distance travelled in current practice. The comparative study on various forecasting models like Exponential Smoothening, ARIMA model, and other regression-based machine learning models like the Regularised Linear Regression model, Support Vector Machine Regressor, and Multi Layer Perceptron are yet to be analyzed and is under progress of the research agenda towards the thesis/dissertation work of the first author of this study.","for efficient last mile delivery prithvirajan d and mathirajan m department of management studies indian institute of science bangalore 560012, india",

95,The Influence Of The Planning And Execution Mode On  Effective Infrastructure Delivery,"the twin principles of phase development and fragmentation, as execution models, have made a significant impact on effective infrastructure delivery. however, recent experience seems to negate these assertions. therefore, this research aims to evaluate how these two principles were used in the execution of two identical road projects, named project a and project b, and the impact of the following four factors on their execution, namely, the practice of phase development and fragmentation, contractor selection, project planning and management as well as the project funding system. the principles of ‘content analysis study’, a qualitative research strategy, were adopted as the research method. the findings revealed that project a was successful in the factors evaluated and the chosen phase was completed within schedule. in contrast, project b failed. this project initiated in 2006 was still a work in progress in 2023. the conclusion is that the purposive use of the principles and practice of phase development and fragmentation can facilitate effective project delivery.","fragmentation, phase development","The focus of this paper was to explore how the integration of the concept of phase development and fragmentation into the planning and execution of infrastructure projects impacts on the effectiveness of project delivery. Four common factors were evaluated in the execution of two identical road projects, one in South Africa and the other in Nigeria. The factors evaluated are the practice of phase development and fragmentation, contractor selection, project planning and management as well as the project funding system. The case study strategy of qualitative research was adopted, using the instrument of content analysis study to unearth the information in the projects’ archives. The synthesis of the information gathered enabled the researchers to understand the successes and challenges of the project and develop suitable themes for discussion. The research revealed that Project A was successful because the project planners and sponsors adopted the practice of ‘contextual’ phase development. The chosen phase was commensurate to the available funds; fragmented into smaller work packages, engaged suitably qualified contractors and an effective project management team. Project A was completed within schedule and at a reasonable cost. In contrast, the failures of Project B are the glaring lack of adequate planning, poorly defined phases, use of a single contractor, poor quality of work, low financial resources and a lack of continuity of governance. In a nutshell, when the principle and practice of purposive phase development and fragmentation is adopted in the development of capital infrastructure, it facilitates the use of quality multiple contractors, and the different components of the work are executed seamlessly and strategically coordinated, to achieve the objectives of the project. The result obtained using this concept in the execution of Project A is like the results obtained in an earlier research effort by Ogbeifun et al. (2018) on a building project. In conclusion, this research clearly shows that adopting the principles and practice of purposive phase development and fragmentation facilitates effective infrastructure delivery. Therefore, this research recommends that the concept of purposive phase and fragmentation should be adopted in the planning and execution of all infrastructure types.","edoghogho ogbeifun civil engineering department faculty of engineering university of jos edobunmi@gmail.com +2348181480266 jan-harm c. pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za +27(0)11 559 1730",

101,Exploring The Constraints Of Implementing Total Quality  Management In The Civil Engineering Consulting,"introducing total quality management (tqm) system in the operation of consulting and construction organizations could result in improved quality product, performance and enhance clients’ satisfaction. however, if the process is not implemented successfully, organizations do not reap the inherent benefits of adopting tqm. a civil engineering consulting company that specializes in structural engineering, transportation engineering, and water engineering introduced the tqm system in 2008, to improve its service delivery. inadvertently, after twelve years of operation, the intended improvements are not obvious. therefore, the focus of this study is to identify the constraints responsible for the non-functionality of the tqm system. the case study research strategy of qualitative research was adopted, the data collected using mixed methods involving online questionnaire, interviews, and document analysis. the findings identified factors responsible for the low functionality of the tqm system in the organization, namely, ineffective communication, lack of training on the use of the tqm system, absence of progressive monitoring, low commitment by senior management, unavailability of quality documentation, absence of quality management personnel and the low involvement of employees. the research concludes that the success or otherwise, in the implementation of the tqm system, is significantly influenced by participation of senior management of the organization, which requires paradigm shift and demonstrated commitment to the implementation of the system.","organization, senior management","The purpose of this research was to evaluate the level of understanding, use and identify the constraints to the effective implementation of the TQM operation in the Civil Engineering company, used for this research. The company introduced the TQM system in 2008, to improve its service delivery, retain its market share in the competitive environment and enhance customers’ satisfaction. The case study method of qualitative research was employed to execute this research exercise. The findings revealed that it does not appear that the objectives for introducing the quality system is being achieved, especially with the spate of reworks, high level of low-quality service delivery and many customers have expressed their low level of satisfaction. The constraints observed are, among others, the lack of effective communication, training, active involvement of the employees and the commitment of senior management, as factors critically impacting the effective implementation of the TQM system. Therefore, this research recommends that the senior management should lead the re-kindled interest in the implementation of the TQM system by: • Employing quality management personnel to midwife the operation, • ensure effective communication, • Implementing a progressive training programme for employees • Involving employees in the implementation process to enhance understanding of the system • Documenting all make accessible all procedures and policies. Since this research was conducted in a single organisation, efforts should be made to evaluate the effectiveness or otherwise of implementing similar quality measures in other civil engineering consulting organizations, in South Africa or else where in the world for effective comparison.","companies – a case study utloa, t m, ogbeifun e and pretorius j h c postgraduate school of engineering management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa utloathabo@gmail.com, edobunmi@gmail.com, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za",
102,Allocation Optimization Of An Electrical Vehicle Charging  Station Using Ant Colony Algorithm,"limited energy sourced from fossil fuels and world climate change is a challenge for energy security because the provision of adequate and affordable energy sources is imperative to support sustainable growth and development. in 2021, the largest energy consumption is in the transportation sector, which is or 33 percent of the total national energy consumption. world climate change and fluctuations in the cost of fossil energy make the demand for electric vehicles one of the alternative choices in driving with the reason to reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions. the purpose of this study is to develop a model based on ant colony algorithm to determine the number of charging stations and locate them that minimize total setup cost, namely the initial cost of developing and the total power capacity of prospective charging stations, index of active power reduction, reactive power loss reduction and voltage profile improvement, and the probability of electric vehicles arrivals using ant colony algorithms. objective functions are founded from weighting of function elements by analytical network process. the location of the study was carried out by applying a model to the real case, namely the trans java toll road section which is the longest and most populous toll road section in java, stretching between jakarta to surabaya, with a road length of about 1200 km and daily traffic density of 688,000 vehicles.","ahp, charging station, electric vehicle","In this study, we proposed a model based on ant colony algorithm to determine the number of charging stations and locate them that minimize total setup cost. The research benefits are to create a decision support system to assist decision-makers in making informed decisions on the determination of the optimal number of SPKLU needed as well as to ensure electric vehicle drivers experience safety and comfort, specifically along the Trans Java toll road. it is necessary to add a social cost component to make it more accurate.

103,Analysis Of The Working Conditions Of Paramedical Staff  In A Burn Unit Using The Ergonomic Approach,"the paramedical staff of the burn unit at an university hospital center requested the occupational health service to find a solution to the organizational constraints and health complaints that are leading to an increase in sick leave. to evaluate working conditions and health status, propose corrective measures, encourage management to provide appropriate solutions, and monitor the implementation and impact of proposed improvements. to complete this work, it seemed useful to propose an ergonomic intervention on the working conditions of paramedical staff by analyzing the work activity in the burn units and involving the concerned staff. the health status of the paramedical staff was assessed by reviewing the medical records. this study highlighted several organizational constraints, including the work carried out by nursing assistants and public health nurses outside the scope of competencies defined by law. the lack of paramedical staff, which can impact the health of these agents and therefore work stoppages. the observation also highlighted the age of the facility and equipment. all the constraints and problems observed during our study were discussed at a meeting with the hospital management. increasing staffing and a renovation or replacement project for the facility were the solutions proposed at the meeting. monitoring is essential to verify the implementation of these solutions. improving working conditions has a strong influence on the behavior of paramedical staff, their health, their work motivation, and consequently on the performance of the burn unit.","burn unit, ergonomics",,"n. chenouf , n. bensekhria , h.k. hassinet and w. benhassine occupational health service - chu of batna university of batna2, algeria",
104,Investigation And Analysis Of A Fatal Occupational Accident  N.Chenouf And W. Benhassine,"following the reporting of an occupational accident that occurred in a cement plant and resulted in the death of two workers during a cement unblocking operation, we conducted an investigation whose objective is to identify the causes and factors that led to the accident and prevent other possible accidents. the method used in analyzing the accident is the fault tree analysis conducted immediately after the accident. the facts were gathered concerning the individual, the task performed, the equipment used, and the work environment. the accident, which occurred two and a half hours (2:30) after the start of the shift, caused two victims who were buried under tons of cement. their activity consisted of almost manually removing the cement stuck to the walls of the silos. the fault tree analysis highlights factors related to the environment and tools. the individual factor, essentially linked to the professionalism and expertise of the construction manager, is also implicated. the occurrence of this accident has a multifactorial origin, particularly work organization and negligence of risks, and to avoid other accidents we favor evaluating situations before intervention and periodic maintenance of work facilities.","cement silos, cement unblocking","The occurrence of this accident has a multifactorial origin, notably the work organization, negligence of risks, and particularly the method used since it is inherently dangerous itself.

105,An Alternative Approach To Building Inspection Challenges  In South African Municipalities,building inspection plays a significant role in the construction of buildings of every country. just like any other industry building inspection has its own challenges. this paper firstly investigates the challenges of the current municipal inspection system and secondly determine an alternative approach to building inspections challenges in south african municipalities. this paper also gives recommendation on how to address the challenges faced by building inspectors. as an alternative approach to building inspection challenges in south africa. the study focused on assessing the challenges based on available literature and on user perspective to improve the building inspections within municipalities.,"building inspector, corruption, bribe","The significance goal of this study was to investigate the challenges of the current municipal inspection system and to determine an alternative approach that can be effective for building inspections. The reviewed literature showed that in the areas where building regulations are omitted may not necessarily be intentional as there is a possibility that the building inspector of that particular area may not understand the building regulations as a result of lack of knowledge of building inspections and building manuals. This may also be because of house owners or contractors who have no knowledge of how the municipality operate due to lack of workshops with house owners and contractors. Failure to orientate and induct new workers affect the productivity of workers as Martel, (2002) stated that, well- oriented worker is much capable of being productive for the company. On the other side, building regulations are omitted as a result of corruption by building inspector, this is done for self-benefit by either the inspector or contractor. Bribe is one of the leading form corruptions which most people are exposed to. Workers with low income have a character of being exposed to bribe and neglecting processes. Education is regarded important in a nation that seek to fight poverty, illiteracy and grow the economy. Lastly the act of corruption is evidence that building regulations are omitted. 5. Recommendation The primary goal of this study was to investigate the challenges of the current municipal inspection system which was affected by lack of understanding of building inspections, workshop, induction and orientation, corruption, bribery, income, education and negligence of building regulations. Determining an alternative approach to building inspections challenges in South African municipalities will mean that the following should be addressed in this manner. • The municipality should establish inspection classes for every inspector which shall then teach them more about building regulations and other instrument of knowledge that are relevant to building inspection to ensure that inspectors are familiar with the regulations and to encourage them to register with the council, this will also assist in mitigating negligence of building regulations. • Secondly the municipality needs to establish a culture of hosting workshops with the community to acquaint them with the municipality and how it operates. induction and orientation should be done do all new appointed workers in order to welcome them and to induct them on their roles. • Furthermore, a system of reporting corruption should establish in order to report and lay complains about the maltreatment, behaviour, bribes, professionalism, etc of that particular inspector. This will assist the municipality when making individual assessment and giving inductions to new employee’s. • In order to fight corruption a system of rotation between building inspector’s areas should be implemented so that building inspectors may not feel comfortable about one area of work and lastly after every final inspection, the chief building inspector should visit the site before issuing of certificate of occupancy. • Education should never be compromised when coming to selection criteria this will help to select applicants who have adequate knowledge of building inspection.","maphutha letsau khutso and morena william nkomo department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg, rsa letsaukhutso@gmail.com, mnkomo@uj.ac.za stephan molusiwa ramabodu department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg, rsa caigbavboa@uj.ac.za",

However, the logic in the diagram, mainly in the sensor control code, allowed us to observe a series of improvements and updates on the operation of the robot with the aim of having the highest possible efficiency. • The use of an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles on a water surface was an efficient option since ultrasonic waves can be reflected by objects present in the aquatic environment, providing information about the presence of obstacles. However, it is important to consider factors such as the propagation of ultrasonic waves in water, which can affect accuracy over greater distances. • Continuous optimization of detection algorithms and data processing techniques is essential to improving the accuracy and reliability of this model. Additionally, this two-dimensional water surface model may need to be integrated with other sensors to address specific limitations or improve the robustness of the system under different conditions.","two-dimensional modeling of aquatic surfaces based on obstacle detection and distance measurement using ultrasound diego cerna, bryan vega professional school of mechatronic engineering, engineering faculty ricardo palma university lima, mi 15039, peru 202110514@urp.edu.pe, 202110505@urp.edu.pe mario chauca engineering research for science and technology research group (erstech) ricardo palma university lima, mi 15039, peru mario.chauca@urp.edu.pe",
112,Identifying The Role Of Emulsion And Nano-Emulsion For  Predicting The Residual Heavy Oil Recovery,"the energy sector as well as daily needs of our day-to-day life depends majorly on the utilization of crude oil and its derived products. therefore, to overcome the basic demands it is mandatory to extract crude oil from existing matured reservoirs. in this work, we have investigated the mechanistic studies of emulsification as well as nano-emulsification and identifying their role on heavy residual oil recovery. the heavy was oil emulsified using surfactants and polymer which were stable up to 24 hours and this assists in improving the trapped residual oil displacement efficiency, thereby reducing the saturation of residual oil inside the reservoir. on the other hand, when nanoparticles were introduced in the same surfactant-polymer system, nano emulsions were observed whose stability were enhanced at a greater rate (up to days) and thus further assist in improved the residual oil recovery. it was observed that average size of the nano- emulsion in microns were smaller (with a greater number of droplets) as compared to emulsion. this phenomenon thereby enhances the stability period and diverts the displacing fluid to cover more area of the reservoirs resulting in higher oil recovery due to higher sweep efficiency. moreover, core flooding experiments conducted showed an oil recovery of 18% (residual oil in place, riop) and was enhanced to 26% riop when nanoparticles were deployed in the system.","emulsion, nano-emulsion, stability, core flooding",The current work compares and demonstrate the potential of emulsion induced by surfactant and nano-emulsion formed using surfactant – nanoparticle towards oil recovery factor.

In fact, we propose that we have to satisfy a random demand distributed over periods in a finite horizon. It is possible to satisfy the demand by using one of two types of raw material (Aluminum and Steel), which differ in terms of their physical characteristics. This difference has an impact on several economic and technical aspects, such as the cost of the raw material, the stocks of the finished product, the recycling costs, the cutting speed and the energy consumption. It is easy to see that there is a relationship between these aspects. The impact of these aspects and their relationship are taken into account when drawing up an economic plan. The production plan is based on the best combination between the two types of raw materials (Aluminum and Steel); that is, we determine the duration of two sub-periods. (for Aluminum ∆𝑡𝑡𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴(𝑝𝑝) and for Steel ∆𝑡𝑡𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆(𝑝𝑝) for each period over the finite horizon. These sub-periods are determined by minimizing a total cost integrating production, energy consumption, inventory and raw material acquisition.

118,Design And Fabrication Of Multi-Functional Fixture With  Experimental Case Studies,"a general practice in manufacturing industry, especially in machine shops, is to design and develop a dedicated jig or fixture for a single operation. the scope of dedicated fixturing has become challenging due to the need of improvisation of adjustability as well as to incorporate a range of production operations. usually, few machining operations are performed on conventional fixtures i.e. vices for the rectangular work parts, and additional attachments are used to incorporate cylindrical work which increase the workholding time, the cost as well as the limitation of variability of dimensions. furthermore, if the size of the work is small (slender or thin sheets) then it imposes the difficulty in fixturing. to perform several manufacturing operations (machining, joining, and welding etc.) on prismatic as well as cylindrical parts, each operation needs to have a dedicated fixture which may not be useable for a new part or the part with varying dimensions. these fixturing issues are addressed through the use of modular kits or custom cnc machined. there are many simple applications, especially in case of light duty manufacturing operations like riveting, adhesive bonding, and inspection of machined features etc. in simple applications the use of modular kits and specialized fixtures are not the preferred choice with respect to economic reasons. therefore, a multi- purpose fixture has been designed and presented in this study. the fixture design is verified through the fabrication of its parts and their assembly. the applicability and repeatability of the multi-functional fixture is validated through different experimental case studies including the inspection of hole quality, examination of microstructure through mini-microscope, drilling, and milling operations.","drilling, welding, milling, quality inspection","The aim of this design oriented research is to address the need and use of a multi-purpose fixture. Based on the fixture design, fabrication, analysis of degree of freedom, the application areas of the fixture, and validation through experimental case studies, the following conclusions can be inferred: 1. The fixture can be used to appropriately locate, position, and/or clamp variety of workpiece forms and sizes such as circular and non-circular profiled parts (square, rectangular, triangular, hexagonal, and other polygons). 2. The designed fixture can be manufactured through conventional machining processes and with the use of standards fasteners. 3. The fixture offers all the required degrees of freedom (along all the three Cartesian axis as well as rotation) to locate, position, and clamp the work parts. 4. The fixture can be used for variety of manufacturing, machining, and quality inspection processes such as:  Milling operations including side milling, slab milling, and face milling  Drilling and boring operations to machine holes in cylindrical as well as non-cylindrical parts 1093","naveed ahmed industrial engineering department, college of engineering and architecture, alyamamah university, riyadh-11512, saudi arabia n_ahmed@yu.edu.sa","References

119,Assessment Of Ionizing Radiation Exposure Risk And Health  Implications For Orthopedic Operating Room Personnel,"introduction: interventional radiology procedures conducted on a daily basis in orthopedic operating theaters often fail to provide adequate protection for those involved. issues and objectives: the case of mr. zr, a 40-year-old anesthetist working in the orthopedic block, has raised concerns about potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation sources (ir). although this risk is not explicitly listed as an occupational hazard in table 6, we believe that a comprehensive survey is necessary to assess exposure levels and identify any similar cases. method: our investigation involved a two-fold approach, consisting of a desk study that analyzed the activities in the orthopedic block, and an exceptional periodic survey of all staff members who were exposed to ir in the operating theaters. results: the survey revealed that surgical staff were at risk of ir exposure due to the use of the ""scopy"" in surgical procedures. personal protective measures were insufficient, as the number of exposed caregivers outweighed the measures that were in place. furthermore, other protective measures were notably absent. the medical examinations of the operating room staff showed that 65% of them had pathologies commonly associated with ir exposure, including hypochromic microcytic anemia, thrombocytosis, thyroiditis, nodular thyroid gland, and a case of bilateral cataract. one anesthetist was even diagnosed with thyroid cancer, which prompted this analysis. conclusion: establishing a definitive causal relationship between the encountered pathologies and the emitted ir in the orthopedic block presents significant challenges. nonetheless, our investigation highlights the importance of conducting comprehensive surveys to assess the potential risks associated with ir exposure in orthopedic operating theaters.","ionizing radiation, orthopedic block",,"bensekhria nardjesse assistant professor in occupational medecine faculty of medecine university of batna 2 fesdis, batna, algeria n.bensekhria@univ-batna2.dz wissal benhassine professor in occupational medecine faculty of medecine university of batna 2 fesdis, batna, algeria w.benhasine@univ-batna2.dz",
120,Integration Between Pmbok 7Th Concepts: A Network  Analysis,"pmbok is a globally widely used guideline for project management. the release of the last version of this framework (the seventh edition) has been motivated by the rapid evolution of technology, new methodologies, swift market transitions, and significant transformations in the professional realm. the 7th edition has been revamped to accommodate these dynamic shifts, aiming to foster proactivity, innovation, and agility. it encompasses various development methodologies, from predictive to hybrid, and offers a dedicated section on customizing approaches and processes. the 7th edition further expands its toolkit by including the “models, methods, and artifacts” segment, emphasizing project outcomes and deliverables. another relevant change in this version is the transition from a hierarchical decomposition of pm knowledge to a comprehensive principles-based approach comprising eight performance domains: stakeholders, team, life-cycle, planning, project work, delivery, measurement, and uncertainty. in order to assess the structure and interrelationship between pmbok 7th components, they are modeled, measured, and analyzed in this paper using the social network analysis (sna) tool. sna is a technique that supports predicting the structure of an entity’s group using graph theory and mathematical indicators. the results confirmed that all pmbok 7th components are linked in different intensity levels. this research seeks to be a management tool for project managers and organizational analysts, giving quantitative support for effective organizational design and implementation.","project management, network analysis, pmbok 7, system modeling","The proposed model allows to understand and have a clear vision of the project management process inside the company and its relationships. From the network analysis performed during the creation of Artifact 1: PMBOK graph model was possible to identify that the planning performance domain plays an important role in project management, given that it has 138 connections, demonstrating great influence on the other PM components. As a result, this research suggest to pay special attention to the planning processes during the modelling and assessment stages of the framework. Moreover, the network analysis confirmed that PMBOK7 concepts act as a system, since the metric “Connected components” have value equal to 1, which shows that all concepts make an interconnected block. This fact highlights that project management process are interconnected confirm that is crucial to a have systemic view of the company’s process. 6.","luisa zambrano, edison atencio, costanza mariani and mauro mancini department of management, economics and industrial engineering politecnico di milano via lambruschini 4b, bovisa, 20156 milan, italy luisafernanda.zambrano@mail.polimi.it, costanza.mariani@polimi.it, edisonpatricio.atencio@polimi.it, mauro.mancini@polimi.it edison atencio department of civil engineering pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso av. brasil 2147, 2340000, valparaíso, chile edison.atencio@pucv.cl",
121,An Enterprise Architecture Approach To Digital  Transformation In Small And Medium-Sized Construction,"this paper addresses the critical issue of digital transformation in the construction industry, a key component of the global economy and an area lagging in adopting industry 4.0 technologies. despite the recognized need for digitalization to enhance profitability and performance, small and medium construction enterprises (smes) face barriers such as lack of support, standards, awareness, high costs, and significant workflow changes. the research introduces a system-oriented framework based on enterprise architecture and social network analysis graph models to counter these challenges. this framework aids construction smes in assessing their current processes and determining the best digital solutions to meet their specific needs. the effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through a case study in a colombian construction sme in the oil and gas sector, showing significant improvements in construction planning and design processes through the adoption of digital technologies. this study provides a practical approach for smes in the construction sector to navigate their digital transformation journey.","project management, network analysis, pmbok 7, system modeling",,"companies luisa zambrano, edison atencio, costanza mariani and mauro mancini department of management, economics and industrial engineering politecnico di milano via lambruschini 4b, bovisa, 20156 milan, italy luisafernanda.zambrano@mail.polimi.it, costanza.mariani@polimi.it, edisonpatricio.atencio@polimi.it, mauro.mancini@polimi.it edison atencio department of civil engineering pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso av. brasil 2147, 2340000, valparaíso, chile edison.atencio@pucv.cl","References

122,Millet Thali (Food Basket) For Transforming Nutrition  Intake,"sustainable development goals (sdgs) are a set of 17 interrelated goals adopted by the united nations (un) for a better and sustainable future for all. one of the sdgs, sdg 2, relates to achieving food security, and improved nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture. millets are a group of small seeded grasses rich in different nutrients, micronutrients and minerals. apart from many types, finger millet, pearl millet, foxtail millet, barnyard millet, proso millet, kodo millet, and sorghum are the most important ones grown worldwide. millets can contribute to dietary diversity and promote sustainability. the objective of this research has been to identify an optimal combination of intake food items to satisfy the daily nutritional requirements by including millets. this research uses a modified form of the classic diet problem. using this mathematical model, an optimal combination of food items to be included in daily meal is found out. apart from satisfying the nutritional need optimally, this research also takes into consideration to include the dietary preference of people. after solving for multiple scenarios, it has been concluded that that daily recommended dietary allowance (rda) cannot be fulfilled without including millets in the meal. millets can have transforming impact on the nutritional intake of people and they can be highly beneficial in combating dietary nutrient deficiency. key words millets, food basket, meal planning, and operations research 1. introduction millet are small-seeded grasses, which have a usage history spanning thousands of years. millets are classified into major and minor millets. sorghum (sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (pennisetum glaucum), and finger millet (eleusine coracana) are the major millets. besides major millets, there are numerous minor millets available locally in various regions of the world. millets have been regarded as a dietary staple in numerous regions across africa and asia. they are now gaining widespread acknowledgment globally due to their remarkable health advantages and adaptability in contemporary diets. these grains are nutrient powerhouses, containing vital elements like iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, 14thannual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management dubai, united arab emirates (uae), february 12-14, 2024 publisher: ieom society internaɵonal, usa published: february 12, 2024 doi: 10.46254/an14.20240281 1122",,"Millets have huge potential for improving the nutrition quotient of food intake while simultaneously being sustainable to produce. The model was used to identify the optimal combination of food items to be included in daily meals so that RDA values are met successfully. However, with the acceptance of such a combination of food items, it is important to prepare palatable meals using that combination. To be able to do that, more food items as per the availability and preferences of consumers can be added in the model. Consideration of more food items in the food basket can lead to a more acceptable combination. Another possibility is to explore the optimality of the solution for different time frames. There is a possibility to use the results of this research for planning government programs for the eradication of malnutrition and ensuring nutrition amongst vulnerable populations in various parts of the world.

123,Risk Profile Classification And Premiums Estimation In  Property Lines Insurance: A Multinomial Regression,"the notion of risk exists in every aspect of the business, as it cannot be eliminated but rather reduced to an attainable level through the utilization of effective risk management techniques. for the insurance industry in particular, risk is traded and transferred to the insurance providers as the company offers a shield from the exposure to risk consequences and the likelihood of loss, therefore, escalating the risk from the insured entity to the insurer for a given premium. this research is a development on a previously published paper by the author which had focused on the same issue but with the utilization of binary regression. the paper now proposes a modern model to risk classification which will be used for property lines insurance. the significance of the research lies in the fact that the process of risk prediction can be extremely complex since there are many parameters to keep in mind. in addition, accurate premium pricing can be difficult to estimate given the unpredictability of the risks occurring to the covered property. the data will be categorized into “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d” using multinomial regression followed by a pricing model. the proposed model will be validated via data collected from surveyed properties of a uae based insurance company. the model is expected to serve as a tool that helps provide better estimates of risk, premiums, and precise pricing.","insurance, machine learning, for this paper","In conclusion, risk is a factor that will continue to exist in every aspect of life as it cannot be excluded completely, especially in the business industry. However, with application of the right risk assessment techniques, it can be reduced to an acceptable level and have a minimal impact on the financial status of the business. The accuracy of risk predicted can in fact be enhanced by implementing machine learning and big data analysis (Jung et al., 2022). For the insurance industry, risk is often transferred from the insured client to the insurance provider for a given amount of premium that is specified for the respective duration of cover. Insurance companies provide a financial shield to the insured and transfer the liability to the company, therefore protecting the client from the likelihood and magnitude of a loss. This research is a continuation of a previously published paper (Abdallah, R.A & Dalalah, D., 2022) which focused on binary logistic regression, hence this particular paper has developed to include multinomial regression to predict and classify risks. Multinomial regression model has been developed for the purpose of predicting and classifying risks into various categories. Moreover, a new model for pricing has been suggested in this thesis for the purpose of 1141","approach reem adel abdallah department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah 27272, united arab emirates","References

125,Exploring The Capacity Of Engineers To Perform The Capital  Budgeting Function Effectively,"the primary goal of manufacturing industries is to maximise profit. this informs their choice of suitable investment projects. however, the capacity and capabilities of the personnel charged with the responsibility of advising the organisation significantly to influence the quality and profitability of the investment project. in many manufacturing industries, engineers play prominent roles in the different units of the industry, including capital budgeting. but does their basic training, as engineers, adequately prepare them for this function? the case study research strategy was adopted, using mixed methods for data collection and analysis, correlating the results with suitable statistical tools. the findings revealed that most of the engineers in the business unit perform capital budgeting using the most elementary tools. to improve their proficiency, engineers require progressive training in business and financial studies. therefore, the researchers recommend periodic and progressive training programmes for engineers, as well as integrating the engineering staff with other personnel from the business and financial professions in the business unit of the organisation.","capital budgeting, engineers","Capital budgeting as an important tool for effective investment decision-making, is given considerable attention by manufacturing industries. The capital budgeting process is executed by the in-house personnel of an organisation or through an outsourced service of specialist consultants. If in-house personnel are to be used, it is imperative to ensure that the personnel have the capacity and capability to perform the functions adequately. Over the years, several studies have been done on capital budgeting practices in different industries worldwide. However, there was little focus on engineers performing the task of capital budgeting in manufacturing industries, especially in South Africa. Therefore, this research explored the understanding and use of capital budgeting practices by engineers working in a South African petrochemical industry. To achieve the aim and objectives of this research, appropriate questions were developed and included in the survey questions to elicit responses from participants. The demographic information indicated that the respondents were aptly qualified and had provided useful responses to the survey questions. The analysis of results and discussion of the research findings provided sufficient information on how the aim and objectives of the research were achieved. In conclusion, the research established that engineers in this South African petrochemical industry have a good understanding and use of some of the basic tools for capital budgeting but do not possess the required proficiency for the use of the technically complex tools most suitable for investment decisions. However, they seem comfortable with the use of the NPV, IRR and payback period methods and have the potential to improve their proficiency in the use of multiple or complex tools through short- to medium-term training sessions. This was true for personnel with business and finance qualifications who work alongside these engineers in the same unit or recirculate the engineers around other units in the industry. As this research was conducted in one unit of a petrochemical industry in South Africa, the research findings cannot be adopted for general use without appropriate contextualisation. Therefore, this research recommends that this exercise should be expanded to cover more units in the same industry and include other petrochemical industries in South Africa to elicit more information for wider use in the Southern African sub-region. To improve their proficiency, engineers require progressive training in business and financial studies. The researchers consequently recommend periodic and progressive training programmes for the engineers, as well as providing the staff with other training from 1152","afia amoa-mensah, edoghogho ogbeifun and jan-harm c. pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg south africa afiamoa@gmail.com, edobunmi@gmail.com, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za","References

126,The Impact Of Sales And Operations Planning Practices On  Manufacturing Operational Performance In A South African,"the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of sales and operations planning processes on production operational efficiency at the organization. the objective of the paper was to examine the extent to which sales and operations planning practices enhance efficiency, the relationship between operations performance and sales planning, and how sales and operations planning can assist the organization in addressing factors that lead to ineffective efficiency. a quantitative research technique was used to collect data for this research, the data was analysed using a descriptive method. the sales and operations planning practices literature were reviewed and the results of the data obtained from the organization employees/participants were presented. the results of the study demonstrated that sales and operations planning (s&op) incorporates all the procedures that connect the organisation's strategic goals with its production process. the influence of sales and operations planning procedures on operational performance were consistently and effectively demonstrated on the organization’s operational characteristics such as quality, delivery, stock, and flexibility.","sales, manufacturing","Manufacturing organizations utilizing sales and operations planning (S&OP) processes often face challenges by overcomplicating the process, especially regarding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Attempting to monitor numerous aspects of supply and demand may render planning ineffective, leading to oversight of departmental visibility. Instead, organizations should focus on identifying crucial KPIs that genuinely assess the collaboration and performance of various departments. S&OP is a continuous process that relies on learning from past failures, emphasizing the need for comprehensive documentation of previous plans and practices.Cross-organizational collaboration forms the foundation of successful sales and operations planning. Involving stakeholders from all aspects of the business during the planning stage is essential for effectiveness. Neglecting divisions like operations and finance while prioritizing only the sales department can undermine the utility of the S&OP process. Investing in S&OP resources facilitates accurate alignment of demand and supply aspects, fostering a cohesive and productive organizational environment. The study had four research objectives. The first objective aimed to assess the impact of sales and operations planning practices on operational performance. The findings indicated that these practices contribute significantly to managing consumer demand and maintaining operational capabilities, providing a consistent set of numbers for strategic, tactical, and operational planning. Notable benefits included improved labour productivity, service delivery, reduced material costs, fixed cost optimization, enhanced promotional effectiveness, and finished goods inventory reduction. The second objective sought to establish the relationship between operational performance and sales planning. Results showed a positive correlation, emphasizing the pivotal role of effective sales and operational planning in manufacturing operational success. Planning, especially through sales and operations planning, enables organizations to assess their market position and proactively address supply chain and demand issues. The third objective aimed to identify factors leading to poor operational performance and how sales and operations planning practices address these issues. Findings underscored that inadequate production procedures, redundancy, poor planning, complicated processes, and inefficient resource allocation contribute to poor performance. Sales and operations planning enhances internal visibility, enabling better product management, promotion scheduling, and inventory control. It mitigates inefficiencies stemming from wasted resources, overproduction, and suboptimal customer service. The fourth objective focused on making recommendations based on sales and operations planning processes to enhance organizational efficiency and effectiveness. Recommendations included regularly reviewing organizational performance against business goals, involving input from all levels, prioritizing improvement areas, and developing action plans with deadlines. The study emphasized the necessity of patience in mastering sales and operations planning for consistent growth, development, and stability. 1161","company khathutshelo mushavhanamadi and lebogang margret seopela faculty of engineering and built environment department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg, south africa kmushavhanamadi@uj.ac.za, lebogangmargret5@gmail.com","References

128,Modeling The Impact Of Sitting Posture And Duration On The  Health And Safety Of Remote Learning,"this study investigates the effect of sitting posture on the back health of students involved in remote work. jack® human simulation software was employed to measure the impact of different seated postures on the lower back region, specifically the lumbar spine. the analysis focused on common positions adopted during extended work periods: neutral (posture 1), flexion (posture 2) and extension (posture 3). three tests were conducted in the simulated environment to predict the forces exerted on the musculoskeletal system, which are lower back analysis (lba), comfort analysis, and ovako working posture analysis system (owas). the results revealed that posture 2 exhibited the highest compression force and is the least comfortable in terms of joint angles compared to the other postures while posture 3 is the least comfortable in terms of body parts. furthermore, the musculoskeletal loading associated with working in postures 2 and 3 does not reach excessive levels, however it is required to provide ergonomic improvements. this paper also proposes strategies to enhance the working postures of university students.","sitting posture, jack software","In summary, this study successfully achieved its objectives of measuring and analysing the effects of various sitting postures usually observed among students working from home. The investigation utilized Jack® human simulation software to assess the impact of different seated positions on the lower back muscles. The findings notably highlighted Posture 2 (flexion) as having the largest L4/L5 forces and highest discomfort levels, despite being the most observed posture by students. Moreover, sitting in a posture with forward or backward bend may cause harmful effects on the spine alignment. Lastly, evidence-based recommendations to improve the ergonomic aspects of remote learning environments have been formulated based on the study's outcomes.","louai maghrabi, mariam mohammed and alia alaydaroos msc. students mechanical engineering department khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, united arab emirates 100061897@ku.ac.ae, 100052366@ku.ac.ae, 100061893@ku.ac.ae maryam almarzooqi msc. student biomedical engineering department khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, united arab emirates 100044445@ku.ac.ae yasmina alseksek msc. students chemical engineering department khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, united arab emirates 100062571@ku.ac.ae dr. saed amer faculty member industrial and systems engineering department khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, united arab emirates saed.amer@ku.ac.ae",
129,Milp And Cp Models For The Blocking Hybrid Flow Shop  Sequence Dependent Group Scheduling Problems,"hybrid flow shop sequence dependent group scheduling (hfsdgs) problems gathered much attention from researchers in recent years. but, the combination of blocking constraints and group technology (gt) principles in the hybrid flow shop (hfs) configuration has not been extensively treated by academics as it must. in the present work, we aim to contribute to the hfsdgs literature through two new mixed integer linear programming (milp) models for minimizing makespan of the blocking hfsdgs problem. also we define two new constraint programming (cp) based models. experimental studies are conducted in our studies to compare the performances of the new models with other models dealing with the same problem. when dealing with problems with small sizes, the cp models show some promising results so we intend to extend the studies to medium and large sizes instances. whenever grouping technologies gt principles are applied in scheduling activities, a group scheduling (gs) problem arises. so we consider both sub-problems: arrangement of groups and the arrangement of jobs within the group. jobs belonging to the same group are processed on the same machine sequentially with no interruption by jobs of other groups. a setup is required each time we switch from one group to the next one. since the flow shop has no intermediate buffers, the blocking constraints arise: a job, which is completed the processing of its operation on one machine, cannot leave it until the next machine belonging to the next stage is idle. the objective is to minimize the completion time of the last job belonging to the last group of the sequence.",blocking,,"ahmed boulahoual and khalid benhida lapssii, est de safi, university cadi ayyad, morroco a.boulahoual@yahoo.com, k.benhida@gmail.com",

131,The Impacts Of Increasing Treatment Uptake Rate Of  Hepatitis C Virus Infection In Indian Punjab On Some,"health economic studies for making decisions on disease management interventions usually focus on evaluating cost- effectiveness or net monetary benefits of the interventions. but there can be other societal benefits of these interventions which can motivate policymakers to adopt them. our disease of interest is hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, which causes more deaths than hiv infection in india. in advanced stages, the only cure is liver transplantation whose costs are more than ten times of india’s annual per-capita income. indian punjab has a high hcv prevalence of 3.6% and is also struggling with the menace of injecting drug use which is a major contributor to hcv spread. in early stages of hcv infection, injecting drug users (idus) might not know of their infection status; thus, increasing screening and treatment uptake can lead to more idus leaving the practice. nearly 75% of the injecting drug users in punjab are below 30 years of age, and as most people in the state are also below this age, the risk of infection in young people becomes a concern for economic productivity and life expectancy- the latter becomes enhanced for young individuals as hcv is a slowly progressing disease and while the lifespans of older people are not expected to be affected significantly, reduction in the lifespans of younger people can be significant if not treated. the most effective standard-of-treatment is directly-acting antivirals (daas). models assessing impacts of daas in the indian context have neither incorporated hcv transmission nor evaluated impacts on important societal parameters like age structure of infected patients, idu prevalence, contribution of hcv to overall mortality and liver transplants needed. we developed an agent-based simulation for modelling hcv transmission in an open cohort. we modelled disease progression using a widely used discrete-time markov chain. the model was calibrated and validated after execution over a fifty-year period; then we added a treatment component where infected individuals were treated at the end of every year for a ten-year period to achieve a targeted treatment uptake rate. the experiments were carried out for five uptake rates- 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% of all infected agents. by increasing the uptake rate from 10% to 90%, we observed the following trends in parameter estimates (reported as means of three replications, with respective standard deviations inside parentheses): 14thannual international conference on industrial engineering and operations management dubai, united arab emirates (uae), february 12-14, 2024 publisher: ieom society international, usa published: february 12, 2024 doi: 10.46254/an14.20240291 1187",,,"important societal parameters soham das ph.d. student, department of mechanical engineering indian institute of technology delhi hauz khas new delhi-110016, delhi, india mez198426@mech..iitd.ac.in varun ramamohan associate professor, department of mechanical engineering indian institute of technology delhi hauz khas new delhi-110016, delhi, india varunr@mech..iitd.ac.in",
132,"A Systematic Literature Review: Exploring Healthcare  Supply Chain Risk Management, Resiliency And Future","this paper reports the findings of a systematic literature review examining supply chain risk management (scrm) and resilience in healthcare supply chains. the review used thematic analysis (manually constructed themes with the help of each article's highlights to identify shared insights and trends across the literature.)to identify trends and gaps within the existing literature. the findings reveal three critical research gaps in the literature. firstly, there needs to be more research on rural healthcare supply chains despite ample studies on innovations and data sharing for enhancing supply chain resilience. this underscores a research gap in understanding the unique challenges rural healthcare settings face. secondly, the potential of a.i. algorithm-based systems in enhancing supply chain resilience in healthcare remains underexplored, indicating a need to explore the role of a.i. in healthcare supply chains. finally, integrating supply chain management with lean six sigma practices for enhancing supply chain resilience requires more research for broader industry applications despite its theoretical importance. the study also identified vital thematic areas crucial to enhancing supply chain resilience in healthcare settings, such as technology, innovation, data sharing, lean six sigma, supply chain management, and a.i. algorithm-based systems. identifying these themes provides a foundation for future research and practical implications for healthcare organizations to adapt to unexpected disruptions and improve their supply chain resilience.","supply chain, risk, network",", the validation process of the paper was conducted with a high level of rigour and accuracy, drawing on reputable journals' peer-review processes and extensive quality checks to ensure the research's validity. 6. Conclusion After an in-depth analysis of the existing literature on SCRM and its resiliency, and through a constructed thematic analysis, this research concludes that while considerable research work has been performed on technology, innovation, and data sharing and visibility, mostly led in urban areas; limited articles investigate the H.C. of rural areas. Despite the involvement of technology in healthcare supply chains, there is still a lack of detailed research on the role of A.I. algorithm-based systems in H.C. Moreover, while there is significant research on the benefits of supply chain management and Lean Six Sigma separately, there is limited research exploring how integrating these two management practices can improve the resilience of supply chains in the healthcare industry. Consequently, the potential of supply chain-lean Six Sigma practices to enhance supply chain resilience in healthcare is yet to be well- documented in research articles. Future research should focus on filling these gaps in knowledge. There is a need to explore how AI-based systems can contribute to improving SCRM resiliency, especially in rural areas that could benefit from cost-effective and innovative technology solutions. There is also a need to explore the potential of integrating supply chain management and lean Six Sigma principles as a way to improve the resilience of healthcare supply chains, optimize their operations in the face of unexpected disruptions, and improve overall healthcare outcomes. Addressing these gaps in research could lead to the development of innovative and effective strategies for healthcare organizations to mitigate risks, improve SCRM resiliency, and prepare for unexpected disruptions like COVID-19, enhancing the resilience of healthcare supply chains in the long run.

133,Enhancing Process Industry Safety: Optimizing Safety  Barrier Allocation To Prevent Domino Effects In Chemical,"the domino effect in the oil and gas industry can be attributed to the persistent need to store, transport, and process hazardous materials in equipment or storage facilities in close proximity to optimize operational efficiency and economic viability. natural occurrences, such as floods, earthquakes, and typhoons, can also act as initiating factors for domino effects. in our current work, we have developed an enhanced model to optimize the allocation of safety barriers for stopping or delaying domino impacts in chemical plants. mixed integer programming (mip) is used to solve the optimal barrier allocation problem. the solution approach provides information on the minimum propagation times of various fire paths associated with all possible accident scenarios, which is directly related to the location of the selected safety barriers. furthermore, the current work introduces a pioneering approach to barrier allocation based on nodes rather than the traditional focus on arcs. as a case study, the developed model simulates the shibushi storage base in japan, comprising forty-three oil storage tanks. the model provides a fast and effective solution to allocating safety barriers around the storage tanks within the allocated budget constraints.","domino effect, chemical plants","A comprehensive mathematical model is developed using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) to improve chemical plant safety barrier allocation, addressing the domino effect in industrial facilities. This novel model incorporates nodes and arcs, expanding on the classic arc-based barrier allocation technique. We used lexicographic optimization to minimize escalation time and analyze the sum of propagation durations for different fire pathways. This dual- objective optimization lets decision-makers intelligently manage resources to reduce domino effects. The model’s capacity to provide optimum answers in an acceptable computing time makes it more applicable in real-world situations. The research focused on chemical facilities, but the concept may be applied to other sectors, underscoring its potential to improve safety in linked systems. The model will be modified to account for geometric aspects in future work, and more industrial experiments will be performed to enhance our technique. This study improves process industry safety and lays the groundwork for domino effects and safety barrier optimization studies.","plants abdelaziz saeed alzaabi team leader mechanical maintenance adnoc offshore abu dhabi, 303, uae abdelazizs@adnoc.ae andrei sleptchenko associate professor at the department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university abu dhabi, 127788, uae andrei.sleptchenko@ku.ac.ae",
134,A Variable Neighborhood Search Approach To A Multi  Order Fulfillment And Consolidation Problem,"this study focuses on the problem of multi-order fulfillment and consolidation in e-commerce retail (mofcp). we examine a retailer that operates an online channel and a network of stores or warehouses. in this context, the term” store” is broadly used to refer to an individual physical store or a local warehouse. customers can place orders containing multiple items through on-line platforms. the goal is to find the locations that fulfill each order and a consolidation point of each order such that the total transportation costs are minimized. to capture the economy of scale of the transportation costs, we model the transportation costs through piece-wise linear cost functions. we propose an integer programming ip formulation enhanced by valid inequalities, as well as a nested variable neighborhood search heuristic. through preliminary numerical experiments, we show that the heuristic has 1.58% and 2.98% overall average increase in costs compared to the milp for the case of tight inventory to demand ratio (𝑘𝑘= 1) and suplus inventory to demand (𝑘𝑘= 1.5) respectively. the overall average running time is about 2 times faster for tight inventory and about 5 times slower than the ip when inventory is surplus.","order consolidation, e-commerce, nested vns, multi order","This study proposes a mat-heuristics approach to solve the fulfillment and consolidation problem of a retailer with an online platform and a network of physical stores. The retailer needs to decide for a given set of orders the consolidation points and the stores serve the orders. We formulated the problem as a capacitated multi-order mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) with piecewise linear costs. We propose a nested variable neighborhood search approach to solve the problem and compare the result with the solution of a MILP solver. The performance of the NVNS was examined for different values of the parameter that controls the inventory-to-demand ratio. Compared to the MILP solver, the NVNS gave a relative percentage increase in cost as 1.56% and 2.98% for the inventory to demand ratio k = 1 and 1.5, respectively. Overall, the NVNS shows an average increase of 2.28% in cost compared to the IP. While The performance of the NVNS is within acceptable limit in terms of it relative percentage increase in cost to the optimal cost of the IP, its computational time is still a bit higher than the IP. Since this study is a work in progress, we hope to refine the implementation and make the algorithm robust for large scale implementation. In this study, we have considered the case of more items that overlap between stores in the network. We hope to consider scenarios where there is limited overlap among stores. Figure 2.

142,The Power Of Testing Parameter On The Specified  Continuous Distributions,,,"The research studied the power and size of the hypothesis testing of the parameter shape on the Lognormal and Logistics distribution. We here then determined and graphically analysed the power and size on these distributions. There are four steps to derive the power and size functions as follow: (1) determine the sufficiently statistics, (2) compute the rejection region, (3) derive the formula of the power, and (4) create the graphs using generate data. The curve of the power is sigmoid and the curve increase faster (to be one) for small parameter shape (σ ) and large n. In this research, the formula of the power is derived using at least the basic concept of the definition of the power. In this research, we used definition of the power on testing hypothesis of the parameter shape in term of one-side hypothesis. A simulation is then given to figure the power’s and size’s curve using R code. The result showed that Lognormal distribution depended on the degree of freedom n, bound of the rejection area, and parameter shape (σ ). Moreover, the size is always constant and remain unchanged, and here the eligible size is 0.049 close to level of significance 0.05. So, we accepted this size as the minimum size ( < 0.05). In the context of the Logistics distribution, the result showed that the power of the Logistics distribution increase as the k increases, and the highestt curve occurs on large k (k=10), but not for the σ . Generally, the size is constant and it does not significantly change the curve on several k. Moreover, the size increase as the k increases. We noted here that the highest size occurs on k=10, and its value is around 1.0. This size is an impossible thing (not reasonable) to be used (far way from 0.05). However, we must choose the small size (less than 0.05), so we did not recommend this size. Acknowledgment I thankfully to the LPPM UNSOED for providing me granting of research",,

147,An Optimized Ball And Plate System Based On A Pid Controller  Abdullah Tahir,"this study gives an in-depth look into the well-known ball and plate system, which uses sensors, actuators, and controllers to keep a rolling ball balanced on a flat platform. the theoretical investigations and analyses underlying the ball and plate system are clarified, including the system's mathematical and physical modeling, as well as a full explanation of the components involved. the goal of our project is to design a closed-loop pid controller to achieve ball balancing on the platform. a resistive touch screen is used in the project as a sensor to detect the ball's current horizontal and vertical coordinates. the pid controller then compares these coordinates to the intended position and controls two dc servo motors acting as actuators, tilting the platform to achieve and maintain the desired ball position. the system's goal is to keep the ball at a specified fixed location in the face of any disruptions (disturbance rejection). particle swarm optimization (pso) is used to tweak the pid controller settings, which optimizes an objective function that minimizes the integral absolute error (iae) in both the x and y coordinates of the ball's position on the plate. this project is an implementation of the pid controller, which is used in a variety of real-world applications such as balancing robots, drones, and temperature control systems. the fundamental goal of developing such a system is to get a full educational knowledge of balancing systems and their operating principles, which are important in many sectors of life and can be improved further for future usage. furthermore, the introduction of an optimization approach to improve the system's reaction to disturbances is regarded as a significant addition to the area.","control, ball and plate, pid, motors, iae","To sum up, we used the PSO algorithm into the simulations to improve the performance of our system. We intended to improve the system's stability and precision by setting the goal function as reducing the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) of the ball's position on the plate. The comparison of simulation results with and without PSO optimization offered useful insights into the optimization technique's efficacy and impact on the system's responsiveness. In the conclusion, the primary objective of our ball and plate system is to precisely control the position of the ball on the touch screen, whether maintaining it in a static position or guiding it along predetermined paths, while promptly rectifying any disturbances that occur.

148,A Time-Discretized Linear Integer Programming Model For  Vacation Route Planning,"budget-conscious tourists are travellers electing to plan their vacations by taking advantage of pricing variability to minimize the total cost of their desired multi-city vacation. this paper presents the formulation and analysis of a time- discretized linear integer programming (lip) model to optimize total travel costs for travellers vacationing between major european cities by considering dynamic flight costs and accommodation expenses. the proposed time- discretized network flow model presented is an extension of classical shortest-route-problems (srp) and is solved using excel’s simplex lp algorithm. flight data collected from the online travel agency kiwi.com between may 1st, 2022, and may 30th was found to show significant daily price fluctuation, whereas accommodation prices collected from airbnb.com between may 1st, 2023, and may 13th, 2023, remained stable. this paper includes the model formulation, assumptions, and cost analysis of varying travel instances by rotating the origin city and altering the stay duration at each destination. three solutions, the generous, greedy, and cost-minimized solutions, were calculated for each travel trip instance. by optimizing the route, the cost can be reduced by upwards of 20.3% and 6.7% relative to the generous and greedy solutions. the model evaluated the impact of varying staying durations on the optimal travel order and was found to be very robust in terms of stay durations such that the optimized cost remained constant. the results of this paper have implications for the global travel industry by lowering the barrier of entry for budget-friendly consumers.",cost minimization,"In conclusion, this paper introduced a linear integer programming (IP) approach to optimize the travel itineraries of European tourists, minimizing total travel expenses encompassing flight and accommodation costs. The proposed discretized time network flow model, an extension of traditional Shortest-Route-Problems (SRP), was employed and solved using Microsoft Excel's integer optimization capabilities. The research unveiled considerable daily fluctuations in flight costs, reaching up to $312 within a brief timeframe, while accommodation expenses from AirBnB.com remained more stable. This paper provided the mathematical model formulation, underlying assumptions, and explored diverse travel scenarios involving changes in the origin city and stay durations at each destination. Three strategies—generous, greedy, and cost-minimized—were examined for each travel route originating from different locations. Optimizing the itinerary yielded cost reductions of up to 20.3% and 6.7% when compared to the generous and greedy approaches, respectively. The most cost-effective trip itinerary was achieved when the journey started in London, totalling $1671, whereas the most expensive route was initiated in Frankfurt, costing $1858. The implications of these findings extend to the global tourism industry, where even small enhancements in travel planning can result in substantial savings for both businesses and budget-conscious consumers. 1365","luca romagnoli university of waterloo department of chemical engineering university of waterloo, waterloo, on, canada lromagno@uwaterloo.ca ali elkamel department of chemical engineering, khalifa university, abu dhabi, uae & department of systems design engineering and department of chemical engineering, university of waterloo, waterloo, on, canada alielkamel@gmail.com","References

149,Chatgpt And Artificial Intelligence (Ai) Massive  Transformation Of Trainers' Education Sector,"the growth of artificial intelligence (ai) has significantly changed the field of education and is revolutionizing the ways trainees learn. ai has the capability to completely transform the way we teach and learn, improving accessibility, individualization, and effectiveness in the classroom. intelligent tutoring systems (its) development is one of the primary areas where ai is having an impact. these systems analyze student data using algorithms and offer tailored feedback and direction depending on each student's unique needs and learning preferences. another illustration of how technology is changing education is chatbots that run on ai. these chatbots give students immediate feedback, assist trainers in tracking students' development, and evaluate and pinpoint areas where students might be having challenges. overall, the application of ai in education is changing how we teach and learn and improving access to, personalization of, and effectiveness of education. this research at elmergib university focuses on methodologies to incorporate ai chatbots in chemical engineering challenging disciplines ensuring that the technologies support student learning rather than replacing the role of critical thinking or human interaction. the incorporation of ai technology tools as instructing topics of process optimization, data analysis, safety, and communication. there are remarkable possibilities for ai technologies to expand significantly.",february 12-14,"The employment of Chatbots as virtual teaching assistants can offer students individualized support by responding to their queries, helping with the course materials, and providing advice on a range of subjects. They can assist in making instructional content delivery more dynamic and interesting for students, improving their learning experience. In academic libraries, AI Chatbots have also been installed to help users find pertinent journal articles, books, or other resources. They can offer suggestions based on user preferences, help manage citations, and advise on how to use library resources efficiently. This facilitates quicker and more effective information access for scholars and students. Additionally, Chatbots can be used in academic institutions for administrative tasks. They can respond to common questions concerning enrollment, registration, financial assistance, and campus services, freeing up staff members' time to concentrate on more difficult responsibilities. Additionally, Chatbots can help with scheduling and remind users of key notifications, deadlines, and academic activities. Additionally, AI Chatbots can aid researchers in their work by helping with data analysis, literature reviews, and recommending prospective study topics based on the body of knowledge already available. They can facilitate research, assist in locating relevant studies, and give access to databases and resources. It is crucial to remember that while AI Chatbots may improve the academic experience, they are not intended to completely replace human connection. Instead of serving as a replacement for human direction and mentorship, they ought to be viewed as instruments that add to human expertise and support. In general, integrating AI systems and Chatbots into academic work has the potential to revolutionize several administrative, educational, and research duties while also delivering more individualized and effective services to students, researchers, and academic professionals.

151,Energizing The Desert: Strategic Multi-Criteria Decisionmaking Approaches To Saudi Arabia'S Renewable,"this paper focuses on identifying and addressing the challenges hindering renewable energy development in saudi arabia. a literature review and expert insights pinpointed seven key obstacles: lack of a stable investment climate, political instability, technical expertise, limited institutional capacity, varying environmental conditions, dependence on fossil fuel, and limited public awareness. the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) was employed to prioritize these challenges, revealing that limited public awareness is the most crucial barrier and varying environmental conditions are followed. to counter these challenges, the paper proposes seven strategies: encouraging private sector investment, providing financial incentives, strengthening the regulatory framework, developing a skilled workforce, promoting public awareness, collaborating with international organizations, and implementing policies. the effectiveness of these strategies was assessed using the combined compromise solution (cocoso) method, which highlighted policy implementation as the foremost approach. this research aims to guide decision-makers in saudi arabia in effectively allocating resources and making informed decisions to facilitate the growth of renewable energy.",,"Renewable energy in Saudi Arabia faces many obstacles. This study identified seven challenges and seven solutions to overcome them. The obstacle weights were determined using AHP. Meanwhile, CoCoSo was used to rank the suggested options by effectiveness. The most significant obstacles were limited public awareness and education about the potential benefits of renewable energy and the need to transition to a more sustainable energy mix, followed by varying environmental and climatic conditions across the country that require customized renewable energy solutions and a lack of technical expertise and skilled labor in the renewable energy sector. Developing and implementing policies to improve country stability and security, which could attract investment and financing for renewable energy projects, was the most important strategy to overcome the obstacles. This study may help Saudi Arabian decision- makers make informed choices and efficiently allocate resources to renewable energy. Renewable energy development in Saudi Arabia is essential for economic growth, energy security, and environmental sustainability. Saudi Arabia can achieve its renewable energy development goals and contribute to global climate change mitigation by acknowledging and resolving the stated obstacles. The findings of this research could help other nations facing similar challenges in developing sustainable energy sources.

154,Centrifugal Pump Reliability Improvement In The Pulp And  Paper Industry,"south african pulp and paper mills have encountered frequent breakdowns of centrifugal pumps, resulting in considerable production losses. a case study was conducted to determine the factors contributing to these failures and devise ways to enhance pump reliability. data were collected through questionnaires and operational records. the study revealed that inadequate maintenance, misalignment of pump components, lack of lubrication, improper baseplate installation, subpar sealing arrangements, inadequate design of the pumping system, and foreign materials entering the system were the primary causes of pump failure. to improve reliability, this study suggests employing machine learning methods to select the optimal maintenance strategy and provide internal maintenance personnel with training in condition monitoring systems. this will enable both pulp and paper mills and pump manufacturers to identify blind spots and improve the dependability of centrifugal pumps.","south africa, centrifugal pump, case study, pump system","and recommendations. 5. Conclusion This study investigated centrifugal pump failures using three sources: literature review, questionnaire, and operational data. This study also examined the strategies and methods used to ensure pump reliability. The results showed that there is little to no use of machine-learning methods for selecting optimal strategies and fault detection. The study helped identify the blind spots of both pump manufacturers and users, that is, pulp and paper mills, and made the necessary recommendations to improve the reliability of centrifugal pumps. Poor maintenance, misalignment of CP components, lack of lubrication of bearings and seals, poor installation of the base plate, use of incorrect seal arrangement, poor design of the pump system and its components, and ingress of foreign objects into the pump system are the main causes of CP failure. The study was based on a single paper mill. Future research should include more companies and benchmark strategies to improve CP reliability in the global market.","nontuthuko shabane, bheki b.s makhanya, jan-harm pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the build environment university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa nontuhmboyisa@gmail.com, bsm3174@yahoo.com",
155,Perceived Impact Of Mandatory Sim Card Registration On  Cyber Security And Data Privacy Among Engineering,"the study examines engineering students' opinions on the effects of mandatory sim card registration on data privacy and cybersecurity at a higher education institute in the philippines. this paper examines data privacy and cybersecurity concerns created by mandatory registration in the philippines after outlining the present state of things and the regulation requirements. this paper used survey questionnaires and interviews to study engineering students' perceptions by investigating complex interrelationships and assessing observed and latent variables, structural equation modeling was used to explain the occurrences. findings show a substantial association between mandatory sim card registration, data privacy, and cybersecurity. results illustrate how crucial it is to monitor the negative consequences of this registration requirement on engineering students' digital security at universities, as there are numerous interrelated ways it might endanger their safety.","cybersecurity, data privacy","required careful data analysis (Garcia and Patel 2021). Interpretation enabled thorough investigation and valuable discoveries. These findings are significant for research and decision-making. 5. Conclusion and Recommendation Latent variables like Perceived Risks and Benefits, Specific Advantages, Specific Concerns, and Behavioral Change are quantified by loadings. Observable and latent variables correlate positively if variables have high standardized regression estimates. Structure model estimations show a positive relationship between Perceived Risks and Benefits, Particular Concerns, Particular Advantage, and Behavioral Change. Standardized regression estimates reveal these associations' nature and direction. RMSEA, CFI, NFI, RMR, TLI, GFI, and Chi-Square/df show that the structural model fits the data well. GFI, TLI, CFI, and RMSEA all meet or exceed the cutoffs, while Chi-Square/df is somewhat higher. Since the modified model matches the data, the hypothesized latent-observable variable relationships make sense. Risks and benefits, anxieties, advantages, and behavior change are positively correlated and consistent with reasonable conclusions given the findings. High loadings in the measurement model indicate that the observed variables measure the expected latent constructs. The survey found that engineering students from Higher Education Institution (HEI) must register their SIM cards, which offers pros and cons for data privacy and cybersecurity. Results showed that students agreed with campus communication and security benefits. Mandatory registration raised concerns about cybersecurity vulnerabilities and personal data exposure. These results support the research's main goal by showing how SIM card registration affects Engineering students' cybersecurity and data privacy views. Engineering students were surveyed on the pros and cons of mandatory SIM card registration. Population views on cybersecurity and data privacy vary. Engineering students worried about data privacy and cybersecurity, citing privacy intrusions. The research examined SIM card registration's effects on engineering students, telecommunications companies, and the Philippine government, as well as national security, infrastructure, and SIM card users' rights and responsibilities. SIM card registration by Higher Education Institution (HEI) engineering students highlighted academic cybersecurity and data privacy issues by showing how the pros and cons interact. HEI Engineering students' SIM card registration showed research cybersecurity and data privacy issues' complicated benefits and downsides. 5.1. Recommendations HEI engineering students' mandatory SIM card registration raises cybersecurity and data privacy concerns. Encryption, security audits, and focused student teaching on cybersecurity dangers and data protection will achieve this aim. In the Philippines, the government, telecommunications businesses, schools, and student groups must communicate more openly and comply with data privacy laws. They should evaluate and create new data security policies to keep the internet safe and encourage engineering students to handle data properly. Further research or model refinement is needed to determine how visible elements affect latent idea exploration. Consider elements that need greater attention yet have lower loadings or correlations. Evaluate standardized regression estimations' validity.","students at higher education institution john michael v. dela cruz, bryant anthony g. islao, guiller e. laluan, stephen shadrach p. marcos, michael john b. valerio, maricar m. navarro department of industrial engineering, college of engineering and architecture technological institute of the philippines – quezon city cubao, quezon city, philippines qjmvdelacruz@tip.edu.ph, qbagislao@tip.edu.ph, qglaluan@tip.edu.ph, qssmarcos@tip.edu.ph, qmjvalerio@tip.edu.ph, mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph",

The CIMS was programmed and developed to match the physical RMA process. SAP was created to match the customer’s SAP network. Later, CIMS was attached to SAP to ensure any receiving in or shipping out of the system is recorded financially via SAP. The suitable organizational chart was built and operators are assigned to each position. The RMA SOP was officially released and the new team got trained upon it.

each task, management view, and record retention are all mentioned in detail in the SOP.  
 
Two versions of the SOP were created. At the beginning of the planning process, a file called “Long-term SOP” was 
shared with the team on a shared drive so whenever a team member has an idea or a detail, they are free to add it. 
Later, another version (the final one) was created by the management depending on the first version that was created 
by the team. The final version was officially released and signed off by each member mentioned in the SOP besides 
the management.  
 
4. Results and Discussion  
In May 2023, the company initiated the reception of the initial batch of RMA boards from the customer. Managing 
these returned PCBAs proved challenging for the existing team, as overseeing both the forward and reverse processes 
became cumbersome using the same team and machinery. Recognizing the complexity, the company engaged 
researchers to develop a dedicated RMA process. 
 
The newly devised RMA process was integrated into the company's operations and officially implemented on August 
16, 2023. Subsequent to the old team's handling of the returned PCBAs, these items were temporarily stored in the 
warehouse. While some boards underwent testing processes, such as AOI and FBT, they were eventually stockpiled 
until the formation and readiness of the new team. 
 
The new team opted to address the RMA PCBAs under the assumption that they had not been previously handled by 
the old team, considering potential adverse effects from extended storage in the warehouse. Employing the ""First In, 
First Out"" (FIFO) method, the new team utilized a system of inventory valuation and management where the earliest 
items added to inventory were prioritized for use.

164,Improving The Operational Efficiency At A Manufacturing  Facility By Using Lean Techniques: A Case Study At Shams,"the ever-increasing competitive landscape necessitates manufacturers to seek improvements in operational efficiency constantly. this paper explores the integration of various methodologies to enhance operational efficiency at shams cables factory. the proposed approach combines lean techniques, conceptual modeling, and process visualization tools like facility layout, activity relationship chart (arc), flow process chart (fpc), and va/nva analysis to further refine the process by differentiating between value-adding and non-value-adding activities. as a result, these integrations allow for targeted efforts to eliminate nva activities, streamline va activities, and maximize overall efficiency.","lean manufacturing, efficiency","After analyzing the data, it is clear that the Shams factory has real problems related to the high percentage of NVA activities and poor facility layout. In this paper, we apply lean concepts and methodologies to achieve the expected results and outcomes. We can significantly improve our operational effectiveness by applying lean concepts and analytical instruments. Non-value-added activities (NVA) such as excessive handling, waiting, and rework are the goals for removal in lean methodologies. We used a spaghetti chart to provide a clear picture of the flow of materials and persons, showing inefficient flow and encouraging layout optimization. Also, the activity relationship chart helped us build a streamlined facility layout that reduces distance and needless interactions between processes, resulting in a seamless, value-driven operation. By addressing both internal and external flow obstacles, this combined strategy enables significant performance benefits that save costs, increase customer satisfaction, and shorten lead times. Keep in mind that achieving lean requires continual monitoring and modification. Using these techniques can help you maintain optimal operational efficiency.","cables factory abdulrahman m almotairi, osama a al-qahtani, mohammed k alamodi and dr alaa momena department of industrial engineering college of engineerin prince sattam bin abdulalziz university alkharj, saudi arabia",
165,Post Pandemic Factors Influencing Continued Usage Of  E-Payment In Higher Education Institution: Integrating,"this study aims to assess the factors influencing the continued usage of e-payment methods using the extended technology acceptance model (tam) in one of the higher education institutions in quezon city. the study utilized a quantitative technique, particularly an online survey, to gather data. the participants of the study have a total of 386 respondents. after the data collection, the study used the statistical package for the social sciences (spss) and analysis of movement structure (amos) for data processing and construction of the structural equation model (sem). the model was used to determine the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived security, perceived trust, behavioral intention to use, perceived satisfaction, responsiveness, reliability, and continued usage. the result shows that perceived security had a significant effect on perceived usefulness, responsiveness, reliability, and continued usage. also, results showed that responsiveness had a positive influence on perceived usefulness. moreover, perceived security, perceived usefulness, responsiveness, and reliability had a significant impact on the continued usage of e-payment methods among the students of a higher education institution.",,"The pandemic has led to the widespread use of e-payments such as Gcash, Maya, Online Banking Application, and Debit and Credit Cards. One of the Higher Education Institutions in Quezon City started to use e-payments as one of the payment methods available. E-payment methods are used in tuition fees, canteen, library, uniforms, organization-related activities, and other documents that are payable in the institution. This research uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with added variables such as reliability and responsiveness to assess the factors affecting the perceived satisfaction of students in using e-payment methods inside the institution. The survey with 47 questions received a total of 386 responses from the students. The result shows that perceived security had a significant effect on perceived usefulness, responsiveness, reliability, and continued usage. Also, perceived usefulness was positively influenced by responsiveness. Moreover, perceived security, perceived usefulness, responsiveness, and reliability had a significant effect on the continued usage of e-payment methods in the institution. When the consumer feels secure with the use of e-payment methods instead of cash, they tend to use it more often. When e-payment methods perform their intended use, and how the management responds to the requests of the consumer also affects the continued usage of the consumers.","extended technology acceptance model jan marielle i. bidayan, abegail g. cambay, arjen guila c. cruz, neil leandro g. fajardo, erika mae p. ople, maricar m. navarro industrial engineering program, college of engineering and architecture technological institute of the philippines, quezon city, philippines qjmibidayan@tip.edu.ph, qagcambay@tip.edu.ph, qagccruz@tip.edu.ph, qnlgfajardo@tip.edu.ph, qempople@tip.edu.ph, mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph",

This system was built based on the selected Saudi industry’s real data. After data filtration and analysis, an interface was developed and a complete system was designed accordingly. The transportation system and allocation schedule were included in the resource allocation system, in which the program displayed the allocation of equipment in respective sites. Two tracking systems were provided and included in the alternative solutions to meet the objectives fully. The designed transportation models and the interface can be effectively be used to perform the following functions: • Allowing the flexibility in inputs for the demand and resources • Allocate the desired equipment for a specific location • Determination of the transportation cost of individual equipment • Determination of the overall cost of the solution • Tracking and the availability of a certain equipment","rafeek bassam mushtaha, abdulaziz yasser aburahma, moath abdullah alluhidan, madiha rafaqat, osamah abdulhameed and naveed ahmed department of industrial engineering, college of engineering and architecture, al yamamah university, riyadh 11512, saudi arabia rafeekmushtaha@gmail.com, abdulaziz.y.aburahmah@gmail.com, m.alluhidan@outlook.com, m_rafaqat@yu.edu.sa, o_abdulhameed@yu.edu.sa, n_ahmed@yu.edu.sa",
167,The Role Of Social Norms In Shaping Normative Beliefs And  Forming Subjective Norms For Predicting Fitness Mania,"the primary aim of this study is to investigate the convergent and discriminant validity of injunctive and descriptive norms in forming subjective norms. it also examines the influence of subjective norms, encompassing normative beliefs (injunctive and descriptive norms) and the motivation to comply, on the intention to consume amino 2000 supplements among fitness enthusiasts in indonesia. this research, employing a mixed-method approach combining qualitative and quantitative analyses, was conducted in four major indonesian cities: jakarta, bandung, surabaya, and semarang. the study sample comprised 393 fitness aficionados from five distinct fitness centers across the region. the findings support four hypotheses posited by the researcher. overall, subjective norms, including normative beliefs (injunctive and descriptive norms) and motivation to comply, more effectively predict and explain the intention of fitness mania to consume amino 2000 supplements, compared to either injunctive norms, descriptive norms, a combination of both, or the normative beliefs formed by these norms, along with the constituent motivation to comply.","subjective norms, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, mixed method","This study effectively fulfills its primary goal by establishing the convergent and discriminant validity of injunctive and descriptive norms in the formation of subjective norms, a key finding substantiated by the factor analysis results presented in Tables 1 and 2. The attainment of discriminant validity, as outlined by Aaker et al. (2011), is evidenced when the measurements of a construct do not correlate with those of a distinct construct. Similarly, Hair et al. (2010) and Sekaran (2010) posit that discriminant validity is present when a construct is unequivocally distinct from other theoretical constructs. In accordance with the criteria set by Hair et al. (2010), this study regards factor loading values exceeding 0.50 as significant. The confirmatory factor analysis in Table 1, where factor loading values for each indicator across all constructs exceed 0.5, attests to robust discriminant validity. Moreover, the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) value exceeding 0.5 in Table 2 indicates a strong convergent validity, further validating the construction of the fieldwork (Hair et al., 2010). Crucially, the study reveals that subjective norms—encompassing both normative beliefs (injunctive and descriptive norms) and the motivation to adhere—exert a significant and positive influence on the intention to use Amino 2000 supplements among fitness enthusiasts in four cities. Given the respondents' limited direct comprehension of subjective norms, the research pivoted to an indirect measurement approach. Regression analysis elucidates that subjective norms, composed of normative beliefs and motivation to comply, significantly and positively affect the intention to use these supplements. The findings also indicate that subjective norms, including both normative beliefs and motivation to adhere, are more efficacious in predicting and explaining the consumption intentions of fitness enthusiasts for Amino 2000 supplements than merely relying on injunctive norms, descriptive norms, or their collective combination. This observation is congruent with Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behavior, highlighting the imperative of a profound understanding of subjective norms for accurately predicting and influencing health-related behaviors, especially in the realm of fitness supplement usage (Ajzen, 1991; Hair et al., 2010). In summary, this study not only elucidates the intricate dynamics of subjective norms in the context of health supplement consumption but also significantly contributes to the existing body of knowledge within the domain of consumer behavior and health psychology.

172,Multivariate Regression Analysis Of Sleep Deprivation  Through Academic Performance Of Architecture Students,"this paper addresses a study on architecture students regarding the effect of sleep quality and various factors that affect their academic performance. the study was inspired by the lack of analysis done on architecture students regarding their sleep quality, which significantly affects their performance in school. the lack of sleep or poor sleep quality also affects the person's ability to function correctly. quantitative methods, which utilized multivariate regression analysis to test the relationship between the two variables and numerous factors, were utilized in this study. surveys were also distributed to gather data. the study had a sample size 221 from a population size of 2,128 recently enrolled architecture students. the pearson correlation coefficient was utilized using ibm spss (statistical package for the social sciences) statistics, a software package to determine the relationship between sleep deprivation and students' academic performance. the study measured the seven components of sleep quality using the pittsburgh sleep quality index (psqi). the research findings show that all the respondents had poor sleep quality. the study on the relationship between sleep quality and academic performance of architecture students indicates a weak yet discernible correlation between their gpa and critical factors like sleep quality, number of units, schedule, and year level. the strength of these correlations indicates that there may be additional factors besides those examined in this study that significantly impact the students' academic performance. however, the links discovered are statistically significant. two variables—year level and number of units—showed a substantial link with sleep quality when assessed for their correlation strength. however, sleep quality had a very weak correlation with academic performance.",sleep quality,"GPA Number of Units 0.279 Accept Null Hypothesis PSQI <.001 Reject Null Hypothesis Class Time Schedule 0.059 Accept Null Hypothesis Year Level .36 Accept Null Hypothesis Class Days Schedule 0.209 Accept Null Hypothesis PSQI Year Level <.001 Reject Null Hypothesis Number of Units Year Level 0.309 Accepted Null Hypothesis The Table 15 shows that all variables have a weak correlation to Academic performance (GPA) except the PSQI which is the only one that was determined to have a significant impact on the Academic performance (GPA). For the Sleep quality correlation both the year level and number of units have a correlation coefficient with the sleep quality, however the PSQI is the only one with that was determined to have a significant impact. 6. Conclusion The study investigates the various factors that may impact the academic performance of architecture students. These factors include the quality of sleep, the number of units taken, the schedule, and the year level of the respondents. The proponents utilize Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess the degree of correlation between each variable. The correlation is determined based on the research model, which postulates the theoretical relationship between the variables. According to the research findings, all the respondents had poor sleep quality. The study on the academic performance of architecture students indicates a weak yet discernible correlation between their GPA and critical factors like sleep quality, number of units, schedule, and year level. While the observed relationships are statistically significant, the strength of these correlations suggests that there are factors beyond the ones investigated in this study that significantly affect the respondents' academic performance. Sleep quality had a very weak correlation to academic performance due to two variables - year level and number of units, which showed a significant association with sleep quality when tested for their correlation strength. The study also suggests a weak correlation exists between the year level of architecture students and both sleep quality and the number of academic units they undertake. The connection between year level and number of units shows the workloads that each participant reflected on their sleep quality, which resulted in the respondents' academic performance. The weak correlation between sleep quality and GPA suggests that, while getting enough sleep can improve academic achievement, it is not the only factor. Similarly, the small correlations with the number of academic units and scheduling preferences suggest that these variables only significantly impact predicting GPA among architecture students. While there is some association between year level and academic achievement, it underscores the complex nature of academic success, with several elements impacting performance throughout a student's architecture education. 1613","mart lorenz r. agravante, john rei c. garchitorena, johanh gabrielle c. julian, carl joseph c. quintana, miguel g. tabirao, maricar navarro, juan miguel dinglasan industrial engineering program, college of engineering and architecture technological institute of the philippines, philippines qmlragravante@tip.edu.ph, qjrcgarchitorena@tip.edu.ph, qjgcjulian@tip.edu.ph qcjcquintana@tip.edu.ph, qmgtabirao@tip.edu.ph, mmnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph, jmdinglasan@tip.edu.ph","References

173,Optimizing On-Site Electric Vehicle Charging: Routing For  Efficient Last-Mile Operations,"the global shift towards sustainable transportation is centered around the growth of electric vehicles (evs) primarily due to their zero tailpipe emissions. to facilitate the seamless transition from non-evs to evs and to alleviate the range anxiety experienced by ev users, substantial improvements in charging infrastructure is required. this involves the development of new fast charging stations and battery-swapping facilities. this research focuses on a step ahead and proposes an innovative solution by providing recharging and battery swapping services to ev users at their preferred time and location with mobile ev recharging and mobile battery swapping vans. the problem is formulated as a multi-depot capacitated vehicle routing problem (vrp) considering hard time windows and simultaneous pickup and delivery, using integer linear programming. the objective is to minimize the total cost of routing the recharging and battery swapping vans from charging stations to customer locations by satisfying the customer’s requirements effectively. the proposed mathematical formulation was tested on a small set of 8 customers and solved using gurobi solver. furthermore, this np-hard problem is tackled by developing heuristics known as large neighborhood search aimed at scalability for larger instances of the problem. the heuristics was successfully implemented and tested for the same small set of 8 customers and a larger instance with two sets (100,200) customers and different depots generated randomly. therefore, this study introduces an innovative approach to tackle challenges related to ev adoption thereby contributing to a more sustainable and accessible future for electric mobility.","battery swapping, ev recharging","This research has provided insights and an effective solution to the challenges associated with multi trip muti depot capacitated vehicle routing problem with hard time windows and simultaneous pickup and delivery with the help of both exact model and neighborhood search heuristics algorithm. The exact model is limited to smaller instances due to the inherent NP-hard time complexity. On the other hand, the neighborhood search heuristics algorithm, designed to handle larger datasets, has showcased its efficiency in optimizing the routes and costs for a large number of customers. Apart from optimizing the costs, the heuristics algorithm is also made sure that is satisfied the constraints of the VRP. The iterative implementation of insert and swap scheme within the heuristics model has significantly improved the overall routing efficiency. Furthermore, the unique research contribution lies in the introduction of an on-site battery swapping and recharging solution through mobile units. This customer-centric approach addresses the limitations of traditional charging stations and enhances the overall appeal of electric vehicles to potential adopters. By effectively addressing the challenges in day-to-day mobility, we contribute to the advancement of eco-friendly 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1 2 3 Total distance No. of depots 100 customers 200 customers 1624","shazeb liyakath and arshinder kaur department of management studies indian institute of technology, madras chennai 600 036, india ms21s017@smail.iitm.ac.in, arshinder@iitm.ac.in viswanath kumar ganesan and haripriya k tata consultancy services ltd. iit madras research park chennai 600 013, india viswanath.ganesan@tcs.com, k.haripriya@tcs.com","References

178,A Practical Algorithm For Midterm Exam Scheduling In  Higher Education Institutions,"the efficient scheduling of midterm examinations at higher education institutions poses a multifaceted challenge. multiple objectives must be optimized, such as minimizing the total number of students who have multiple exams on a single day or on consecutive days, minimizing the number of exams assigned to weekends, etc. the problem also includes many practical constraints belonging to different stakeholders. some of these constraints are scheduling all exams on the allocated time period, scheduling single section courses to their lecture times, and scheduling all sections of multi-section courses at the same time in the evening or weekends. this study develops an algorithm and a decision support system (dss) for this complex problem. besides necessary structural constraints, this dss incorporates real- world complexities such as preferences for exam dates, fixing course dates, and variations in scheduling for single and multi-section courses. a construction heuristic empowered by a local search procedure is proposed, which is implemented using visual basic for applications (vba). the user-friendly interface facilitates both scheduling and sensitivity analysis, allowing educators to fine-tune parameters like the setting of the number of weeks allocated for midterms and penalties for unfavorable days and time slots. the system’s performance is evaluated using real data, demonstrating its potential to enhance educational management.",college,"In this study, we considered the university midterm timetabling problem at the Department and College levels. We developed a mathematical programming formulation together with a heuristic algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in MS Excel VBA which handles the input data easily and provides the solutions in a few seconds. We performed case studies in our institution (at department and college levels) using Fall 2023 data. The results demonstrated that even for the larger problem that includes the whole college, the algorithm generates exam timetables efficiently. It also allows the decision makers to perform sensitivity analysis on problem parameters and obtain insights about the solution characteristics. As one future study, the algorithm can be modified to schedule final exams. Note that these two problems have several differences. There is no distinction of single and multi-section courses for the final exams. During the final exam periods there are no ongoing courses. The allocated exam slots are longer and the number of spanning exam days is less in the case of final exams. Assigning the exams to classrooms can also be included in the problem. Furthermore, developing a user-friendly graphical user interface and converting the algorithm into a decision support software would be beneficial. As another future study, an exam timetabling program could b e developed for the whole university, with various colleges, and various departments and programs inside each college.

179,Dual-Channel Closed-Loop Supply Chain: Competition And  Channel Coordination,"due to changing environmental laws, adoption of sustainable practices, and shortage of raw materials, manufacturers are increasingly focusing on remanufacturing. the implementation of successful remanufacturing practices is dependent on efficient recollection. many firms are adopting dual-channel recollection to enhance their recollection efficiency. we study a dual-channel recollection efficiency of a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer, and a third-party collection agent, where the manufacturer recollects using any two of the three agents. we analyze three competitive hybrid recollection channels under full and asymmetric information settings using wholesale price, linear and non-linear two-part tariff contracts. our key findings are as follows: (i) two part tariff (ltt) contracts can coordinate the recollection channel consisting of oem and retailer irrespective of reverse channel competition, (ii) recollection using oem and retailer works better when oem offers wholesale price contract, (iii) if oem offers ltt contract, then recollection channel consisting of oem and retailer performs better with low competition intensity, and recollection channel consisting of oem and a third-party (3p) vendor performs better with high competition intensity, (iv) an oem cannot design channel coordination mechanism whenever a 3p vendor is involved but she can design pareto-optimal contracts to improve profitability, (v) in asymmetric information game, an oem’s profit increases if recollection agents share their hidden cost information with her, and (vi) oem earns more profit by employing herself and another supply chain agent for product recollection if oem’s recollection efficiency is higher; in case of complete outsourcing of recollection activity through a retailer and a 3p vendor, oem earns more profit if the retailer is more efficient than the vendor.","dual-channel, competition",,"pinakhi suvadarshini assistant professor, indian institute of management amritsar, india",
180,Charging Planning Model For Electric Vehicles Based On  Range Prediction,"range anxiety continues to be one of the most important factors negatively affecting the transition to electric vehicles (evs). however, range anxiety can be reduced if the ev driver knows where to stop for charging on the route according to the range information remaining at the beginning of the journey. although evs can access real-time data, it cannot be expected that the created charging plan will reduce range anxiety unless range prediction is made considering the conditions of the determined route. the aim of this study is to determine where and how much the ev should be charged for minimum travel time or cost by creating a charging plan based on real-time range prediction for a specified route. the deep neural network model was trained by using the inputs of the static features and dynamic features of the journey in the range prediction model. the amount of energy consumed between the nodes is obtained by the range prediction model. within the scope of charging planning, a mixed integer programming model is developed that consider nonlinear charging times, dynamic charging prices, vehicle to the grid, multiple charger with different power levels and their availability. since the developed mathematical programming model was insufficient in terms of the solution time, a matheuristic is proposed. test results on 32 various problems indicate that the matheuristic approach outperforms the metaheuristic and heuristics for both minimum travel time and cost.","electric vehicles, range prediction, charge planning, matheuristic",,"hilal yılmaz assist. prof. dr., department of industrial engineering bursa technical university bursa, türki̇ye hilal.yilmaz@btu.edu.tr",
181,Determining An Optimal Charging Plan For Electric Vehicles Considering Time-Of-Use Pricing,"considering the long charging times, limited range of electric vehicles (evs), and the limited number of charging stations, it is vital to check the feasibility of a route and make a charging plan, especially for long journeys. charge planning of an ev includes the decisions of where, when, and how much the ev needs to be charged. charging planning is one of the areas where decision support should be provided to ev drivers. thanks to intelligent transportation system (its) technologies, it is now possible to receive information from charging stations, which plays an essential role in providing decision support to ev drivers. this study proposes an optimization model to find an optimal charge planning model for suitable routes that enables the ev to complete its journey without range anxiety. the proposed model determines where and how much charge is needed at the charging stations considering time-of- use (tou) pricing. an integer linear programming model is developed based on the range coverage location model (rclm), which determines the minimum number of charging stations the ev needs to visit. the proposed optimization model is tested on randomly generated problems. the test results show that the model can find the optimal charging plan in a reasonable time.","electric vehicles, charge planning",,"hilal yılmaz assist. prof. dr., department of industrial engineering bursa technical university bursa, türki̇ye betul yagmahan prof. dr., department of industrial engineering bursa uludag university bursa, türki̇ye hilal.yilmaz@btu.edu.tr, betul@.uludag.edu.tr",

183,Crowdfunding: Exploring Its Role As An Alternative  Financial Avenue In The Indian Context,"this paper seeks to construct a theoretical framework to understand better crowdfunding, its applications, and its impact on the progression of start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). researchers have investigated the origins and consequences of financing through crowdfunding in start-ups and smes thus far. lack of funding to launch, maintain, and expand firms is one of the most significant obstacles to small and medium enterprises' success. higher rules and prudential standards by financial institutions, combined with the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, significantly reduced credit supply to start-ups and smes. crowdfunding is a group effort that enables business owners to obtain cash from numerous individual sources via online platforms. this article explores the growth of crowdfunding within the indian context, consolidating various scholarly studies focusing on advancements in funding for start-ups and small and medium enterprises (smes). furthermore, it delves into how much crowdfunding has provided financial assistance to these entities. the article aims to highlight to researchers and policymakers the necessity of enhancing the structure to achieve balanced development between conventional and alternative economic systems.","crowdfunding, start-ups, smes, sebi","Innovation in financing to sectors, notably start-ups SMEs, is acceptable when traditional financial sources fail to accommodate the credit demands of start-ups & SMEs and entrepreneurial chances continue to emerge. Crowdfunding was developed to level the playing field and provide individual investors the chance to aggregate relatively small sums of money to meet the funding needs of start-ups or growing enterprises. India continued to lag behind its international competitors and contributed very little of the funds generated. It happens due to the legal framework governing equity crowdfunding is still unclear. Crowdfunding was made more restrictive by SEBI's strict regulations by placing it under the Companies Act 2013, which has harmed the industry. Despite SEBI's announcement in March 2017 that it was open to revisiting the sector's regulatory standards, it is unlikely that any expansion will materialize in the upcoming years. 1678","ritika research scholar department of management studies indian institute of technology roorkee roorkee, uttarakhand-247667, india ritika1@bm.iitr.ac.in dr. ashu khanna associate professor department of management studies indian institute of technology roorkee roorkee, uttarakhand-247667, india ashu.khanna@ms.iitr.ac.in","References

187,Automation In Construction Cost Budgeting Using  Generative Artificial Intelligence,"this paper explores the paradigm of continuous improvement in construction cost management, emphasizing the utilization of generative artificial intelligence (generative ai) as a pivotal factor in driving this advancement. embracing the lean construction principle and the plan-do-check-act approach, the study emphasizes the need for requirements and techniques in cost management. building information modeling (bim) is recognized as crucial for budgeting construction costs, but it faces challenges related to automation and technology. in this study we explore the use of generative ai in generating bills of quantities (boqs) for building cost management in small and medium- sized enterprises (smes). the exploration combines transformer-based techniques and large language models (llm), introducing a novel approach to development of boqs in construction projects. robustly optimized bert pre-training approach (roberta), an effective and reliable transformer architecture, categorizes substructure and superstructure components with an impressive 91% accuracy, forming a solid foundation. fuzzy similarity matching connects sub-element records to project cost tables, incorporating cost data for meticulous computations. leveraging the advanced text-generation capabilities of gpt-4, a state-of-the-art language model, the study automates the construction of a detailed and comprehensive boq. this departure from traditional rule based boq development offers enhanced flexibility and contextual knowledge. this approach, combining transformer-based models for precise categorization with llm (gpt-4) for automated boq generation, presents a simplified and efficient solution for cost budgeting in building projects. this innovative method not only promises improved project documentation but also signifies potential revolutionary progress in building cost-management procedures. the findings provide valuable insights for construction professionals, paving the way for a more efficient and advanced approach to cost management in the construction industry.","generative ai, bill of quantities, bim","Generative AI can create a level playing field for all experience levels of construction costing professionals, business scales, and project types by simplifying the approach to construction project measurement and costing. SMEs and large construction companies have unused big data, essential in producing large language models that would serve the Generative AI for the cost. SMEs would benefit from a low-cost, easier, and quicker approach to quantifying and costing construction costs through Generative AI. To ensure the ongoing success, acceptance, and practical implementation of cost-related projects, it is important to continuously improve productivity across the whole project lifecycle. Generative AI will enable quantity surveyors, cost estimators, construction managers, and contractors to gradually enhance project cost efficiency. This research contributes to exploring the dynamic opportunities and challenges associated with integrating Generative AI into the construction industry. The process of using Generative AI for BOQ productions creates more time for more productive cost planning and management tasks, thereby adding value to the role of the quantity surveyor and cost planning teams. This innovative method not only streamlines the automatic generation of BOQ but also serves as a fundamental component for precise cost estimation and management in construction projects. It signifies a positive trajectory for future enhancements. The feasibility study decisively demonstrates the practicality of employing AI for BOQ and the comprehensive administration of building expenses. The findings from our proposed framework underscore the immense potential inherent in deploying such technologies, highlighting their effectiveness in reshaping established procedures within the construction industry. The findings of this research can direct the construction research community to focus on the practical applications of Generative AI capabilities. Moreover, this study provides an initial groundwork for realizing the capacity and challenges of Generative AI in this industry. Further validation studies implementing the proposed framework and developing real construction applications would be a natural extension of this research.

As we explored, simple changes in the layout of the drive-thru workstation can drastically reduce the chances of a worker getting injured. We proposed three design solutions that can help decrease the amount of leaning required from each drive- thru worker: a window extension, a mechanical fixture, and an automatic conveyer belt. After analyzing these solutions against the design constraints and decision matrix criteria, we decided to implement the mechanical fixture as a response to the overall RULA assessment score of 5. The RULA assessment indicated that the current workstation imposes a high risk of injury and requires immediate change. The following conclusions can be derived: 1. Three solutions were proposed: o Window Extension: an extension to the existing window that will allow the drive-thru worker to slide orders on. It will reduce the amount of leaning required from the drive-thru worker. o Mechanical Fixture: a fixture that can move in multiple directions (up/down and forward/backward) using a combination of mechanisms such as a lever or push/pull that will help reduce the amount of leaning that the worker is required to do. The fixture will have an attached tray that has different depths to hold the drinks. o Automatic Conveyor Belt: a conveyer belt that is fully automated to move the order from the kitchen to the drive-thru window. This requires automation and technologies to be used. This solution will ultimately eliminate the need of a worker to stand at the drive-thru window. 2. Design Solution Selection: o Based on the criterion, the mechanical fixture scored the highest (best) in terms cost, durability, simplicity, efficiency, and maintenance. o The mechanical fixture was chosen to move forward to implementation, prototyping, and testing. 3. Design Solution Impact: o The project successfully addressed the ergonomic challenges faced by drive-thru workers, significantly reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. 4. RULA Assessment: o The current workstation scored a 5 indicating a high risk of injury, specifically to the trunk area (scoring a 6). o The RULA assessment revealed a notable decrease in musculoskeletal risk, affirming that the drive-thru fixture can substantially improve the ergonomic safety of workers compared to traditional workstations. The use of the fixture decreased the risk of injury to 3, and drastically reduced the risk to the trunk areas (scoring a 1). o The RULA assessment validated that our mechanical drive-thru fixture effectively mitigates ergonomic risks, particularly in the neck, trunk, and legs, offering a marked improvement over existing workstations.

The ABC classification, which applies the Pareto principle, is a widely utilized analytical method for categorizing inventory into three classes: A, B, and C. However, inventory classification should be viewed as a multi-criteria problem, as the traditional ABC method relies on a single criterion. To address this limitation, this study utilizes Support Vector Machine (SVM) to consider multiple criteria in inventory classification. The SVM algorithm achieves an impressive 87% accuracy in classifying inventory. While this study represents an initial exploration of machine learning accuracy in inventory classification, it is recommended to replace traditional classification methods that overlook critical data features and rely on a single criterion. Advanced methods like SVM and other classification approaches that utilize various data features should be adopted.

At present, traditional wind turbines are the most used machines to transform wind energy into electrical energy. The issues associated with traditional wind turbines include transportation problems, high maintenance costs, and harmful environmental impacts. These downsides lead to a consideration of the Vortex Bladeless Wind Turbine (VBWT), which focuses on less space requirement, less impact on wildlife, zero noise, as well as having fewer moving components, which means less wear and tear, and lower maintenance costs. The suitable size of this turbine also makes it simple to install in homes, schools, and any location. The main objective of this study was to optimize the potential energy production of a vortex wind turbine using mathematical models. In the process of devising the tools to achieve that goal, the Taguchi method had to be created for VBWT design parameters. For the measurement of VBWT dimensions, the VORTEX Bladeless ® 3D model was used. The main findings of this study can be summarized in the following points: 1. The optimal values of VBWT design parameters are: 𝐿𝐿𝑚𝑚= 20 𝑚𝑚 , 𝐿𝐿𝑟𝑟= 2.5 𝑚𝑚 , 𝐷𝐷𝑚𝑚= 0.4 𝑚𝑚 , 𝐷𝐷𝑟𝑟= 0.04 𝑚𝑚 , 𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚= 0.1 , 𝑡𝑡𝑟𝑟= 0.02 𝑚𝑚 2. The output power of optimal VBWT is 3.44 KW. It increased from 1.25 KW for the initial design parameters to 3.44 KW. 3. The most significant design parameter is the length of the turbine, which takes the first rank in Taguchi design. Future work concerns pursuing the following directions to improve the model: 1. In this study, a cylindrical shape of the mast was used to follow the VORTEX Bladeless® model, but designing a conical mast shape may achieve perfect synchronization of the vortex shedding all along the mast. Given that the wind velocity in the atmospheric boundary layer increases with height, the diameter of the oscillating structure should also increase with height to favour synchronization. 1879","optimal design of a vortex wind turbine using taguchi method sarah al saeed, shahad almasud, reham alashwl, fatima aljameel, sabah alshahrani and mohammed alqahtani department of industrial engineering, king khalid university, king fahad st., abha, 62529, saudi arabia m.alqahtani@kku.edu.sa","References

(mhi), which faced the challenge of developing a large-scale just-in-time (jit) job-shop scheduling software that could schedule up to a quarter million jobs and 6.2 million operations within an hour. we designed the algorithm for scheduling and used list data structure for storing the resource availability. we used ousterhout matrix as a benchmark, which is popularly used for slot scheduling and shows that our approach significantly improves the runtime. our study highlights the implementation of data structures in job-shop scheduling problems.","job-shop scheduling, digitalization, frame work","In this research, we develop a set of algorithms for large-scale JSSP which considers many real-life constraints such as, daily working shifts, release and due dates for a job, multiple quantity of a resource, and calendar dates. Incorporating all these constraints in a real-time scheduling algorithm calls for developing a novel scheduling framework that simplifies the process for finding the valid timeslot and updating the quantity of each limited resource. We achieve it by developing algorithms for maintaining resource availability over the given time horizon, job prioritization, scheduling, and resource update. We also highlight the role of careful selection of data structures for storing and retrieving different information related to real-life scheduling. We selected Ousterhout Matrix as a benchmark and show that our approach significantly improves the runtime significantly. These all are novel contributions of this work, and our scheduling framework creates new opportunities for designing and selecting better dispatching rules for real-time large-scale scheduling. The importance of JIT scheduling is well recognized in manufacturing (Srinivasan et al., 1994). The advent of Industry 4.0, and the digitalization of manufacturing processes has enabled real-time interaction between digital and physical resources through “smart connections”, and manufacturing and production related data collection from disparate sources such as sensors, information and communication technologies, and monitoring instrumentation (Choi et al., 2022). However, the opportunities created by the digitalization of manufacturing processes using these technologies have not been leveraged to a large extent to improve the JIT manufacturing practices5. In this context, our research makes a novel contribution by developing a scheduling framework for real-life large-scale JSSP. In the current work we only use one dispatching rule, namely critical ratio, to demonstrate the promise of our framework in generating real-time scheduling. However, production scheduling must be designed to respond to real- 4 We used 100,000 operations here and have planned to share the results for larger instances in the conference presentation. 5 https://www.lean.org/the-lean-post/articles/why-lean-fails-in-job-shops-and-what-to-do-to-succeed/ 1928","a digitalization framework for real-time large-scale production scheduling neha kadu, shankar prawesh and avijit khanra department of management sciences, indian institute of technology, kanpur india nkadu@iitk.ac.in naoyuki fujiwara, yuichi koga and yosuke watanabe digital innovation headquarters, : 0360074 mitsubishi heavy industries, ltd., india","References

In other words, it has a clear automotive strategy and a structured ecosystem of suppliers that has proven to be highly effective both locally and in export markets. In 2023, the first Moroccan automaker emerged with the introduction of the first 100% Moroccan car brand, NEO. The company, Neo Motors, with Moroccan capital, established an industrial unit in Ain Aouda (in the Rabat-Salé- Kénitra region) to manufacture automobiles for the local and export markets, with a projected annual capacity of 27,000 units and a local integration rate of 65%. According to its founder, Nassim Belkhayat, the company's CEO, the company aims for an annual production of 15,000 vehicles within three years, along with the introduction of new electric models. Finally, the findings of the study underscore the crucial role of tool training in the effective implementation of Operational Excellence, as acknowledged by nearly all companies. The next three key success factors identified include training in change management, awareness sessions, and effective communication of vision and strategy. Conversely, the study results highlight those cultural aspects, the pursuit of quick gains, and the absence of a sustainability method stand out as the primary risk factors for the successful adoption of this concept. 1977","the impact of culture and national leadership on operational excellence maturity: case study of the automotive sector in morocco mohammed hamoumi, mariam benhadou and abdellah haddout industrial management and plastics forming technology team mechanics, engineering and innovation laboratory, lm2i, national high school of electricity and mechanics – ensem- hassan ii university, casablanca, morocco hamoumi@gmail.com, mariambenhadou@yahoo.fr, abdellahhaddout@yahoo.fr","References

Studies are consistently providing seamless approaches to handling the vast amount of data and are persuading the business community to shift from traditional methodologies to cloud data warehouses. Similarly, this paper has used an approach of thoroughly comparing the on-premises data warehouse and cloud data warehouse. The paper has reviewed the alternatives through a certain set of parameters and summarized the stances in a table. The modernization of the data warehouses has eventually paved the path to cloud strategy. Nonetheless, the case studies, the comparisons, and the optimization approaches tested on cloud data warehouses as compared to traditional data warehouses have certainly given an upper hand to cloud solutions. To further elucidate the dilemma between the data warehouse approaches services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon DynamoDB, Cloudera, Snowflake, Teradata, Apache Hive, and Microsoft Azure are growing their customers rapidly. It may be stated that the on-premises data warehouse provides its users with a greater sense of data security, however, the services that the cloud has been offering nullify the capabilities of an on-premises data warehouse. The functionalities of the cloud such as pay-as- you-go service, scalability, flexibility, backup services and cost-effectiveness have led the world with a very clear motive for what has to be the future of data warehouses.

Collections management emerges as a critical area for all organizations, as non-compliance with collection time can lead to serious financial problems. In such cases, companies often resort to applying for lines of credit, which involves the payment of high interest and fees, negatively impacting the companies' profitability or, in the worst-case scenario, leading to the company's bankruptcy. This study highlights that, before the implementation of RPAs, companies managed their collections every 88 days. Subsequently, thanks to the intervention of the bots, a successful remittance of 98% of the invoicing volume was achieved, reducing the collection period to every 30 days and obtaining a net recovery of 85%, compared to the initial 49%. In the specific case of this Mexican company, the implementation of automation not only represented a significant improvement in the process of sending invoices to debtors but also marked the birth of a new product that is now offered to other companies in sectors such as logistics, food, and beverages, among others. 2058","intelligent automation in the operational processes of a collection company in mexico: a strategic approach for pharmaceutical companies victor martin maldonado benitez, gabriela guadalupe escobedo guerrero esca santo tomás, instituto politécnico nacional méxico city, méxico vmaldonadob1500@alumno.ipn.mx, gescobedog@ipn.mx, gabrielaeg@hotmail.com brenda esmeralda moreno garduño esca santo tomás, instituto politécnico nacional, méxico city, méxico bmorenog1500@alumno.ipn.mx","References

Studies have shown that despite implementing measures such as traffic law enforcement, road safety education, and training requirements, the number of road accidents caused by human error and driving mistakes continues to rise (Publico 2022; Tucay 2016; MMARAS 2019). Through the integration of PMT and the Three Broad Domains of Ergonomics, this study aimed to understand how these factors affect the perceived safe-driving behavior of Filipino private car drivers.. The variables considered are driving experience (D), geographical perception (GP), level of understanding (LU), perceived vulnerability (PV), perceived severity (PS), perceived safe driving (PD), physical ergonomics (PE), cognitive ergonomics (CE), and macro ergonomics (ME). The variables are evaluated through Structural Equation Modeling, where the results show that the latent variables driving experience, geographical perception, level of understanding, perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, physical ergonomics, and cognitive ergonomics were identified as factors that has a significant impact to the perceived safe driving behavior of Filipino Private car drivers. Among these latent variables, perceived vulnerability is determined to be the most significant factor to perceived safe driving behavior with a beta value of ß = 0.845 and p- value of p = 0.006. However, macroergonomics shows an insignificant effect on Filipino private car drivers' perceived safe driving behavior. Üzümcüoğlu, Y. 2020 stated that macro-ergonomic factors may not directly influence a driver’s perception of safety as it only contributes to the overall safety of the driving environment and has nothing to do with the driver’s specific driving behaviors. Given these results, the accepted hypotheses established are as follows: H1: Driver Experience has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. H2: Driver Experience has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. H3: Geographical Perception has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. H4: Geographical Perception has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers.H5: Level of understanding of Traffic Policies has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. H6: Level of understanding of Traffic Policies has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. H7: Perceived Severity has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. H8: Perceived Vulnerability has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. H9: Physical Ergonomics has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. H10: Cognitive Ergonomics has a positive direct impact on the perceived severity of Filipino private car drivers. The study highlighted perceived vulnerability as the most significant factor that affects the perceived safe driving behavior of Filipino private car drivers. This is evident as drivers who believe that they are less vulnerable will undoubtedly engage in unsafe driving behaviors (Hu et al. 2020).","determining factors affecting perceived safe-driving behavior of filipino private car drivers john david bicera, nestor paul casipit, abigaile de jesus and yoshiki b. kurata department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd., 1015, manila, philippines johndavid.bicera.eng@ust.edu.ph, nestorpaul.casipit.eng@ust.edu.ph, abigaile.dejesus.eng@ust.edu.ph, ybkurata@ust.edu.ph",

235,A Fuzzy Multi-Objective Model For Green Closed-Loop  Supply Chain Network Design With Transshipment,"this paper is on designs a green closed-loop supply chain network considering economic factors and environmental concerns and interconnected facilities. over or under-achievement of forecasted supply, demand, and return, caused by the isolation of manufacturing and remanufacturing facilities (mrfs), can be compensated through lateral transshipment between mrfs. the decision variables are opening mrfs, environmental investment level for adopting clean technology in each mrf which is defined by linguistic variables, and the flow of products between nodes. environmental investment and selection of transportation modes play important roles in the concerned objectives. a fuzzy multi-objective mathematical programming model is proposed for the problem under inherent uncertainty of supply, demand, returns, costs, capacities in the network, imprecise co2 emission of transportation modes, and technology level. solving two numerical examples shows the applicability of the model in the real world with the selected best technological level of mrfs and the reduction of costs and co2 emission.",transshipment,"The issue of supply chain network design has been the focus of researchers in different ways. The various relationships between the main components of the supply chain network, the way of transportation between the components, the closed loop and attention to various social and environmental requirements are among the factors that have been mentioned in recent articles in this field. The problem of 5 echelons of the supply chain including suppliers, MRFs, customer zones, CIs, and disposal zones in which it is possible to return the product is the main issue studied in this article. This routine model, which has been previously discussed in various articles, can be examined from several aspects. First, what will be the transportation procedure between and within the echelons in terms of cost and pollution. Second, what is the level of technology chosen in MRFs in terms of cost and pollution. Thirdly, what pattern does the returned product from the customer return to the cycle? And fourth, whether there is a possibility of intra-echelon transfer. On the other hand, the uncertainty hidden in the parameters and limitations of the problem and the multi- targeting of the problem are other main aspects of the articles related to this field. This paper studies the integration of transshipment in supply chain network design with multiple suppliers, multiple manufacturing and remanufacturing facilities, multiple customer zones, multiple collection and inspection centers and disposal centers, under an imprecise/fuzzy environment. As an aspect that was observed to be lacking in the literature, in this paper lateral transshipment between MRFs is considered. Transshipment policies might improve customer satisfaction and responsiveness to customer demand in closed-loop supply chain. In order to mitigating transportation capacity uncertainty, we applied multi-mode transportation system. Multi-mode transportation system leads to reduce total costs and Co2 emission as well. The proposed supply chain network design includes environmental consideration in both transportation process and environmental technology level of MRF. Subjective parameter based on linguistic variables is another important aspect for interacting decision making based on cost and environmental variables. In this paper a multi objective mixed integer programming model is proposed for minimizing total cost and environmental influence. Since most of the parameters in such a problem have imprecise nature, a possibilistic programming is applied to dealing with epistemic parameters i.e., cost, and environmental influence. To solve the proposed MOPMILP model, an interactive fuzzy solution approach is proposed by combining the Jimenez and TH methods. The proposed framework provides the efficient solutions based on decision maker preferences to incorporate their expertise as well as their historical knowledge regarding the system under study into the model in order to obtain an optimal production network. By defining the variable of quantity of product shipped from MRF j to MRF j´, the amount of lateral transshipment was considered in the model. Based on the obtained results, by adding this variable and its equivalent constraints, compared to the case where there is no lateral transportation, in average the amount of 2103","sepideh aghajani phd, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering alzahra university tehran, iran aghajani69@ut.ac.ir mehdi seifbarghy associate professor, department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering alzahra university tehran, iran m.seifbarghy@alzahra.ac.ir","References

241,14Thannual International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management Dubai United Arab  Doi: 10.46254/An14.20240582,"this article aims to implement a security model in a maintenance company to reduce accidents. the main problem is the high number of accidents recorded in the maintenance area, specifically 28 accidents in a 6-month period. root causes are determined through a problem tree, and subsequently, tools such as the risk matrix, continuous iperc, and safety procedures are assigned. the model was implemented in medium and low voltage electrical work, where a higher level of risk was identified through the risk matrix, specifically in the maintenance activities of medium and low voltage electrical panels, as well as in illuminated signs. regarding the continuous iperc matrix, it was developed for the identification and description of hazards and their sources in activities classified as more hazardous found in the risk matrix evaluation. next, safety procedures were developed, with one for each more hazardous electrical job, detailing objectives, scopes, normative references, definitions, responsibilities, preventive measures, main procedure, ppe, and tools. by creating procedures for each hazardous activity, they were unified to form the main safety model. when implementing the model in the study company, results over two weeks showed a reduction in the number of accidents, thus achieving the main objective. the number of weekly accidents in the most hazardous electrical maintenance area decreased from 2 to 0. the uniqueness of this model lies in its specific focus on occupational safety in electrical work, particularly in medium and low voltage.","security, maintenance, electricity, accidents","and Future Research Using the risk matrix, it is concluded that the most hazardous activities in the maintenance area are those related to electrical work. This includes maintenance of low-voltage electrical panels, maintenance of medium-voltage electrical panels, maintenance work on illuminated signs at ground level, and/or using fixed or multidirectional scaffolding and hanging scaffolds. It is evident that challenges and risks associated with tasks such as electrical maintenance, or the installation of illuminated signs can be mitigated through specific measures. These actions help reduce the residual risk level to a point lower than the initial risk of the activity. The use of an IPERC matrix provides a clear representation of how these risks are anticipated and controlled, directly influencing the risk level associated with each task. It can be asserted that this anticipation is achieved by assigning preventive actions based on the established safety model. 2162",occupational safety model in maintenance operations: a case study of a service company marolim marcela chavez vasquez universidad de lima 20190477@aloe.ulima.edu.pe mateo bresani doig universidad de lima 20192491@aloe.ulima.edu.pe rafael mauricio villanueva flores universidad de lima rvillan@ulima.edu.pe,"References

In order to attain reliable outcomes, it is imperative to employ a combination of time and motion studies when doing work measurement. Prior to doing a time study, it is imperative to also take into account the motion study. Therefore, it may be argued that motion study serves as a fundamental framework for doing time study. As previously mentioned, time study is a method used to quantify the amount of time needed to complete a specific task by a predetermined process flow. The researchers conducted a study on bottleneck stations in order to reduce unnecessary time and enhance manufacturing output on the machine. The time required for each element was initially computed and afterward examined in order to identify any necessary modifications to be made to the machine. The examination of existing processes in a dairy milk-producing facility is conducted through the application of method study and layout techniques. Based on the preceding discourse, it can be inferred that the enhancement of the process may be achieved by the use of method study, optimization of work procedures, and effective usage of machinery. The proposed improvement has the potential to enhance the existing process by mitigating process complexity, lowering time requirements, and alleviating worker fatigue. Following the implementation of the recommended improvement strategies, the firm had a notable enhancement in production, with a significant rise of 27.77%.","enhancing productivity through the utilization of a work- measuring methodology mohammed a awadh department of industrial & systems engineering college of engineering king khalid university abha, aseer, saudi arabia mohalawadh@kku.edu.sa",

Younger workers are 3.1% more productive than older workers. Based on the author's experience in managing production shifts, it is evident that older workers get tired easily than younger workers when their jobs involve a lot of physical labor. Regression analysis of the data demonstrated the validity of this result. Suggestions were also given to the company to improve their productivity. The author would like to suggest a few improvements to improve the research outcomes. 1. Control more factors. Despite being the same in both work areas, the environment in this research is uncontrollable. Tiny changes in the variables under control may have an impact on the outcomes. 2. Apply a multiple level factor. The author's coded approach for this research has two levels for the factors, denoted by the codes +1 and -1. If the factors—noise at 70, 75, 82, 90, and 100 dB and age at 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 years old, the outcome may not be as clear-cut as ""younger workers are more productive.""

Recommendations have been made that SMEs should adopt TOE as a framework theory for basing the adoption of big data analytics. It is worth noting that the TOE framework theory is used when engineers and entrepreneurs want to adopt the implement big data analytics. The growth in the publications in the Scopus databases shows that researchers are writing about this topic. During COVID-19 times the has been a sharp growth of the research in this discipline. This is a result of lockdowns and the number of data created during that time as many people did most of the things on the internet. The country under study, South Africa is in the top 12 countries that have contributed significantly to this country. However, it remains the lowest contributor on the top 12 list. The country can do more in terms of increasing publication because it has a high number of SMEs and this presents an opportunity for more research. Furthermore, South Africa has a presidential task team on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. It is worth noting that the Fourth Industrial Revolution includes big data. They should be invested energy in the adoption of big data by SMEs and research should be done on this topic. Future studies should focus on action research where the TOE framework theory is tested for its effectiveness when adopted and implemented by SMEs implementing big data analytics.","technology-organisation-environment framework theory for adopting and implementing big data analytics: a bibliometric analysis study lawrance seseni department of business management college of business and economics university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg, rsa sesenilawrance@gmail.com charles mbohwa & nelson sizwe madonsela department of quality and operations management postgraduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg, rsa cmbohwa@gmail.com, nmadonsela@uj.ac.za",

277,14Thannual International Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management Dubai United Arab  Doi: 10.46254/An14.20240652,"at present, debates addressing climate change, fossil fuel depletion, and energy saving highlight the need for a more sustainable built environment to reduce energy consumption and emission trends in the building sector. with a primary focus on commercial buildings in sri lanka, where heating ventilation and air conditioning (hvac) systems account for a significant portion of electricity usage, this research investigates into the underexplored area of airside efficiency strategies. for this purpose, a comprehensive literature synthesis was conducted, and a qualitative research approach using a semi-structured interview survey was conducted targeting 17 experts. the collected data was then analysed using content analysis. the findings of the research revealed 17 strategies under 3 categories namely, air handling unit (ahu) optimisation, system design and layout optimisation, and cooling system optimisation. key strategies identified are, the installation of efficient ahu filters, variable air volume (vav) system implementation, advanced controls and automation, reduction of coil losses, variable speed drive (vsds) installation, a control system addressing varying loads, night purging and air distribution and balancing. the knowledge gathered through this study can be used by respective industry professionals to enhance hvac energy performance, while it will also help the academia to research more on this sub-branch of hvac system in the sri lankan context.","airside efficiency, energy efficiency","In Sri Lanka, the building service that uses the most energy in a commercial building is HVAC. It combines elements of both waterside and airside systems, and at the moment, energy-efficient techniques are primarily applied to waterside systems because they have larger and more numerous components. Nevertheless, implementing waterside- only energy efficiency measures will only result in approximately 60% of energy savings; the remaining 40% can be attained by implementing airside-only energy efficiency measures, as the combined effect of both systems will result in savings for the HVAC system as a whole. Even though this is already adopted in developed countries, this is an area, in which commercial buildings in Sri Lanka are lagging in. Thus, this research was intended to explore the strategies to enhance the energy efficiency of HVAC Airside systems of commercial buildings in Sri Lanka. Altogether, 17 strategies were identified from this study to enhance energy efficiency of HVAC Airside system. Out of it, 11 are from the literature review, and they are namely, installation of an efficient AHU filter, efficient AHU fan system, airside economizer, heat recovery wheel, efficient ducting system design, installation of VAV system, efficient AHU selection, Pre-cooled Air Conditioning System, Demand Control Ventilation, advanced controls and automation and optimal start-stop mechanism. Additionally, six strategies were discovered from the research findings, and they are, reducing coil losses, installation of VSD, installation of a control system to meet varying loads, air distribution and balancing, and night purge ventilation. The conclusion of the literature analysis and expert insights underscores several key strategies pivotal for enhancing the energy efficiency of HVAC Airside systems. Among these, the installation of efficient AHU filters, implementation of VAV systems, adoption of advanced controls and automation, reduction of coil losses, installation of VSD, implementation of a control system addressing varying loads, air distribution and balancing, enthalpy controlling and embracing night purging emerge as central pillars. These strategies, consistently highlighted across diverse literature and emphasised by experts, collectively form a robust foundation for advancing energy-efficient practices in the realm of HVAC airside optimisation. Furthermore, it can be concluded from the research findings that all identified strategies are applicable to the Sri Lankan context and will facilitate commercial buildings to reach energy efficiency levels, hence mitigating the existing energy wastages of the HVAC system.","strategies to enhance energy efficiency of hvac airside system of commercial buildings in sri lanka p a p y gajaba and piumi dissanayake department of facilities management university of moratuwa, sri lanka pranidhig@uom.lk, piumid@uom.lk",

The Uncanny Valley appears to be a distinct factor in most of the survey respondents' minds. There seems to be a general acceptance of robots and for the physical capability of those robots. Moving arms, walking, and talking all were viewed fairly favorably. Humanlike appearance and full human-like robots were viewed much less favorably. Knowledge of specific humanoid robots and age played a factor in the responses the survey takers provided, but the results are very clear. The survey takers have shown that they want their robots to not look too much like an actual human.","the subjective idea of the physical appearance of a humanoid robot steven brownlee department of electrical and computer engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa sbrownlee@ltu.edu dr. george pappas assistant professor and director msai department of electrical and computer engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa gpappas@ltu.edu",
