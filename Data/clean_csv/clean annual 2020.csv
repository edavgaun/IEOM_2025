0,Analysis Model Of Communication Network  Under Complexity,"communication among members in an organization is an important research aspect in organizational processes. therefore, our research is based on communication networks and a series of studies is developed by applying the information theory and the markov chain to construct quantitative models that can grasp information distribution for infinitely repeated communication in an organization. however, the constructed models mainly focus on the aspect of randomness in information processing, and do not sufficiently deal with the concept of fuzziness. dual aspects of ambiguity exist for both randomness and fuzziness in human information processing complexity, which cannot be overlooked when discussing organizational communication. this study considers a memory communication channel, and proposes an estimation model for both randomness and fuzziness to analyze the prior information allocation ratio to each member in two different organizations. additionally, we conduct positive analyses on a communication network with isomorphic and non-isomorphic structures, and suggest an inter-organizational communication and the role among members of the organization. 78",,,"nyunho jung faculty of regional management, the university of fukuchiyama 3370, azahori, fukuchiyama-city, kyoto prefecture, japan jung-nyun-ho@fukuchiyama.ac.jp takaaki kawanaka institute for innovation in international engineering education, graduate school of engineering the university of tokyo 7-3-1 hongo, bunkyo-ku, tokyo, japan kawanaka@cce.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp hiroshi yamashita department of commerce, meiji university 1-1 kanda-surugadai, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan hyamas@meiji.ac.jp",
1,Systematic Review Of Literature On Lean And Six Sigma In  Healthcare And Directions For Future Research,"healthcare organizations have increasingly turned to lean and six sigma (lss) as management systems to achieve quality and efficiency in patient care. this study aims to classify this body of literature and to discover factors that enable and prevent successful lss implementations. peer-reviewed literature in journals that were published through 2018 in english language were sought through a search of multiple databases. the inclusion criterion was broad in that all areas of healthcare and interpretations of lss were considered. the literature search yielded 368 publications. one third of the studies present a u.s. affiliation and only 19% has been conducted in developing countries. the case study is the most popular study type but only represents around 52% of the body of literature. lean and the ed are preferred approach and setting, respectively. factors that enable and prevent successful implementation were grouped by managerial, preparation, people, and project relationships. there is a need for future literature to provide a longitudinal balanced view on the benefits and challenges of implementations, and for studies to follow experimental designs for statistical validity. this is the most inclusive review about lss in healthcare as it includes different study types, healthcare settings and lss tools together. 80",,,"rodrigo e. peimbert-garcía aschool of engineering and sciences tecnologico de monterrey monterrey, nl 64849, mexico rodrigo.peimbert@tec.mx bschool of engineering macquarie university sydney, nsw 2109, australia rodrigo.peimbert@mq.edu.au timothy matis department of industrial engineering texas tech university lubbock, tx 79409, usa. timothy.matis@ttu.edu jonathan cuevas-ortuño school of engineering and sciences tecnologico de monterrey guadalajara, jal 45138, mexico jonathan.cuevas@tec.mx samuel m. nucamendi-guillen department of industrial engineering universidad panamericana guadalajara, jal 45010, mexico. snucamendi@up.edu.mx","References

The optimization process considers random process shifts instead of a single or a few shift values, which is more realistic from a practical viewpoint. The optimization process also ensures that the false alarm rate of the designed chart will not be increased, and extra inspection resources will not be needed. The proposed optimal economic EWMA chart outperforms (in terms of total expected cost per unit time) the traditional economic X chart, the optimal economic X chart, and the traditional economic EWMA chart by about 109%, 23%, and 95%, respectively, which highlights the importance of optimization design of the control charts. In this study, the optimal economic EWMA chart is designed for monitoring shifts in the process mean. Future research can consider shifts in both process mean and variance, and the randomness of the process shift can also be characterized by using other distributions such as uniform distribution instead of Rayleigh distribution.","mohammad shamsuzzamana sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah 27272, united arab emirates amshamsuzzaman@sharjah.ac.ae salah haridyb sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group. department of industrial engineering and engineering management, university of sharjah, sharjah 27272, united arab emirates. benha faculty of engineering, benha university, benha, egypt. bsharidy@sharjah.ac.ae imad alsyoufc and hamdi bashird sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah 27272, united arab emirates cialsyouf@sharjah.ac.ae; dhbashir@sharjah.ac.ae",

7,Modeling A Bi-Objective Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained  Project Scheduling Problem To Minimize Project Makespan,"in most of the multi-objective multi-skill resource-constrained project scheduling (mo-msrcpsp) research works, it has been assumed that a staff member is able to exhibit different skills with the same proficiency or expertise. however, this is not true in real life. usually, a person possessing various skills may be expert in one (or two) skill(s) but may only be moderately trained for performing other skills. the assignments of persons with less-skilled levels have to be kept as low as possible to achieve satisfactory quality targets. under this motivation, this paper develops a mathematical model for a msrcpsp with two objectives. in addition to the regular objective of minimizing the makespan, the second objective aims at minimizing the total time elapsed with the less-skilled resource assignments defined as ‘skill divergence span’. a weighted sum teaching-learning-based optimization (tlbo) algorithm is employed to solve this complex problem. in addition to the tlbo, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (ga) is also developed as an alternative metaheuristic for the comparison purposes. the computational results are performed on 36 test instances with varying level of skill factors, resource strength and network complexity. the average % deviation from critical path based lower bound obtained is comparatively lower for the mo-tlbo as compared to the mo- ga. it is 62.17% for the proposed mo-tlbo while for mo-ga its value is 75.11% which shows that tlbo is an effective metaheuristic for solving such problems.",,"This paper investigates a scarcely treated work in literature about multi-objective multi-skilled resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MO-MSRCPSP) by considering mixed skill proficiencies. A multi-objective mathematical formulation is presented for this problem which aims to minimize two time estimates; the project makespan and the total time elapsed with less-skilled resource assignments which has been conceptualized as total skill divergence span (SDS). To solve this complex problem, a priori-approach based on weighted-sum or scalarization method is used. The weights given to makespan and SDS function are 0.7 and 0.3 respectively which can be arbitrarily modified by decision maker. To solve this problem, two metaheuristics have been proposed namely MO-TLBO and MO-GA. The test instances developed for the MSRCPSP have been suitably modified with mixed proficiency levels of the staff members. The comprehensive test results reveal that the MO-TLBO has performed significantly better than the MO-GA and can be an effective metaheuristic for solving such real life problems.","and skill divergence span dheeraj joshi associate professor, deptt. of mechanical engineering, swami keshvanand institute of technology, management & gramothan, jaipur dheerajjoshi25@gmail.com m.l. mittal professor, deptt. of mechanical engineering, malaviya national institute of technology, jaipur mlmittal.mech@mnit.ac.in manish kumar research scholar, deptt. of mechanical engineering, malaviya national institute of technology, jaipur m81manishkumar@gmail.com",
8,An Investigation On Assessing Process Capability  Indices Under Weibull Distribution,"process capability indices (pcis) are widely-used statistical quality control tools for measuring process performance. in manufacturing industries, pcis can be used to help companies stay competitive by providing understanding of process capability and guidance for quality improvement. however, the normality assumption for traditional pcis, such as p c and pk c , might be violated in real-world manufacturing processes, and this can lead to erroneous conclusions of process capability and eventually financial losses for companies. hence, many researchers modify existing pcis or construct new pcis to evaluate the performance of non-normal processes. given various non-normal pcis that have been proposed, there is an interesting in knowing how well these methods are, and there are demands for a proper comparative analysis. in this study, we investigate four non-normal pcis, npk c , s c , y c and py c . we first compare these pcis in terms of their capability to reflect true process yields under different parameter combinations of weibull distribution, then examining their magnitude of estimation biases when implemented in different sample sizes. the result shows that y c is the most exceptional among the four pcis in the above two aspects, and has a recommended sampling size of 50 or more. moreover, we employ a well-known inference approach, bayesian inference with markov-chain monte carlo (mcmc), to review the sampling variation derived from parametric estimation of the weibull distribution. a series of simulations for establishing mcmc credibility intervals is conducted on y c with the adaptive rejection metropolis sampling (arms) algorithm. the coverage rates and average widths of credibility intervals are adopted as two criteria to assess the accuracy and precision of the mcmc method, respectively. it turns out that the mcmc credibility intervals perform satisfactorily in different sample sizes and under various parameter combinations of weibull distribution.",,,"chun-yi chang department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, taiwan jasonzhang19950602@gmail.com chien-wei wu department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university hsinchu, taiwan cweiwu@ie.nthu.edu.tw",
9,Developing A Two-Stage Sampling Plan For Products  With An Unilateral Specification Limit,"acceptance sampling plan is a statistical tool of quality control. it is a well-considered decision system that meets both consumers and producers need for product quality. the purpose of acceptance sampling plan is to provide a decision-making guideline, whether or not the lot is likely to be accepted. many efforts were directed to make sure that we are meeting the requirement in the most cost-efficient way. a common practice is single acceptance sampling plan, because of its simplistic. however, with its simplistic comes with a downside that a larger sample size is usually required to avoid making a judgment mistake, because there is only a chance to sentence the lot. in this paper, for the expectation of reducing the required sample size, we propose a two-stage sampling plan to give a questionable lot another chance of inspecting samples before deciding to accept or reject the lot. the propose plan is designed on the basis of one-sided capability index with the assumption of the quality characteristic follows a normal distribution. the concept of two-stage sampling is that decisions in the second-stage sampling inspection is independent to the first-stage sampling inspection, having the desired to operate on variables inspection. the optimal parameters are determined by optimization of the design model, which minimizes the average sample number (asn) and satisfies the producer's and the consumer's risks at the specified quality levels. the utility of the proposed sampling plan is shown through comparison with the single sampling plan in terms of sample size required for inspections under various combinations of quality levels and required risks. the result indicates that two-stage sampling plan involves smaller required sample than that corresponding to the single sampling plan. thus, the propose plan proceeds towards to help practitioners efficiently sentence the submitted lots.","oc curve, process yield 108",,"yu-ting won department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university, hsinchu, taiwan email: hotpizza9889@gmail.com chien-wei wu department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university, hsinchu, taiwan email: cweiwu@ie.nthu.edu.tw",
10,Optimal Operation Policies For Vendor Machines With  Product Dedicated Variant Towers,"in recent years, the level of competition extremely increased for all markets. due to globalization, similar products and services are offered by many players. in order to become stronger in this competitive environment, all players must act strategically and enhance their supply chain management activities. some companies try to extend their market share from wholesale level to retail and lower levels. this strategy forces companies to reach customers by vendor machines. the aim of this study is to develop a mathematical model to optimally manage operations of vendor machines carrying multi-items located at different locations. the considered problem handles pricing, routing, inventory management and capacity planning problems. we seek an optimal solution that will answer the following research questions: (1) which items should be available at each location and how many towers should be allocated for those items? (2) what should be the optimum inventory level of these items at the beginning of each period? (3) shall there be any item transfer between locations at each period of time? (4) what should the price for each item at each location and at each time period be? our model considers the uncertainty in demand of the items with the help of scenarios. the proposed model is checked by several functional tests to verify that the model works properly and gives the expected results. by conducting numerical experiments, we understand that our model provides efficient solutions to the problem with uncertainties. we also compare the results of the model with the results of a heuristic approach. when compared with the mathematical model, heuristic approach does not produce efficient results for the locations without direct link to the supply centers. the results support usage of the proposed mathematical model.","vendor machine, dynamic pricing, istanbul",,"assoc. prof. dr. ertan yakici industrial engineering department turkish naval academy, national defense university i̇stanbul, turkey eyakici@dho.edu.tr haci sahin, prof. dr. serhan duran industrial engineering department middle east technical university ankara, turkey",

A random demand over a ﬁnite planning horizon that must be satisfied by production system with a required service level defined by the stakeholders. With this in mind, analytical models have been developed to establish combined sub-optimal lot-sizing and preventive maintenance plans that optimize the total costs of lot-sizing, maintenance, consumed energy and inventory with regard to different constraints. Besides, to overcome the unforeseeable circumstance making some machines unavailable and unable to meets demands, a novel risk assessment is presented to assist the company to choose the appropriate subcontractor cost. The proposed approach has been illustrated clearly through a numerical example with five machines over six months of production horizon.

Failure to consider the factors affecting to the building fire incidents leads to under-performance of existing fire safety system in the building and it endangering human lives. This research paper presented the findings on factors affecting to the fire incidents in buildings. An extensive literature review was undertaken to explore the behaviour of building fire, hardware and software measures of fire safety, models for building fire impact evaluation, global fire incidents in different buildings and factors affecting to the building fire incidents. Findings of the paper review behaviour of building fire through classic fire concept and tetrahedron concept and involvement of hardware and software measures in building fire safety. Structural behaviour, material of construction, physical barriers, earth leakage devices, surveillance system, automatic fire suppression system, staircase pressurisation system and signage were recognised as hardware measures. Software measures are consisted with human monitoring, maintenance of mechanical and electrical systems, trained occupants, maintenance of fire barriers and evacuation drills. Early fire detection was recognised as an important preliminary firefighting method which includes ultraviolet and infrared detectors, particle sampling, relative humidity sampling, smoke analysis, temperature sampling and transparency testing. Further, existing models for building fire impact evaluation, such as CMFST, BFSEM, BAW, FSES, FSCT, GFRM and ICIM were examined as a detailed analysis methods for building fires. Different fire incidents in different building structures were also reviewed and the highest fire rates relative to population were found in Australia, Bulgaria and Israel. Asian region was identified as the second highest region with fire safety non-compliance and fire was identified as the second highest disaster topology in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, factors affecting to the fire incidents in building were recognised through various real fires in building worldwide. Building design features, refurbishment practices, human behaviour, fire regulation, policies and building codes, fire tools and techniques and perceptions of architects and fire protection engineers were evaluated as factors. 10.

14,Identifying The Most Influencing Success Factors Of Tqm  Implementation In Manufacturing Industries Using,"tqm implementation serves the purpose of achieving business excellence which eventually leads to customer satisfaction, increased profits and higher production for the organization. the purpose of this paper is to investigate the most important success factors of tqm and study its comparative importance for enhanced execution in manufacturing industries. in this study a broad literature review was done to identify and prepare the list of success factors for sustaining tqm implementation. analytic hierarchy process is used to assign the relative importance and ranking the identified success factors of tqm in perspective manufacturing industries. the finding of study demonstrates that ‘top management commitment’ ranked number one and this factor is fundamental for implementing tqm initiatives successfully. the success factors ‘education and training’ and ‘rewards & recognition’ ranked at second and third positions which need special attention while performing tqm activities in a more effective manner. the results also propose a general hierarchy model for judging the relative importance of success factors that would influence implementation of tqm.","success factors, manufacturing",,"analytical hierarchy process pardeep gupta1, ankesh mittal2 1,2 department of mechanical engineering, sant longowal institute of engineering and technology, longowal, sangrur (punjab), india-148106 pardeepmech@yahoo.co.in, ankeshmittal07@gmail.com",
15,"Assessment Of Safety Culture In Three Selected Thermal  Power Plants Situated In Sylhet, Bangladesh","hazards, accidents and ill management in thermal power plants have a big impact on business, whether it's due to reduced productivity, lost sales, lower staff morale, or even closure. to prevent and/or mitigate workplace injuries, hazards, accidents and to improve productivity, it is needed to establish safety culture practice in the entire management system. use of safety signs is one of the ways for controlling hazards in the work environment. safety signs are widely used to effectively control workplace hazards. in this research, different safety culture factors were taken from ohsas 18001:2007 standard. the objective of this study was to assess the safety culture factors in three selected thermal power plants namely sylhet 150 mw combined cycle power plant, fenchuganj 90 mw combined cycle power plant and bibiyana south 400 mw combined cycle power plant. this research work describes the key factors of organizational health and safety management system. the research also measures the existing safety practice performance of the three selected thermal power plants. the collected data were analyzed to explore research findings. lastly recommendations were made to take corrective actions to improve existing safety culture practice in the three selected thermal power plants situated in sylhet, bangladesh.","safety culture, safety signs, weighted average","This study has tried to assess the current safety culture scenarios in three selected gas turbine thermal power plants. As for Sylhet 150 MW Power Plant, OH&S management system, OH&S management organogram and OH&S objectives are missing in this power plant. Those are few prime necessities for establishing a good safety culture in Sylhet thermal power plant. Health and safety hardware (e.g. PPEs), Health and safety training, Health and safety incentives etc. should also be increased in this power plant. All equipment need to be tested periodically as per the Factory act 2015. Emergency evacuation paths should be established, and mock drills conducted should be increased. In Fenchuganj 90 MW thermal power plant, OH&S management system, OH&S management organogram and OH&S objectives Should be established. Number of fire drill, mock drill and vertigo training should be increased in Fenchuganj 90 MW thermal power plant. Trees and other vegetation closer to live conductors, transformers and other equipment should be trimmed and cleared. Light and sound intensity need to be measured as per Factory Rule 2015. Management review of the existing safety culture practice is also necessary for continuous improvement of safety culture in Fenchuganj 90 MW thermal power plant. Bibiyana South 400 MW Power Plant has the best safety culture practice among the three studied thermal power plants.

17,The Relationship Of Tqm And Lean Production Towards  Integrated Application,"total quality management (tqm) and lean production (lp) have been considered as emerging world-class manufacturing strategies to meet the increasing demands of customers for product quality at competitive price. however, their overall and detailed association has not been fully explored by earlier studies. the objective of this study is to describe the overall and detailed relationship of tqm and lp. the result is envisioned to give meaningful insights for academicians on the inter-relatedness of tqm and lp as well as for industry practitioners on the potential implementation synergy of tqm and lp towards an integrated application, as one system or program. the study was conducted using the philippine electronics and semiconductor industry as the locale, and employee respondents as the unit of analysis. pearson test of correlation was used to test the relationship between tqm and lp. result showed that the overall relationship of tqm and lp is strongly positive and significant. however, when the relationships are compared at detailed levels, the extent of relationship varies. continuous improvement and striving for perfection strongly bind tqm and lp while benchmarking, supplier quality management and pull production do not strongly support the association of tqm with lp.","lean production, systems thinking","and recommendation. The results of this study also have empirical implications. The validity and reliability of the developed LP instrument in this study proved that Womack and Jones’s framework (the 5 principles of Lean) is empirically valid and that this can be used as instrument for Lean measures in survey studies. This proof may also provide further confidence to industrial consultants and practitioners on the applicability of the Lean framework as the forefront in developing, implementing and sustaining Lean practices. Another implication is the establishment of the significant relationship between TQM and LP which empirically validated the interrelatedness of TQM and LP. This study also forwarded information on the gaps (weak items and aspects), constraints (weak relationships) and difference in the implementation of TQM and LP. As an implication, companies may need to focus on these aspects in a continuous improvement perspective. On the other hand, this study also forwarded on which aspects companies may need to use as leverage (strong items, aspects and relationships) to successfully implement TQM and LP.","romulo n. ulibas tarlac state university romulo bvd. san vicente tarlac city, philippines romulonulibas@gmail.com",
18,Impact Of ‘Check Sheet’ And ‘Flow Chart’ To Improve Quality And  Efficiency Of Finishing Unit In A Garment Industry,"rapid development of textile enterprises in bangladesh led the sector competitive both locally and internationally. however, to ensure competitive advantages, textile industries are applying modern approaches to enhance overall productivity growth, product quality, standardization, efficiency and effectiveness, reduction of manufacturing cost etc. to recover the enterprise fall down to critical point due to effects of liberal policies in international markets. recently, various total quality management (tqm) tools are playing important role as a function of modern approaches. tqm tools are practical methods, skills, means or mechanisms that can be applied to particular tasks. in this study, two tqm tools, ‘check sheet’ and ‘flow chart’ (or run chart) are used in finishing unit of a garment industry in bangladesh to find out the ways to mitigate significant amount of alter, rework, rejection and improve quality and efficiency. here, check sheet is used to count the number of defects for the selected items. then, counter measures against the root causes is defined and implemented to improve the quality as well as to reduce the rework. finally, a flow chart is developed. after several analyses, it is found that, in finishing unit, rejection or scrap decreases by 29.29%, alter or defect per hundred unit (dhu) decreases by 44.60% and significant amount of alter, rework and rejection or scrap per style, per month is minimized without any additional investment but by proper utilization of internal resources.","just-in-time (jit), lean manufacturing, operation layout, line efficiency","This study has extracted an overall scenario of the finishing unit of a garments factory in the context of improving quality. The study found that there are some common and repetitive defects which happen almost every day during production. It is found that by implementing tools and the pillars of TQM, a garment factory can improve quality, efficiency, satisfy the employee by providing a good approach in creation of QM environment, introduction of employees to TQM, encouraging cooperation and teamwork. Analyzing the product quality and process by using the TQM tools can give a remarkable improvement by reducing defect and rework.

21,Liveability Concept For Development Of Urban Built  Environment: Case Of Sri Lanka,"globally, urban development has been limited to improvements in built environment. similarly, in sri lanka, compromise of the natural environment and inability to response real life expectations of inhabitants have rested the rigorous urban sprawl in a debatable position. therefore, need for a multi-disciplinary approach towards urban development was identified when implementing new development projects. a robust environment with affordable amenities, accessibility to services and environmentally sustainable community is recognised as a liveable city. thus, liveability is selected as a common platform to analyse this need, because liveability is the short-term suspense of inhabitants of cities of sri lanka; especially in colombo. for this study, a survey strategy is adapted by interviewing experts in sociology, ecology, town planning and architecture who are experienced in urban planning. a thematic analysis is steered on healthcare, security, stability, economy, infrastructure and environment. study reveals that most of liveability indicators related to sri lanka are significantly similar to that of global context, yet resettlement of slum households, waste management and restoration of the ecologically significant areas are context specific. moreover, attention to socio- economic aspects, environment and character of the city, availability, quality and proximity to services are significant when planning urban built environment.",liveability,"In a summary, the significant factors in terms of liveability, that add value to the expansion of urban built environment are identified based on the opinions of experts interviewed. Characteristics such as socio-economic aspects and environment and character of city, promote sustainability while characteristics such as inclusiveness through connectivity, services and other infrastructure represent resilience of the community. Thus, combining liveability concepts with urban built environment indirectly promote sustainability and resilience of the city in the long term. Accordingly, rather than carrying out constructions in urban areas with sole profitability view, the overall liveability of the area highly persuasive to make the constructions effective. The proper balance of the developments in the cities with public parks, housing, services ranging from water supply and electricity supply to schools and recreational areas is the key for the success of the business investments in the cities. Thus, attention to socio- economic aspects, environment and character of the city, availability, quality and proximity to the services are significant when planning and reshaping the urban built environment. Moreover, the connectivity of amenities and community through increasing walkability, public and private transportation and upgraded infrastructure which facilitate the mobility requirement is viewed as a highly significant yet an area that has not given adequate provisions when improving the urban built environment. 7.

22,Wind-Induced Damages On Roofs: Sri Lankan Case  Ekanayake B.J.,"although many studies have focused on identifying the single factors that cause wind-induced damages on roofs, the studies carried out in the sri lankan context mainly focus on the wind patterns in sri lanka and the damages to people and property. therefore, there is a need for pooling of expertise to identify the wind- induced damages to roof, strategies to mitigate them and challenges encountered to systematically adopting avenues in the sri lankan context. this study administered a qualitative approach. the extensive literature review was followed by semi structured interviews with 07 subject matter experts and data was analysed using manual content analysis. the findings revealed that roof is the most vulnerable building element to wind disaster, even in the sri lankan context. it also proved that location and topography, structures and vegetation around the building, proximity and the height of neighbouring buildings or structures, shape, elevation and height of the building, choice of roofing material and workmanship are the factors contributing to wind-induced damages on roof. strategies should be adopted considering these factors. reluctance to adhered to current standards and guidelines is the major challenge.","roof, winds","and Recommendations Roof has been identified as the most critical element vulnerable to wind-induced damages. Previous studies were more focused on identifying the factors, which determine the magnitude of the pressure acts on the roof due to wind forces. This study, which has adopted a qualitative approach contributes to the existing body of knowledge by identifying key factors that influence wind-induced damages on roofs due to wind speed and thus atmospheric pressure and additionally human related factors. These factors affirm why roof is the most critical element in the event of a wind related disaster. The study categorised the wind-induced damages on roof in to two main origins, namely environmental related and human related. Accordingly, it was also deduced that minimising damages on roofs due to wind can be done through proper land selection by avoiding high-wind susceptible areas and proper design and workmanship of roofs. Thus, the study reconfirms that both designers and workers have a greater role in minimising the impact of wind-induced damages on roofs. Further, in terms of the impact on the practice, the study would assist the building designers to consider appropriate measures when designing roofs.

Wickramarachchi","over the past decade, the increased global focus on sustainability forced organizations to integrate sustainability aspects into their supply chains. as a result, green vehicle routing optimization came into action to facilitate the reduction of adverse environmental impacts from distribution networks. this study presents a vehicle routing optimization model with the objectives of minimizing both operational cost and carbon emission considered in the form of a cost. study has been carried out in four stages: a critical review of literature on green vehicle routing problem (gvrp); development of a mathematical model to minimize operational cost and carbon emission cost; development and tuning of genetic algorithm (ga) to solve the problem formulation using benchmarked instances. the final output of the model developed from this study can be used by logistics service providers to design their transportation networks for optimizing the carbon emission reduction and cost reduction.","vehicle routing, meta-heuristics","& Limitations Over the past few decades, the concerns on Carbon emission reduction increased over the globe. Many governments and international environmental bodies came together in implementing policies and strategies to minimize the current emission rate. Vehicle routing optimization strategy is widely used for designing transportation networks to achieve operational cost minimizations and with the rise of sustainability considerations, a new branch of VRP emerged namely Green Vehicle Routing Problem. GVRP focuses on the minimization of negative environmental impacts resulted from transportation. With the current competition within the world, to achieve operational profits and environmental goals, organizations need to focus on the dual minimization of operational costs and environmental negativities. This study presents a mathematical model for achieving multiple objectives of operational cost reduction and Carbon emission reduction. The model has been developed as an extension of the study carried out by (E., et al., 2015) and researchers have been able to identify a computationally efficient GA by identifying parameter values i.e. tournament size as 5, generation size as 1000, mutation rate as 0.0025 that bring out the most optimum result in solving the mathematical model. This study can be considered as the first instance of using a tuned GA for solving multi-objective VRP. Analysis showcase that the highest reduction in the total cost is achieved when the tournament size is equal to 5, the size of the generation is equal to 1000 and when the mutation rate is 0.0025 where the average percentage reduction in the cost at these mentioned parameters is 58.3%. This study has been carried out based on the assumption that the vehicle fleet consists of homogenous vehicles only and by neglecting the impact from the road gradient for calculations. 8. Future Work With this researched a tuned GA has been experimented with a network consisting of a single depot and a homogenous vehicle fleet. Hence, for future work, it is suggested to carry out studies considering networks with multiple depots, heterogeneous vehicle fleets, and time-windows considerations. For future studies, considerations can also be placed on networks with stochastic demands.","department of industrial management university of kelaniya kelaniya, sri lanka erwiz2008@gmail.com, kasuniv@kln.ac.lk, ruwan@kln.ac.lk",
25,Model To Assess Consumer Switching Behaviour  Vahiny Sivakumaran And Suren Peter,"organizations invest considerable resources on consumer acquisition. therefore, retention of these consumers becomes crucial for them to build their market presence. consumer switching between competing products that provide standardized services may occur where consumers’ personal traits and psychological perceptions play the major role of switching intention rather than the service attributes. in order to counteract this behaviour, it is imperative that organizations understand the switching intentions of consumers. therefore, there is a need of an accurate model to assess switching behaviour. although several studies have used different models (i.e. push-pull-mooring migration model) and theories (i.e. theory of planned behaviour, prospect theory) to analyze switching behaviour they have not fully explained why switching takes place. use of personality traits to explain the gaps are limited. following a systematic review of the literature, the psychological approach of theory of planned behaviour and the five-factor model of personality was used to develop a conceptual model to assess switching behaviour. the model has been validated through expert opinion.","five-factor model, personality traits",Consumers switching between very similar product and services are majorly driven by the personality traits and other psychological factors. This study focused on developing a psychological model to assess the psychological perspective of consumer switching behaviour. A gap was established from existing literature as the models which explained consumer switching behaviour from a psychological approach did not use personality traits. It is believed the theoretical model developed following a systematic review of literature will be able to better explain consumer switching behaviour among similar products and services by conceptualizing one of the special cases where emotions play the major role than service attributes. The proposed model should be empirically validated in different contexts and can be developed further with different constructs to explain consumer switching behaviour for different contexts in the future.,"department of industrial management university of kelaniya kelaniya, sri lanka vahinys_im14056@stu.kln.ac.lk , suren@kln.ac.lk",
26,Optimal Ewma Chart For Monitoring Failure Rate  Salah Haridya,"this research proposes an optimal exponentially weighted moving average (ewma) control chart for monitoring the failure rate of buses in a transport company to improve the quality of service, avoid negative impacts and enhance the customers’ satisfaction. the charting parameters of the ewma chart, including the weighting parameter and the control limit, are optimized to achieve the best detection effectiveness. the proposed control chart is compared with the optimal np chart in terms of the average number of failures (anf) since the shift occurs until the control chart can detect it. failure data were obtained from the company for the implementation of the control charts. the results of the comparative study reveal that the ewma chart substantially outperforms the np chart, especially for detecting small and moderate shifts. it is very beneficial for the company to use an effective monitoring tool to guarantee continuous improvement and a high standard of efficiency.",control chart,"This research proposes an optimization design of the EWMA chart. The design algorithm optimizes the charting parameters of the EWMA chart so that the best overall performance can be achieved and, in the meantime, the constraint on the false alarm rate is satisfied. The main objective is to detect the increasing shifts in the failure rate as soon as possible. This will definitely help the decision-makers take a quick action to analyze the failure and recommend the required solutions. A performance assessment has been carried out between the optimal NP and EWMA charts. The results of the comparative study reveal that the optimal EWMA chart outperforms the optimal NP chart substantially for monitoring the failure rate of buses. Specifically, The EWMA chart is more effective than the NP chart by 67% in terms of ANF. This study highlights the importance of optimization design in control charts.

28,The Relationship Between Occupational Stress And Job  Performance: An Empirical Study In A South African,"as frontline service providers, the contact centre agents are bound to experience occupational stress with having to meet the customers’ demands and shareholders expectations. occupational stress is a growing problem that can cause significant cost to individual workers performance and that of the organization. studies performed on stress provide insight into patterns of stress level among various occupations such as that is the call centre of banks in south africa. new developments in managing job related stress emerge almost all the time and that should be an indication of just how much the topic of stress needs attention. the purpose of this study was to find the level of occupational stress and its relationship to work performance among contact centre agents working in a bank in south africa. the study used descriptive-correlational research design and the survey method was used to gather data regarding occupational stress. the respondents were the contact centre agents of south african banks. this study could well provide perception of occupational stress to the employees in the bank’s contact centre in south africa, and this may lead to better understanding of self-apprehension which can enable them to have a productive working environment.","occupational stress, contact centre, job performance",,"contact centre nokukhanya ndlovu department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa nokukhanya.g.ndlovu@gmail.com",
29,A Salient Feature For Enhancing The Detection Speed  Of Ewma Scheme,"this article proposes a salient feature to enhance the detection speed of the ewma scheme based on the power of the difference between the actual number and the target in-control number of nonconforming items. we refer to it as wewma scheme and show that the traditional ewma chart is a special case of the proposed scheme. we discuss the optimal design procedure of the scheme, including the determination of its charting parameters to ensure the best overall performance. the results reveal that the developed wewma scheme has better overall detection effectiveness than the traditional ewma chart. specifically, the former outperforms the latter by 35% for the tested cases under different specifications.","control chart, quality control","This article proposes a wEWMA control scheme for monitoring increasing shifts in proportion p of nonconforming items in a binomial model. The traditional binomial EWMA chart is just a special case of the proposed scheme. Our monitoring statistic uses (dt – d0)w instead of difference (dt – d0). By applying this salient feature, the wEWMA is able to considerably outperform its traditional counterpart for detecting p shifts much quickly in terms of AND in different scenarios. The binomial EWMA scheme is, in general, not as efficient as its generalized version, namely, the wEWMA scheme. As a result, the wEWMA scheme should replace the EWMA scheme for all SPM applications. This article assumes that the number of nonconforming items dt follows a binomial distribution with a known p0, and the shift δ follows a uniform distribution. Thus, studying the performance of the wEWMA scheme when dt and δ follow other distribution rather than the binomial and uniform, respectively, is worthwhile. Another prospective future work would be to investigate how the detection speed of the wEWMA scheme is affected when p0 is estimated from a limited number of samples.

31,An Advanced Transportation System Based On  Internet Of Things,"the improvement and reinforcement of logistics and freight distribution in cities can be achieved by managing the factors affecting deliveries in urban areas. traffic congestion and time windows of deliveries are the most critical factors in solving distribution planning problems and executing deliveries in an urban environment. traffic congestion affects the feasibility of delivery schedules and should be taken into account during the initial scheduling, as well as during the execution of deliveries. time windows should be ensured during the initial scheduling of deliveries, but any rescheduling should guarantee that this restriction is not violated. contemporary software technology can assist the scheduling and execution of freight distribution in cities. logistics companies could exploit technologies, such as cloud computing (cc) and the internet of vehicles (iov) for optimizing the efficiency of their deliveries. real-time data of traffic flow and speed of vehicles, collected from sensors, can improve the accuracy of deliveries and increase customer satisfaction. alongside, the significant volume of data can be stored, processed and utilized, through cc. this technology can quickly provide information and take real-time control over critical processes, to ensure efficiency. the scope of this paper is to describe the architecture of a cloud- based transportation system. the system integrates routing and traffic forecasting algorithms with cc and iov technologies. the functionality of the system includes the initial, static scheduling of deliveries and the routing of the vehicles. it takes into account the time-windows of the customers and the feasibility of the schedules based on traffic congestion forecasts. besides, the system collects real-time data of the current situation of the trucks and the real conditions of the traffic in the streets of the city, in order to reschedule the deliveries, if it detects an expected violation of the time windows.",cloud computing,"and Further Research The proposed architecture of the transportation system incorporates the current trends in the application of industry 4 in supply chain and logistics. It integrates static data for vehicle routing and scheduling and real-time data for monitoring and rescheduling of routes, avoiding inconsistences in the schedules. It is a decision support system that can offer efficiency in the delivery of goods and keep in a high level the customer satisfaction of its users. Cloud computing is used in order to build and provide the system for decision making in routing and scheduling operations of logistics companies or generally of companies that need to prepare their distribution plans in urban areas. The development of the designed system is part of an ongoing research project carried out by the Industrial Engineering Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens in partnership with a software company.

32,"A Practical Tool For Scheduling Interrelated Activities  Hamdi Bashir, Salah Haridyb, Mohammad Shamsuzzamanc, Imad Alsyoufd,","the issue of scheduling interrelated product development activities is important and of particular concern to project managers. to help them with this issue, several studies have proposed methods for scheduling interrelated activities. however, these methods are of limited practicality because of their complexity and because they require input information that is difficult to obtain in the beginning stage of product development. this paper introduces interpretive structural modelling (ism) technique as an alternative tool for scheduling interrelated activities. for the demonstration, the technique is applied to real-world project data adapted from the literature. the results show that ism can be considered as a promising practical tool for scheduling interrelated activities.",scheduling,"In today’s highly competitive environment, product development companies face intense competition and shorter product life cycles, requiring the development of high-quality products at a rapid pace. In such an environment, production development projects often involve a myriad of interrelated activities, and the schedule of these activities can significantly affect the project’s success. To assist design mangers with this issue, researchers have proposed several scheduling methods. However, these methods have limited practicality. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposed using the ISM technique for scheduling project activities. For demonstration, the technique was applied to a real product development project adapted from the literature. The performance evaluation of using this technique as a scheduling tool would be one of the directions for further research. Last but not least, the practicability of the approach was demonstrated using published real data project. The results of this demonstration could encourage practitioners and researchers to test further the practicality of the approach on more real-world projects Acknowledgments The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Sustainable Engineering Asset Management (SEAM) Research Group, University of Sharjah.","sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group department of industrial engineering and engineering management, university of sharjah, sharjah 27272, united arab emirates. ahbashir@sharjah.ac.ae; bsharidy@sharjah.ac.ae; cmshamsuzzaman@sharjah.ac.ae; dialsyouf@sharjah.ac.ae",

35,A Knowledge Transfer Model To Implement Lean Practices  For Apparel Industry Based Multi-Stakeholder 3Pls,"warehousing plays an important role in the logistics sector in order to facilitate economic and business benefits for both parties including customer and the service provider. 3pl (third-party logistics) service providers are specialized in providing end-to-end logistics solutions including warehousing, transportation and distribution to their multi-stakeholders in various sectors (apparel, fmcg). lean knowledge transferring process from 3pls to their apparel based multi-stakeholders is a kind of challenging process for both parties due to several factors. the way of transferring and receiving knowledge is directly affected by the success of any business. in this research, a framework is developed on the perspective of 3pls by examining the factors that affect effective knowledge transferring on lean practices for their clients. based on these, the model which consists of relevant factors named extent of lean practices, capabilities of the source and the recipient and the relationship between them are providing a clear roadmap to the service provider and their stakeholders. the proposed model will help the 3pl service provider to identify critical success factors for sharing the knowledge of lean practices effectively. also, it facilitates the successful collaboration with the multi-stakeholders and finally it helps to improve the overall warehouse operational performance.",lean practices,"The purpose of this study is to develop a model to transfer knowledge on lean practices effectively from 3PL service providers to multi-stakeholders in the apparel sector. Hence, the model is providing a roadmap to both parties to identify the factors which are affecting for effective transfer. Sharing knowledge, experiences, values is one of the best practices to gain a competitive advantage in the industry. It is a vital need to find out existing capabilities and pitfalls in the organization in order to improve service efficiency. Although there are many knowledge-sharing models available in various contexts, still there is a lack of developing an appropriate model to transfer lean knowledge in warehousing field. Different authors have focused on critical success factors which are affecting knowledge sharing and developed conceptual frameworks to share explicit and tacit knowledge within the organization. The proposed model goes beyond it to scrutinize the factors involved in sharing knowledge with external multi-stakeholders of the company. Hence the model is very important for both parties to improve their service level. The proposed model of the study is based on the assumptions that the selected 3PL service providers are using lean practices for their operations and have enough capability to share knowledge with the recipient. In addition to that, selection of knowledge recipient companies of respective 3PL provider is based on their revenue generation and that company has already implemented lean practices into their operations. The model is recommended to validate through multiple case studies and expert reviews.

36,A Literature-Based Survey On Industry 4.0 Technologies  For Procurement Optimization,"to survive in the market and acquire a competitive edge, industries need to invest in advanced technology. however, most companies fail due to poor integration of technology in their supply chain. the concept of procurement 4.0 has emerged to optimize supply chain performance developing new value propositions and meeting new business needs. it is the integration of industry 4.0 concepts in procurement. although industry 4.0 concepts have been studied in different industrial contexts, a limited number of researches have been conducted on the use of emerging technologies such as internet of things (iot), robotic process automation (rpa), big data and cognitive analytics, artificial intelligence (ai) and cloud technologies, etc. in relation procurement while more existing researchers have focused web-based applications which facilitates real-time communication across supply chains. therefore, the applicability of industry 4.0 technologies in procurement should be investigated. in this research, a literature survey involving systematic identification and review of 45 articles published in different sources between 2000 and 2019 was carried out to identify different emerging technologies that can be used across the procurement process. further, the results include the applications of these technologies in the different areas of procurement that supports procurement optimization.","procurement process, industry 4.0, procurement 4.0",,"sachini chandrasekara, kasuni vidanagamachchi and ruwan wickramarachchi department of industrial management university of kelaniya kelaniya, sri lanka sachini.yc94@gmail.com, kasuniv@kln.ac.lk, ruwan@kln.ac.lk",
37,Model To Assess Risk Perception And Behaviour Of  Individuals,"risk behaviour is the controlled conduct of people in contexts with uncertainty, where there is a possibility of the outcome received deviating from the outcome expected. the goal of this study is to assess how the confidence of individuals dominate individual risk behaviour. the study was carried out through a systematic review of literature, with which the gap of not using individual’s confidence to interpret their risk behaviour was discovered. hence, this study focuses on interpreting the individual risk behaviour through a combination of the theory of perceived self- efficacy and the reconceptualized model of risk behaviour. perceived self-efficacy is a cognitive psychological concept where people’s confidence on their own personal abilities affect their actions taken to reach designated goals. the reconceptualized model suggests that an individual’s risk behaviour is dominated by two major characteristics; risk propensity and risk perception. the risk behaviour model has been adjusted by removing the organizational-related factors from it. the model has been validated through expert opinion.","risk behaviour, behavioural model","The risk behaviour of individuals depends on both psychological factors and environmental factors. This study focused on developing a model to identify the determinants of the risk perception and risk behaviour of individuals. A gap was identified through a systematic review of literature as the existing reconceptualized model of risk behaviour does not explain how the self-confidence of a person affects the risk behaviour of an individual. From the psychological behavioural models studied, the Theory of Self Efficacy was selected as the most suitable model to determine the confidence of an individual. An integrated model of self-efficacy and reconceptualized model of risk behaviour was developed in order to explain the individual risk perception and behaviour better. The model was empirically and statistically validated and has the potential of being tested in different contexts in the future as further improvements.","mevuni mendis and suren peter department of industrial management university of kelaniya sri lanka mevuni.mm94@gmail.com, suren@kln.ac.lk",
38,"The Entrepreneurial Youth Profile. A Case Study  Jeanette Del Pilar Ureña-Aguirre, Javier Chiza López, Oviedo-Pantoja Winston, Maya-","the present work evidences a study carried out by the industrial engineering career of the technical university of the north, where the entrepreneurial profile of the students of the third year of unified general baccalaureate of two emblematic institutions of the city of ibarra was identified; through the application of the “discover your entrepreneur profile” test, the entrepreneurs were categorized and their main attitudes were identified when establishing their business idea. the results show that the entrepreneurial profile of the students of the educational units under study are the realizer-entrepreneur 22.5% and researcher- creator with 17%, followed by concrete-conventional, multiple profile and social-affective in 16.5 %, 12.5% and 12% respectively; in a lower percentage are the realist-management, and artist-imaginative profiles with 11.5% and 8.5%.","bachelor, entrepreneur, profile, students","Through the investigation, the objective of knowing the entrepreneurial profile was achieved, the answers being as real as possible since a transparent and autonomous process was carried out in the application of the test by the students. In the Teodoro Gómez de la Torre Educational Unit it was obtained as a result that the predominant profile in students is concrete-conventional, so it can be said that students are more focused in areas related to Audit-Comptroller, calculations, consultancies, security. The second predominant profile is Social-affective, which is focused on health and aesthetics, restaurants, bookstores, etc. Among the profiles with less predominance are those of investigative- creator and realistic-managerial. In the University College the predominant profiles are: Realizer-Entrepreneur and Researcher-Creator, that is, with the first one they are linked to the world of innovation, ideas, products, services or processes and with the second they are directed to create schools of languages, businesses linked to technology and games, as well as companies oriented to the transfer of knowledge. The importance of knowing the profile of the entrepreneur is necessary to promote projects or entrepreneurial ideas, which will arise from the development of the profile and in the development of their business plans. Studies of this nature improve the student's attitude towards entrepreneurship, since they indirectly analyze their life project and motivate themselves to develop a business idea early. Carry out this research continuously, applying techniques and instruments that awaken the entrepreneurial spirit, so as to facilitate learning techniques and to facilitate the development of business plans; It is recommended that this be initiated from the first weeks of having started the school year since the results will allow a remarkable advance in the business plan. It is important to awaken the entrepreneurial spirit of the students using different techniques and tools so that they show interest in the entrepreneurial culture and become more involved in economic and social development through the implementation of their creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship.","nicolalde mayra, marcelo cevallos vallejos carrera de ingeniería industrial facultad de ingeniería en ciencias aplicadas universidad técnica del norte ibarra, ecuador jdurena@utn.edu.ec, fjchiza@utn.edu.ec, wgoviedo@utn.edu.ec, mamaya@utn.edu.ec, mcevallos@utn.edu.ec",

44,"A Study On Present E-Waste Scenario In Chattogram City,  Bangladesh","sales of electronic devices have been increasing in recent years resulting in increased e-waste in bangladesh. although bangladesh is a developing country, it has no infrastructure to handle e-waste properly. at present, there exists no formal e-waste dismantling facility for environmentally sound management of e-waste. therefore, the estimation of e-waste generation in bangladesh is crucial to policymakers. considering the limited available data, this study describes the current and future estimation of e-waste generated from cellphones and pc in chattogram city, bangladesh. modified consumption and use methods were applied to estimate the e-waste volume in chattogram city in the research work. in 2019, the calculated amount of e-waste generated from cellphones in chattogram city was approximately 401.98 tons. and from pc the amount was approximately 3924.98 tons by applying modified method 1. using linear trend forecasting, it is predicted that the amount of e-waste generated from cellphones will reach approximately 739.18 tons and e-waste generated from pc will reach approximately 5851.80 tons by 2025. this study also discusses the present scenario of e-waste management in chattogram city, bangladesh.","e-waste, cellphone, pc, c&u method","This paper has provided some qualitative and quantitative information about e-waste in Chattogram city. As shown in the findings, the amount of e-waste is increasing in Chattogram city. In 2019, the calculated amount of e-waste generated from Cellphone in Chattogram city was approximately 401.978 tons. And from PC the amount was approximately 3924.979 tons by applying Modified Method 1. The amount found by applying Modified Method 2 was nearly similar to that of Modified Method 1. Due to the high generation of e-waste and the lack of proper managing systems, it is predicted that such waste would have some adverse effects on the health of citizens and the environment as well. Therefore, it is necessary to provide necessary infrastructures for separation, collection, recycling, and management of such waste. Before establishing any proper e-waste recovery and recycling system a complete empirical study is necessary. This study will prepare the platform for additional study and exploration of e-waste recycling. While this study focused only on cellphone and personal computers, other electronic equipment can also be taken into consideration using a similar methodology. This study estimated the e-waste volume in Chattogram city. For estimating the volume of e-waste in other major cities, the adoption of this methodology will constitute an effective approach.","mohammad iqbal1, abdullah-al-nadim1, hasin ahmed1 and shahrin iqbal2 1department of industrial and production engineering 2department of electrical and electronics engineering shahjalal university of science and technology sylhet-3114, bangladesh iqbalm_ipe@yahoo.com, aalnadim2305@gmail.com, hasinahmed.ipe@gmail.com shahrin19emma@gmail.com",
45,"Aggressive Driving Behavior: A Case Study Of Mehran Uet,  Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan","this research is socio-emotional study of individuals with different gender, age, driving experience and academic status. by the help of this research, driving behavior of individuals is studied which can be helpful for traffic police to overcome violations on roads due to aggressive driving. this study was conducted to reveal aggressive driving behavior of students and teachers at muet, jamshoro, pakistan. questionnaire of dr. larson was used as research instrument. 200 questionnaires were distributed among respondents; 160 samples were collected and 16 were rejected. 16 hypothesis were developed in this study. data was analyzed in (spss) version 22. reliability of the questionnaire was checked by cronbach alpha test (alpha=0.875). firstly, descriptive statistics for all questions was calculated; after the normality test, independent sample t-test and anova tests were used for hypothesis testing. furthermore, relationship among driving, anger, driving impatience, competing and punishing were found by the help of pearson correlation. it was concluded that there was no significant difference in driving anger, driving impatience, competing and punishing of drivers belonging to different demographics i.e. gender, age, driving experience, students and teachers. furthermore, significant positive association was found among the driving anger, driving impatience, competing and punishing of drivers. key words aggressive driving; driving anger; hypothesis, pakistan. 1. introduction aggressive driving has become a common occurrence to an increasing extent (mizell, 1997). driving aggressiveness as defined by tasca “a driving behavior is aggressive, if it is deliberate, likely to increase the risk of collision and is motivated by impatience, annoyance, hostility, and/or an attempt to save time” (gilbert and orlans, 2011) or ""ill intention or disregard to safety"" (aaa foundation for traffic safey, 2009). it is used as a synonym of ‘road rage’ (paleti et al., 2010). it may involve driver anger, intend to have an advantage over other drivers, and intentional violations and exceeding from the normal traffic speed (goodwin et al., 2013). the behavior which can cause any mental or physical injury (grey et al., 1989). driver aggressiveness is the bigger problem than the traffic jam as observed by most of the people. aggression as defined by daula, c.s. the behavior due to which people on the road may be physically or emotionally harmed (dula and geller, 2003). frustration always gives out aggression (lajunen and parker, 2001;abou-zeid et al., 2011). it is not assumed always but it rather suggests and facilitate the aggressive driving behavior (berkowitz, 1989). research indicated that the personality differences in individuals significantly play a remarkable role in proneness towards aggressive driving (aaa foundation for traffic safey, 2009). it was concluded that expressions of aggression of drivers can be due to anger i.e. speeding tailgating which have been indicated to impact the road safety negatively (swov institute for road safety research, 2012). the results of aggressive driving can be property damage, injury and mortality (dula and geller, 2003). during the past few years, aggressive and angry driving have caught the notable attention of the public as well as the government (jerry l. deffenbacher et al., 2002). aggressiveness always originates from frustration (abou-zeid et al., 2350",,"and Suggestions In this research, aggressive driving behavior was investigated by focusing on the demographics of the respondents. On the same time, the relationship among various constructs i.e. driving anger, driving impatience competing and punishing was found. Results of hypothesis testing (T-test and ANOVA) revealed that there was no significant difference in the driving anger, impatience, competing and punishing behavior of the drivers across both genders: similarly, no difference was found in the aggressive driving behavior among the drivers of various age groups: whereas, the significant difference was found in the punishing behavior of driving across the various groups of driving experience; which demonstrates that drivers (having different driving experience) punish the other drivers with no- equal magnitude aggressive driving: moreover there was no significant difference found in the driving anger, impatience and competing among the drivers across different driving experience. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the aggressive driving behavior (i.e. driving anger, impatience, competing and punishing) of teachers and students of Mehran UET, Jamshoro. The results of Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the driving anger, driving impatience, competing and punishing were in significant positive relationship with one another: which clearly indicates that on increasing on factor will cause the certain increase in the various factors. 7. Future Work In this research, drivers were taken the questionnaire samples at offices and canteens but for more precise results, it is suggested that the drivers should be taken the questionnaire samples suddenly after the drive. In this way, the researcher can have the exact response from the side of respondents. 8. Acknowledgement The questionnaire of Dr. Larson was used for the data collection in this study. We are also very thankful to Dr. Shakeel Ahmed Shaikh (Associate Professor) at the department of Industrial engineering and management, Mehran UET, Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan to guide us in the data collection and human factors standard procedures.

47,Impact Of Workplace Conditions On Level Of Employee  Satisfaction,"late arrivals and no show are major concern in south african workplace. the bad working environment and attitude of management may result in dissatisfied employees, which contributes toward most of the absenteeism. this study aims to investigate the impact of the management and workplace conditions on the level of satisfaction of the employees. a johannesburg based non-profit organization which has been facing high staff turnover was selected as a case study. about 50 employees across several departments were selected using convenience sampling for semi-structured interviews and participant observations. the result showed that majority of participants reported on limited equipment and machinery available to perform daily tasks, for instance the whole organization was using only one printer to scan, print and copy documents. furthermore, majority of participants were concerned that management does not provide sufficient resources and rewards to deserving employees.",management,"and Recommendations Limited resources and lack of management role contributed to job dissatisfaction within the workplace. The employees were observed to be facing difficulty with meeting the deadlines and getting frustration with limited and ineffective equipment as stated by 80% of the participants. The behavior of management plays a pivotal role to keep employees satisfied within the workplace. However, 90% of the participants reported that management does not promote employee engagement and interaction to keep employees motivated. Recommendations 1. The non-profit organization should attract sponsors and generate funds to add enough and efficient equipment. This will help in eliminating delays and employees will be able to complete their jobs on time. 2. The management must be well trained to handle diversity and ensure equality to resolve conflict and address problems fairly. 3. The organization can implement performance appraisal system to assess employees, which will help to provide constructive feedback to struggling employees and reward better performing employees. 4. The management can implement job rotation, enrichment and enlargement to promote employee engagement and involvement. This will enable employees to perform various jobs and assist each other, and give them a sense of greater responsibility.","judith mhlanga and anup pradhan department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg, south africa jmhlanga@uj.ac.za; anupp@uj.ac.za oludolapo akanni olanrewaju department of industrial engineering durban university of technology, south africa oludolapo@dut.ac.za",

55,"Analysis Of ""Mathematics Proficiency"" Online Course Data  Through Process Mining","a pre-requisite for exact sciences students is to master basic mathematical skills. since 2016, to reduce the drop-out level of such students, ben-gurion university of the negev offers a ""mathematics proficiency"" online – self-evaluation and training course. the course was developed by the mathematics department in collaboration with the university’s academic development and teaching improvement unit. the goal of this study was to classify key learning patterns and characteristics and relate those to student’s achievements at the end of the first semester of studies in the faculties of engineering and natural sciences (stem in general), mainly via process mining and statistical analysis. process mining combines data mining with process modeling and analysis to discover, monitor and improve organizational processes by extracting knowledge from event logs available in the databases of organization’s information systems. in this research we utilized three leading process mining tools: disco, prom and celonis, combined with r for statistical analyzes. our analysis relied on the event and self- evaluation logs of the students' online course, without disclosing their personal identity. after defining the examined population and the research method, an extensive data cleaning was carried out. we had over 25.5 thousand records reflecting 6265 students participating during 3 academic years of activities. then, process mining tools were applied for modeling as well as identifying behavior patterns, those displayed over 1,100 variants, reflecting student behavior and diversity, learning those patterns with process mining tools led to definition of 5 main learning patterns. finally, the effect of the behavioral patterns during the course was examined through students’ success, particularly on the average grade in the first semester of studies. the results show that 72% of the students did not use the on-line course despite recommendation, but from those who did use it, approximately half have performed most of the recommended tests (as per personal recommendation). statistical analysis indicated that there was no distinct difference between students that studied up to 2 self-evaluation tests before abandoned and students that did not use the on- line course at all. however, significant correlation was found between persistence learning pattern and students’ average. students who have conducted most of the recommended tests (over 75%), achieved on the average, final score higher by 5.4 points (in 0-100 scale) than students who did not perform any tests at all. 2756",,,"sagit kedem-yemini logistics department sapir academic college sderot, israel sagity@mail.sapir.ac.il dor tiram, shir berenson, ifat menashe and gadi rabinowitz industrial engineering and management department ben-gurion university beer sheva, israel dorti@post.bgu.ac.il, shirbere@post.bgu.ac.il, ifatmen@bgu.ac.il, rgadi@bgu.ac.il",
56,Productivity Improvement At A Soft Drink Manufacturing  Company: A Case Study,"this study was conducted to examine the impact of poor-quality management on the productivity of a beverage industry. a south african soft drinks manufacturing company was selected as a case study. the study was carried out among the employees of the company's plant and through observing equipment and wellbeing of company's facilities located in johannesburg. a sample of 150 workers was drawn from the company, and each employee was asked questions on how productivity can be improved. the results showed that reducing quantity of inputs, such as working time, would enable the company to produce a standardized product. it was also found that proper maintenance of facilities and working equipment and employee's skill improvement would improve operations within the company. tight supervision and special monitoring of workers have a greater impact on performance and the overall productivity of the company. thus, the company needs to encourage hygiene and improve employee's skills to adapt to fast changing technologies, and strategies must be adopted accordingly to obtain optimum productivity of the workers and satisfy customers with quality products. by responding to the needs of this contemporary marketing environment, it was believed that it will give the company competitive advantage over its competitors.","quality management, productivity, new technologies","A South African soft drink manufacturing company was studied to examine the factors that were adjusted to increase the overall productivity of the company. Based on the results of productivity index, it was found that the productivity of the company was improved, which was achieved by reducing the amount of productivity factors identified during the study, and changes were made to increase the level of output for the same quantity of inputs or even lesser inputs. This is aligned with Wilt et al. (2010), who stated that productivity is achieved by reducing the amount of inputs used to produce the same outputs or increasing the inputs to produce more outputs. The improved productivity makes the company more productive and competitive.",judith mhlanga and anup pradhan department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg south africa jmhlanga@uj.ac.za; anupp@uj.ac.za,
57,The Impact Of Inventory Control On Productivity Of Steel  Firms,"the effect of inventory control on the productivity of manufacturing firms has become topical. inventory control is an important factor in determining efficiency and effectiveness, thereby achieving productivity of a manufacturing firm. survival of the manufacturing firms depend on its ability to have uninterrupted production, and effective control of inventory is necessary to achieve an efficient production process. this study was conducted on selected steel firms based in johannesburg, south africa. based on the information obtained from the firms involved, the study established that inventory control has an effect on the productivity of a firm. the study also discovered that inventory control is a problem for larger steel firms compared to small and medium size firms because the larger firms are dealing with big orders. the study also revealed that during the production process, firms tend to use rule-of-thumb when managing inventory control. the survival of the manufacturing firm depends on its ability to have uninterrupted production. furthermore for the manufacturing firm to be able to achieve an efficient production process, its inventory must be controlled effectively.","inventory control, productivity","Existing literature establishes that inventory control has an effect on productivity of the firm. The study conducted on few selected companies establishes that inventory control is a problem for larger steel firms because they are dealing with much bigger orders as their production line is much bigger. The study discovered that that there is a positive relationship between inventory control and productivity. The literature reveals that firms who minimize the level of inventory stand a good chance of increasing their productivity. The study discovered that inventory control approaches can assist in elimination of waste in production. The study reveals that firms that do not necessarily follow inventory control approaches struggle with maintaining and keeping inventory during production process. The study discovered that productivity speaks to the company’s production ability being able to reach the process capacity. The study also depict that productivity improvement helps to satisfy customer and reduce time and cost to develop, produce and deliver products.","thembinkosi victor luthuli and anup pradhan department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa thembalv@gmail.com, anupp@uj.ac.za",

It was identified that the production of recycled plastic wood is a process whose production volume is low, for this reason, for the control of quantitative variables, the individual graphs of mobile ranges (I-MR) were implemented that allowed to detect the variability and stability of the process. On the other hand, since the qualitative variables are difficult to quantify, a control tool (process sheets) was designed that allows activities to be carried out in an orderly manner and thereby guarantee a standardized procedure. As for the strength of the material, plastic wood is produced with a maximum resistance value of 751.03 N and with 316.51 N of breaking strength. It was also possible to standardize the time variable in the molding and pressing area, being these 36 and 26 minutes respectively, the temperature in the molding area could be standardized with a value of 150 º C and in the pressing area the correct pressure for guarantee the hardness of plastic wood sheets is 4.76 bars.","andrés r. cruz herrera, lupe p. taimal cuasapud, jeanette del p. ureña aguirre, santiago m. vacas palacios and leandro l. lorente leyva facultad de ingeniería en ciencias aplicadas universidad técnica del norte ibarra, ecuador arcruz@utn.edu.ec, lptaimalc@utn.edu.ec, jdurena@utn.edu.ec, smvacas@utn.edu.ec, lllorente@utn.edu.ec",
61,Sustainable Supply Chain Concerns In Diamond Industries  Dr. Akhilesh Barve,"green supply chain management (gscm) is one of the major areas of concern for industries. all the sectors are mostly aiming on the “greening” things. in this aspect, this study focuses on detecting various parameters associated with gscm practices in diamond mining industries globally. in this context, diamond mining can be viewed as an important activity for providing raw materials needed to produce essentials items for the growth and development of the society. the severity of past mining disasters and the casualties associated with them have raised the public's perception of mining as being a high-risk activity not only for the public's and workers' health but also for the environment. in this work, a several parameters have been identified from literature which relates to sustainable supply chain concerns in diamond industry.","dimond industries, 2015)","It can be observed that in future there will be big concern on sustainable issues of supply chains instead of the profitable supply chains. Therefore, to sustain in long run manufacturing enterprises need to re conﬁgure their strategies rapidly in anticipation to the changing opportunities and requirements towards sustainable growth. Growing attention towards environmental issues at both national and international levels is putting pressure on organizations to develop strategies that will integrate environmental concerns with their business strategies. Further, diamond mining industries can be placed at one of the extreme ends of the supply chain for being supplier of raw materials. For this, environmental improvement efforts of the mining industries will deﬁnitely reduce environmental degradation effect of diamond supply chain. In this regard this research assumes its importance by identifying potential sustainable concerns in diamond mining industries and their interdependencies. This research can be used for further analysis of these factors and their dependency and driving power by using MICMAC and other tools. Also, a systematic model of these factors cab be developed using Interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique, this model will give a perfect idea about the factors arranged in a proper way. Structural equation modeling (SEM) have the ability to validate an already developed model but unable to develop the initial model. ISM and SEM are complementary in nature, therefore, in future SEM can be used to test the validity of the developed model, through ISM.

62,"Lean In A High Mix, Low Volume Manufacturing  Environment – Case Study","market competition is fierce and has been intensified due to globalization, therefore companies have experienced increase pressure to improve cycle and delivery times and achieve a high level of customization. lean principles have been designed and implemented to respond to market changes. however, these principles are commonly aimed to aid low-mix high-volume (lmhv) manufacturers. this paper aims to produce an approach to implement a lean framework in a high-mix low-volume (hmlv) manufacturing environment. an hmlv manufacturing environment, currently produces a variety of products which differs in terms of shape and size and different sequence of operation. furthermore, analysis of the manufacturing assembly shows there is a substantial variation in cycle and changeover time from product to product. in this approach, an action based study has been completed. this study uses data collection methods to be applied in order to calculate timings to be used in a discrete event simulation (des). the simulation uses lean tools to study material movement and facility layout to minimize bottlenecks and eliminate waste from the process. an introduction of lean supermarket is considered within the simulation whereby an operator withdraws products in an specific amount needed by a downstream process before introducing it across the assembly floor and an action plan is created. as a result, a lean manufacturing simulation study has been implemented to evaluate the effects of a supermarket concept within the current manufacturing environment. initial results show a variation within the cycle and setup times for each of the different products due to the nature of the process. the paper, is limited to applying the approach to a singular production line and a singular manufacturing plant. the practical implications to implement this approach into a manufacturing environment is that there should be a need from the company. this approach should be driven by senior members within the organization as the resistance to change would increase the risk of failure. another implication of the proposed approach is to ensure the accuracy of the data collected and to introduce a series of briefs within each stage of the approach. this is important as all stakeholders would need to be kept up-to-date with the project. however, the approach is applicable to any organization and can be applied to any sector. this paper, proposes a systematic approach to implement a lean framework in a high-mix low-volume (hmlv) manufacturing environment. the approach is validated in british manufacturing organization competing in global markets. biographies anees hussain is currently a postgraduate research student within faculty of engineering and informatics at the university of bradford. he received his msc in mechanical engineering in 2019, whilst working as a process improvement engineer for an automotive manufacturer. his research interests include application of modelling techniques, such as discrete and dynamic event simulation to support the implementation of lean and six sigma methodologies within manufacturing, supply chain management and big data systems. dr j. eduardo munive-hernandez is a lecturer in advanced manufacturing engineering at the faculty of engineering and informatics, university of bradford. he received his phd in total technology from the university of manchester institute of science and technology in 2003. he has industrial experience in the manufacturing sector 614",,,"anees hussain, jose eduardo munive-hernandez, felician campean faculty of engineering & informatics university of bradford bradford, bd7 1dp, uk a.hussain286@bradford.ac.uk, j.e.munive@bradford.ac.uk, f.campean@bradford.ac.uk",

Due to their size, it is not so easy to access and articulate the work with public policies, since they dedicate themselves to everyday life and to seeking to participate with their immediate communities. Another difficulty that arises is framed within sustainability, since they are interesting ideas that seek better living conditions, but that face problems to generate liquidity over time. 1197","mayra maya, winston oviedo, jeanette ureña and javier chiza facultad de ingeniería en ciencias aplicadas universidad técnica del norte ibarra, ecuador mamaya@utn.edu.ec, wgoviedo@utn.edu.ec, jdurena@utn.edu.ec, fjchiza@utn.edu.ec","References

65,Assessing Systematic Literature Review Bias: Kaizen Events  In Hospitals Case Study,"a systematic literature review (slr) is a protocol used to identify publications, select relevant publications, collect data, conduct scientometric analyses, and report research results (slr outcomes or findings). despite the increasing use of slr to assess the maturity or evolution of a research field, as engineering management, there are a limit number of publications focused to test slr biases. therefore, the purposes of this investigation are to test search field bias (precise slr vs. sensitive slr) and to identify statistically significant differences between slr outcomes. in order to achieve these goals, a three steps methodology was used in three platforms/databases. first, a precise slr in proquest (search terms only in abstract) was conducted to identify publications describing a single kaizen event in a hospital. from these publications, five metrics were assessed: new authors per year, number of authors per paper, number of publications per year, kaizen event duration (days), and number of tools used during the kaizen event per paper. second, a sensitive slr in proquest (search term in full text) was conducted using the same search terms, exclusion criteria, and metrics from the first step. third, t-test hypotheses were conducted in spss version 20 to identify statistically significant difference for each metric between precise slr vs. sensitive slr. the same three steps were used in two more platforms/databases: ebscohost and scopus. initial results from this ongoing investigation show statistically significant differences between precise slr and sensitive slr for some of the five metrics assessed, such as the number of publications per year. final results will be available in november 2018.","kaizen event, hospital",,"fernando gonzalez aleu, francisco flores, jimena perez, and roy gonzalez school of engineering and technology universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcia, nl 45000, mexico fernando.gonzalezaleu@udem.edu jose arturo garza-reyes centre for supply chain improvement university of derby, derby, de22 1gb, uk j.reyes@derby.ac.uk","References

69,A Sustainable Travelling Purchaser Problem Model Khalid Khamis,"this paper proposes a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (momilp) model to solve the travelling purchaser problem (tpp) with a sustainable supplier selection, order allocation, with multiple vehicles and a single product. the manufacturer’s target is to choose the best green suppliers from whom the materials can be purchased, which means that suppliers who will be able to provide low-cost products and generates minimum co2 emissions from transportation, while maximizing the social and environmental criteria of the material will be selected. as a result, the model consists of three objective functions, the first objective function aims at minimizing the total fixed and variable purchasing and transportations costs; the second objective function aims at minimizing the total transportation-related co2 emissions; the third objective function aims at maximizing the total green and social value of the materials purchased from the selected suppliers.",supplier selection,"In this paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is presented for the TPP with multiple vehicles and a single product. CPLEX software and the weighted comprehensive criterion method were used to solve the model and the multi-objective formulation. The results proved the feasibility of the algorithm to reduce the cost and CO2 emissions, for improving the environment and social criteria. In order to solve large-size instances of this problem, a heuristic approach needs to be developed. Moreover, the formulation can be extended to account for multiple products and to have a limitation on the maximum travelled distance for each vehicle.

72,Organisational Behaviour And Success Of Construction  Projects,"projects are set up for specific purposes which are to be achieved within a stipulated time period, but not all projects achieve it set objective within the set time. in order for a construction project to be executed successfully, a team has to work closely together and implement project goals. all project stakeholders including the sponsor and the project implementation team are responsible for the successful completion of any project. this study, therefore, seeks to investigate organisational behaviours necessary for successful completion of a construction project. the study was conducted in gauteng province, south africa and a structured questionnaire was administered to construction professionals. retrieved questionnaires were analysed using the relative importance index. findings from the study revealed that efficient relationship management, proper documentation of progress and effective teamwork are the most important traits required from project stakeholders to ensure successful completion of projects. it was, therefore, concluded certain behavioural traits must be inherent in project stakeholders and team members for a project to reach successful completion.",,"As a generally established fact, construction projects are very volatile and complex in nature when compared with other kinds of projects. The volatility and complexity of construction projects can easily be attributed to the large number of multi-disciplined staffs needed to successfully complete individual projects. Since construction projects require a large number of workers, there is a need to examine the personal traits of each worker that will promote project success. This study was therefore aimed at investigating the organisational behaviours necessary for successful completion of a construction project. The theoretical review discussed how project team members and their organisational behaviour can be beneficial or detrimental to the success of a construction project. The empirical findings of this research stressed the vitality for an efficient team selection process, in order for a project team to effectively work together and achieve project goals. Before a team is selected, the skills and experience possessed by possible team members should be evaluated. Each team members’ personality should be evaluated as well. Forming a team haphazardly often leads to team destruction and non-realisation of project goals. In selecting construction project team members, it is very important to consider the personal qualities of individual prospective member in addition to their professional capacity and experience. This will ensure a positive organisational behaviour towards the project which will enhance the chances of construction project success.","clinton aigbavboa, olushola akinshipe and madidimalo mutshaeni sarchi in sustainable construction and leadership in the built environment, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa sholaakinshipe@gmail.com",
73,An Ergonomic Approach On Facilities And Workstation   Design Of Public School Canteen In The Philippines,"this paper aims to redesign the facilities and workstations of public school canteen in the philippines by applying the principles of ergonomics. previous studies have proven that workers in the canteen are exposed to musculoskeletal disorders and injuries due poor facility layout and workstation design. review of related literature states that improper arrangement of tables and seats cause congestion and irrational spacing (ismael, 2011), poor design of physical environment such as ventilation, lighting and noise can cause discomfort, annoyance and dissatisfaction (niu, et al., 2011), and improper design of workstation wherein repetitive work activities are performed lead to muscle fatigue and stress (sripaiboonkij & taptakarnporn, 2014). thus, the researchers aim to assess the current condition of the public school canteen in the philippines in order to determine the risk and exposure of the workers to musculoskeletal disorders (msd) and injuries. the researchers also aim to identify significant factors in the design of canteen that affect the discomfort level of workers in terms of the following: personal factor, physical factors and task-related factor. key findings from the study revealed that workers in the canteen experience pain and discomfort in the neck, upper back, shoulder, lower back, upper arm, hips/buttocks and lower leg. similarly, result of rapid entire body assessment (reba) and niosh lifting equation proved that workers are exposed to risk of msd due to their poor working posture and repetitive work activities. risk factors identified in the study were further treated and analyzed using regression analysis. the result revealed that factors such height, body-mass index, temperature, lifting posture, and work posture significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to msd. given these conditions, the researchers were able to redesign the facilities and workstation of public school canteen by applying the principles of ergonomics, quality function deployment (qfd) and systematic layout planning (slp) tools.","ergonomic design, facilities design, workstation design, canteen","The findings of the study have proven that workers in canteen are exposed to risks of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries due to poor facility and workstation design. The risk was evident on the scores generated by RULA and NIOSH computed from their body postures while performing tasks. Based on the result of CMDQ, majority of the respondents’ experience pain on their neck, upper back, shoulders, lower back, hips/buttocks, upper arm and lower leg. Several risk factors were considered in the study based on review of related literature, direct observation and interview from the people involved in the tasks. Factors considered are the following (1) personal factor: age, gender, height, weight, BMI, (2) environmental factor: temperature, illumination, noise, (3) task-related factors: rest period, work duration, work posture and lifting posture. These factors were analyzed and treated using regression analysis. The result revealed that factors such height, body-mass index, temperature, lifting posture, and work posture significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to MSD. Given these conditions, the researchers were able to redesign the facilities and workstation of public school canteen by applying the principles of ergonomics, quality function deployment (QFD) and systematic layout planning (SLP) tools.","ma. janice j. gumasing, eidref joseph e. espejo school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, ejeespejo@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",
74,A Biomechanical Risk Assessment Of Lifting Tasks In The   Logistics Industry In The Philippines,"this paper aims to assess the biomechanical risks involved in the lifting tasks of workers in the logistics industry in the philippines. previous studies have proved that workers in the logistics industry are exposed to occupational risks of developing musculoskeletal disorders (msd) and injuries due to the nature of their job. workers in the logistics industry commonly employ heavy manual tasks that involve lifting, pulling and pushing; that can become hazardous and could cause significant and even irreversible injuries and disorders. based on studies, several factors can contribute to the risks of workers such as repetitive movement, sustained force, awkward posture and weight of object being lifted to name a few. according to osha, the best and most effective way to eliminate or minimize the risk of msd and injuries is to consider manual task hazards and risk during the design and planning stage of a workplace or a job. during this stage, hazards and risks can be eliminated before they are introduced into a workplace. given these conditions, the authors intend to identify significant factors that contribute to the occupational risks of workers while performing lifting task in order to develop a mitigation plan that will help eliminate msd and injuries of the workers. key findings from the study revealed that workers experience msd and injury in their lower back, upper back, hips/thigh, shoulder and wrist. similarly, result of rapid entire body assessment (reba) and niosh lifting equation proved that workers are exposed to high risk of msd due to their poor working posture and repetitive work activities. risk factors identified in the study were further treated and analyzed using correlation and regression analysis. the result revealed that factors such age, body-mass index, frequency of lift, weight lifted, lifting posture and duration of lifts significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to work injury and musculoskeletal disorders with coefficient of correlation (r) values of 0.812 and 0.832 respectively. the identified factors serve as the basis for the researchers to develop risk mitigation plan to minimize the msd and injuries experienced by workers.","biomechanical risk, lifting task","The findings of the study have proven that workers in logistics industry are exposed to risks of musculoskeletal disorders and injuries due to heavy exposure to manual material handling and lifting tasks. The risk was evident on the scores generated by REBA and NIOSH computed from their body postures while performing tasks. Based on the result of NMQ, majority of the respondents experienced pain in their lower back, upper back, hips/thigh, shoulder and wrist. Several risk factors were considered in the study based on review of related literature, direct observation and interview from the people involved in the tasks. It was determined using statistical analysis that risk factors contributed to the MSDs and injuries of workers are age, body-mass index, frequency of lift, weight lifted, lifting posture and duration of lifts significantly affect the risk and exposure of workers to MSD and work injury. The identified factors serve as the basis for the researchers to develop proper manual material handling technique and lifting technique to minimize the MSD and injuries experienced by workers. 1677","ma. janice j. gumasing, romeo carlo j. casela school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, rcjcasela@mymail.mapua.edu.ph","References

75,The Effects Of Energy Expenditure On The Mental Fatigue Of  Construction Workers,"this study aims to determine the significant factors that affect the mental fatigue of construction workers in the philippines. studies revealed that workers in the construction site routinely exceed generally accepted physiological thresholds for manual work leading to fatigue. they typically carry out highly demanding physical tasks with various types of stresses resulted from awkward posture, excessive force demands, repetitive actions and excessive energy expenditure. due to this labor-intensive nature of construction work, many construction workers face excessive demands beyond their physical capabilities. thus, they are prone to be exposed to significantly high level of mental fatigue as well as other safety risks. this study aims to focus on the physiological measures of energy expenditure of workers leading to fatigue. factors that were considered in the study are activity metabolic rate, heart rate, age, and body mass index. to objectively measure the mental fatigue experienced by the construction workers during the whole 8-hour shift, the deary liewald reaction time software was used. statistical analysis is also employed to determine the significant differences in the factors identified among the 5 construction trades such as labor, mason, carpentry, steal work and plumbing using anova. correlation analysis is also used to identify relationship of factors to the fatigue level of construction workers. results of the study revealed that all factors considered in the study have significant relationship to the fatigue experienced by workers among the 5 construction trades. and in order to develop measures to minimize mental fatigue level of workers, a suitable work-rest schedule is designed through the application of monte carlo simulation model having 9,125 runs, which generated a year worth of data for the 25 construction workers.","mental fatigue, energy expenditure","The findings of the study have revealed that workers in the construction site routinely exceed generally accepted physiological thresholds for manual work leading to fatigue. This was evident on the factors gathered from the respondents such as their activity metabolic rate, heart rate, age and body mass index. Results of statistical analyses such as correlation and regression model proved that the factors considered in the study have significant effect to the mental fatigue of the workers as measured in the reaction time of the respondents using the SRT and CRT tests. Considering results of this study, the researchers were able to design an optimal work-rest schedule for the construction workers using Monte Carlo simulation. Through this method, the researchers were able to determine the maximum allowable work duration for the workers and compute the optimal rest period to lessen the mental fatigue experienced by workers in different construction trades.","ma. janice j. gumasing, claire marie a. llamas and czarina anne a. martin school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph, cmallamas@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, caamartin@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",
76,"Assuring Quality, Accuracy And Validity Of Test Results In  The Laboratory For Sedibeng Water","assuring quality of test results is very vital, although this study only covered minimum of three ways of assuring the validity of results but is was evident that these methods can be used as basic approach of assuring quality of results. 1. introduction laboratory services are an essential component of water quality delivery. they can be utilized effectively at every level of the water quality system, including water treatment and point of compliance testing. quality laboratory results are required to support water treatment plant optimisation, rationalize and monitor treatment, for chemical balance and dosage purposes. provision of valid and credible results is very crucial to the laboratory since failing to provide analytical services does not only impact water treatment plants however; it also impacts the end user (consumers at home) as the water treatment or purification requires laboratory results for treatments plants to be optimised. this also put accreditation in question since one of iso/iec 17025:2017 requirements are to produce valid and credible results timeously as well as meeting customer needs. according to angmo et al. (2015), testing laboratories are employed by all types of businesses to contribute objective analytical data on the quality of a process or a product. the purpose of establishing laboratory quality standards is to ensure the accuracy of test results, increase the confidence of customers, stakeholders, and communities in the value of provision of essential services such as water. all laboratory activities may be subject to errors, and studies have shown that errors in the laboratory can occur in all the phases of testing. nkengsong et al. (2016). currently the wtl is struggling to achieve credible and valid test results for nitrate method. there is an inconsistency of nitrate levels in water tested which makes it difficult to make decisions for plant optimisation. nitrate test method 2814",,"The results obtained from PT are also an evident that proper method validation as well as implementation of QCs yields positive results. Implementation of Method validation, QCs and PT has assisted the laboratory to be able to asses Nitrate test method through PT outliers, QC breaches and method validation results, since then; there have been no uncertainty and inconsistency on Nitrate test results which had increased customer satisfaction and the level of confidence in the results we produce. This study did not help the laboratory to assure quality of Nitrate results however; the laboratory also benefited from monitoring the accuracy and precision of a method, encourage collaboration between laboratories through PT and demonstrated technical competence against third parties 5. RECOMMENDATIONS After the study, the following recommendations were made: • To apply all the techniques, use on this study in all test methods • To periodically re-validate test methods • To periodically review QC limits by calculating using historic data • To implement other ways of assuring quality of test results as this study only covered basic techniques 6.",nomalungelo magwaza department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg south africa nmagwaza@sedibengwater.co.za xhanti dyonase department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg south africa xhantid@uj.ac.za,

79,An Integrated Decision-Making Model In Building Or  Expanding Health Facilities,"in the philippines, the healthcare delivery system has been described as somewhat operationally inefficient as it is consisting of government and private health, diagnostic, and treatment facilities spread unevenly across the archipelago. thus, the objective of this study is to (1) assess the current basis of doh and other regulatory agencies in building/expanding health facilities, (2) know the factors that have significant effect in the decision-making and (3) develop an integrated decision-making model that will make use of forecasting, simulation and optimization modeling approaches. the study proposed an integrated decision-making model that consists of three major categories to consider: volume drivers, health resources parameters and health facility requirements based on reviewed documents and articles. this model was developed to aid in decision- and policy-making related to health infrastructures.",equipment,"The researcher reviewed related documents and materials from the Department of Health (DOH)’s official website. Relevant guidelines in building health facilities provided by the DOH can be found in the AO 29 series of 2006 (Guidelines for Rationalizing the Health Care Delivery System based on Health Needs) and AO 4-A and 4-B of 2006 (Guidelines for the Issuance of Certificate of Need to Establish a New Hospital). This applies to both government and private health facilities. The Certificate of Need (CON) takes into account the proposed health facility’s catchment population, location and the LGUs’ commitment to the funding and maintenance the health facility. In addition, utilization rate, number of staff and bed-to-population ratio are considered. Each CON is evaluated in the context of the rationalization plan. With this information, the researcher thought of considering other factors that secondary sources have taken into account. Several of the factors and sub-factors were from a World Health Organization (WHO)’s Regional Publications on health facilities’ guidelines for development and operations (1998). It was then evaluated using a survey instrument with a 5-point Likert scale to determine its importance to the subject of the study. Statistical tests were done to reduce the pool of data and attain only the significant ones as shown and grouped in Figure 4. The integrated model can be used, not just for policy-making, but also in strategically planning where to build future health infrastructures with specific configurations in a city/province. Future studies can be done through the integrated decision-making model since this study’s aim is just to consolidate all the factors that could be useful inputs in the model. Other researchers can continue the research by pinpointing which is the best forecasting, simulation and optimization modeling approaches that can be applied to each stage/phase. Furthermore, other fields can also consider creating software or a system that can handle such big data and incorporate the modeling approaches as its logical flow.","marvin i. noroña, katherine d. gavino school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university manila intramuros, manila, 1002, philippines minorona@mapua.edu.ph, kdgavino@mcl.edu.ph",
80,Exploring The Potentials Of Project Controls Within The  Construction Industry: Drivers And Challenges,"this paper examines the boundaries of project controls throughout the project life-cycle on construction projects. the researcher evaluates the factors contributing to the success and failures of projects, as well as identifies what project control mechanisms are currently being used in the construction industry to control projects throughout the project life-cycle. the details of the study reveal that although efforts have been made to control projects in various aspects of the construction project life-cycle, however these control mechanisms seem to be mis-jointed and scattered amongst construction professionals, and do not effectively work to address project controls, but only take effect after issues appear in a project. with the absence of a clearly defined structure to adopt project control mechanisms throughout the project life-cycle, this poses a clear gap in research towards improving construction project performance that satisfies the key stakeholders of the project. thus, this paper proposes the development of a smart project controls framework model that would facilitate effective control of the activities identified throughout the project life-cycle, whereby the role of project controls becomes well defined within each stage of the project to ensure more sustainable project outcomes.","project controls, smart projects, project planning, transport","(Gap) Taking the above into consideration, little literature reveals details of where project controls lies within the project life-cycle, which could assumes that project controls is simply applied to monitor and control specific aspects of a project, and thus there seems to be no real evidence amongst literature if project control activities do stand as defined valuable inputs amongst projects in the construction industry, although studies suggest many benefits and effects of project controls outcomes on project success. Thus it is necessary to point out the significance of project controls not just controlling specific aspects of a project, but rather needs to be present in all aspects of the project life-cycle and if attention is given in this aspect, particularly in the initial stages of a project, then there is a higher chance of project success rates. Furthermore, there are critical factors which determine project success and failures, although success and failure factors may be relative in view of the key stakeholders to a project. However, project controls could play an integral part in controlling various aspects of the critical factors for success on projects. Although there are project control mechanisms and tools in place which are used heavily in Project Management and controls, however there are drawbacks which could hint why projects are not as successful as they are. Therefore, there needs to be ‘Smarter’ or ‘leaner’ ways of controlling projects, with project controls being required in each aspect of the lifecycle through planning, monitoring and control of each aspect. Thus, this paper aims to carry out further research in order to develop a decision-based model and framework, which would seek to identify which project controls tools and mechanisms are required and their associated timing in each step of the project life-cycle to assist in contributing to project success.","heveine baban, krisanthi seneviratne, yasemin nielsen school of energy, geoscience, infrastructure and society heriot watt university dubai, uae hsb7@hw.ac.uk, k.seneviratne@hw.ac.uk, yasemin.nielsen@hw.ac.uk",
81,Performance Of Two-Component Systems With  Imperfect Repair,"mechanical systems degrade over time and ultimately fail. failed components of the system are either replaced or repaired, non-repairable components are usually inexpensive, and it is often more cost- effective to replace. this paper examines the behavior of two component repairable systems. the main objective is to determine the system’s performance of three configurations with identical components; namely series, parallel, and cold standby. closed form analytical expressions for steady state availability are derived and their behavior is illustrated by an example.","repairable, series, parallel","and Future Research As it has been shown, the closed form expressions for the steady state operational probability becomes more complicated as the number of repairs increases. In addition, the analytical derivation of the operational probability is easier for the series system than the standby system, while it is very tedious for the parallel configuration. The derived expressions for the steady state operational probability are generic in nature; they could be used for the perfect repair case under certain assumptions. Moreover, if other than the exponential distribution is assumed for the failure and repair rates, measuring the performance analytically becomes extremely difficult and tedious. Future works should examine systems with more than two-component with non-identical components, more than one repair channel, more complex configurations, and non exponential distributions. 646","mohammed a. hajeeh, shaima m. alshamali, and wafa awadh techno-economics division kuwait institute for scientific research, kuwait mhajeeh@kisr.edu.kw, sshamali@kisr.edu.kw, wawadh@kisr.edu.kw","References

82,Centralized Versus Decentralized Sewage Treatment Plant  In A Metropolitan City,"this work aims to economically evaluate centralized and decentralized sewage treatment plants (stps) for a metropolitan city. for the same, centralized and decentralized wastewater treatments for a catchment area in sharjah city (united arab emirates) were evaluated by net present value (npv) method. three options meeting local government regulations were considered for the catchment. options 1 and 2 were centralized, and option 3 was decentralized. option 1 was about connecting the catchment to the existing centralized stp location, option 2 to connect the catchment to the new proposed location which may be situated at the lowest point around the catchment area, and option 3 involved constructing three decentralized stps. the results showed that option 3 had the lowest npv of costs including capex and opex for 25 years. there was a saving in option 3 of around 44% compared to option 1, and 23% compared to option 2. this finding is useful for engineering managers for infrastructure planning for a metropolitan city like sharjah city.","catchment area, sharjah","This work was aimed to evaluate the centralized and decentralized STP in a metropolitan city like Sharjah city taking into consideration the local government requirements. The result showed that option 3 which is the decentralized system has the lowest NPV of the CAPEX and OPEX costs for 25 years. In option 3, it is supposed to construct three STPs, the first STP for zone 1 to zone 10 with a capacity of 15,630.2 m3/d, for zone 11 the capacity is 537.3 m3/d and for zone 12 the capacity is 1,731.2 m3/d. This option shows how the pump station and rising main in options 1 and 2 occupy great amount of investment resulting in saving around 44% from Option 1 and 23% from Option 2. This study shows the importance of evaluation of different alternatives in infrastructure planning. It is expected that the result from the Sharjah Sewage Infrastructure will open door for further research in UAE and similar metropolitan cities around the world. Recommendation for future research is to include treated effluent system to be a complimentary system in evaluating the costs.","m. affan badar department of applied engineering and technology management indiana state university terre haute, in 47809, usa m.affan.badar@indstate.edu senthilkumar venkatachalam department of civil engineering indian institute of technology palakkad, kerala, india senthil@iitpkd.ac.in zahraa a. yousif sani department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates u15100774@sharjah.ac.ae",
83,"Scheduling Of Diffusion Furnace In Semiconductor  Manufacturing A Literature Review, Classification And","scheduling began to be taken seriously in manufacturing industry at the beginning of 20th century with the work of henry gantt and other pioneers. manufacturing industries have to meet shipping dates that have been committed to customers, as failure to do so may result in a significant loss of goodwill. hence, they have to schedule the activities in such a way as to use the resources available in an efficient manner. among various manufacturing industries, semiconductor manufacturing industry is an extensive and highly competitive industry mainly due to the fact that both price and product-life for new electronics products are decreasing exponentially over time along with rapid technological advancements. in such kind of industries, the capability of meeting due-date along with the reduction of cycle time is the most decisive factor of the fierce competition in the global market place. hence, scheduling research remains among the most important tasks that must be performed routinely in sm industry. further, among various stages of sm, wafer fabrications are the most technologically complex process and challenging industrial environments in use today. the diffusion operation, carried out on batch processing machine, heavily impacts the production rate of wafer fabrication and in turn the sm industry. this is due to the fact that, diffusion operation requires relatively longest processing time among all the operations in the wafer fabrication. hence, there is a rich amount of research studies available in scheduling of diffusion furnace (df) since 1991 (i) to improve the due-date compliance, (ii) for significant reduction in the overall production time due to their longer processing time compared to other operations in the sm, and (iii) to effectively utilize the expensive resource. at the same time, the new researchers are struggle hard to get the relevant research studies. therefore, it is essential to harness the available research studies. accordingly, this study presents a literature review, classification schemes and a simple meta-analysis for scheduling of df research in sm industry. this review is based on a study of journals and web based documents/articles, which include conference materials, lecture notes in computer science, working papers, etc., which has been published between 1991 and 2019. based on the detailed literature review carried out, this study grouped the existing literature based on (i) type of data, (ii) machine environment, (iii) nature of scheduling, (iv) objectives, and (v) methodology considered by the author. this study help the researchers (readers), who are interested in scheduling of df by providing the source of reference, to identify the gap/untouched research problems and to understand the trend in scheduling of df.","diffusion furnace, literature review",,simple meta-analysis m. vimala rani1 vinod gupta school of management indian institute of technology (iit)-kharagpur vimala@vgsom.iitkgp.ac.in m. mathirajan department of management studies indian institute of science (iisc)-bangalore msdmathi@iisc.ac.in,

(b) environment: lighting, ambiance, temperature, security. (c) product: prices, variety, availability, promotions. however, in the regression model developed in the study, only variables that affect the consumer behavior and satisfaction are the following: shelf organization, height of shelves, aisle space, temperature, size of labels, baggage counter availability and lighting. these variables served as the basis of the researchers in developing a new layout design model for independent grocery stores using house of quality and systematic layout planning tools.","layout design, powell et al.","were broad and the factors need to be form accurately. Statistical analysis that will answer the “how?” and “what specifically?” will be a great help to the future researchers. The use of Multiple Regression Analysis in the relative importance indicated in House of Quality will help the analysis to be specified and the relationship will have a relevant basis from a statistical method. The part of the study about product arrangement can be further analyzed and evaluated through the use of different methods. The product placement or arrangement concluded should be applicable to different types and space of shelf.

88,A Facilities Planning Approach On Tenant Mix And  Positioning Of A Community Shopping Mall,"the shopping mall industry has rapid growth and it is highly attractive in the philippines. shopping malls compete with one another through their tenants to increase the malls’ foot traffic. this industry is driven by location, land area, mall tenants, anchor stores, and consumer behavior. the industry’s primary key success factor is tenant mix. however, as defined by casazza, (1985), “there is no single optimal tenant mix for shopping malls” and tenant mix should be tailored to meet the location, size, demographic profile and consumer needs. in most cases a tenant mix for one mall could be a mistake for another. dawson (1983) recommended that in a shopping mall non-anchor stores should not be clustered but dispersed throughout the mall because consumer focus on a shopping mall is changing as non-anchor stores and anchor stores are sharing the spot light as trend setters. in this study, researchers used this new erected shop: king doña carmen, as the subject, to determine the tenant mix and positioning that will decrease the payback of this shopping mall. the methodology involves four phases, first, knowing the consumer behavior through survey questionnaire, second, identifying the optimal tenant mix through benchmark with competitors and the result of phase one, third, using linear programming to identify the number and types of store to be placed in each floor and to propose a new layout design using systematic layout planning to improve rent income, and fourth, have a strategy timeline within the term lease of 20 years. it is concluded in the study that the result of the linear programming model to maximize the disposable income of consumers and facilities layout design through systematic layout planning will reduce the company’s payback period by two years and increase its monthly rent income.","shopping malls, community malls","The primary objective of the study is to assess the consumer behavior of Shop King Doña Carmen’s service area (5km radius) if the mall meets the consumers’ needs and wants, which will be used to evaluate Shop King Doña Carmen’s tenant mix and benchmark it with competitors near Shop King Doña Carmen. It is concluded in the primary objective of the study that the ten highest foot traffic generators are food shops, dessert shops, banks, beverages shops, beauty and health shops, clothing stores, beauty and health services, perfume shops, entertainment services, and footwear shops. Considering these foot traffic generators, these types of tenant categories should be prioritized. However, considering the disposable income the consumers are willing to spend, the ten highest income generators are the tenant categories of banks, cellphone shops, drugstores, clothing stores, baby shops, bags shops, appliance stores, bookstores, restaurants, and beauty and health shops. Among comparison with the three competitors it is concluded the tenant categories they have most in common are food shops, clothing stores, and beverages shops. Analyzing consumer needs and wants with the current confirmed tenants of Shop King Doña Carmen almost everything is in line with the consumer needs and wants except for one, which is Gym Services. Therefore, using the percentage of the potential foot traffic to be generated and multiplying it to the total leasable area of Shop King Doña Carmen which is total to 6101 sqm. The proposed tenant mix ratio allocation per store category is made and shown in table 3.3 Proposed Tenant Mix. Using the formulated LP model, it has successfully allocated all leasable areas with the corresponding number of stores per category. The store per category is equal to the allotted area in sqm divided by the estimated minimum area per category. Using the data gathered the author was able to recommend a revised floor plan that decreased the payback period of Shop King Doña Carmen.","madonna f. andrada, johanz matthew m. rivera school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines mfandrada@mapua.edu.ph, jmmrivera23@gmail.com",
89,Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Recsys Using  Distributed Q Table,"recommender systems are becoming ubiquitous in many settings and take many forms, from product recommendation in e-commerce stores, to query suggestions in search engines, to friend recommendation in social networks. present systems suffer from two limitations, firstly considering the recommendation as a static procedure and ignoring the dynamic interactive nature between users and the recommender systems. also, most of the works focus on the immediate feedback of recommended items and neglecting the long-term rewards based on reinforcement learning. in this paper, we propose a recommendation system that uses the q-learning method [1]. we use ε-greedy policy combined with q learning, a powerful method of reinforcement learning that handles those issues proficiently and gives the customer more chance to explore new pages or new products that are not popular [4]. usually while implementing reinforcement learning (rl) to real-world problems both the state space and the action space are very vast. therefore, to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose the multiple\distributed q table approach which can deal with large state-action space and that aides in actualizing the q learning algorithm in recommendation and huge state-action space.",recommender system,,"ritesh kumar department of industrial & systems engineering indian institute of technology, kharagpur kharagpur, 721302, india riteshiitkharag@gmail.com ravi ranjan senior associate data science publicis sapient bengaluru, 560037, india ravi.ranjan6@publicissapient.com","References

It was established that no formal e-waste collection and treatment was practiced. The responsibility of managing such waste lied with the producers of such waste but nevertheless almost 90% of the industries were lacking regular e-waste handling procedures. Storage and landfill disposal of the generated e-waste without proper segregation was prevalent due to lack of e-waste related policies to regulate e-waste flow across the industries. Lack of e-waste awareness contributed to poor stakeholder coordination towards combating the e-waste menace. The e-waste was found to contain high proportion of lighting equipment such compact and straight tube fluorescent lamps followed by ICT equipment.

92,Optimization Of Digital Advertising Portfolio Using Analytic  Hierarchy Process (Ahp)Based Goal Programming,"this study utilized the analytic hierarchy process (ahp)-based goal programming (gp) in the prioritization of the multiple goals in the digital advertising portfolio. ahp was used to determine the prioritylevel prior to the formulation of goal programming. a questionnaire was formulated and distributed among the 30 respondents to conduct a pairwise comparison among the 7 criteria and 8 alternatives. the set of criteria was determined and agreed collectively by the domain experts as aligned to the strategic objectives of the organization. the gp results showed that the 5 goals were achieved, while the other 3 were not satisfied. specifically, the p1was attained with a positive deviation of 9,969. the p3 was also satisfied with a positive deviation of 371,817. furthermore, p6 was attained with a positive deviation of 284,371 while the p5 and p8 were achieved without any deviations. on the other hand, p2 wasn’t satisfied as it has a negative deviation of 474,065. also, p4 and p7 were not achieved as both have negative deviations of 194,160 and 184,398, respectively.",,"As this study utilized the AHP, it was deemed to draw the interest of various researchers, primarily due to its promising method of determining the mathematical bounds of decision-making as well the fact that its intuitive and quite simple to formulate (Triantaphyllou & Mann, 1995). Thus, its inherent simplicity, according to Vargas (1990), was postulated through the pairwise comparison as anchored to its pre-determined criteria. Furthermore, its application to drive the advertising campaigns by efficiently managing the limited budget while the customer reach was being maximized allows the decision makers to have a highly reliable decision support tool (Aliyev, 2017).

94,A Single-Level Forecasting Inventory Simulation Model  Integrating Downstream Forecast Information,"in the field of operations and production management, inventory systems is the most studied aspect due to its high contributions to most companies’ expenses. in that respect, effective stock control is essential to the improvement of many businesses. problems arise, however, when conducting inventory management due to the many uncertainties faced. in this paper, the researchers address issues concerning the said uncertainties in inventory management through forecasting and supply chain integration in an inventory simulation model via microsoft excel and visual basic applications. the proposed model incorporates information coming from downstream tiers of the supply chain in computing the forecasts. the model was tested using a set of heuristic data using the incurred costs as performance measure. the findings show that the proposed model, in comparison with basic and classical forecasting and inventory management models, performs significantly better under the different conditions tackled in the study. the findings also suggest that the proposed model could be the basis of more complex inventory management models.",,"The study uses and modifies two similar forecasting tools, Simple Exponential Smoothing and the TSB method. For the modifications done, instead of just using the previous demand occurrence in the forecast computation, the average between the latest available downstream forecast and the actual demand last period are used, using only last period’s demand if no information from downstream tiers are available. Implication of the proposed forecasting method was done through an equation found in related literature. The ROP equation formulated by Syntetos and Babai (2007) uses forecasts for each period in calculating the ROP for the same period. By using this equation, the researchers were able to incorporate the two forecasting techniques in an inventory management system. The methods were then tested against the classical ROP computation approach in 1,440 Monte Carlo inventory simulation runs using a heuristic set of data. The results show that the proposed methods outperforms the classical approach under all conditions. For the first set of 360 runs without the availability of downstream forecast information, the TSB method generated the least cost on 180 runs (50% of the time), with SES having 139 runs (38.11%) and classic approach with 89 (24.72%). For the third set of 360 simulation runs, with the availability of downstream forecast information, the TSB method generated the least cost on 290 runs (80.56%), SES with 170 (47.22%) and classic approach with 28 (7.78%). Several enhancements can be done to further improve the model’s application on real-life scenarios. Since the model proposed in this study was only tested under a heuristic set of data, the researchers recommend doing case study using said model. Although the 10 randomly generated demand patterns could closely represent an empirical set of data, using the proposed model on a real life business situation would help prove its effectiveness. Particularly in a case involving the semiconductor industry. Since the simulations and results in the paper involved very high numbers, it was only able to prove that the model works robustly under a product which experiences the same range and variation. The study was also limited by the assumption that the demand pattern follows a Normal Distribution in computation of the ROP using forecasts. Assuming a more widely used probability distribution in the computation of the ROP could lead to a more controlled inventory simulation. Another step towards improving the proposed model is through modification for a multi-product inventory problem since the model proposed can only be using for a single-product inventory model. The model proposed is a very basic approach towards solving current inventory problems but it can be a baseline in coming up with a model to face more complex scenarios. 0 10000000 20000000 30000000 40000000 50000000 60000000 70000000 80000000 90000000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Inventory Position w/ Control Limits Series1 Series2 Series3 Series4 LCL CL UCL Inventory 1762","rene d. estember, antonio luis b. juarez, jonathan n. concepcion and raymond junrong s. zhuang school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university, manila, philippines rdestember@mapua.edu.ph, antonioluisjuarez94@gmail.com, jnconcepcion03@yahoo.com, zhuang_junrong@yahoo.com tsai-chi kuo department of industry management national taiwan university of science and technology no. 43, keelung rd., sec. 4, da’an dist. taipei 10607, taiwan tckuo@mail.ntust.edu.tw department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university 200 chung pei road, chung li district, taoyuan city, taiwan 32023, r. o. c. tckuo@cycu.edu.tw","References

95,The Important Criterions To Select The Optimum  Maintenance Strategy In Jordanian Food Industry,"the primary purpose of this research is to study the criterions used to select the maintenance strategy in the food industry. six criterions were identified; cost, historical data, added value, feasibility, safety, and equipment status. a survey was conducted in the jordanaina food industry to rank them based on the importance when selecting the maintenance strategy for machines, 93.5% of the surveys were completed. historical data was the significant (18.8%) followed by add value (18.3%), safety (17%), equipment status (16.8%), cost of maintenance (16.3%), and last is feasibility (12.8%).","food industry, jordan maintenance","The demand for high production and high quality has increased. This has raised the importance of manufacturing and high expectations regarding reliability and availability. This has led manufacturers to look for new ways to decrease or eliminate production line failure and shutdown, and therefore effective maintenance of machinery has become a big concern. There is a need to find maintenance strategies to achieve increased production and decrease the number of failures and downtime. For this reason, maintenance is now considered as an investment, which helps to increase the institution’s profit. There is a need to understand the criteria that should be used to determine the optimum and suitable maintenance strategies and programs to preserve machines and equipment in the production lines. After much research, it was found that most focused on six dimensions, which are: 1- Cost 2- Safety 3- Add value 4- Historical data 5- Feasibility 6- Equipment status. After studying the importance of these criteria by evaluating them from the perspective of maintenance expert’s opinion in the Jordanian food industry, it appears that the historical data criterion should be the most important criterion. Most of them believed that the past trends of the machine could help to determine or predict future expected failures. This means that preventive action can be completed and this is the cheapest and easiest way. The least essential criterion was considered to be feasibility which is divided into two criteria: acceptance by laborers and technique reliability. This may be because the food industry in Jordan has traditional production lines and new technology has not been tried and tested. 5.","osama t. al meanazel, ahmad saad, mazin h. obaidat, hesham a. almomani, ahmad m. qamar department of industrial engineering the hashemite university al zarqa, jordan osama@hu.edu.jo, eng.ahmadsaad@gmail.com, mazin@hu.edu.jo, heshamalmomani@hu.edu.jo, ahmaqam@hu.edu.jo rami h fouad department of industrial engineering university of jordan amman, jordan rhfouad@ju.edu.jo",

The model is formulated as non-linear and then transformed into a linear one by discretizing the maintenance period. Based on our results, using Block-AGAN in production planning requires having preventive maintenance in a less frequent manner than block-ABAO. However, the maintenance and production costs are higher.

97,An In-Depth Study On Challenges Faced By Junior Coal  Mining Companies In South Africa,"this paper revels the inception of junior coal mining companies into the coal space in south africa. even though they are supported by other entities like the government, eskom and transnet they still face a lot of challenges in operations, finance, logistics, equipment, and other issues leading to high risk of companies shutting down. literature review outlines the big coal mining houses and their contribution in the coal industry. due to that there is little knowledge about junior coal mining companies the researcher conducted an explorative descriptive design method which included questionnaires and interviews on 85 junior companies. the results show that they do contract mining, hire transportation, and they get most of their finance from the private investors. in conclusion the public and private sector should do more in order to ensure the survival of junior coal mining companies. 1. introduction the south african coal industry has of late witnessed a number of junior coal companies joining the sector. however, these junior companies seem to be facing a number of challenges, particularly in production processes. a junior company is defined by mitchell (2016) as prospecting organizations who are just associated with the beginning phases of mining. anyway, in south africa, it implies a black economic empowerment organization (bee) or a small scale mining activity and there is an expanding number of junior coal mining organizations in south africa, which account for 30% of the coal production according to prevost (2013). junior coal miners are supported by the government through the mining charter of 2016 which encourages 26% black ownership (broad based black-economic empowerment) in mining companies. on the other hand, junior coal miners are supported by eskom which wants them to supply 40% of thermal coal (eskom, 2016). based on this, richards bay coal terminal in conjunction with transnet increased its capacity to boost junior coal miners (kolver, 2014). regardless of all this support junior coal miners still face a lot of challenges in operations, finance, skilled personal, equipment, legal documentation, safety, environment, and other issues leading to high risk of companies shutting down. according to deloitte (2016) reports states that as exploration dwindles, junior miners continue to fight tooth and nail for survival and, despite these headwinds, governments still expect miners to help bolster their economies through taxes, royalty fees, shares of profit, infrastructure spend and community investments. 2. literature review according to hartnady (2011), coal crisis in south africa which has been caused by absence of re-investment by the major coal mining entities like anglo coal, bhp billiton, exxaro, sasol, and glenco, which opened up opportunities for junior coal mining companies, with the assistance received from the government, eskom, transnet and richards bay coal terminal. prevost (2003) “the south african coal industry is rapidly approaching a stage of stagnation, mainly due to a lack of re-investment by the main producers, when the industry has therefore recently not been able to raise its production. on the contrary, the industry is steadily decreasing its coal 2845",,"In conclusion this paper provided an insight into the challenges and support on junior coal mining companies. Although there is support much has to be done in order for the industry to survive the storm. If this is not done a lot of companies will shut down causing a spill over effect into job losses, load shading which will in-turn affect other industries. 6. Bibliography 1) Burns, A.C. & Bush, R.F.

102,Solution Approaches For The Berth Allocation Problem In  Container Terminal Logistics – A Review,"container terminal (ct) logistics is one of the important elements of any country’s economy as it affects distribution efficiency, interest rates, productivity, energy costs and energy availability. for reaping profits, ct optimize various decisions related to the allocation of berth to vessel, choice of material handling equipment, scheduling of quay cranes, scheduling of stacking cranes, scheduling of agvs, traffic control of agvs and determination of stack capacity, personnel management, etc. amongst all decision problems in ct, berth allocation problem (bap) is the very first decision to be taken which serves as an input to various other management decisions at the ct, as optimal scheduling of berth will improve satisfaction among shipping companies and enhance the performance of cts and in turn will help in generating higher profits for them. there is a large body of research studies available related to bap. the objective of this study is to conduct a detailed review of formulation of bap model and solution approaches addressed for bap for helping new researchers, particularly for understanding the various modelling and solution methodologies presented so far in the literature, working in the area of bap. accordingly, a detailed review was conducted based on scientific journals, conference papers, dissertations, working papers etc. based on all possible descriptors to identify research papers on bap, we identified research papers published between 1992 and 2019. we classified these literatures based on bap-configuration wise studies proposing various mathematical modelling, exact methods, simple constructive heuristic approaches, and metaheuristic approaches. finally, we acknowledge that the review presented in this study cannot be claimed to be exhaustive, but the output of this study does provide reasonable insights into the state-of-the-art on solution approaches to bap research. further, it is hoped that, the output of this focused review will provide a source of reference for any new researchers/readers in identifying or developing newness in terms of problem configuration, solution methodologies, and objective(s) of bap being proposed and help simulate further interest.","mathematical model, heuristic approach",,"ankita panchariya and m. mathirajan department of management studies, indian institute of science, bangalore, india email: ankigcek@gmail.com and msdmathi@iisc.ac.in",
103,A Simple Multivariate Bubble Point Correlation For Deep  Offshore Niger Delta Crude,"in this study, a new linear bubble point correlation for deep offshore niger delta crude was developed using excel. using 129 data points characterizing crude from deep offshore niger delta fields, a simple multivariate model was developed by dividing the data points into modeling and validation data. with r2 of 0.999, the new model was found to satisfactorily predict the bubble point pressure of deep offshore niger delta crude samples. however, it was discovered that for crude samples with api density less than 50, the percentage error between predicted actual bubble points were less than 10%. while for crude samples with api gravity above 50, percentage error was above 10%, reaching up more than 60% in for some api gravities. therefore, it was deduced that the developed model is applicable to deep offshore niger delta crude samples with api densities less than 50.","bubble point, api gravity","From this study, bubble point pressure correlation has been developed for a Niger Delta field. This correlation can be used in calculating bubble point pressure using available data gathered from field. This can be used in defining this important parameter in the absence of experimental value in calculating material balance, analysis of well performance, reservoir simulation and production engineering calculations. The developed model is applicable to deep offshore Niger Delta crude. The model is a linear multivariate model which can predict bubble point pressure satisfactorily for crude oil samples with API gravity of less than 50, which is typically the kind of crude oil found in this region. 6.","jonathan francis, phd and prof. joseph ajienka world bank africa centre of excellence centre for oilfield chemicals research university of port harcourt port harcourt, rivers state, nigeria jonat.francis@hotmail.com; joseph.ajienka@uniport.edu.ng",
104,Real-Time Monitoring Of The Semiconductor Wirebond  Interconnection Process For Production Yield And Quality,"the electronics industry in the philippine is the largest contributor to the manufacturing sector within the country. the philippines is also considered the fastest growing economy in the region where its electronics products are among its top exports. the manufacturing of new electronics devices that comes with the emerging technologies translate to new processes that require new equipment that poses challenges to the industry. thus, innovative solutions are developed by the engineers to improve and increase the production yield. this study presents the development of a monitoring system that is interfaced to an existing wirebonding machine as a means of improving production yield. the system detects and records the bouncing of the “area under bond” which is identified as a major cause of product rejection. the arduino-based microcon- troller takes the u/sg (ultrasonic generator/gain) signals from the machine. the raspberry pi monitors the real-time signal provided by the microcontroller and compares the signal from the database module with trained signals. tests run show that the system can detect the signals and present it in a “.csv” file format. twenty (20) units of a specific electronic device were tested to identify between good and defective device. 678",,"Based on the result of evaluation, using the Arduino-based microcontroller and raspberry pi system can acquire signal from existing wirebond and monitor the ultrasonic generator signal on each wirebond. All signals acquired can be determined to be good or poor. The system can detect if the machine needs to stop operations before further wirebonds lead to more device rejection. It is recommended to validate the obtained system on 1000 wire bond unit for further study and analysis. It is also recommended to feed the acquired data in machine learning algorithm for prediction analysis. Table 1.

We proposed the term ‘Project Management Research Agenda’ as an umbrella concept involving the various studies related to project management and schools of thought. The literature review shows how the research agenda was reviewed from the earlier classical type, rethinking project management, brave new world and finally the project studies. Svejvig and Andersen (2015) mentioned that the traditional aim is solving the project problems, increasing the productivity and the effectiveness which can be done by understanding and highlighting the nature of the project and its environment. Moreover, the purpose behind identifying the schools of project management is to understand various perspectives and tasks that lead to make decisions and achieve goals. The nine schools of thought – Optimization School, Modeling School, Governance School, Behavior School, Success School, Decision School, Process School, Contingency School and Marketing School – introduced by Bredillet (2007c) - were identified clearly in the literature review and the interaction between the different schools was explicated. In addition, the School of Management was discussed, supported by a brief definition to build up a clear vision of its relationship with the School of Project Management.","alya j. abuseem university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates u18104184@sharjah.ac.ae",

In particular, we looked at the supply component of a supply chain and considered the case of a manufacturing company operating in the automotive sector. We have shown the limits of the traditional approach to risk management, especially at the stage of assessing these risks. The first limitation is due to the difficulty of the absolute evaluation of the criteria (Probability and severity) of a risk. We have suggested the use of the AHP method for easier assessment based on a relative comparison of risk criteria. The second limitation of the classical method concerns the fact that this method does not take into account the dependence between the risks.

112,A Decision-Based Design Framework For A Commercial  Product,"the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the application of decision-based design (dbd) framework to a commercial product—a foldable hand truck. this paper’s new contributions to dbd framework are the application of discrete choice analysis (dca) in dbd framework that greatly simplifies the task of customer survey, resembles the real purchase behavior of the customers and reflects their preferences on the product design better, and recommendations for the utilization of the dbd framework in future product design applications. the selected application problem is a foldable hand truck. in contrast with the conventional hand truck, a foldable hand truck can be folded and moved through the stairs. also, the feature foldability saves a considerable amount of storage space.",engineering design,"and Future Work In this research, the limitations of traditional approaches to engineering design and problems associated with the multi-criteria design methodologies have been elucidated. In this regard, the DBD methodology is seen as a remedy to these limitations which employs a single-criterion approach to design and select the preferred alternatives consistently and unambiguously. The customer survey was embedded with DCA so that it resembles closely with actual consumer buying behavior. Finally, the complete DBD process has been demonstrated by applying it to a new product design problem. DBD enables us to reflect customer preferences in the engineering design process of product development. However, difficulties may arise in situations where customers never used the product or customers are little familiarized with the product. This might occur during the development of a completely new type of product whose design has been radically changed. In these cases, customers may find it difficult to respond to the survey due to their lack of product knowledge which eventually may result in unreliable survey data. In some cases, the design specification may affect the marketing, inventory and distribution costs (Wassenaar et al., 2005). For example, packaging costs may depend on the physical dimensions of the product. The impact of marketing, inventory and distribution cost can be incorporated in the DBD framework in the future. The DBD framework can be made robust by taking account uncertainty into the objective function, constraints and design variables. Thus Decision Based Robust Design can be another possible scope for future efforts to improve the framework.","tanvir ibna kaisar and kais zaman department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology shahbagh, dhaka-1000, bangladesh tanvirkaisar@ipe.buet.ac.bd, akmkbzaman@ipe.buet.ac.bd",

116,A Quality Control Application In A Furniture Company,"this study deals with a quality control application in a furniture manufacturing company. furniture manufacturing involves several wood cutting operations in specified dimensions. based on our investigation in a selected sofa-manufacturing factory, we have observed that cutting operations are not done in accurate procedures and usually result in wood slabs, which deviate from standard dimensions. one of the reasons that wood cutting operations are not done as accurate as the metal cutting operations is because it is easy to recut the excessive part on the longer wood slabs, and to add a small piece to the wood slabs which is cut shorter. these types of simple remedies are not possible in metal cuts. while these extra processes do not appear to be significant, when they are added up in a mass manufacturing system, the waste in workers time, as well as in material usage, becomes substantial. we have investigated a specific sofa manufacturing system and developed some hypothesis testing procedures to prove to the management the significance of the cutting deviations from the standard requirements. amount of waste in labor time and material usage are quantified for a selected manufacturing period. furthermore, some quality control procedures, including control charts, are developed and implemented in the factory to control the cutting operations. the procedures and the results presented in this study can be used by managers as guidelines in furniture manufacturing industry to improve their cutting operations and minimize the waste.","wood cutting, quality control","This project aims to improve the quality of sofa furniture production by implementing engineering statistics & quality control techniques to reduce process variability. This results in reducing excess material waste and opportunity loss, as well as increasing the level of perfection in order to meet customer requirements. Based on the study, we were able to address a significant analysis which could result in improvement of furniture manufacturing processes by applying statistical process control tools. Based on capability analysis, the company has huge opportunity to reduce financial burden by increasing the capability of production processes up to (1.25). Also, by applying quality control charts, company could be able to assure accurate monitoring of the process stability and eliminate erroneous results. As a further research, it is helpful to establish quantitative indicators to easily capture any sort of shifting of a certain process which can be used to cut off overhead cost significantly. Other quality attributes, in addition to length of strip wood cuts, should be monitored by control charts, which would play important roles in process monitoring in furniture industry. One of important measure that should be stringently controlled is the fabrics cut and sewn to fit the sofa units. A lot of wasted material and quality control problems can be seen in these processes and need detailed study and analysis. Such studies can minimize wasted fabric material, contribute to company profits and also economy of the country in general. Because of time limitations, this issue could not be included in this study.","mehmet savsar kuwait university industrial engineering department, kuwait and üsküdar university industrial engineering department, istanbul, turkey msavsar@gmail.com hazza alotaibi kuwait university industrial engineering department, kuwait hazza.alotaibi@eng.ku.edu.kw",
117,A Simulation-Based Optimization Approach To Facilityallocation Under Demand Uncertainty And Enforced Level,"deciding on the number and configuration of distribution centers (dc) is one of the most impactful decisions that create a pathway for competitiveness and responsiveness. in this research, the allocation of distribution center problem is studied under demand uncertainty. the purposes of this study were to specify the optimal number and allocation of distribution centers out of candidate ones. this paper proposes a three-step model with probabilistically distributed demand where the coefficient of variation is the measure of risk along with the enforced level of service metrics that are focused on responsiveness which aligns with real-world problems and the considered company, working as a backward linkage of the fast fashion industry. to consider uncertainty, a set of scenarios for customer demands is created based on the monte carlo simulation. the best network structure is identified by optimizing each scenario and detecting which configuration has been observed the highest amount of times. furthermore, the uncertainty of demands creates variations of the optimized total cost which is imposed on the logistical system. notably, this research has been done in one of the oldest textile yarn distribution firms in bangladesh.","demand uncertainty, network design, manufacturers","In this paper, a facility allocation model has been formulated in order to identify the optimal allocation of distribution centers out of candidate centers. The objective function was modeled to minimize the total cost that includes inbound transportation cost, outbound transportation cost, goods handling cost, fixed cost of opening a distribution center and sourcing cost of the goods. The model is formulated as a three-echelon supply chain model with demand uncertainty with two plants or goods sourcing points, five candidate distribution centers, and eleven aggregated customer zones. To represent the uncertainty of demands, scenarios have been generated using the Monte Carlo Simulation technique with the coefficient of variation. In the developed model it has been made sure that the average customer is not at a great distance as well as not a great number of customers is far away to impose the required level of service in the optimal outcome. The result gives us a probabilistic output that shows us that it would be optimal to open four distribution centers without the one that had the lowest optimal appearance with a probability of 84.2%. The uncertainty of demand that is taken into consideration in this study is generated because of the existing fierce bullwhip effect throughout the whole supply chain. Although the generated demand is the most visible and impactful area where unpredictability is present, other components of uncertainty can also be considered as an extension of this study. Furthermore, other additional elements of the level of service like the condition of the delivered product, after- sales service and strict time windows for delivering the products can also be taken into account for future studies. Moreover, the objective of this model was to minimize the incurred cost for the considered element and multi-objective models might also be explored as an improvement of model formulation.","of service joyjit bhowmick trade services (pvt.) ltd. dhaka, bangladesh joyjittspl@gmail.com",

123,Responsible Manufacturing Practice Be The Right  Paradigmperspective Bangladesh,"the problem investigated in this research was that the vast majority of the manufacturing practices in bangladesh are being invariably dealt with little or no regard for the current field- tested paradigm of what is called responsible manufacturing practices, which addresses the socio- economic milieu while adding value in every step of the process itself. the prime objective of this experimental research was to compare the effect of responsible manufacturing instructional design interventions in the socio-economic intersection to foster sustainability and hence maximizing wealth. a case study based on action research has been deployed in the investigation. results signified that responsible manufacturing practices statistically improved firms’ performance in the value-based propositions compared to the traditional method both in tangible & intangible terms. in brief, the very practice significantly improved firms’ attitude, satisfaction, motivation and perception towards reconstructing sustainability by balancing the wider set of trade-offs that lies within.","bangladesh, manufacturing, responsible","Milton Friedman (1970) argued that ""the business of business is business"", and that the foremost concern of organizations should be profit, and not CSR and sustainability issues. However, many CEOs reported that sustainability issues are rising on their agendas (HBR, 2010). It would seem that much sustainable OM research is still driven by the profit paradigm, linking sustainability with organizational and financial performance. Are sustainability initiatives only of value if they lead to a profit or competitive advantage? Or are responsible business practices a worthwhile endeavor regardless of profits? Although Bangladesh has achieved noteworthy success with respect to all three pillars of sustainable development, yet, much more are needed to be done in relation to constructing a pathway for an accelerated development of the country. Responsible manufacturing model is in a position to lead the business disciplines in sustainability research and practice. This paper continues the sustainability leadership position of Responsible manufacturing practices. Given this situation, we look forward to seeing the exciting developments in sustainable manufacturing with a view to shifting the attention of the world market towards Bangladesh. Failing to do so might as well prove disastrous for Bangladesh. And, it has never been more an uphill task for countries, as in Bangladesh in this fragmented world. Responsible manufacturing fueled by sustainability issues would capture the bold change that business seeks to create in the world. Infusing the model under question requires a strategic choice in the context of Triple Bottom Line. And in turn, it helps prioritize, differentiate and design more exceptional experiences in the long run.","md. ziaur rahman assistant professor, department of business administration, metropolitan university, sylhet, bangladesh titu@metrouni.edu.bd dr. mohammad iqbal professor, industrial & production engineering department shahjalal university of science & technology sylhet, bangladesh iqbalm_ipe@yahoo.com",

Two mathematical methods for Weibull parameters estimation have been estimated numerically and graphically to simulate wind speed data obtained from measurement data provided by K.A.CARE. Results obtained using the two methods, namely the Weibull Least Squares and the Weibull Openwind compared quiet well with the experimental data obatained from K.A.CARE. The use of Weibull distribution indicates that the region of Riyadh might be suitable for installing wind turbine machines. , The monthly average wind speed and frequency distribution of wind speed in Riyadh has been plotted and analyzed for a possible deployment of wind power in Riyadh.

125,Trust In Smart Energy Meters: The Role Of Perceived Values  Ahmed Shuhaiber,"a smart energy meter is one of the smart city applications that record, monitor, control, analyze, and predict in-house energy consumption. although smart energy meters have great capabilities, this technology is still in very early stages in many developing countries, and little is known about users’ trust in this technology and what perceived values are associated with trust from users’ perspectives. therefore, this research aimed to fill this gap by examining the influence of four different types of perceived values on residents’ trust in smart meters in uae. by following a quantitative approach, 266 survey responses were tested by using structural equation modeling-partial least squares. the statistical results genuinely indicated that perceived epistemic values significantly impact emotional values, monetary values and convenience values, and that emotional values, monetary value and convenience values significantly influence users’ trust in smart energy meters. in addition, the three perceived values of monetary, emotional and convenience also play a significant mediating role between perceived epistemic values and trust in smart energy meters. theoretical and practical implications are indicated, and directions of future research are specified afterwards.","convenience values, emotional values, epistemic values, monetary values","It is noteworthy that the strongest path in the research model is the influence of perceived epistemic value on monetary value (β = 0.643), whereas perceived monetary value scored the lowest value in affecting trust in this technology (β = 0.156), but it was still found a significant path on 5% confidence interval. The amount of variance explained by R² provides an indication of the model fit as well as the predictive ability of the endogenous variables. The R² scores should be greater or equal to 0.10 (Hair et al., 2016). As a result, the R² value of ‘Trust’ was found moderate and equal to 56.8%. Other R² scores are presented and shown in Figure 1. Overall, the four dimensions of perceived values are found to have a significant influence on either trust in smart meter in a direct or indirect way. Perceived epistemic value 311","college of technological innovation zayed university abu dhabi, uae ahmed.shuhaiber@zu.ac.ae","References

126,Closed-Loop Supply Chain For Seawater Desalination: A  Performance Measurement Model,"the expansions of global population, increasing water demand, along with recent climate changes and scarceness of natural water sources, have caused the increment need of seawater desalination worldwide. much attention has been paid in the water desalination literature to optimize the unit processes of a single desalination plant and its operations. nevertheless, there are few researches considered evaluating the desalination supply chain as a whole, more particularly closed-loop supply chain. examining the water desalination process as a closed-loop supply chain allows decision makers to evaluate the performance of water desalination operations end to end. thus, the purpose of this study is to develop a performance measurement model for closed-loop supply chain in water desalination industry. the research methodology is based on literature analysis concerning performance measurement in closed-loop supply chain to be applied for companies belonging to the water desalination industry. since the study focuses on a specific industry, this could be seen as a limitation. the proposed model could serve as a reference for the desalination industry to establish applicable performance appraisal indicators. it is believed that both researchers and practitioners would benefit from the model developed.","supply chain, desalination, closed-loop","Shortage of fresh water is one of the major challenges for life in earth planet. Even countries which do not suffer from water scarcity at the current time might experience water shortages in the near future due to population growth, climate change and desertification. Therefore, seawater desalination has been realized as a feasible solution to water shortage problem. It is important to assess the performance of water desalination operations holistically by considering the seawater treatment process by desalination plants as well as the process of providing the desalinated water to consumers. The focus on closed-loop SC is a step towards the wider adoption and expansion of sustainability, since the SC considers the product starting from its initial processing of raw materials up to the delivery point to consumers. This study has proposed a performance measurement model to evaluate and ultimately enhance the closed-loop SC performance in seawater desalination industry. Based on the literature review, the collected performance metrics were distributed into BSC model perspectives which are financial, customer, internal processes, and learning & innovation as well as environment to construct the performance model for the closed-loop water desalination supply chain. This research contributed to further understanding the nature of seawater desalination industry and allow for refinement of future research. Moreover, this research is likely going to help stakeholders of the industry by fostering a better understanding of the impact of SCM toward the closed-loop water desalination performance. The decision makers should be able to know the story of current performance through digits and graphs and how to enhance it in future.","hasan balfaqih supply chain management department college of business administration (cba) university of business and technology (ubt) jeddah 21448, kingdom of saudi arabia h.balfaqih@ubt.edu.sa",
127,Supply Contract Analysis For An Eco-Friendly Textile Supply  Chain,"in recent times, the world has experienced the rising importance of environmental friendliness in the textile and apparel industry. examples of organizations such as patagonia, walmart, etc. signify this phenomenon. motivated by this issue, here we design a dyadic environmental friendly textile supply chain comprising one apparel manufacturer and one apparel retailer under price and environmental friendliness sensitive demand. first, we design the supply chain under a centralized and a decentralized setting using wholesale price contract. here, we determine the optimal greening level, wholesale price, retail price of the apparel. then, we propose two mechanisms, i.e., cost-sharing and profit-sharing approach between the apparel manufacturer and the apparel retailer to improve the greening level of the apparel. under these mechanisms, we determine the optimal greening level, wholesale price, retail price of the apparel. with the help of comparative analysis, we show that the greening level and the profitability of the supply chain members increase under these mechanisms compared to that under wholesale price contract, whereas profit-sharing mechanism emerges as the best option for both. additionally, we demonstrate the impact of the customer’s green sensitiveness and the cost of greening production on the decision variables mentioned above.","textile industry, supply contract, profit-sharing",,"arnab adhikari operations management group indian institute of management ranchi jharkhand, india arnab.a@iimranchi.ac.in",

130,Correlating Brain Dominance And Hand Preference To  Academic Tracks: A Case For Senior High School Students,"this study explored the correlation of hand preference to brain dominance of senior high school students (shs) in the philippines using the hermann brain dominance instrument (hbdi) questionnaire. students were asked to accomplish the questionnaire and their scores were evaluated to confirm the theory of sperry (1981) which suggested that the brain dominance of a person is lateral to his hand preference. further, the characteristics of students in the four (4) academic strands for shs were also assessed to verify if students have chosen the appropriate track that could enhance their skillset as individuals. results revealed that sperry’s theory was conclusive since most of the students with right hand preference demonstrated left- brain dominance and possessed the characteristics of being analytical, logical, and critical thinkers which are appropriate for the academic track they were enrolled in while students with left-hand preference are creative thinkers and artistic and exhibited dominance of the right side of the brain. students who posses the character of being logical and have above average ability in mathematics and problem solving may pursue careers in science, technology, and engineering since these professions require analysis of data, perform various calculations, and create innovative designs. consequently, the study will aid not only the students in finding the best profession suited for them in the future but will also help the teachers in assessing the profiles of their students to identify the suitable teaching methodologies in the classroom.","brain dominance, hand preference","The theory stating that individuals may be left-brained or right-brained means that people in general have specific skillset unique to the activities of the brain.

131,Ereserba Cardinal: An Integrated Room Reservation  System For Higher Education Institutions,"the advancement of technology required most organizations today to utilize an integrated information system. the use of such system was proven to help improve different types of processes through elimination of delays and minimizing errors. this study was conducted to optimize the scheduling of room reservation of a higher education institution in the philippines which was found to be highly manual, time consuming, and tedious. different units were responsible for the management of various rooms and their office locations were scattered around the campus that required too much traveling activities. similarly, delays were also experienced due to availability issues of the concerned and authorized personnel who will approve the usage of rooms. through information system design, an online system called ereserba cardinal was created to facilitate ease of room management, provide real-time information, and offer a convenient manner of room reservation for students, faculty and personnel.","integrated systems, room reservation, process flowcharts","Manual processes are commonly found to be prone to data inaccuracies, are time consuming, and cost inefficient. The use of technology, particularly an information system, improves system efficiency, allows for better management of facilities, and increases worker productivity because a lot of non-value adding activities such as waiting times and travelling can be eliminated. The eReserba Cardinal, an integrated system for room reservation at HEIs, is a web- based application that will aid users to conveniently monitor the status of reservation request and easily manage various facilities and equipment. eReserba Cardinal can help eliminate the non-essential steps and redundancies in the current room reservation system of the institution, thus improving the speed and quality of the service the institution provides. The use of this system will also help reduce the usage of papers and go for eco-friendly transactions. In turn, organizations may be able to save money and help protect the environment. Future researchers can perform simulation of the proposed online reservation system in order to verify the system’s efficiency and applicability to other HEIs. In addition, creating an information system for other services offered by the HEI may also be done to optimize the other processes. A mobile application may also be developed to complement the eReserba Cardinal web- based system so that users can easily and readily reserve their preferred rooms at a more convenient manner.","paz clariz a. barzaga, josephine d. german, guiller o. binoya, samantha dominique c. bucao, samantha cyrine r. ibe, and dave cullen g. yap school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university, manila, philippines pcabarzaga@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jdgerman@mapua.edu.ph, gobinoya@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, sdcbucao@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, scribe@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, dcgyap@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",
132,Assessment And Improvement Of Facebook Business  Platforms For Smes In The Philippines,"social networking sites, such as facebook, allow users to create a public profile and interact with other users. one of its features is having a business page wherein users or business minded people advertise and sell their products online. living in the fast phase environment and advancing technology, the role of social media in the social economy is seen to increase. smes are facing strong expectations for their role to be key players when economies recover from the present global recession. previous researches include the use of social media as a marketing strategy for businesses however, the standard design for business platforms is yet to be realized. such in the case of facebook, it is observed that the features, use, and settings of its business page are not being maximized by the business owners. nonetheless, it is the intent of this study to standardize business platforms in social networking sites. focusing on facebook’s platform, the researchers were able to classify the categories that small and medium online businesses sell as well as assess its significant factors and failure points that may affect customer’s decision making using the facebook page interface. lastly, to meet the user requirements for the proposed business platform design, the study used quality function development and failure mode and effects analysis.","business platform, facebook","The success of an online business Facebook page relies on its interface. When purchasing online, buyers cannot touch the products, smell them, feel them, taste them, or use them therefore, it takes exceptional persuasive power and powerful content to sell online where customers base their decisions on content in its many forms such as written descriptions, photos, videos, reviews, spec sheets and product demos (Ganoe 2014). The researchers intend to design an online business page with the needs of the customers in mind, capitalizing on its features and settings to prevent redundancy of posts and avoid customer confusion. Likewise, help business owners in managing their business page conveniently. The proposed interface developed by the researchers, based on the data and results articulated, arranged and displayed significant posts of what was needed in an online Facebook business page. Potential users were asked to test the new design wherein time observations were gathered. Results showed a significant decrease in time spent on browsing the page and when posting to buy the product. It only took an average of 1.75 minutes for a customer to complete an online transaction which is 15% lower than the current interface. The users also remarked how the page looked pleasant in the eye as decluttering was minimized and noted the convenience in exploring the page as the time consumed to scroll the page was reduced. This research study also proved that there is a need for improvement with the current Facebook business platform. This implies to maximize the utilization of the features offered by Facebook and to use the settings of the platform efficiently to increase online sales and sustain the business for the long term. Moreover, the limitations of this study is it focused only on the fashion product line since it dominated the online business shopping trend. However, researchers who want to improve this study can as well assess platforms of other online stores selling various or multiple products (e.g. Electronics, Toys, Food). 1820","jenalyn shigella g. yandug, diana marie b. de francia, and joymicah o. paulo school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university muralla st., intramuros, manila jsgyandug@mapua.edu.ph, dmbdefrancia@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jopaulo@mymail.mapua.edu.ph","References

140,Improving Fast-Food Restaurants’ Method Of Operation:  Automated Drive-Through Ordering System,"as digitalization is on the rise, customers are rapidly changing the way they engage with accessibility and convenience yet the typical drive-through remains unchanged from when it was first introduced in 1947. the researchers conducted a time study in different fast-food restaurants that offer a drive-through service in metro manila, philippines. data showed an average of 6.27 minutes for the whole transaction in the current layout. through the use of promodel software, the researchers have identified that out of 100 customers, 57 of them experience long queues and delays while 43 of them does not. this paper aims to provide an improved method of operation by revamping the traditional layout of a fast-food drive-through. at the end of the study, the researchers designed a system to balance speed and order accuracy in a drive-through restaurant, reducing the processing time in the proposed layout by 52%, equivalent to 3.27 minutes. the simulation results show that 57 customers who experience long queues and delays in the current system have been reduced to 8 customers in the proposed system which has an 86% improvement in the operation.","digitalization, accessibility, convenience, staging station","Fast-food restaurants have upgraded their services through drive-through that can be used by customers who have their cars with them and do not want to leave it in the parking or wants to have their food but are in a rush. As drive- through became popular for the customers, the management began to encounter problems in their drive-through service. The researchers conducted a time study to measure the elapsed time by every process in ordering in a drive- through restaurant. Long queues of cars, long time waiting for the orders, small spaces for cars, and fewer items are present at the order station are just some of the problems being encountered by the customers. These are also the reasons why the researchers came up with the idea of improving the ordering system of a drive-through and the goal is to reduce problems so that fast-food restaurants would be able to satisfy the customers and to allocate their services to more customers. In the comparison of the proposed system versus the current system in drive-throughs, the proposed system has an ordering menu display and a built-in payment collection process where the customer will have a choice between cash or card payment. If the customer chooses to pay in cash, the customers can conveniently insert their cash in the kiosk. This method reduces the time and costs for fast-food drive-through as the company does not need to put different windows for the ordering process and payment process. The proposed system also shows on screen the status of the orders and notifies the customer whenever their orders are done and that will be the only time, customers can leave the staging station to pick their food up unlike in the current system, customers have to wait in queue for their orders. This system also reduces the bottlenecks in the drive-through which currently the main problem being encountered by fast-food restaurants, especially during rush hours. The researcher also provided a floor plan layout of the drive-through for implementation. With this proposed system, the researchers are expecting that the management will increase the number of customers that they will be served, and the customer’s specifications will be met. Using the current self-service kiosk as a basis for the proposed system, the researchers were able to reduce the average time of transactions the customers have to spend while ordering. From the current system having an average time of 6.27 minutes per customer, it went down to just 3.27 minutes. Through the use of ProModel Software, the researchers discovered that in the current system, 57 customers out of 100 are experiencing delays and long queues. By creating a simulation for the proposed system, the researchers were able to improve the customer service of the fast-food by reducing the number of customers who are experiencing delays and long queues from 57 customers to just 8 out of 100 which provides an 86% improvement. The researchers recommend adding the function of a reloadable smart card for payment. The customers will have an additional option on how they want to pay for their orders. It will be a small card that can be tapped onto the system after ordering and it will process the payment afterward. The researchers also recommend adding a mobile application or online website for the customers to order in advance and pick up their orders at the fast-food drive- through. Order customization; discounts for persons with disabilities (PWD) and senior citizens; and discounts for coupons/vouchers can also be added to the system.","allysa mae m. castillo, louie john l. salonga, john allen l. sia, and michael n. young school of industrial engineering and service engineering management mapúa university, intramuros, 1002, philippines maecastillo01@gmail.com, louiejohnsalonga@gmail.com, allensia4500@gmail.com, and mnyoung@mapua.edu.ph",
141,20 Years Of Scientific Evolution Of Cyber Security: A Science  Mapping,"the technologies of industry 4.0 such as big data brings challenges since companies will have to deal with a large amount of data that will help to anticipate and solve problems in development, ﬂexibility and organizational efﬁciency. on the other hand, companies need to create defenses strategies, also known as “cyber security” in order to deal with the cyber-attacks. the objective of this study is to perform a science mapping in the field of study of cyber security in order to discover current topics, authors in the field and create a map of the area of study, identify productive themes with great scientific impact and point challenges, perspectives and suggestion for future works. to perform this science mapping, the scimat (science mapping analysis software tool) was used. besides, the vosviewer was used to analyze co-authorship between countries and authors. the scientific evolution presented 17 clusters whereby the most representative themes are: 'challenges', 'framework' and ‘intrusion detection’. the analysis of the network of the cluster 314",,,"leonardo bertolin furstenau1, michele kremer sott1, andrio jonas ouriques homrich2 and liane mahlmann kipper3 1master student of graduate program in industrial systems and processes 2undergraduate student of production engineering 3professor of graduate program in industrial systems and processes university of santa cruz do sul (unisc) santa cruz do sul – brazil leonardofurstenau@mx2.unisc.br, micheleksott@mx2.unisc.br, andrio@mx2.unisc.br, liane@unisc.br abdul aziz al abri professor of advanced cyber security academy advanced cyber security academy muscat – oman abdulaziz.alabri@aca.om theodoro flores cardoso undergraduate student of automation and control engineering pontifical catholic university of rio grande do sul (pucrs) porto alegre – brazil cardoso.theodoro@gmail.com josé ricardo lópez-robles management engineering phd university of the basque country bilbao – spain ricardolopezrobles@outlook.com manuel j. cobo professor at the dept. of computer science and engineering university of cadiz cadiz – spain manueljesus.cobo@uca.es",
142,The Use Of Industry 4.0 Concepts In The Retailing Process Of  The Automotive Industry,"the world is witnessing a tremendous breakthrough in technology owing to the use of the internet and electronic devices. accordingly, the relationship between companies and their customers will be closer than before. these changes will allow products’ users to communicate with their manufacturers so that they can be improved in future generations and can also be supported with updates made remotely, without user intervention. productivity increment, continuous improvement, and enhancement in customer relations are the objectives of this paradigm shift. products from all durable and non-durable segments will have a high level of customization with the customer being responsible for specifying which characteristics will satisfy them. the current work presents concepts of industry 4.0 and iot (internet of things) and highlights the retailing process of the automotive industry. the related works are reviewed, and a solution framework is reported and discussed in details.",industry 4.0,"Industry 4.0 has the potential to make the retailing processes of cars more efficient and thereby enable the production of products and after sales service with high quality standards and in a very short time. Many potential benefits can be highlighted: cost reduction; increased safety; environmental conservation; error reduction; no waste; and business transparency. All the above-mentioned benefits enable the automotive industry to expand its research and development centers, encouraging the study of new technologies and their integration into existing and future product lines alongside dealing and retailing process. This paper gave a glance about the shape of the retailing process in the age of Industry 4.0. a proposed approach was introduced to address some issues in the current retailing process using IoT.","nesreen m. abdelghafar, mahmoud a. el-sharief mechanical engineering department assiut university nisssreen@gmail.com - msharif@aun.edu.eg","references of customers and 
drivers, and behavior of components and systems of the vehicle. For instance, tracking the number of 
kilometers travelled; checking fuel quality; remembering the geographic regions travelled; monitoring of 
parts that affect safety, and strong connections between manufacturers and customers through dealers.  
All this information provides the manufacturer with the ability to monitor the product very precisely and 
even to contact the customer if necessary, in case of complaint. The information can also be used in a 
knowledge base for use in continuous improvement and new product development projects. 
 
6. The Proposed Approach 
Traditionally, the main information channels between the manufacturer and the customer have been through 
car dealers.  Consequently, a lot of information about the condition of the vehicle is lost to the manufacturer. 
The proposed approach as shown in Figure 3 is supposed to find better ways in solving problems and come 
up with innovative solutions; to achieve dramatic improvements in retailing process of cars while 
continuously improving quality to meet rising customer expectations. First, we need to listen to the voice 
of customers from Industry 4.0 perspectives: by conducting surveys and interviews with them. Additionally, 
we need to organize brainstorming sessions with the stakeholders [Frontline staff, Administrators, 
Managers …etc.]. To shape the area of improvements and guarantee quality of service delivery: the degree 
to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements. Then analyzing the collected data using the 
theories for the quality and use the results from quality control process to reflect the overall quality status. 
Finally, we need to provide guidance and direction on how quality will be managed and verified throughout 
the implementation. For example, by adding to the proposed approach a feedback flow from the 
User/Support phase to the phases of ideation and definition, and inclusion of this information in a 
knowledge base. Moreover, IoT can play a fundamental role in channel integration of retailing process 
because it allows companies to rebalance supply and demand [8].

143,An Empirical Analysis Of Financial Ratio Trends Of Several  Companies Listed In The Philippine Stock Exchange,"this paper presents an analysis of the trends of financial ratios of one hundred fifty (150) companies that are currently listed in the philippine stock exchange with the aim of helping equity investors in their investment strategies. exam- ining the annual company financial reports, a set of criteria was set in order to determine whether certain companies can be deemed equitable by investors. stocks that passes the set criteria are added into a portfolio following an equally weighted strategy. the portfolio performance is then compared with the market index (philippine stock exchange) which shows that the resulting portfolio can outperform the market. in addition, individually considering each ratio as the criteria of selecting stocks into the investment pool results to portfolios with negative returns. this implies that the portfolio selection with the proposed criteria is superior to the portfolio selection considering each ratio as the selection criteria. overall, although white noise may occur in the stock market, this research provides investors with an unbiased forecast reference to help them evaluate their stock picks and build their investment portfolios.","financial ratios, forecasting, stock picks","This research analyzed the trends of financial ratios of 150 random companies from the Philippine stock exchange. Using some simple criteria, investment pools are generated screening out companies with at least 𝑛 number (out of 12 financial ratios) of favorable ratio trends. For comparison purposes, investment pools considering only 1 type of fa- vorable financial ratio trend are also identified. For testing purposes, equally weighted portfolio strategy is applied to select for the optimal portfolio. Portfolios using the investment pool consisting of companies with at least 𝑛 number (out of 12 financial ratios) of favorable ratio trends are denoted as 𝑃𝑛 portfolios. Portfolios using only 1 type of favor- able financial ratio trend are denoted as 𝑃𝑟 portfolios. 𝑃𝑛 portfolios, 𝑃𝑟 portfolios, and the market portfolio (M) are compared to one another to identify the superior portfolio. As expected, back-test results show that 𝑃𝑛 portfolios can outperform both 𝑃𝑟 portfolios and M portfolio. Overall, this study provides research contribution in 3 ways: (1) it presents an alternative investment procedure that can probably outperform traditional benchmark like the market portfolio.; (2) it provides a research study on portfolio selection using Philippine data.; and (3) it offers a simple variation on the basic framework of portfolio selection. Further improvements can still be done to improve the results of this study. One way is to consider the actual invest- ment environment wherein trading costs are considered which plays a huge role in the profitability of any portfolio. Next is to consider other portfolio selection models like safety-first model and different variations of the mean-vari- ance model to have another point of comparison.

The cases consist of occupational injury, illness, fatality, and work-related abuses which were coded up to four causes for each case. In addition, the outcome of each case was also analyzed. Based on our study, occupational fatality was found to be the most frequent case and it can be further classified into six patterns: crushed by another vessel, poisoning gases, jump from the vessel during parking, hit the sea coral, hit by fishing wire, and huge wave. For occupational injury, three workers were stuck in the fishing wire with a significant finger injury and one worker was reported heavily injured due to a gas explosion. For occupational illness, one worker was reported that his left brain contaminated with bacteria and another one was reported had an intestine problem. Finally, for work-related abuses, there were twelve patterns which include: excessive and undefined working hours, food problem, non-payment or delayed payment by the employer, physical abuse, non-payment or delayed payment by the agency, job mismatch with the contract, threat by the agency, agency still find a job, non-payment or air ticket, psychological abuse, abuse by other workers, non-occupational fatality, and stealing employer’s property.

146,Defects Management Practice During Dlp In The Uae  Construction Industry,"building defects are a key concern in the construction industry. defects represent not only a loss to the project but also hamper the smooth operation of a building. the uae construction industry accounts for heavy defects during dlp (defects liability period) that lead to significant rework, delays in project handover, disputes and construction claims t among construction parties. this paper presents preliminary findings of a research study which is investigating defects management practices in the uae. the paper presents an overview of construction defects, defect types and main causes of construction defects. the research findings are drawn from a literature review, and semi-structured interviews, which encapsulates uae construction law and its implications in managing defects during defect liability period for different stakeholders. the paper highlights that future research is needed to investigate construction defects in relation to relevant work disciplines to identify root caused and remedies, which will improve overall defect management practice in the uae construction industry.","building defects, uae","and Future work Management of construction defects during the defect liability period is a key concern for contractors as well as construction clients. This paper has presented an overview of construction defects, and defect management during DLP in the context of the UAE construction law. Construction Law in the UAE following DIFIC contracts general terms and conditions which are applied to defect management during DLP, and clearly defines contractual responsibilities of construction clients, consultants and contractors in managing defects during DLP. The types of defects that appear during DLP vary in their nature and intensity, which is a separate research topic. There are limited studies that investigate defects and its relation to the work disciplines such as architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical, and the defects inherent in them. Recognizing this, future research is needed to investigate the causal relationship between the types of defects and their root cause within each work discipline involved. The study of defects identified during the DLP can be very significant as a control mechanism to ascertain the validity and reliability of a project’s implementation process. 2858","muhammad tariq shafiq assistant professor, department of architectural engineering, united arab emirates university al ain, uae muhammad.tariq@uaeu.ac.ae ghaleb al seena, mohammed al saqqa, sultan al mansouri student bsc architectural engineering united arab emirates university al ain, uae","REFERENCES

148,The Effect Of Family Ownership On Risk-Taking:  Socioemotional Wealth Perspective,"this study examines the effect of family ownership on risk-taking activities in a corporation. family ownership may lead a corporation to adopt a risk-averse attitude and risk nepotism (where inappropriate family members occupy positions of top management), which can lead to business inefficiency. on the other hand, family owners have a socioemotional endowment with a corporation (gomez-mejia et al. 2007) that enables them to behave altruistically and pursue sustainability for the sake of their employees and community. in this situation, family owners promote top managements to take risk-taking behaviours to stimulate r&d investment and innovation. this study supposes the effect of family ownership toward risk-taking is not constant and hypothesizes that the contingency factor could affect the relations between family ownership and risk-taking. in the context of japan, where family ownership in listed companies exceed 50 percent and is in the exposure to pressure by institutional investor, this study considers institutional investor ownership as the mediator between risk-taking and family ownership. this study examines the effect of family ownership using panel data in japanese listed companies. i also adopt the system gmm estimators the system gmm estimator proposed by arellano and bover (1995) and blundell and bond (1998) for the analysis to solve the endogeneity 326",,,"takahiro nishi school of commerce, meiji university, 1-1 kanda-surugadai, chiyoda, tokyo, japan takahi52@meiji.ac.jp takaaki kawanaka institute for innovation in international engineering education, graduate school of engineering, the university of tokyo 7-3-1 hongo, bunkyo-ku, tokyo, japan kawanaka@cce.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp",
149,Development Of A Low-Cost Solar Water Puriﬁer Using  Metaheuristic Process,"the solar water purifier is an advancement of the current water purification system. it has been introduced to meet up demands of pure drinking water using renewable energy. it takes solar power as an energy source and stores it in a battery which is a free source of energy. then using this energy, a low-cost heating coil heats water up to a certain temperature (below boiling temperature). after condensing cold water is further purified through the filtering chalk. in this stage, water is condensed again and gives water at room temperature. through this process, we get pure drinking water. we followed almost all the phases of a product development process which started with collecting customer requirements and ended with finalizing the design. cost analysis had also been done from the viewpoint of mass production of the product. we optimized the overall process using a metaheuristic approach for heating process, cooling process and purifying process. this product, if used properly, can eradicate the scarcity of pure drinking water.","solar energy, water purification, design analysis","The scarcity of pure drinking water and scarcity of energy are two of the most booming problems of Bangladesh. Our solar water purifier offers a perfect solution for both of these problems. We followed all the steps of product design from customer surveys to the manufacturing processes. Afterward, the purified water quality was tested against different parameters and it was observed through the results that although the purification system does not have a significant impact on pH values, it decreases COD, BOD values and other parameters. However, the design is effective for only domestic uses. It needs to be refined and amended to increase its output for usage in industrial sectors effectively. We can also explore the possibility of removing arsenic from drinking water, which is a silent killer toxin in Bangladesh. Due to arsenic poisoning, hundreds of people are dying every year in Bangladesh and many water sources have been marked unusable due to this. If we can mitigate arsenic levels from water through purification, this can have a revolutionary effect in terms of social benefits. These can be scopes of future studies in this field. In Bangladesh, this type of water purifier is yet to be introduced in the market. So, we think our solar water purifier, if implemented efficiently by removing limitations, will attract customers of all sectors inhabiting in both urban and rural areas.","sourav kumar ghosh and md. mamunur rashid department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of textiles dhaka, bangladesh sourav@butex.edu.bd, mamunrashid@butex.edu.bd naurin zoha and fariha kabir torsha department of production and industrial engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology dhaka, bangladesh naurin.zoha@gmail.com, torsha.666@gmail.com israt zarin era department of industrial and management systems engineering west virginia university united states isratzarin1208022@gmail.com",
150,Development And Optimization Of A Single Stage  Multimodal Fixed-Cost Transportation Problem,"transportation plays a vital role in logistics which is an inseparable part of today’s supply chain management. an effective transportation network can optimize the supply chain to a great extent by reducing total cost, total time as well as maximizing profit. in this paper, we deal with one stage (supplier to manufacturer) multimodal fixed cost transportation problem (fctp) of a local paper mill. here we have formulated three different models which are road transportation model, rail transportation model and a combination of road and rail transportation models using linear programming to analyze and select the most optimized one for the case. for solving the case, we collected data for keeping the capacity constraints of each source and the demand constraints for each destination. we have used an excel solver to solve the models and the results show that the rail route is the most cost-effective, but it leaves some of the demands unfulfilled. but the combination of both road and rail routes provide the most cost-effective solution satisfying the demands of the destinations. henceforth, we compared the results by conducting cost analysis to select the most optimized one for the organization.","fctp, multimodal, excel solver","The transportation problem compares three models that incorporate rail and road transportation systems for single stage transportation network optimization. After a thorough cost analysis, it is evident that the multi-modal network provides the most efficient results for the supply of raw materials for the respective company. This type of optimization network model can also be utilized in varieties of other segments of the logistics network. The problem can also be further worked on by developing multi-stage models that incorporate a broader view of the supply chain network. Further improvement in the accuracy of the results can also be attained by introducing uncertainties in the case.","sourav kumar ghosh and md. mamunur rashid department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of textiles dhaka, bangladesh sourav@butex.edu.bd, mamunrashid@butex.edu.bd naurin zoha department of production and industrial engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology dhaka, bangladesh naurin.zoha@gmail.com",

154,A Fuzzy Logic Based Approach Towards Sales Forecasting: Case  Study Of Knit Garments Industry,"in this work, the demand pattern of readymade garments of a knit garments factory in bangladesh was studied and factors influencing the demand pattern were identified. an accurate sales forecast is a prerequisite of achieving an accurate and effective supply plan of complete garments. a fuzzy inference system based algorithm was developed to predict the sales of garments according to the sales influencing factors. the developed algorithm is mainly a quantitative method of forecasting but also takes into account some qualitative issues. the developed model was compared with the actual total sales found by traditional seasonal forecast with trend adjustment. the seasonal factors for the two cyclic demand patterns, january – june, and july - december of each year were calculated and the linear regression trend was followed to calculate the traditional forecasting. the developed model showed better prediction as it matches closely with the actual sales. the root mean squared error (rmse) and mean absolute deviations (mad) are 3.605 and 3.081 in the developed fuzzy model which is within the standard limit. thus the obtained result showed by the fuzzy model yields better demand prediction taking into account the inherent uncertainties and with less error and thus the efficiency of the proposed fuzzy model was verified. key words: knit garments, fuzzy logic, fuzzy inference system (fis) 1. introduction: sales forecasting is the process of estimating what our business’s sales are going to be in the future. sales forecasting is an integral part of business management. without a solid idea of what our future sales are going to be, we cannot manage our inventory or our cash flow or plan for growth. the purpose of sales forecasting is to provide information that we can use to make intelligent business decisions ward (2013). the objective of sales forecasting is to provide consummate information that we can use to make level-headed business decisions. without forecasting sales volume, it is very tough for us to guide the company in the right direction. businesses are forced to look well ahead in order to plan their investments, launch new products and decide when to close or withdraw products and so on. the sales forecasting process is a critical one for most businesses. sales forecasting is used to serve a variety of functions in a company such as coordinating operations, smoothing production, achieving economic scale, improving logistic performance, reducing inspection & packaging cost etc. maintaining an inappropriate forecast is a costly exercise, generally regards this as primary evil from managerial point of view. gardner and mckenzie (1988) tried to guide in identifying exponential smoothing models with non-seasonal data in fuzzy rule extraction directly from numerical data for function approximation. they highly recommended to select the models at first where exponentially smoothing model will show a better result without applying it everywhere. (gardner jr & mckenzie, 1988). d. w. cho and y. h. lee (2013) considered seasonal factors that affect the demand of a product which causes a highly fluctuating situation in the supply chain.(cho & lee, 2013). roberts (1989) worked on formulating short term sales forecasting and introduced a range of fuzzy models of considerable importance. he suggested using simple combined forecasting models with more accuracy as benchmark rather than a complex combination(clemen, 1989).claudio s. bisso and carlos patricio samanez (2014) used fuzzy logic approach for determining the distribution of a particular item and model developed by considering the alternatives.(bisso & samanez, 2014) r.j. kuo and k.c. xue (1998) attempted to develop an intelligent sales forecasting system using fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, and fuzzy systems which pointed far improved result than conventional autoregressive moving average (arma) method. they also supported the suitability of their combined fuzzy artificial neural network (fann) model comparing with single ann method.(r. j. kuo & xue, 1998) byoung chul lee et al. (2009) (lee, park, & kim, 2012). r.j. kuo (2001) developed gfnn (a fuzzy neural network model with initial weight developed from genetic algorithm) to forecast sales of a convenience store (cvs) company which showed reasonably better outcome in case of fluctuating internal and external environments like special offers, promotion, etc. (r. kuo, 2001) sarwar et al. (2015) developed an artificial intelligence (anfis) model for forecast the natural gas consumption. (ferdous sarwar, rashid, & ghosh, 2014) g. peter zhang and min qi (2005) investigated the issue of how to effectively model time series with both seasonal and trend patterns with genetic fuzzy predictor ensemble. they have established their conclusion with experimental results that a combination of data pre-processing approaches- de-trending and de-seasonalization and then developing a forecasting model with artificial intelligence 345",,"As an effective sales forecasting tool, multivariable fuzzy logic model can be used as demonstrated by our results. The fuzzy model performed best because of its ability to identify nonlinear relationships in the input data. However, the correlation was better for short-term forecasts and not as good for longer time periods. A much more comprehensive model can be built by taking into account other factors like climate, percentage price change, marketing strategies etc., which would be an extension of our work submitted in this paper. In this research work, the demand pattern of RMG of a DBL Group was studied and factors having influence behind the demand pattern were identified. In order to achieve an accurate and effective supply plan of RMG it is prerequisite to have an accurate sales forecast of it. As newer forecasting models are being invented with the passage of time, our textile and clothing sector should adopt some modernized method to forecast RMG demand. So, an algorithm that will able to forecast RMG demand with respect to our country environment with more accuracy will play a major role in the development of our clothing sector. A Fuzzy Inference System based algorithm was developed in this research in order to predict sales of RMG according to the condition of the sales influencing factors in Bangladesh. Sixteen input nodes namely Design, Shade Variation, Finishing, Cotton specification, trims & accessories etc. were considered as inputs to predict one output which is 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 No of RMG (Millions) Year Comparison of Sales forecast with fuzzy model and traditional Approach Sales forecast by Fuzzy Model sales foreast by traditioal appraoch 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Table 5.

155,A Unified Uncertainty Mathematical Model For Input  Oriented Data Envelopment Analysis,"in a competitive environment, it is crucial for organizations to know how efficiently and effectively they are operating compared to similar organizations. the challenge is to somehow draw helpful insights from all these numbers that will lead to improvements in the performance of the organization. efficiency measurement is one aspect of organizational performance. data envelopment analysis (dea) technique is considered the most appropriate tool for evaluating the performance of a set of comparable homogenous organizations under some predefined conditions. in real-life problems, values for input and/or output variables include uncertainty, this uncertainty may be randomness or vagueness in nature. the purpose of this study is the using of some theoretical results to develop a unified dea model to handle different uncertainty types, the developed model allows various natures of variables (vagueness, randomness and deterministic) depending on the nature of uncertainty in the variables. implementation of the model was presented through some cases to illustrate the model functionality. in addition, the results are compared with three other different dea models; a combined fuzzy/deterministic model, a combined stochastic/deterministic model, and a deterministic model. managers can rely on the developed model to assess relative efficiency in business complex systems associated with different uncertainty natures.",model validation,"Since exact data may not always be available in real life problem performance assessments due to the existence of uncertainty. As a result, DEA efficiency measurement may be sensitive to such variations. A DMU which is rated as efficient relative to other DMUs may turn inefficient if such uncertainty variations are considered, or vice versa. In another word, if the collected data for a variable is not represented in the correct form nature, then the resulting efficiencies will be erroneous and misleading because of the high sensitivity of the efficiency scores to the realized levels of inputs or outputs. Therefore, a unified input-oriented DEA model is proposed to conduct performance assessments in uncertainty environments that able to deal with either input and/or output cases simultaneously, while the variables have vagueness or randomness in nature and the remaining variables are deterministic in nature. The model is tailored for fuzzy variables with triangular membership functions and has been handled using the α-cut approach, while the chance constraints programming approach was used to handle the stochastic variables. Through the illustrative example, it is noticed that the nature of the variable has an influence on the resulting relative efficiency levels and could toggle the status of the DMU from efficient to inefficient and vice versa. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the nature of the variable from the beginning and apply the appropriate DEA model to achieve reliable results. 8.","assem a. tharwat professor, college of business administration, american university in the emirates, uae. assem.tharwat@aue.ae basma e. el-demerdash assistant lecturer, department of operations research and management, faculty of graduate studies for statistical research, cairo university, egypt. basma.ezzat@cu.edu.eg ihab a. el-khodary professor, department of operations research and decision support, faculty of computers and artificial intelligence, cairo university, egypt. e.elkhodary@fci-cu.edu.eg",
156,Vehicles’ Emissions Consideration In Transportation  Network Design Using Markov Chain Traffic Assignment,"markov chain traffic assignment (mcta) is a relatively recent approach for modeling traffic conditions in a road network. it results in traffic density measurements that express congestion levels in the network at the road level. while the stochastic approach is powerful analytically, the resulting traffic density does not readily lend itself to emissions estimation. typically, average-speed emission models are utilized to estimate emissions on an aggregate network level. however, while this is easily done in user equilibrium (ue) models using the bureau of public roads (bpr) relationship to derive vehicles’ average speed from traffic flow, no such relationship exists for traffic density. we highlight the mathematical challenge here and propose an approach to estimate vehicles’ average speed based on traffic density obtained from mcta. the average speeds are then used to estimate vehicles’ greenhouse gas emissions using average-speed emission estimation models. this approach can be applied on a road level or aggregated to a network level. we utilize the bpr relationship to build a linear piece-wise approximation function and illustrate its use through two widely used average-speed emission estimation models: transyt-7f and copert v5.","vehicles emissions, network design","While a closed-form mathematical relationship relating average vehicles’ speed to traffic density is not possible, we propose piece-wise approximation function to bridge this gap. The approximation function can satisfy most practical emission estimation applications. We tested the approach using two widely used average-speed emissions estimation models: TRANSYT-7F and COPERT v5. The model can be deployed to road level as well as network level estimations. This work opens the door for NDP models using MCTA to consider environmental objectives in its optimization through GHG emissions. An NDP model such as the one proposed by (Salman and Alaswad, 2018) can be extended into a bi-objective optimization model which simultaneously considers network congestion and its environmental impact. This research direction is the subject of another paper that is currently under review. 769","sinan salman college of technological innovation zayed university abu dhabi, uae sinan.salman@zu.ac.ae suzan alaswad college of business zayed university abu dhabi, uae suzan.alaswad@zu.ac.ae","References

157,Resource Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Using  Priority Rules: Application In The Deep-Water Construction,"the resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem (rcmpsp) has predominately been addressed in deterministic environment. yet, uncertainty is inherent to real-life problems and the rise in adopting projects and portfolios in managing business organizations has initiated growing interest in considering stochastic aspects when developing a resource schedule. priority rules (pr) is a common approach to solving the rcmpsp avoiding its computational complexity. since the performance of prs is highly dependent on project context, it is necessary to study the performance of prs with real-life cases. the current study presents an application of 17 priority rules to a portfolio of deep-water construction projects. the results confirm previous results obtained from the literature and gives project and portfolio managers insights about the adequacy of different prs with respect to schedule quality and robustness.","construction, priority rules, project management, rcmpsp","MS wins for Q1, which seems to be acceptable because each activity has a relatively higher number of successors, while MAXSLK dominates for Q2. The unexpectedly good performance for this rule is due to the activities with high slack need more resources than the critical activities which not required a lot of resources. For robustness measures, MCS performs well for R1, whereas SOF delivers the best for R2. In addition, MAXSLK and MINTWK considered as the preferable rules with respect to Q1 and Q2. These results show that the performance of priority rules differs significantly according to the desirable objective. 7. Conclusion This work presented a case study for applying PRs to solve the RCMPSP considering uncertainty in activity duration. A set of 17 PRs have been compared to test the performance of the individual project and portfolio in terms of schedule quality and robustness. In order to identify the PR performing best, a trade-off has to be made. An evident conflict may be identified between the selected objectives as well as the viewpoints of project and portfolio managers. The presentation of results and analysis for the specific case study for the company gives managers insights about the performance of the different PRs and allows to arrive at a compromise satisfying both objectives and viewpoints within the defined company strategy. Since, no PR is ranked best under different circumstances related to project and resource characteristics, such a case study is vital to help managers solve the RCMPSP under uncertainty inherent to FCFS SOF MOF MINSLK MAXSLK MINTWK RAN MINLFT TWK-EST MS MCS 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% 18% R2 Q2 361","industry hassan elfiky, aly owida, noha m. galal department of industrial and management engineering arab academy for science, technology and maritime transport abu-kir campus, p.o. box 1029, alexandria, egypt hassanelfiky@outlook.com, alyowida@aast.edu, noha.galal@aast.edu","References

However, biocides are toxic chemicals that can harm human beings and the environment. Therefore, there is a great need to develop novel types of biocides that are green and environment-friendly. This paper discussed types of traditional biocides, their effects on humans and the natural world, their limitations and how they ought to be replaced by green biocides that are environmentally safe.

Distance minimization, velocity deviation minimization and directly minimizing the emissions produced are the three objectives studied in this work. Distance minimization experiment generates routes of minimum total distance; however, this routing decision making leads to the selection of routes with more significant deviations from the optimum traveling speed. On the other hand, velocity deviation minimization model results in the longest routes with vehicle velocities closer to the optimum, regardless of the distances associated with these routes. However, emissions minimization model considers distance and velocity by choosing an intermediate route, longer and less congested than distance minimization model where the vehicle can travel on a speed near optimum and still shorter than velocity deviation minimization model resulting in the least travel time, emissions and fuel consumed. Comparing the three objectives shows that there is a trade-off between the total distance traveled and vehicle velocity. The experiments prove that minimizing distance objective does not always achieve optimum results. Therefore, managing trade-off is crucial to achieving least amount of emissions and fuel consumed. The model generated is implemented on a real-life case study, where feasible and optimal routes for the different model objectives are generated, proving the applicability of the developed mathematical model and its usefulness in proving implementation ready solutions to decision-makers. Results of all experiments show that shifting departure times to more congested time-periods decreases traveling velocities on all possible routes, increasing the deviation from the optimal travel speeds and, consequently, increasing both emissions and fuel consumed compared with departure times at less congested time- periods. In future work, developing better estimates for fuel consumption rate rather than being merely a linear function of the emission rate might be considered. Also, investigating whether the emissions caused by refrigeration should be taken into account in temperature-controlled transportation and whether will it affect the routing decisions.","hagar h. amer, hala a. farouk, khaled s. el-kilany department of industrial and management engineering college of engineering and technology arab academy for science, technology, and maritime transport abo-kir campus, p.o. box 1029, alexandria, egypt hagar.amer@hotmail.com, mail@halafarouk.info, kkilany@aast.edu",
160,Ranking Of Water Desalination Technologies Based On The  Preference Selection Index,"water is a vital part for all creatures, however, huge variation exists between countries in terms of clean water availability. most countries suffer from extreme shortage in water resources along with fast increase in population. this resulted in even more complicated problem that has a direct impact on the economical and development aspects of countries. this paper employs the preference selection index (psi) in selecting the most suitable water desalination process for different types of feed water. seven water desalination technologies were compared: the electrodialysis, reverse osmosis, multi flash distillation, multi effect desalination, vapor compression, ion exchange and nanofiltration. a total of 12 criteria were considered in evaluating the selected desalination methods, these were related to the technology cost, lifespan, simplicity, reliability, quality and environmental impact. results showed that the ion exchange is the most suitable desalination technology.",water desalination,"In this paper, seven water desalination technologies were compared based on 12 criteria. The PSI multi criteria decision making technique was considered as a novel tool to judge between water desalination technologies. Published literature was the main source for data collection. The PSI concluded that the most favorable water desalination methods was Ion exchange, followed by vapor compression, nanofiltration, electrodialysis, multi effect desalination, multi flash distillation and then by reverse osmosis.

161,Examining Availability Of A Packaging Unit: A  Pharmaceutical Case,"in this paper, an oral solid dosage (osd) packaging unit in a reputed pharmaceuticals company of bangladesh is thoroughly investigated for its present availability level and a practical approach to improve the same is pursued. such work is a new practice from the context of the pharmaceutical industry in bangladesh. availability is one of the three factors upon which overall equipment efficiency (oee) depends. it is found that lower availability of machines acts as the main culprit behind the overall lower availability value in oee for the considered osd packaging unit. however, machine availability – defined as the ratio of machine uptime and the summation of machine uptime and machine downtime – depends on many external factors that are liable for unfavorable machine downtime and uptime. maintenance personnel index (mp), task severity index (ts), and daily maintenance index (dm) are identified as the external factors crucial to the availability of the blister packaging machine in the considered osd unit. the interpretations of these three indices are in detail demonstrated for the considered packaging section. for determining the complex relationship between the mentioned three indices and machine availability, a model trained by an artificial neural network (ann) using field data is used. using the trained model, the values of these three indices that result in the various availability values in the desirable range are determined. finally, which values of these three indices can be practically attained with respect to their present values are discussed briefly.",,"can be drawn from other index values also. A low TSI value of 5.5 can be achieved through substantial financial investment. Further decisions lie solely on the upper management and the company stakeholders. Here, one mention-worthy issue that although MP intrinsically entails the effect of maintenance delay time and MTTR for maintenance, the supply delay time is not directly included in the ANN training to eventually obtain the desired targeted availability; because it is yet to be defined how to incorporate the same. However, the unavailability of the spare parts resulting from the supply delay may directly hamper machine availability. How the required spare parts can be calculated for the determined target availability, though not explored in this paper, is expected to disclose in our future work in the same context. 4. Conclusion The study demonstrates that how the improvement of some external factors of machine availability affects the desired machine availability level. This study is pursued for a packaging section of a reputed pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh. For such exploration, initially, the current availability of the system is determined. To find out the principal causes behind the present low availability, Pareto analysis is performed. This analysis finally shows that specific machine components are mainly responsible for the overall lower availability of the studied packaging section. Having defined the three external factors, namely personnel index, daily maintenance index, and task severity index, from the pharmaceutical company perspective, we have gathered their values for the last twenty-four months. However, these values were not directly available. Their values are shaped by utilizing the corresponding historical data available regarding the performance and operations of machines as well as the manpower required to maintain them. To establish the complex relationship between these external factors and corresponding machine availability, we have taken the help of artificial neural network that yields a trained model. This model is then used to obtain the target value of those external factors for the desired machine availability level. Moreover, how much machine availability can be attained from the current perspective of the company is discussed. In the future, extending this study, the researchers can determine the complex relation of machine availability influenced by the availability of the spare parts too.","md. galib an-noor amio, shibshankar dey, faisal mahmud department of industrial & production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology dhaka-1000, bangladesh galibannoor@gmail.com, shibshankar@ipe.buet.ac.bd, mahmudfaisal937@gmail.com",

163,A Service Quality Study On The In-Demand Motorcycle  Hailing Applications,"public transportation is defined as transportation by a conveyance that provides continuing general or special transportation to the public. as public transport organizations grow older and matured, the quality of service dwindles down with public being left with no option but to accept what is offered with the current economic status. in conducting the study on how to effectively examine a certain type of public transport service is by using quality service metrics and identifying the various failure points within the whole service process. it is said that high-volume consumer is equal to a high degree of innovation. transport service is always evolving and companies have always an idea on how to create a service that is efficient and well suited to the modern technology. the satisfaction people experience when using motorcycles as transport services is influenced by (a) road traffic, (b) road accidents and (c) service quality. solving these matters will affect and decrease the potential risks that occur within the process of service delivery. the researchers used a conservative approach with a conscious effort to avoid any subjective tendencies when assigning value to both costs and benefits for the purpose of a cost-benefit analysis. the researchers may conclude that even if the costs incurred in the process of implementing the said plan of actions: (i) motorcycle taxi booths, (ii) personal protective standardization, (iii) c2x software, (iv) training programs for safety and security as well as training programs for health and hygiene increases per year the benefit will increase as well. with the overall findings, the significance of patronizing motorcycle hailing applications with best service quality will be very viable among every citizen.","service quality, road accidents, road traffic","The findings have shown the relationship with the in-demand motorcycle hailing applications in our society today. Among the significant variables is how our existing road traffic affects the behavior of drivers, which may lead to road accidents resulting to low satisfaction rate for motorcycle hailing applications due to risking the safety and security of customers. One of the main reasons of motorcycle accidents was traffic congestion. Mixed traffic between trucks and cars in a same road is what causes a heavy traffic. Motorcycle riders would then go between vehicles to avoid being stuck in a lane. Road traffic is in addition to the energy sector and the industry one main source of air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. Although most countries and manufacturers agreed to environmental regulations to reduce the pollutant emissions, particularly in urban areas with high traffic density, the impact of road traffic emissions on the environment and human health has been growing in importance steadily. Motorcycles show potential as a more sustainable mode of transport than cars in that they utilize less space and fuel and emit fewer harmful emissions. Motorcycles show potential as a more sustainable mode of transport than cars in that they utilize less space and fuel and emit fewer harmful emissions. From this perspective, it is tempting to promote motorcycles as a substitution for car trips, with the aim to improve the sustainability of the system. Based on the results, it is evident that using motorcycle hailing applications travel faster and cheaper than using car hailing applications. The researchers gathered time data showed the time travel difference between travelling with the use of motorcycle versus car. After looking at the road traffic factor that affects the travel time, the researchers now gathered data on how customers rate the service quality of the said motorcycle hailing applications. The researchers used the RATER survey to be more specific and precise on what identifying what category needs alternatives and improvements. The result showed negative values on Tangible, Reliability, Assurance and one factor with Empathy. With the said results and the will of researchers in improving the service quality of motorcycle hailing applications, here are the alternatives and improvements that should be considered by motorcycle hailing application companies. With the overall findings, the researchers may conclude that decreasing the existing road traffic rates will also decrease the road accident rates. One of the factors of decreasing road traffic is decreasing the number of private vehicles and the use of 4-wheeled vehicles, wherein the significance of patronizing motorcycle hailing applications with best service quality will be very viable among every citizen. Establishment of a motorized lifestyle provides convenience and allows cheaper accommodation and decreased in travelling time (Knoflacher, 2013).","mary christy o. mendoza, adrian kendrick s. casas and rhona h. reyes school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila mcomendoza@mapua.edu.ph, akscasas@gmail.com, rh.reyes04@yahoo.com",

Some authors used “flexibility” interchangeably with versatility and adaptability, while some asserted that flexibility is an antecedent of agility. Paper has enriched domain by proposing framework flexibility-enabled Intermodal Terminal decision framework. This model can simplify decision making and improve performance under uncertain conditions prone intermodal transportation system with further real-time data supplemented by the shipping industry in India. This study is in infancy and being supported by the Ministry of Shipping Govt of India. The potential success of flexible intermodal transportation will depend on competing actors, but also on the decision of competing modes, the shipping transport sector in particular. It is striking that with the emergence of cost-effective inland ports facilitated by Indian Government initiatives like Sagarmala and Bharatmala Projects. The decision makers still require improving their productivity by achieving a competitive position towards flexible intermodal transport in emerging scenario. Performance improvements can only be accomplished with more intelligent (flexible) planning systems and agreements. The proposed DIS-IFT will framework will surely benefit transport operators, planners, designers, policymakers by upbringing more clarity in understanding the flexibility of shipping transportation. Furthermore, the proposed model will assist to redefine coordinated flexibility capabilities. Finally, this framework can benefit managers to set their goals and develop strategies related to internal and external flexibilities to gain its competitive advantages.

167,Design And Implementation Of A Nurse Robot,"the active hospital is aspiring to accelerate services to patients and to reduce the burden of doctors and nurses by reducing the number of mistakes. the main purpose of this study is to develop a nurse robot (nr) system that acts as a diagnostic device that is programmable with a multi-function manipulator designed to help doctors and help patients recovering better. the main contribution behind this paper is to deliver a multi-functional robotic system that works on reading human vital signs. the system will be implemented using arduino uno that enables us to use multiple sensors for the reading pins. the output pins are used for the robot interaction with the patients, based on the input data. using the speaker as output sound will be the way of interaction. while using infrared (ir) sensors to enable the robot to read the human availability, that is, ir is used to recognize if the patient stands in front of the robot, using ir light beams, and near-field communication (nfc) technology to read the patient tag provided by the hospital as his identity.","nurse robot, infrared, diagnostic","From the previous discussion, it is clear that using NR is considered an important multi-functional vital-signs measurement that will help hospital nurses in fulfilling regular check up on new patients. The adopted system will be installed in hospital patient's waiting room in the aim of creating a direct interaction between the patient and NR. The main reason is that NR is considered to be a very secure way to measure the patient vital-signs through measurements based on electronic sensors that are directly attached to the patient’s body. Hence, NR will help in performing better services to both the hospital and the patients. The main strength of NR resides in how NR is stable and reliable in fulfilling its duties. Others strengths will rely on the cost effectiveness, the quality assurance and productivity improvement, the work in hazardous environments, and the data collection and patients monitoring. So, emergency case such as heart failure, high blood levels, and low oxygen rates could be avoided when directly and quickly sending the patient reports to relevant doctors. The weaknesses of the project however come from the implementing of NR functions, the potential job losses, and the high initial investment costs. In comparison with human being, many people do not feel comfortable when dealing with robots as the robot can never be compared to a human. 1318","amal abutaleb, jory alsabhani, sadeem alkinani, shahad alkaydi, sara alghamdi, ahmed bensenouci electrical and computer engineering department effat university jeddah, kingdom of saudi arabia amabutaleb@effat.edu.sa, joalsabhani@effat.edu.sa, ssalkinani@effat.edu.sa, saralghamdi@effat.edu.sa,shalkaydi@effat.edu.sa, abensenouci@effatuniversity.edu.sa","References

168,An Experimental Study On The Performance Of A Newly  Developed Pico Hydroelectric Device,"as electricity demand increases, different renewable energy sources were continuously explored to cope with the rising demand of an eco-friendly and affordable energy source. the concept of hydroelectric generators was considered and the researchers developed a pico hydroelectric generating device which is called the aqualite to provide households with an alternative power supply. it is a device that powers 3 basic essential household appliances with the use of water. the initial design of the prototype was made but the goal of this experimental research is to optimize the performance of the device by determining significant factors affecting its output in watts and lux and by testing different combinations of fittings and pipes to get the best design for the device. the researchers have tested 36 combinations and run 30 trials for each and have collected 1,080 values for the watts output and another 1,080 values for lux output. these values were analyzed statistically and the researchers have found the best and optimal design for the pico hydroelectric device. this could help the inventors to develop the device and be more functional effectively and efficiently. with this invention and supporting research, the community could have a sustainable alternative source of energy",,"The researchers have set a long term goal to reduce the electricity cost of households and commercial establishments by using a newly invented pico hydroelectric device. Based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 1,080 values of Watts output and 1,080 values of Lux output, it can be concluded that there are significant differences among the combinations of different components/parts in producing electricity supply in watts and in lux. From this analysis, the researchers have determined that water temperature, water type, the number of turbines and number of motors have a significant difference in output both in Watts and in Lux. When temperature rises, water molecules becomes stagnant and helps the stability of its flow inside the pipes giving it a higher output in terms of watts. Also, it was proven that having different types of water into the system has varying values. Increasing the number of turbines increases the number of output in Watts but not in LUX. The number of motors coincides with the pressure of water inside the system so the number of motor has a direct proportionality with Watts and in LUX. So therefore, the researchers conclude that these factors significantly affect the performance of the newly invented micro hydroelectric device, Aqualite. It is a suggestion to the makers and inventors that they should use the best and optimal design that was proven in this research. This result prompted further research of our system. Reduction of electricity cost for household and commercial establishments can be achieved by using the newly invented pico hydroelectric device with the estimated savings of Php 14, 547.73 / year for a conservative use of LED bulbs, electric fan and phone charging. From the different assessments done, the researchers have developed recommendations for future improvements which includes: (1) research for optimizing motors and turbines, (2) to have an ergonomic casing for the device and (3) to have a better output rating, higher than what this research established.","loreen alyana s. macasu, marco e. malabrigo, esmond adriel m. ramos, rianiña d. borres school of industrial and engineering management, mapúa institute of technology 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila, 1002, philippines loreenalyanasmacasu@gmail.com, malabrigomarco0895@gmail.com, eamramos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdborres@yahoo.com",

170,Renewable Waste Water Filtration System With  Phytoremediation Used In Aquaculture Of Freshwater,"for many years, researchers improve the maintenance system of all aquaculture technology including the best idea for water maintenance and sustainability. the study is coming from a premise that the prevalence of certain factors such as ph and temperature affects water quality for pond and aquarium system. with this epistemology, the study posits that the idea of combining five different existing filtration technologies to create a new filtration technology system that will minimize the effort of performing manual maintenance procedure of keeping freshwater ornamental fish. the logic behind this idea is to choose the best characteristics of existing design of filtration system and eliminate characteristics that contribute to the negative side. using experimental method, the proponents considered material selection and system design in order to improve the potency of a design filtration unit which greatly affects amount of energy consumed and huge volume of water consumption. testing was performed to validate the efficiency of materials along with their characteristics. results of the study revealed that waste water can be renewed with the use of filtration media classified as mechanical, chemical and biological. the results of the study were contributory to improve the effectiveness of water treatment by introducing additional treatments in the mechanical filtration, proposing a chemical treatment in one of the stages, and boosting the biological absorbance of waste nutrients by applying phytoremediation. the study suggests that water quality is the key to a healthy livestock.",aquarium system,", AND RECOMMENDATIONS 5.1 Summary of Findings The researches have seen the importance of having good and proper filtration materials and system. The first finding is that the nitrogen containing compounds (Nitrate, nitrite, ammonia) is decreased more than the tolerance level if the proposed materials as mentioned in chapter 4 is combined in one (1) system. This leads to lesser consumption of water because water parameters are more stable and clarity is maintained. The results prove that it is an efficient upon activating the filtration on the second week and later on improves as good bacteria continues to culture in the biological system of the filtration. The plant which serves as the phytoremediation tool grows lush and fast indicating that it completely absorbs the nitrogen containing compounds and other nutrients found in tank water. TDS value also had significant changes which contributes on the benefit of the effect. General Objective: The overall aim of the study is to create an innovative filtration technology system that will minimize the effort of performing manual maintenance procedure of keeping freshwater ornamental fish. The conceptual framework of this study as well as its analysis has paved the way for the researchers to consider that the several parts involved in the conceptual framework also belong to those factors that the researchers considered in performing this study. The identified factors are the following: 1. Selection of the best materials and features from existing filtration units 2. Effects of the design filtration system in managing toxic nutrient levels in water 3. Reduction of water consumption for keeping fish This implicates that choosing the right filtration for a specific water condition is very important because some materials can affect other water parameters like pH and hardness which is not suitable in some other aquatic organisms. Checking the market for availability of materials as well as the function of that specific materials must also be considered to achieve full scale efficiency of the product. 1343","ornamental fish charlotte palao, glyda aricon marquez, kenneth ibasco, lady claudette ferrer and patricia sagge industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal, quiapo metro manila, philippines misscjpalao@gmail.com, glydamarquez@gmail.com, engrkennethibasco@gmail.com, claudette.ferrer@gmail.com, pdsagge08@gmail.com maria teresa b. mendoza industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal, quiapo metro manila, philippines mariateresa.mendoza@tip.edu.ph","REFERENCES

The findings indicate that there are gaps between the framework derived from literature and the actual process followed in the organization. This study has shown that identification of stakeholders is a known phenomenon in the SOE. However, the process has not fully matured as in practice it is not executed. Stakeholders are important throughout the life cycle of a project and their identification is a significant step in the project lifecycle since all stakeholders have the ability to influence project delivery and outcomes. The identification process in the initiation and planning phase was not conducted, thus ignoring some of the potentially influential stakeholders. Therefore, despite the effort by PMBOK to introduce Stakeholder Management as a knowledge area in the PMBOK 4th and 5th edition, the process is still not fully implemented in practice.

It is a Tri-objective model and seeks to meet the three sustainability indicators in the supply chain, which are to minimize total supply chain costs, to minimize CO2 emissions from different network activities while maximizing responsiveness to customers' demands in each market. The proposed model was transformed into a single objective function by a weighted-sum method and was solved by giving different weights in GAMS software. The model was solved by considering a test problem and obtained rational optimal solutions confirmed the validity of the model. There are some potential future works. This model can also be solved by considering stochastic demand. Other methods of solving multi-objective optimization problems such as Weighted Tchebycheff and ԑ-constraint methods can be exerted. Since our model is NP-hard, solving this model for large problems requires the use of specific algorithms such as genetic and Scatter Search, because it is hard to solve large problems in a reasonable time.

For bio-asphalt and coconut shell distillation still need refinement of its manufacture technology that can produce material with cheaper, so that can be used as a substitute for asphalt from petroleum.

183,The Effect Of Personal Development And Networking On  Enterpreunership Interest With Supervising Lecturers’As,"this research aims to explain the effect of personal development and networking on entrepreneurship interest with supervising lecturers’ ability as the intervening variable. our respondents are participants of student entrepreneurship program of stie mahardhika surabaya. based on data from 180 students, we find three major results. first, personal development significantly affect entrepreneurship interest, as indicated by p-value of 0.047. this implies that personal development dominantly affect entrepreneurship interest without having to directly affect supervising lecturers’ ability. second, networking does not significantly affect entrepreneurship interest, as indicated by p-value of 0.272. this implies that the networking variable is not dominant in affecting entrepreneurship interest unless affecting supervising lecturers’ quality first. third, supervising lecturers’ ability significantly affect entrepreneurship interest, as shown by p-value of 0.05.",networking,"Our research is about the effect of personal development and networking on entrepreneurship interest with supervising lecturer’s ability as the intervening variable. Our respondents are students of STIE Mahadhika Surabaya who participated in the entrepreneurship program. In general, we find that: Personal development has a significantly positive effect on entrepreneurship interest. This can be seen from positive coefficient of 0.155 with CR value of 1.904 and p-value of 0.047 which is smaller than significance value α of 0.05. These imply that the personal development variable significantly affects entrepreneurship interest. The indirect effect value is smaller than the direct effect. These show that the personal development variable is dominant in affecting entrepreneurship interest without having to affect supervising lecturers’ quality. Networking does not have a significant effect on entrepreneurship interest. This can be indicated by the positive coefficient of 0.142 with CR value of 1.099 and p-value of 0.272 which is higher than significance value α of 0.05. These imply that the networking variable does not significantly affect entrepreneurship interest. The indirect effect value is greater than the direct effect. These show that the networking variable is not dominant in affecting entrepreneurship interest unless affecting supervising lecturers’ ability first. In other words, supervising lecturers must be well-qualified before students can develop their entrepreneurship interest. Supervising lecturers’ ability has a significantly positive effect on entrepreneurship interest. This can be seen by the positive coefficient of 0.219 with CR value of 1.958 and p-value of 0.219 which is higher than significance value α of 0.05. As a result, the supervising lecturers’ ability variable significantly affect entrepreneurship interest. These results support our fifth hypothesis that predicts that lecturers’ ability has a significantly positive effect on entrepreneurship interest.

186,Simulation Driven Appointment System Model For A  License Processing Office In The Philippines,"transportation is one of the necessities in our life today. along with the increase in the number of cars and roads being made is the increase in the demand for driver's licenses. with the numerous land transportation offices, few issue new driver's licenses and therefore has to serve many applicants who exert a lot of time and effort to complete the application process which normally takes more than four hours to be completed. time, being a very important factor in our daily decisions, is the concern of this study. this study aims to lessen the total time to complete the process and so is the minimum waiting time of 46% by designing an appointment system developed and tested using simulation and system improvement. sensitivity analysis was used to see how waiting time and running time was affected under various realistic circumstances. results have shown a decrease in waiting time to 9%. to further improve the results of the study, research on the factors affecting and degree of punctuality of license applicants and change in the utilization employees after the application can be made.","simulation, promodel","In a system where applicants arrive on their preferred schedule, there is a possibility of not being able to finish the process and be asked to come back on the next day or not being accommodated at all. Unscheduled arrival also renders applicants to longer process and waiting time. In the current license application process, waiting to be accommodated in the lecture room and approval station brings the highest waiting time in the system with an average time of 68 minutes and 20 minutes, respectively. With the proposed system, only 6 minutes on the average will be the waiting time of each applicant for the lecture and 9 minutes for the approval, while time in queue for validation is 0.33 min, 1.26 for Picture and Signature AMPI, 0.28 min for cashier, 2 min for approving and 0.11 min for releasing. To achieve this, the application and evaluation of different scheduling rules on the process were done by varying the arrival batch size, accumulation size, changing the arrival sizes depending on time and changing the distribution of arrivals in these schedules. The study was able to decrease the waiting time by more than 25% and ensuring the completion of the process on the same day of starting the process. With the improved model, with the same quantity of applicants being accommodated, time in the system was reduced by evenly distributing arrivals giving room for more applicants, as having a fixed arrival schedule gives the applicants knowledge of the allowable arrival times. To strengthen the accuracy of the results of the study and improve the schedule to better suit the time preferences of applicants coming in LTO, it is recommended to have research on the factors that affect their time of arrival, delay, and decision on their planned time of arrival. For future studies, the information system for the appointment system can be made. A more detailed study can also be made about the idleness of employees and the effect of having noon break and identify if other internal factors can attribute to the present waiting time and possibly affect the proposed model. A detailed study on the behavior of the demand for license processing for all kinds of the license can also contribute to helping better understand the reasoning behind the arrivals of customers, thus establish even more stability and better prediction of demand for the process.

187,Tropically Adapted Passive Building: The Impact Of  Building Design And Double Glazing On Ambient,"the high energy consumptions in buildings has been reported as one of the key contributors to global warming since the energy is mostly generated from fossil sources which is responsible for large emission of carbon dioxide. hence, there has been series of awareness on the need for an energy efficient building that can drastically reduce energy consumption. in this study, the performance of a tropically adapted passive building (pb) was investigated in real hot tropical climate of malaysia. two mock-up buildings were built to represent a “green”, made of clay brick double-glazed pb and a conventional, made of concrete “red” building (rb). the ambient temperature of pb was found to be always lower than rb throughout the 7-days experiment during typical sunny/cloudy weather constellations. besides that, the double-glazed windows installed in pb could better withstand the radiation effect of the sunlight hence maintain a much lower window ist than the single-glazed windows in rb. the average ambient temperatures of pb and rb are 29.9 oc and 31.6 oc respectively while the average window ists of pb and rb are 31.6 oc and 33.8 oc respectively. the study concludes that pb provides a better protection against thermal discomfort and the window is one of the critical contributors that affect ambient temperature in a warm tropical climate.","passive building, green building, double glazing, window, heat gain","The configuration of the façade was found to have a tremendous impact on the ambient temperature thus the overall energy consumption of the building. Window commonly presents a small area of a building, but it has a significant effect on the immediate heat inflow to the building. Whereas this work so far measures the impact of double-glazed window, moving forward, the impact of other parameters such as the floors, walls, ceilings, and even shadings are being investigated by the research team to determine the contribution of all these building enclosures in order to achieve tropical residential thermal comfort. The challenge is to bring all these relevant parameters into play in different weather situations for a more sustainable green living in the age of global warming.

188,Analysis And Improvement Of Facility Layout In A Furniture  Factory: A Case Application,"one of the problems faced in production facilities is the material handling, which may account between 20- 50% of total costs of manufacturing and distribution. material handling is directly related to facility layout. in many instances, wrong facility layouts result in excessive handling costs, which could be eliminated or minimized through effective layout procedures. in this paper, we present a case application of a facility layout for a furniture factory, which has a wood and a fabric sections, with fourteen and fifteen departments respectively. about 23 types of sofa models are produced in the factory, where excessive material and personnel flows and backflows were observed during a detailed study. facility layout models were used to estimate total material flow for both the current and the improved layouts. it was found that by using appropriate layout techniques, unnecessary flows could be eliminated, and total material flow costs could be minimized. interdepartmental distance matrices, material and worker flow matrices, and weighting factors were used to quantify the total costs of flow between departments. by using quantitative relations and a facility layout algorithm in excel, layouts of departments were restructured, and total flows were minimized. the proposed new layouts resulted in a significant reduction in material handling costs.","facility layout, furniture factory, material handling, material flows","This paper attempts to improve layout of a sofa furniture manufacturing facility to minimize total material flow costs in a real system by applying engineering tools related to facility planning techniques. Current layouts are analyzed, and related material flow costs are calculated. Next, CRAFT facility layout algorithm, which is available as excel add- ins, is utilized to determine optimum layouts corresponding to minimum material flow costs. The procedure followed in this paper proved to be effective in reducing total material flow costs in the facility studied. This study can be useful guide for facility layout and production engineers to minimize material flow costs in their facilities. The procedures and the results of this study also show that material handling costs due to wrong layouts should not be overlooked. Total annual material handling costs due to wrong layouts can be substantial and related savings, by using appropriate layout tools, can be significant.","mehmet savsar kuwait university industrial engineering department, kuwait and üsküdar university industrial engineering department, istanbul, turkey msavsar@gmail.com aminah aldehaim kuwait university industrial engineering department, kuwait aldehaiem@gmail.com",
189,"Technology Mapping: Definitions, Types, And Applications Alya J. Abuseem*, Yumna J. Alzaabi, Abeer H. Alhammadi, Fikri T. Dweiri, And Alaa M.","the literature of technology mapping or roadmapping, as a one of the elements used in technology management, reviewed in this research to understand how technology mapping has been developed, define technology mapping, identify the types, and applications of technology mapping. this has been done by analyzing the various studies in technology mapping. it has been proved in this research that technology mapping went through three different phases namely product technology roadmapping, emerging technology roadmapping, and innovations roadmapping. technology mapping or technology roadmapping both terminologies used to describe the methods used in generating technology roadmaps to support decision-making process and organization strategic planning. three types of technology roadmapping identified in this research namely “based on purpose”, “based on format”, and “based on use”. for applications, three applications only identified in the current research namely sustainable new product development decisions, fuel cell sub-technologies’ identification, and foresight studies. however, it was stated in the literature that technology mapping could be applied and used in different fields. the analysis conducted on the technology roadmapping literature highlighted many challenges and feature research directions which we discussed in this research.","technology, management, mapping","and Future Research Technology mapping or Roadmapping is a tool that combines innovation and communication in the technology management field. Technology mapping applied in different organizations to achieve effective strategic objectives with technology, to support strategic decisions, for long-range planning, provides a way for companies to explore the future, scan the environment and to track the individuals’ performance. It has been proved in the literature review that technology mapping went through three different phases, which can be seen as generations: the first generation of technology Roadmapping focuses on the product technology roadmap, the second generation is the one focusing on emerging technology Roadmapping, while the third generation of technology Roadmapping is the one that puts an emphasis on the innovation roadmaps. It has been proved in this literature review that technology mapping or technology Roadmapping both terminologies used to describe the methods used in generating technology roadmaps. Literature review showed as well technology Roadmapping methodologies or tools can be categorized to three types, which are based on purpose, based on format and based on use. Regarding the applications of technology mapping, researchers in the current research were able to identify three applications only. However, it was stated in the literature that technology mapping could be applied and used in different fields. Literature review showed a struggle in implementing technology Roadmapping, only 10% of large organizations have implemented it (Phaal, et al., 2004). The reasons vary from the confusion of which form the company should use, to the fact that there is not enough practical support and knowledge sharing in this field. Furthermore, when it comes to the best methodologies of Roadmapping there is a lack of documentation, lack of tools and practices, and there is a lack of addressing the relationship between technology Roadmapping and other initiatives. It has been proved in the literature that having more primary information would have been helpful in terms of understanding the different concepts and methods by relating them to practical-life situations. We can conclude that technology mapping carries significant scope for future researchers, as it would enable them to think of the elements to be reconsidered in the future. Based on the literature review, it can be seen that technology mapping can provide a competitive advantage to organizations but those organizations need to pay attention to the importance of innovation and communication within the organization itself. Technology mapping can be considered as a planning tool and it is a method in which organizations can improve. Implementing technology mapping is not the ultimate solution; rather organizations should keep the map alive by updating it and adding more criteria, fields and tools to it throughout the years.","ubaid college of engineering, university of sharjah, university city, sharjah, uae u18104184@sharjah.ac.ae, u18104182@sharjah.ac.ae , u18105803@sharjah.ac.ae, fdweiri@sharjah.ac.ae, and aubaid@sharjah.ac.ae, * corresponding author, alya j. abuseem, u18104184@sharjah.ac.ae, p.o.box: 27272 sharjah, uae / w: www.sharjah.ac.ae",

191,Work Shift Generation In The Operation Of A Bus Rapid  Transit System,"generation of work shifts is an important issue in bus rapid transit systems, due to the impact caused by the costs of hiring drivers to carry out the routes. the generation of shifts consists of putting together work schedule blocks, in order to cover the operation of the routes specified by the transport system, in this case, the routes of the colombian west-center metropolitan area. to solve this problem, a two-phase solution methodology was proposed, based on a column generation algorithm that combines the work blocks, minimizing the number of shifts. the table 1 presents a comparison of the results obtained with the manual programming and the proposed methodology in real-world instances (megabús, colombia). the table 1 also shows that the methodology reaches feasible solutions in reasonable computing times, and outperforms all the proposed solutions by skilled practitioners, decreasing the total number of shifts. moreover, the algorithmic solution allows the coordinators to focus in the contingencies presented during the operation of the massive transit system; as shown in table 1, a task requiring approximately 8 hours of coordinator’s work (feeder and main routes), the methodology schedules the daily operation in 8 minutes. note that the algorithm generates less work shifts than the manual programming, reducing the operational costs of the company. additionally, the number of mixed shifts is also reduced, a scenario where drivers with the most expensive license (c3), will be scheduled for services requiring only c2 license. 387",,,"daniel esteban cortés and david álvarez-martínez department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universidad de los andes bogotá, colombia de.cortes10@uniandes.edu.co, d.alvarezm@uniandes.edu.co rubén iván bolaños and césar augusto marín-moreno research, development & innovation department integra s.a. pereira, colombia rbolanos@integra.com.co, cmarin@integra.com.co luis miguel escobar-falcón program of systems engineering universidad libre pereira, colombia luism.escobarf@unilibre.edu.co kenny cárdenas-parra industrial engineering department universidad tecnológica de pereira pereira, colombia kennycardenas@utp.edu.co",
192,Optimization Of Flat Rolling Process Through A Simulation  Approach Using Simufact Forming,"rolling process is implemented in the production of structures that are regularly utilized in vast applications such as pipes, frames, shells, and discs. flat rolling is one of the widely used rolling processes that involves reducing the thickness of a metal sheet by feeding it between two rollers that are separated by a pre-specified distance, and this can be done under hot conditions (hot flat rolling) or cold conditions (cold flat rolling). due to the significance of flat rolling applications, optimizing this process became a crucial necessity in today’s industrial revolution. in this paper, simufact forming simulation software was utilized to extract critical results such as effective plastic strain, effective stress, lateral spread, and maximum rolling force under different rolling conditions such as the rotational speed of the rollers and the friction between the rollers and the workpiece to identify their effect on the process. the general trends of the extracted data showed either a linear or a quadratic relationship between the parameters verses the rotational speed and the friction. finally, the trends were used to characterize the best conditions for flat rolling applications.","simulation, rolling process, flat rolling, forming","In conclusion, this researched focused on the simulation of multiple flat rolling processes which were run under different conditions of rolling speed and friction coefficient. The aim was to understand the behavior and the state of the workpiece during and after the each process. The results of each run that includes the effective stress, effective plastic strain, strain rate, lateral spreading and the rolling force were extracted after the simulations were done. These results were summarized in graphs to understand basic trends and relationships. It was found that the best conditions to perform the flat rolling process for the studied material is at speeds of 70 to 90 RPM with friction coefficient between 0.35 to 0.45. These conditions resulted in reasonable values for the measured stresses, forces and deformations. The trends were characterized by a positive linear relationship or a positive quadratic relationship. From that, it can be concluded that increasing the speed or the friction coefficient to high values or decreasing them significantly can be a disservice to the production of sheet metals by flat rolling. y = 1167.7x2 - 920.22x + 400.97 y = 13.409x2 - 11.177x + 3.2686 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 210 215 220 225 230 235 240 245 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 Effective Plastic Strain Effective Stress (MPa) Friction Coefficient Maximum Effective Stress and Effective Plastic Strain Vs.

197,Simulation Analysis Of Patients Flow In Oncology Clinics  Sara A. Hamad And Khaled S. El-Kilany,"with an ageing population and more efficient treatments, demand for cancer care is rising; leading to long waiting times and a significant increase in delays in chemotherapy clinics. chemotherapy operations planning and scheduling is a multi-facet problem due to numerous aspects such as the variety of chemotherapy treatment plans, the flow of patients, and the interdependence between the departments. patient flow is affected by many delays at different stages; doctors’ and pharmacy’s delay, referral to specialist, and waiting time for chemotherapy. the aim of this work is to improve the waiting time of chemotherapy patients by studying the flow of patients from the register time until departure time. the typical characteristics of outpatient chemotherapy are detailed in this paper based on a real-life case study in alexandria, egypt. the data collected showed that 66% out of 144 studied patients arrive earlier than scheduled, which results in a fifo flow that affected the scheduling system. hence, most planning and scheduling efforts are ineffective. a simulation model is built using the data collected to analyze the flow of patients. two scenarios are proposed, tested, and compared to the base model and show that improvements can be attained by reducing unnecessary delays.","chemotherapy, outpatient clinics, patient flow","Long waiting time for chemotherapy patients occur frequently in oncology clinics and this does not only affect the patient satisfaction, but also affects the efficiency of the drug provided in the chemo and subsequently affects the whole treatment process. Operation Researchers have studied this field using assumptions due to the several number of departments that are involved in the process and the high variability. Simulation have been identified in literature as one of the key tools to address the complexity of these systems and to handle the stochastic nature of the different variables affecting the performance of healthcare processes in general. A real life case study of an oncology department in a hospital located in Alexandria, Egypt has been selected. Actual data has been collected and analyzed for a considerable number of patients. Also, data about the different process, resources, and operation of the oncology clinic have been identified. Although the hospital treats patients with all sorts of cancer types; yet, the study has been limited to breast cancer patients only. A base discrete event simulation model representing the current operation of the oncology clinic has been developed using ExtendSimTM v10.0.4 and analyzed. The model included the different resources identified; in addition, the pharmacy and drug preparation time are considered in the model; however, without including the detailed operation of the pharmacy. Average length of stay of patients reported from the base model has been analyzed to identify its different constituents. The largest contributor to the ALOS that can be feasibly reduced are identified. Two different scenarios were developed to test the effect of the proposed solutions on the different performance measures. Results show that the different performance measures can be actually improved without the need to modify any of the current resources. Furthermore, although other activities contributed to the ALOS of patients with greater values; however, these activities cannot be altered due to the fact that the duration of these activities is a clinical variable that cannot be changed, such as the chemotherapy, line, and the premed injection times. Drug preparation time was also one of the major contributors to the ALOS; yet, due to the restricted access to the pharmacy, detailed modelling of pharmacy operations and resources was not possible at this stage of the research. Hence, it was not possible to actually estimate or identify any possible reduction in drug preparation time. Future research work will focus on modelling further details of the pharmacy operations and resources to determine whether the drug preparation time (one of the major contributors to the ALOS) can be reduced or not and whether this reduction will lead to an overall improvement of the oncology clinic performance or not. Furthermore, alternative patients’ schedules are to be modelled and analyzed to test their effectiveness in improving patients’ ALOS and resources’ utilization.

198,An Optimal Preventive Maintenance Policy For A Solar  Photovoltaic System In Order To Promote Sustainability &,"the aim of this paper is to develop a preventive maintenance strategy for a group of solar panels interconnected in series. the approach was to determine the optimal number of solar panels to replace, as well as the optimal replacement periods in order to minimize the total cost of maintenance, over a finite time horizon. in addition, it has been considered that the replacement of solar panels improves the reliability of the system. in case of failure, a minimal repair is carried out. this intervention has no impact on the reliability of solar panels. a numerical example is presented to illustrate the contribution of the proposed modelling approach and to discuss the different results obtained.","solar panel, reliability, sustainability",,"profitability safouane elkouiri and lahcen mifdal laboratory of innovation and applied research - lidra polytechnic school of agadir agadir, morocco safouane.elkouiri@e-polytechnique.ma, mifdal@e-polytechnique.ma sofiene dellagi laboratory of industrial engineering and mechanical production - lgipm university of lorraine metz, france sofiene.dellagi@univ-lorraine.fr anis chelbi university of tunis, higher national school of engineering of tunis. cerep, tunis,tunisia anis.chelbi@planet.tn",
199,A Mathematical Model For Strategic And Tactical Planning Of  The Oil & Gas Upstream Supply Chain After A Merger,"the oil and gas (o&g) industry have complex supply chains across the various processes involved in extracting, refining, and distributing oil and gas. the supply chain involves multiple locations (wellheads, production facilities, and refineries) and many companies supplying the material and equipment required at these locations as well as support services such as project and contract management and logistics. moreover, lower oil prices are reducing the operating margins of the oil and gas companies forcing them to review their organizations and supply chains to improve efficiencies and reduce cost. this can be achieved not only through vertical integration but also through a horizontal merger between two or more companies. therefore, strategic and tactical planning and optimization of the main activities in the o&g is challenging and continue to attract researchers and practitioners. in this study, we present a novel mathematical model for strategic and tactical planning of the upstream o&g supply chain. the o&g supply chain is composed of production areas for oil and gas, processing plants, and demand terminals (tank farms for oil and downstream gas processing). the proposed model assists decision-makers in studying how to manage the o&g supply chain after a merger. the model introduces a framework for the evaluation of advantages associated with horizontal mergers through supply chain network integration and optimization. a case study based on real data from the uae is provided to show the applicability of the model. besides, a sensitivity analysis related to the volatility of oil and gas prices is conducted to derive managerial insights. the initial results show that merger decisions and related costs (shared services and logistics cost) have an impact on how to meet the demand, minimizing costs, and maximizing revenue. finally, experimentation of the proposed model for two scenarios pre- and post-horizontal mergers is presented for the quantification of potential gains associated with the merger. 390",,,"abdalla rashid masoud alnaqbi industrial engineering and engineering management department university of sharjah, uae systems engineering department école de technologie supérieure montreal, canada aralnaqbi@adnoc.ae fikre dweiri industrial engineering and engineering management department university of sharjah, uae fdweiri@sharjah.ac.ae amin chaabane systems engineering department école de technologie supérieure montreal, canada amin.chaabane@etsmtl.ca",
200,Study Of Text Neck Syndrome Among Smartphone Users  Via Jack Software,"this paper focuses on examining the risk factors associated with text neck syndrome (tn) among individuals using smartphones. tn syndrome has many side effects that may harm the users’ health by causing musculoskeletal disorders (msd) to be the riskiest among anything else. this paper experimented with all possible scenarios that an individual would use their smartphones. as it was applied for both genders, three different percentiles, three possible postures, and three possible levels of usages using digital human modeling. jack software was used for modeling all possible postures to analyze the effect of texting on the neck area. in addition, a survey was done with 722 respondents in order to measure and analyze the pain level associated with the main factors of tn occurrence. also, minitab software was used to analyze both the survey’s data and rula scores to show the most significant factors affecting the neck pain. solutions and recommendations were given in order to reduce the pain level and ergonomic risks on the neck.","text neck syndrome, cervical spine","To conclude, this paper focused on the ergonomic risk and neck pain due to the TN syndrome problem that affects people that is based on gender, postures, level of usage and height percentiles. The TN is associated with exponential growth and development of technology that has many side effects on people. Other than that, the head flexion angle was a matter of concern that was measured. Based on the survey that was developed, hours spent using a smartphone and people ages have a significant effect on the neck pain level. Digital Human Models with different scenarios were built using JACK software to show the risk associated with the prolonged usage of a smartphone. The results proved that both genders’ outcomes showed a riskiness level that needs further investigation and other high risky levels outcomes that required immediate changes. Therefore, alternative solutions were suggested such as chair arm support and prism glasses. Based on all outcomes, prism glasses were the optimum solution as RULA and neck scores decreased and the head flexion was zero, this means that the neck will not be bent that minimizes the vulnerability to experience/ get text neck. On the other hand, some recommendations might help in reducing neck pain due to the usage of smartphones such as: using the correct texting techniques by raising the smartphone closer to eye level with a straight back while sitting or standing. For tall people from (50th to 95th) percentiles, it is preferred to use the smartphone in sitting posture, it is necessary to make sure that both arm and hand are well supported by anything like a chair, table, briefcase or others supporting arm techniques. One important thing is to avoid using the smartphone while walking; however, in case of something urgent it is preferable to take care of the usage level and neck posture. Lastly, it is important to have frequent breaks with stretching and do some exercises that will help in easing muscle pain.","amira khalaf, bahie elsamad, dana mohammad, fajer al-sanad, khadeja abdalaziz, lawrence al-fandi, department of industrial engineering, american university of the middle east, eqaila, kuwait 22380@aum.edu.kw, 22459@aum.edukw, 24236@aum.edu.kw, 22945@aum.edu.kw, 24270@aum.edu.kw, lawrence.alfandi@aum.edu.kw",

202,Crop Planning Problem Using Rectangular Management  Zones And Different Irrigation Systems,"according to the united nations report, the world population is estimated to be 9.6 billion people by 2050. as a result, there must be an increase in food production by 70 % to meet the world’s growing demand. food supply chains expand from agriculture activities, production, transportation to consumption. the efficient management of agricultural activities is indispensable to secure food production. the main challenges faced in this respect are the limited availability of natural resources (land and water). in this study, we applied an integer linear programming model to solve the crop planning problem in a small farm while considering limited water availability. the crop planning model relies on the delineation of rectangular management zones to identify the optimum crop pattern based on the physical and chemical properties of the land. the model has been applied to a small farm in egypt. the results help the decision- maker in identifying the optimum crop pattern for maximum profit and also to decide on the economic feasibility of different irrigation systems.","crop planning, irrigation, linear programming","and Future Research In view of limited water availability in arid and semi-arid areas, optimizing crop planning is one way of efficient utilization of land and water resources. This work has presented the application of a crop planning model based on the delineation of rectangular chemical and physical management zones to a small farm in Egypt. Apart from the model’s capability to identify optimum crop patterns to maximize profit, it is used to compare different irrigation systems. This latter use of the model will aid farmers in identifying the more economically viable irrigation system. In the current case, a combination of surface and drip irrigation leads to the maximum total profit over the planning horizon. The application of the model gives insight into the different cost components and gives the decision-maker the flexibility to choose an adequate irrigation system. The model is generic and applicable in arid and semi-arid areas. The study of the economic feasibility of the use of modern irrigation systems and smart water and moisture sensors using the internet of things for data acquisition to collect data from the field for the optimization model is suggested to be investigated in the future.

209,Modular Construction Innovation In The Uk: The Case Of  Residential Buildings,"the construction industry in the uk within the last decade has seen an increasing demand for housing and wider concerns over the need to improve performance. comparatively, other uk industry such as car manufacturing has rapidly developed and modernised itself. offsite technologies seem reluctant to be adopted by the construction industry. several surveys have been carried out to examine the limitations and explore remedial actions however, house builders are uncertain in their views, hence are reluctant to embrace this innovation in helping to meet the current demand for new homes. this study has been carried out to understand the benefits and barriers of modular construction and the level of satisfaction with the modular construction over the traditional construction. the investigation was carried out through using 3 case studies, within which a combination interviews, questionnaires, site observation and document review were used for data collection. the results suggested that in comparison with traditional construction, modular construction will offer a better quality finished product, significant savings in construction programme, improved health and safety and increased end-user satisfaction. the projects reviewed have shown excellent market achievement. the authors have hence concluded that given changing client perception, improved design and procurement, and increased awareness, modular techniques will be the future home construction trend. to achieve this, increased awareness and training opportunities in modular techniques are necessary to enlighten traditional builders about the potential benefits of modular techniques.","modular building, innovation, prefabrication","The modular construction method is a significant innovation that aims to offer the construction industry modern methods of building residential homes efficiently and speedily to meet current demand. Traditional contractors are reluctant to adopt off-site modular construction techniques mainly due to its poor previous perceptions. Cost was often seen as an obstacle to off-site activities due to increased initial cost required during the planning and design phases inaccessible by traditional builders. However, the primary data conducted using 3 case studies show that there are considerable benefits in terms of time, cost and quality aspects, if adopting modular construction over traditional construction. Barriers were identified too as poor perception, transport difficulties, lack of coordination and collaboration. In addition, other barriers such as lack of knowledge and regulatory guidance, lack of industry and product awareness, shortage of skilled workers have hindered on traditional builders’ unwillingness to embrace this innovation.

211,Achieving Sustainability Through Holistic Maintenancekey  For Competitiveness,"the manufacturing sector is considered to be an engine of economic growth for most of the developing nations. at the same time, issues related to environmental sustainability cannot be ignored. therefore, every aspect of manufacturing activities needs to play its part in ensuring the sustainability of overall manufacturing. to ensure, optimal use of manufacturing facilities, the use of maintenance function is very important. most of the time, maintenance is considered to be a reactive function. it does not find many places in sustainability-related discussions of manufacturing. it is found that world-class organisations have started considering maintenance as a strategic activity. it is expected that maintenance management will find a place like quality management. when maintenance is to be strategic/ proactive function, it requires to be performed in sync with sustainability aspects. total productive maintenance (tpm) is a futuristic maintenance strategy that will give a holistic concept of strategic maintenance. the performance of organisations on tpm can be evaluated using overall equipment effectiveness (oee). research has suggested that oee is not sufficient to capture the sustainability aspects of maintenance. this study has proposed a concept of green tpm, which can take care of sustainability and maintenance simultaneously. maintenance activities may release hazardous chemicals, defected/ unrepairable spare parts, and other components that can negatively impact the environment. this paper explains the concept of green tpm as a future-oriented vision that follows the philosophy of customer-orientation, environmental concern, mass production with customization and sustainability. it is an integrated approach that covers elements like green training, green maintenance, and green lean six sigma. this approach is not only helpful in achieving higher manufacturing performance but also environmental performance.","green tpm, maintenance, oee, sustainability","The conventional competitiveness is determined on your abilities to offer a superior quality product at low cost with faster deliveries. With more aware customers, the expectations are now moving into intangible aspects, particularly environment-related issues. The focus of maintenance has chased from a cost centre to strategic investment activity but adding ‘green’ aspect will help an organisation to achieve sustainability through green TPM. The efforts of different functional areas to help in achieving sustainability will create a more synergistic environment in the organisation. This synergy will be a very important enabler for competitiveness in coming times. There will be a continuous requirement of spreading this synergy from internal-organisation level to inter-organisation level. The conventional TPM will be scaled up to green TPM using some of the green pillars coming from different functional aspects. This GTPM will open the door of economic, environmental, and social sustainabilities and this will become an important enabler for the competitiveness of the organisations in a period which is characterised by very frequent change of product designs, frequent change of jigs and fixtures, and frequent change of dies etc. 4. Limitations and Future Scope This framework is being proposed on the basis of literature review and experts survey. So there is the future scope of the study to empirically validate the proposed framework. In this proposed framework, it is possible to have a few case studies as well as data collection from different organisations.

212,"Barriers And Enablers For Developing Sustainable Supply  Chain At Traditional Shipyards In East Java, Indonesia","traditional shipyards in indonesia have produced lots of wooden fishing boats in various gross tonnage sizes. efficiency in material costs has been concerned for creating competitive advantage. however, traditional shipyards encounter various barriers in developing sustainable supply chain. in this study, we investigate the barriers and enablers experienced by traditional shipyards when developing sustainable supply chain by using analytical hierarchy process (ahp). the results show that the top five barrier factors are lack of information, fund constraints, high cost, and lack of visual and statistical control during green lean implementation, and poor quality of human resources. on the other hand, the top five enabler factors are risk mitigation, top management commitment and support, monitoring and auditing supply chain partners, availability of financial support, and recognition. by incorporating the sustainable supply chain principles into the traditional shipyards’ business models, the owners agree that the recognition of environmentally friendly shipyards can increase their sales growth and reputation","shipyards, barriers, enablers","We have discussed the barrier and enabler factors for developing sustainable supply chain at traditional shipyards in Indonesia. By using AHP method, we found out that the top five barrier factors are lack of information, fund constraints, high cost, lack of visual and statistical control during green lean implementation, and poor quality of human resources. Meanwhile, the top five enabler factors are risk mitigation, top management commitment and support, monitoring and auditing supply chain partners, availability of financial support, and recognition. The insights derived from the barrier factors are most the traditional shipyards invest on wooden logs to anticipate the fund constraints and increasing material price. Furthermore, the intelligent quotient of workers and the number of training are important to master in all fishing boat building activities. On the other hand, the insights from the enabler factors are that the support and commitment from top management to implement the environmentally friendly production process is very necessary. Moreover, the traditional shipyards owners agree that the recognition of environmentally friendly shipyards can increase their sales growth and reputation. This is because the number of wooden material consumed will be less as the shipyards implement the greening production process. Future research can be done by modeling the industrial ecosystem of wooden fishing boat building.

Surely many researchers will question its generalization and elements considered here in this study. With marginal changes in the elements and variables detailed in the Table 1, 2 and 3, developed migration path can be used to know the state of integration of a supply chain. Future research should focus on implementing this migration path in the manufacturing industries. So, developed migration path should be operationalized for different types of industries like: Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Auto Component Manufacturers etc. We believe a larger study should be carried out and compared with our work to obtain better understanding of supply chain integration index and migration path for SCI.","prashant shahabadkar, dr. ashok kumar vangeri department of mechanical engineering shetty institute of technology, kalaburagi, karnataka, india vidyaprashant22@gmail.com, vanageriashok@gmail.com dr. pramod k s, dr. keshav n nandurkar k k wagh institute of engineering education and research, nashik, india",

This is mainly due to the fact that TLBO uses the best solution of the iteration to modify the existing solution as in PSO and it does not divide the population as in case of ABC. 834","optimization algorithm p. j. pawar, k. n. nandurkar and p. k. shahabadkar k. k. wagh institute of engineering education and research, nashik savitribai phule pune university, pune maharashtra, india pjpawar@kkwagh.edu.in, knnandurkar@kkwagh.edu.in, pkshahabadkar@kkwagh.edu.in","References

219,Road Projects Estimation: A Review  Opeoluwa Akinradewo,"the road infrastructure being the backbone of the transport system serves as a connection between the populace. this keeps the economy of the country flowing thereby establishing a crucial constituent of the economic, environmental and social well-being. to understand the approaches to estimating for road projects in the construction industry, this study reviewed extant literature using articles downloaded from scopus database. it was established from extant literature that estimating for construction project is done to ascertain the likely required cost and also to ascertain the likely required time to execute the project. these estimates inform the project team on the financial implications of inputs made to proposed projects, thereby allowing for proper budgeting and cost control depending on the phase of construction. reviewed literature revealed that categories of construction estimates are preliminary estimates, definitive estimates and detailed estimates while methods of estimating include subjective estimating, parametric estimating, comparative estimating, and analytical estimating. analytical estimating was adjudged the most accurate of the four methods of estimating. it was therefore concluded that analytical estimating should be adopted for road projects to achieve the desired accuracy.","construction, estimation, project cost","It has been indicated that estimating for construction project is done to ascertain the likely required cost and also to ascertain the likely required time to execute the project. In project management, estimating is considered an essential part as it serves as the benchmark for cost control during the project execution phase. These estimates inform the project team on the financial implications of inputs made to proposed projects, thereby allowing for proper budgeting and cost control depending on the phase of construction. Also, estimates serve three purposes in the construction industry. Firstly, at the early phases of a construction project when an estimate of the projected cost is needed so that the financial feasibility of the project can be determined. Secondly, once the construction starts, the preliminary estimate serves as a benchmark for identifying deficiencies and the contractor taking corrective actions in order to sustain profit margins. Thirdly, winning a bid is based on the estimate prepared for the project for the purpose of openness. Categories of construction estimates were identified to be preliminary estimates, definitive estimates and detailed estimates while methods of estimating include subjective, comparative, parametric, and analytical estimating. Analytical estimating was adjudged the most accurate of the four methods of estimating. From the reviewed literature, it is concluded that estimation in the construction industry is essential as it serves as the benchmark for cost control while executing the project. It informs the project team on the financial implications of inputs made to proposed projects which allow for proper budgeting and cost control depending on the phase of construction.","sarchl in sustainable construction management and leadership in the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa. opeakinradewo@gmail.com clinton aigbavboa sarchl in sustainable construction management and leadership in the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa. caigbavboa@uj.ac.za ayodeji oke sarchl in sustainable construction management and leadership in the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa. emayok@gmail.com",
220,Bio Char Production From Sugar Cane Bagasse And Its  Application Sugarcane Processing Wastewater Treatment,"the sugar producing industry generates tons of bagasse as a waste product. this bagasse has the potential to be converted to bio char. in this study, sugarcane bagasse was converted to bio char at 600 ◦c for 3 hours and a heating rate of 10 ◦c/min using the pyrolysis technology. a bio char yield of 75% was achieved with a surface area of 500 m2/g and a particle size of <2mm. the bio char was used as an adsorbent media in sugarcane wastewater and the changes in the ph, biological oxygen demand (bod), chemical oxygen demand (cod), total nitrogen (tot-n), total phosphate (tot-p) and the total solids (ts) were monitored using standard methods. application of the bagasse based bio char in sugarcane wastewater treatment resulted in the significant reduction of bod, cod, tot-n, tot-p and ts by 85.1%, 84.8%, 74.8%, 76.5% and 84.7% respectively.",bagasse,"Sugarcane bagasse is a good raw material for bio char production. The bio char produced had good porosity and surface area of 500 m2/g which makes it useful as a bio adsorbent. Application of the bagasse based bio char in sugar cane wastewater treatment resulted in significant decrease in BOD, COD, TS, Tot-P and Tot-N by more than 70%. The bagasse based bio char had good adsorption properties essential in sugar wastewater treatment.

221,Artificial Neural Networks For Fault Diagnosis Of Milk  Pasteurization Process A Comparative Study,"the increasing complexity of most industrial processes always tends to create problems in monitoring and supervision systems. detection and early fault diagnosis are the best way to manage and solve these problems. artificial neural networks (anns), by their ability to learn and store a large volume of information, are tools particularly suitable for diagnostic support systems. effectiveness of anns for fault diagnosis in milk pasteurization process is presented in this paper. the initial data base used for fault diagnosis is constructed using data extracted from fmea (failure modes and effects analysis) tables of milk pasteurization process. indeed, this analysis makes it possible to establish the links of cause and effect between the faulty components and the observed symptoms. three models of anns, namely feed-forward back propagation (ffbp), radial basis function based neural network (rbnn), and generalized regression neural networks (grnn) are developed and compared. the determination coefficient (r2), root mean square error (rmse), and mean absolute error (mae) statistics were used as evaluation criteria of all the models. the comparison results indicate that the performances of grnn model are better than the ffbp and rbnn models. the same neuronal models can be extended to any technical system by considering appropriate parameters and defects.","fault diagnosis, e.g.",,"chebira samia, bourmada noureddine, and boughaba abdelali industrial safety department, hygiene and industrial safety institute mustafa ben boulaid batna 2 university batna, algeria schebira@yahoo.fr","References

222,"Lean Approach In A High Mix, Low Volume Manufacturing  Environment – Case Study","market competition is fierce and has been intensified due to globalization, therefore companies have experienced increase pressure to improve cycle and delivery times and achieve a high level of customization. lean principles have been designed and implemented to respond to market changes. however, these principles are commonly aimed to aid low-mix high-volume (lmhv) manufacturers. this paper aims to develop a systematic approach to implement a lean framework in a high-mix low-volume (hmlv) manufacturing environment. an hmlv manufacturing environment, currently produces a variety of products which differs in terms of shape and size and different sequence of operation and as a much smaller batch size. additionally, analysis of the manufacturing assembly shows there is a substantial variation in cycle and changeover time from product to product. in this approach, an action based study has been completed. this study uses data collection methods to be applied in order to calculate timings to be used in a discrete event simulation (des). the simulation uses lean tools to study material movement and facility layout to minimize bottlenecks and eliminate waste from the process. an introduction of lean supermarket is considered within the simulation whereby an operator withdraws products in an specific amount needed by a downstream process before introducing it across the assembly floor and an action plan is created. as a result, a lean manufacturing simulation study has been implemented to evaluate the effects of a supermarket concept within the current manufacturing environment. initial results show a variation within the cycle and setup times for each of the different products due to the nature of the process. the paper, is limited to applying the approach to a singular production line and a singular manufacturing plant. the practical implications to implement this approach into a manufacturing environment is that there should be a need from the company. this approach should be driven by senior members within the organization as the resistance to change would increase the risk of failure. another implication of the proposed approach is to ensure the accuracy of the data collected and to introduce a series of briefs within each stage of the approach. this is important as all stakeholders would need to be kept up-to-date with the project. however, the approach is applicable to any organization and can be applied to any sector. this paper, develops a systematic approach to implement a lean framework in a high-mix low-volume (hmlv) manufacturing environment. the approach is validated in an automotive manufacturing organization competing in global markets.",lean,"This paper presents a lean approach in a high mix low volume manufacturing facility. This proposal includes arguments for and against the need to change from a single piece flow into a supermarket concept. This paper would show decision makers that by reducing the size of bottlenecks they may have to compromise on transportation and storage which could increase costs. Therefore, this paper will help them to be better informed to support decision in improving the manufacturing facility. The VSM is constructed by using the DMAIC improvement cycle and using stopwatch analysis to measure operators over a various shifts. The paper applies action research, gemba walk and process stapling to create a current value stream map. This would then need to be validated with stakeholders before introducing estimations to create a future state map that would include a supermarket concept. The paper applies action research to validate the proposed methodology in a British manufacturing organization competing in global markets. Thus, the analysis, development and validation of the current value stream map and analysis to change the layout into a supermarket is very beneficial. The process of using the supermarket concept to validate the benefits within the organization could be further enhanced: • Including of CAD software and Discrete event simulation • Running trials for various scenarios. • Further action research is needed to analyze and implement the methodology in other assembly lines and collecting data considering a longer period of time. • Validate the DES methodology with data collected from other assembly lines. • Create a detailed action plan for the implementation of improvements. 842","anees hussain, jose eduardo munive-hernandez, felician campean faculty of engineering & informatics university of bradford bradford, bd7 1dp, uk a.hussain286@bradford.ac.uk, j.e.munive@bradford.ac.uk, f.campean@bradford.ac.uk","References

223,Lean Readiness Level Of The Azerbaijan Construction  Industry,"this paper identifies and measures the lean readiness of the azerbaijan construction industry. a survey questionnaire was utilised to evaluate the lean readiness of this industry by measuring its quality practices and to test three hypotheses. the lean readiness framework developed by al-najem et al. (2013) was taken as a basis for this study; however, there can also be seen some adaptations made from the framework developed by diekmann et al. (2003). the questionnaire was sent to 57 azerbaijan construction companies, from where 20 responses were obtained. the results derived from the questionnaire showed that the azerbaijan construction industry is not ready to implement the lean methodology. it also found that there remains a lack of trust between employee and employer relations. lastly, it is evident that the size of the companies does not play any considerable role on lean readiness of construction companies and does not make any sense for choosing construction prerequisites. this study can be beneficial for those azerbaijan construction companies that are interested in the implementation of lean construction, or which are interested to increase their level of competitiveness.","lean, lean readiness, materials",,"hajibaba aghayev warwick manufacturing group, the university of warwick coventry, cv4 7al, uk haji.aghayev@gmail.com jose arturo garza-reyes, simon peter nadeem, anil kumar centre for supply chain improvement, university of derby, derby, de22 1gb, uk j.reyes@derby.ac.uk; s.nadeem@derby.ac.uk; a.kumar@derby.ac.uk vikas kumar bristol business school, university of the west of england, bristol, bs16 1qy, uk vikas.kumar@uwe.ac.uk luis rocha-lona esca santo tomás, instituto politécnico nacional, mexico city, mexico lrocha@ipn.mx fernando gonzález-aleu departamento de ingenieria, universidad de monterrey, san pedro garza garcía, n.l. méxico fernando.gonzalezaleu@udem.edu","References

228,Comparative Analysis Of Cost Overrun On Road  Construction Projects Executed By Indigenous And,"project implementation arguments on expatriate and indigenous contractors in the nigerian construction industry are based on their performance on construction projects. expatriate contractors are engaged more on large-scale construction projects leaving the indigenous contractors to small-scale projects. the nigerian construction industry is not faced with the challenge to draw foreign contractors but to encourage indigenous participation. this study is aimed at determining the cost performance of road projects executed by expatriate and indigenous contractors with a view at drawing a comparison to know how efficient the two groups of contractors are. the study adopted a qualitative research design approach. this is achieved by observing the subject matter in its natural settings and attempting to interpret the pattern and behaviours of the subject matter. with the use of pro-forma, archival data on road project cost executed in ekiti state between january 2018 and july 2019 were retrieved from the state ministry of works. a total of 61 road projects were completed with 28 constructed by indigenous contractors and 33 constructed by expatriate contractors. the retrieved cost data were analysed using descriptive statistics. from the findings of this study, it was evident that road projects executed by indigenous contractors experience less cost overrun compared to road projects executed by expatriate contractors while indigenous contractors execute fewer road projects. it was therefore recommended that indigenous contractors should be patronised by clients in the construction industry to boost the economy and also improve the employment rate by engaging more local manpower.","cost overrun, nigeria","AND RECOMMENDATION The study has been able to determine the cost performance of road projects executed by expatriate and indigenous contractors. The study retrieved cost data for road projects executed in Ekiti state, Nigeria and it can be concluded that indigenous contractors execute fewer road projects compared to expatriate contractors. Also, indigenous contractors recorded fewer cost overrun on road projects executed compared to expatriate contractors. Despite this, expatriate contractors are patronised more than indigenous contractors by clients in the construction industry. It is therefore recommended that indigenous contractors should be patronised by clients in the construction industry. This will promote local content and also reduce the menace of cost overrun experienced on road projects executed in Ekiti state. Also, expatriate contractors will always send their earnings to their home country which contributes to income generation and distribution shortages, unexperienced indigenous contractors, local construction and material industries that are not worthy. For further study, a wider range of cost data can be retrieved to have a general view of how cost overrun varies on road projects executed by indigenous and expatriate contractors.","expatriate contractors opeoluwa akinradewo, douglas aghimien, clinton aigbavboa sarchl in sustainable construction management and leadership in the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa. opeakinradewo@gmail.com",
229,Design Of Job Scheduling Using  Bat Algorithm To Minimize Makespan,"this research was conducted in a manufacturing company that produces high carbon wire. the company had issues in fulfilling demand where it had to work on overtime despite having a production capacity that is greater than the number of requests. this problem are due to greater actual production time than the standard production time and job scheduling prioritization using first come first serve. the purpose of this study is to create a job schedule using a bat algorithm in hybrid flow shop for high carbon wire products to minimize makespan and hence, to reduce overtime. in this study, a comparison was made between 4 conditions, namely one condition using time and sequence of work based on production reports (condition 1), second condition using actual time and sequence of work based on bat algorithm (condition 2), third condition using standard processing time and sequence of work based on production reports (condition 3), and forth condition using standard time and sequence of work based on bat algorithm (condition 4). post data processing, we found that the condition 1 has a makespan of 551 hours and requires 82 hours of overtime; condition 2 has a makespan is 545 hours and requires 76 hours overtime; condition 3 has a makespan is 478 hours and requires 9 hours overtime; and condition 4 has a makespan is 439 hours and does not require any overtime 4. by using bat algorithm and standard processing time, the company can eliminate overtime and reduce makespan by 112 hours from condition 1.","scheduling, hybrid flowshop, high carbon wire, low carbon wire","1. Upon doing research and data processing, the shortest makespan is obtained in Condition 4. 2. The job processing sequence for Condition 4 is J5, J3, J22, J6, J17, J14, J13, J18, J9, J7, J2, J1, J20, J15, J21, J10, J12, J16, J19, J8, J11, J14 for machine 1 and J5, J21, J2, J17, J6, J20, J9, J18, J22, J15, J3, J11, J1, J4, J8, J13, J19, J12, J7, J14, J10, J16 for machine2. Total makespan with that processing sequence is 439 hours. 3. Based on the calculation using bat algorithm for Condition 4, the total production time is reduced by 112 hours or 20% from the actual production time. 4. With the decrease of production time by 112 hours, overtime is no longer required to fulfil orders and overtime is reduced by 100% from actual time. 5. The company is able to save production cost of IDR13,972,500,- every month if they apply bat algorithm and strictly supervise production to ensure that actual production time is not higher than standard processing time. 6. By applying Condition 4, the company is able to accept more orders due to a 30 hours time saved.","in hybrid flowshop sumiharni batubara, debbie kemala sari, dhimas aryo wicaksono industrial engineering department faculty of industrial technology trisakti university kampus a usakti, indonesia sumiharni@trisakti.ac.id; debbie.kemala@trisakti.ac.id; dhmsaryo@gmail.com",
230,Heating And Cooling Loading Processes And Optimizes  Material Properties For The Best Thermal,"this study examines the issues as regards the development of the built environment and discusses the thermal performance of trombe wall with respect to heating and cooling load profile. the scope of this research is limited to trombe wall designs that are suitable for a common building structure facilitate the comparison and reduce the time taken. therefore, a good solar building performance will provide good selection material by using cambridge engineering selector (ces) software and go through the process of selecting a candidate material (or a range of materials), hence only a few materials able to pass the requirements. the result shows that the best materials for trombe that meets the requirements of the ces software are found on titanium alloys, stone, concrete, silica glass, soda-lime glass, brick, silicon, and borosilicate glass. the research concludes that solar energy produces different energy performances which resulted from different building techniques that affected the environment in various ways.","trombe wall, solar thermal","A Trombe wall can enable a building envelope to go from a net-loss feature to a net-gain feature. The Trombe wall provides passive solar heating without introducing light and glare into these commercial spaces. Overhangs are necessary to minimize the summer gains; however, additional means would be helpful to minimize summer cooling impacts. TW does not give many influences to the internal temperature. Therefore, it is proved that both materials are suitable to be applied in building in terms of comfort internal temperatures. As this study evaluates the progress of solar Trombe wall system-wide and the possibility for further use, the analysis shows the different designs of solar Trombe wall system that requires elements of passive solar design, the passive solar design principles, the potentials, the difficulties, also main environmental and thermal performance strategies of Trombe wall. In this way, the good performance of the solar Trombe wall system will be accomplished. Trombe walls save energy by complementing conventional heating. In an efficient building, Trombe walls may even replace the need for conventional heating. The innovation of the Trombe wall not widely used in victoria and integration with existing facilities not widely performed. Application of Trombe walls can be used wherever building heating is required providing that a suitable north-facing wall is available. Consideration must be given to hot summer months. To avoid overheating it is important to provide shade over the glass collector and close both the upper and lower vents. Therefore, a good building will provide good selection material by using Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) software and go through the process of selecting a candidate material (or a range of materials) that find the best candidates for TW selection of concrete, with stone and brick as alternatives because from the comparison. Recommenidation for Future work Future studies should incorporate theoretical, experimental evaluation and mathematical simulation for the design work. Once the theory has been established. It is possible to investigate all the parameters affecting the performance so that an optimum size Trombe wall system of the reasonable cost could be established. Future research could also be made on the design of the Trombe wall system in Libya, which is a large country in North Africa. Libya has a long coastline on the Mediterranean but the greater part consists of the central Sahara desert which is boiling hot. This research is regarding its winter system using the annual temperature in North Africa - Libya that can be seen as follows.

232,Evaluation Of Pre Versus Post Merger Of Indian Banks  Prabhavathi Kalshetty,"over the year’s indian economy has been going through continuous fluctuations due to the recent government reforms. with reforms are various structural levels, banks were also looked into detail. even though the indian banking sector are known for maintaining stability at international levels, due to operational issues there has been several concerns at the indian banks which has led to issues like net performance assets (npa). the merger is a combination of two or more companies with an objective of wealth maximization to add more value with a stand of one. the aim of the present paper is to evaluate the pre and post performance and npa of the merging banks in the indian banking industry. the financial performance evaluation was based on various financial metrics like profitability and liquidity. in addition to financial performance, npas are evaluated using various aspects of bank’s financial parameters like net profit, loans, advances, net npa (nnpa), gross npa (gnpa), enterprise value, book value, market capitalization, deposits, deposits (cagr%), casa deposits, return on equity (roe) and return on assets (roa). the study has employed on a sample size data of 12 banks, where all of them are government owned banks and the data has been collected over a period of three years from 2016 to 2018. through an extensive literature review the researchers explored that through the comparison of financial performance it is evident that the amalgamation of the banks into a single bank is positively affected in the future. the mergers of big banks may fructify over the next 18-24 months. though the integration is long-drawn it will disrupt lending. there will be issues of book dilution, which will happen due to government infusing capital at low valuations and issues additional shares to investors of amalgamated banks. the researchers through their 845",,"Any disruptions during these merger processes could have negatively affected the bank’s performance. Therefore, it is essential for banks to mitigate exposures in the areas to interconnect, credit quality, innovation and liquidity, the market, regulatory compliance. These risks can be solved by advance planning and due diligence for smooth movement. The public sector banks should also empower and recruit chief risk officers at market linked compensation to attract the best talent. These appointed chief risk officers should empower to mitigate the exposures. This will help them to position towards global sized banks. 6.","research scholar department of management ballari institute of technology and management visveswaraya technological university karnataka, india asbblrpk@gmail.com dr. shekar babu phd professor & founding head department of management amrita vishwa vidyapeetham karnataka, india sb@amrita.edu prof. gurrum prasad dinesh phd chairman department of management vijayanagara sri krishnadevaraya university karnataka, india gurrumdinesh@gmail.com",

234,Stocking Decisions In A Multiple Location Periodic Review  Inventory System With Order Crossover,"deliveries in global supply chains are often made through lengthy shipping routes that are subject to many delays such as border crossings, inspections and so forth. consequently, orders frequently crossover, that is, their order of arrival is not the same as the order that they were issued. in this paper we consider the window fill rate of a multiple location inventory system with order crossover. demand arrives to each location according to a poisson arrival process and inventory in each location is reviewed periodically. the system’s window fill rate is the probability that a customer arriving to the system is served within her tolerable wait. we consider two stocking optimization problems. the first is the spares allocation problem, which is defined as finding the optimal allocation that maximizes the window fill rate given a budget of spares. the second problem is the optimal budget problem, which is defined as the optimal allocation that minimizes the total budget of spares subject to a required window fill rate level. we show that when resources are scarce it is optimal to cluster spares to only few locations. in contrast, when resources are abundant, then an equitable solution is optimal.","spares allocation, window fill rate, customer patience, order crossover","In this study we describe a multiple location inventory system with periodic review and solve two typical problems that managers must solve to reduce costs or maximize performance. We show that when there is a limited number of spares, the optimal solution is asymmetric even when the locations are identical. Thus, when resources are scarce, it is optimal to concentrate them in few locations rather than distribute them equitably. Customer patience play a significant role in the system’s performance and reduces the number of spares needed to meet a required performance level. This observation has a practical implication when writing service contracts. System managers may offer customers reduced premiums if they agree to longer waits. Understanding how the tolerable wait affects the budget size is critical in the design of these contracts. Our multiple location system’s structure is a flat structure with all locations situated in a single tier and without the option of lateral transshipment of spares between locations. Extending the model to more complex structure such as multiple-echelon systems is a challenge left for future studies. 1410","yahel giat department of industrial engineering, jerusalem college of technology, jerusalem, israel department of medicine, hebrew university, jerusalem, israel yahel@jct.ac.il","References

235,Comparison Of Social Good Versus Npa Of Indian Banks  Prabhavathi Kalshetty,"as the indian economy has been going through various fluctuations due to the current government reforms as well as structural reforms across various levels, indian banks have been facing a lot of pressures. though the indian banking sector are well known for their financial and healthy stability, however, due to policy issues at the structural there has been several concerns. issues such as net performance assets (npa) were further exposed which led to additional pressures. the aim of the present paper is to compare the social good of these banks with respect to their npa ratio. the researchers are comparing the social good, measured in terms of corporate social responsibility (csr) spend and the npa ratio, measured in terms of the total number of wilful defaulters and the total amount which has been wilfully defaulted. the financial performance evaluation was based on various financial metrics like profitability and liquidity. the researchers evaluated the financial performance in addition to npas for these banks. the npas were evaluated using various aspects of bank’s financial parameters like net profit, loans, advances, net npa (nnpa), gross npa (gnpa), enterprise value, book value, deposits, market capitalisation, deposits (cagr%), casa deposits, and return on assets (roa). the social 854",,"The increase productivity in banks is clearly due to the kind of services provided to the customers with increasing levels of deposits, profitability and lending and decrease in NPAs. NPAs are caused due to the non monitoring and disbursement of money at the right levels. A fault in single branch can be regulated but not in the whole country which runs in thousands of crores of rupees. In the previous years the stressed credits are converted to assets with the help of restructuring. There has been a significant decrease in recovery rates and resolve the NPA problem. There is a destressing effect on the economy is due to rising NPAs. The causes of NPA may effect the profitability of the banks as they do not earn any income from the NPAs, rather they have costs for their maintenance. But, rising NPAs have destressing effect on the economy of the country. The consequences under causing NPAs maybe i) the banks profitability effects severely as the banks do not earn any income from NPAs, rather they have future losses which incur costs for their maintenance. Banks are also subjected to risks like other businesses which cannot be eliminated but can be monitored regularly within the limit.","research scholar department of management ballari institute of technology and management visveswaraya technological university karnataka, india asbblrpk@gmail.com rajshree sundararajan department of management amrita vishwa vidyapeetham bangalore, india srajshree1997@gmail.com prof. shekar babu phd amrita vishwa vidyapeetham bangalore, india sb@amrita.edu prof. gurrum prasad dinesh phd chairman department of management vijayanagara sri krishnadevaraya university karnataka, india gurrumdinesh@gmail.com",
236,Critical Analysis Of Software Vulnerabilities Through Data  Analytics,"one of the main security risks is the software vulnerability. the vulnerability when exploited by attacks, can cause catastrophic losses to the system. there are a number of vulnerabilities that are explored and discovered in the computing system and these vulnerabilities have increased multifold. the security vulnerabilities span across entire networks, large organisations and have to mitigated by information security engineers on a regular routine basis. one of the key challenges for information technology (it) system administrators is how to tackle these vulnerabilities and more specifically which vulnerability to prioritize. all companies recognize the importance and need to prioritize these vulnerabilities. it is not only important to prioritize the vulnerabilities; it is imperative to utilize a vulnerability evaluation system. the significant role of the vulnerability evaluation system is to separate these vulnerabilities from each other through quantitative and qualitative methods. in this paper, we first review through both qualitatively and quantitatively the various vulnerabilities within an existing large global multinational company. we explore and analyze 30,000 various vulnerabilities across a 3-month time period. the 30,000 vulnerabilities are captured using an automated software from individual systems and the network within the company. the software detects the vulnerabilities and the various characteristics associated with these vulnerabilities and assigns severity levels based on the severity of the vulnerability. the severity is assigned a score from 1 to 5, with 1 being least. the vulnerabilities captured span across 20 different lab environments, across different operating systems and these vulnerabilities are with various severity levels. the cvss vulnerability scoring system was utilized for data from one of the biggest multinational company from within their environment. the researchers analyzed the various vulnerabilities using the various parameters of these vulnerabilities. the researchers analyzed and studied the various inherent patterns within the environment. various variables were analyzed critically as part of the descriptive analytics. the vulnerabilities were analyzed across the labs. then each lab was analyzed using variables like os, various severity levels, ids, status of vulnerabilities, cvss scores, access vector, attack complexity, confidentiality, integrity, availability, exploitability, systems, categories of systems, ports, pci,","severity, cvss, risk",,"parimi mastan rao amrita vishwa vidyapeetham bengaluru, india parimimastanrao@hotmail.com dr. shekar babu professor amrita vishwa vidyapeetham bengaluru, india sb@amrita.edu",
237,Detecting Anomalies In Users – An Ueba Approach  Raguvir. S,"large organizations across the globe are using advanced security solutions to protect and watch the users information. even with such advanced solutions these companies are not able to protect or attacks. in addition to attacks one of the key aspects is users behaviour and detecting anomalies when the users are utilizing the systems on the network as well the patterns in their behaviour. lack of proper monitoring and controls implementation and data breaches are seen. the security professionals within the organizations as well as outside are grappling to solve these issues. one of the new approaches to information security is user entity behaviour analytics (ueba). one of the biggest challenges with incident response is the large amount of data that the system environment has generated and how to accommodate and analyse the data. analytics within the area of information security is a new area. analytics professionals are working on creating rules and correlation aspects, in addition to trends and behaviour patterns with respect to the users behaviour and their approach. one of the key focus areas of ueba is on users actions and behaviours. behaviours, users access as well as their usage anomalies are popular and interpretation of these anomalies or malicious activities is very critical. ueba approach is a viable approach in the area of security to detect user behaviour anomalies using methods like statistical analysis and machine learning. the paper aims to show how analytics and specifically ueba can help in users patterns and any anomalies within these patterns. with the focus on user behaviours and the analytics related to user behaviours the authors look at the insights, benefits and the utilization of resources in the area of security. the various parameters analysed for the users are user name, ip address, time of usage, date of usage. the data was analysed over a period of 3 months. the researchers developed patterns using a visualization dashboard and used mining, script and processing of raw data before developing visual analytics. the various anomalies were highlighted from the different patterns.","security, anomalies, visual analytics","From the analysis and the data we can observe that the authors focused on the behavior of the users usage of the corporate network from various locations. In addition, the authors also explored to find out the different times these users were utilizing these locations. The authors also wanted to explore how frequently the users are utilizing these corporate services. They also looked at from which locations were these services used and how frequently. The authors also looked at the density of users from various locations, using IP ranges and IP addresses. 9.","research assistant amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, bangalore 560035, karnataka, india prof. shekar babu, phd amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, bangalore 560035,karnataka, india",

While the second is the formation of informal ties between farmworkers to help each other and find work outside the agricultural sector. The offer from the industry to buy land at a high price, causing most landowners to sell land as assets or capital in developing business and this condition makes the farm labourers are in a position of uncertainty about the livelihood resources they have. Logical consequences caused by the mindset of landowners have implications for the search for other jobs by farmworkers because of the limitations and uncertainty of land to try.","faculty of social and political sciences brawijaya university east java, indonesia sanggar.fisip@ub.ac.id, darsono_wisa@ub.ac.id, anif_ub.ac.id@ub.ic.id m chairul basrun umanailo postgraduate, department of sociology faculty of social and political sciences brawijaya university east java, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com",
241,Csr Communication Strategy In Indian Organizations Arun K.,"corporate social responsibility (csr), over the last few decades, has become a buzzword among organizations and its stakeholders. communicating csr has evolved from a unidirectional mode to a bi- directional mode, enabling companies build positive reputation with stakeholders – from design phase to implementation of any csr initiative. penal measures, as stipulated in the amendments to companies act 2013, make it imperative for businesses and academic experts to interpret csr reporting and communications in greater depth. every company chooses to implement csr in its own manner based on its size, the industry in which it operates, the inherent culture, the demands of its stakeholders and the company’s own history. this study examines the communication materials meant for consumption by the intended audience of csr communications (internal/external actors) along with official social media presence, csr communication modalities, including challenges and gaps in csr communication pertaining to indian organizations. qualitative data from one hundred indian companies across nine sectors are analyzed to see how these companies address csr reporting and communications in arriving at a framework for communicating csr initiatives.","csr communication, csr reporting","80 of 100 Indian companies directed their CSR communication to investors, not only from financial point of view, but also from an ethical standpoint.

242,Are Corporates Renouncing Shareholder Capitalism And  Moving Towards Stakeholder Capitalism?,"for more than four decades, corporates were operating using the principle of “maximizing shareholder value”. with this principle, their focus was on profits and share prices, regardless of the consequences to other stakeholders like community, customers, labor force, suppliers and others. the free-market ideology of “shareholder primacy” was a key driver in indian markets. in this paper, the researchers explore if indian corporates are replacing “shareholder capitalism” with “stakeholder capitalism” and are striking the balance between stakeholders in allocating the profits and capital of an organization towards the society. the researchers revisit the time-tested popular narratives of capitalism and the predominant stakeholder in these narratives. in order to promote responsible and sustainable businesses for current and future generations, the researchers believe that the fine balance among stakeholders is the true constant and this balance can be achieved through communication and the principle of stakeholder communication can be meaningful principle of stakeholder capitalism. the researchers through a systematic review of literature and elucidation of major narratives, map the stakeholders of indian corporates using annual reports and to confirm the resurgence of stakeholder capitalism.","stakeholder, capitalism","Following the Great Recession in 2008, a renewed interest in stakeholder capitalism was inevitable. Although socialism shaped the principal economic and social structure of India for nearly four decades after gaining independence, India moved towards a more market-based economy towards the end of twentieth century. Changes in organization staffing policies, creation of a lean workforce, spurt in entrepreneurial ventures are some of the factors causing realignment of stakeholders’ segments. Changes in consumption behavior, advances in technology has forced industrial sector to introspect who are their stakeholders. Freeman concedes that the six principles may not always be successful, as exceptions to the rules that there will always exist a small group which will pursue only their self- interest even at their expense. Growing exposure of frauds have revived the interest and need of stakeholder capitalism, especially creation of new sources of value through morals, relationships, teams, trust, honesty, and care which are essential for a sustainable organization. We offer the inclusion of seventh principle through Stakeholder Capitalism “The principle of stakeholder communication”. It draws attention to consistent and periodic disclosure of the current state of meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders such as customers, suppliers, communities, employees, and financiers. Transparency and communicating regularly to stakeholders can make the difference and offer the necessary checks and balances required to exercise prudent choices. We believe that we can do a better job in the course of making use of capital and ensuring stakeholder balance using the principle of stakeholder communication along with the other six principles.","arun k. department of commerce and management, amrita school of arts and sciences, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, amritapuri, india. arunkpillai@am.amrita.edu dr. shekar babu phd professor & founding head, department of management amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, bengaluru, india. sb@amrita.edu",

244,Measuring Supply Chain Complexity Based On Multicriteria Decision Approach,"this study identified twenty-two drivers that cause the complexity in supply chain. the level of such complexity is quantified by using hybrid ahp and gra method. a case company is studied in order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. the results from the case company were analyzed and it is seen that the level of supply chain complexity of the case company is 0.44, which is signifying that there is a considerable scope of improvement in terms of minimizing complexity in its supply chain. from the study outcomes, it is realized that the case company mainly needs substantial improvement on the issues of “government regulation,” “internal communication and information sharing,” and “company culture” in order to minimize the level of accompanied complexity in its supply chain.",,"This study identified the drivers of SC complexity and developed a quantitative model to measure the level of complexity created by these drivers on SC. The identification of the drivers was based on an extensive literature review. In order to measure the level of SC complexity, hybrid AHP and GREY method was used. From this hybrid method, numerous drivers were identified, which need to eliminate, or minimize to remove or reduce the complexity level in SC. In order To validate this hybrid method, it was applied to study on a multinational company. From the study, the SC complexity level of the case company was found 0.44, which indicates abundance room of improvement to minimize the level of complexity in the studied case company. The effectiveness of SC is defined based on various performance measures. In Future, this research can be extended to determine the effects of identified complexity drivers and their magnitude on various performance measures of SC such as cost, supplier responsiveness, and innovation.","sujan piya, mohammad khadem and mahmoud al kindi department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university, muscat, oman sujan@squ.edu.om; khadem@squ.edu.om; kindim@squ.edu.om ahm shamsuzzoha school of technology and innovations university of vaasa, vaasa, finland ahsh@uva.fi",

247,Need Identification For Csr Activities Through  Gramasabhas – A Kerala Model,"need identification is always a challenge for organizations in india, while planning csr activities. this is mainly due to geographical widespread of the country as well as language barriers. the need of the bottom line will be known to the regional leaders and other community development activists. this kind of need identification at bottom level is required not only for csr activities, but also for any government funded projects, which normally comes under the financial budgets of central and state governments. kerala, the southernmost part of india, has a proven method for dispersing such benefits to the society. in kerala, these needs were identified at each panchayats, through a process called “gramasabha”, where members from each household and the elected representatives along with government officials will come together for finding out the genuine beneficiaries, based on the fund allocation for that particular financial year. this system is followed for the last two decades and is found to be a successful model as there is not much ambiguities. at some points, there will be a gap between the allotted fund and the beneficiaries – that is – the government may not be able to fulfill the requirements and demands of the society and to satisfy the bottom line. this gap may be efficiently filled using csr funds. some real needy people may miss out to have their opportunity, while prioritizing the list of beneficiaries, by the panchayats. these ‘miss out’ list may be escalated and integrated at state level and may handed over to the corporates to plan and disburse their csr activities. thus, gramasabha can play a significant role in need identification for the organizations, across the country. the projects, which are funded by the government are mostly implemented through the self help groups (shgs), which is considered as a homogeneous and non-profit group, with a decentralized manner of functioning and having same socio-economic strata, which has its roots along the length and breadth of the state, even to the remotest rural areas. the group share their ideas and knowledge to achieve a common cause and they help the society by identifying their own problems as well as that of the fellow-people in the community. these shgs can also perform their part by providing feedbacks from the grassroot levels of the village and then passing on the information through proper channels; thus, supporting the government machinery in identifying the beneficiaries, which otherwise, might have unintentionally missed out by the officials and other elected representatives. ultimately, this can even cover-up the lethargically moving csr fund allocation process and convert it into ‘smart’ by implementing the csr projects as envisaged and budgeted by organizations during respective financial years itself.",need identification,,"arun k. department of commerce and management, amrita school of arts and sciences, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, amritapuri, india. arunkpillai@am.amrita.edu rajesh r. department of mechanical engineering, amrita school of engineering, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, amritapuri, india. rajeshraveendran@am.amrita.edu geena prasad department of mechanical engineering, amrita school of engineering, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, amritapuri, india. geena@am.amrita.edu",

251,Sustainable Development Practices In The South African  Construction Industry: A Review Of Related Literature,"sustainable development is a method, which endeavors to save an overwhelming parity state over the long haul. it requires the human, monetary and ecological worries to work together to guarantee 'unending life for mankind' in the all-inclusive regular framework. this expression talks about maintainability of human life by warily balancing social, financial and environmental assets in a persistently altering globe. this article reviews the practices of sustainable development in the south african construction industry. economical practices are likely to wind up executed if there are discernible welfares for example; cost investment funds or endeavors from its inability to act; like reputational harm and lack of market share. however, today the construction industry is facing the environmental issues. therefore, the construction industry needs to adjust and produce more sustainable homes to withstand destructive forces such as hurricanes and floods so as to avoid large swathes of upcoming populations losing their homes due to unexpected weather conditions. construction enterprises have been moving in new technologies in order to stave off environmental catastrophe to push forward the sustainable development.","economic, environmental, sustainability","The main focus of this article was to review on the practices of sustainable development in the South African construction industry. It therefore sought to broaden our perspectives that, South African construction industry is encountered with a number of threats, which expressively have an effect on its performance in sustainable housing construction. The unmet demand, due to incapacitation of the construction industry in provision of housing, is evident in the irregular emergence of shacks in cooperation with town and countryside communities in evolving nations. In order to obviate continual emergence of shack building, the South African government has legislated a sequence of housing rules over the years, many of which were announced to have influenced delivery of affordable housing significantly, though the houses built lack the tenet of sustainable development.The aim of sustainable development is to supply a bodily, communal and mental atmosphere in which the behavior of the people is amicably amended to improve the present and provide for the future. The considerations in this article have shown that awareness of sustainable construction is low in countless countries, situations that some authors ascribed to dearth of training and education on sustainable building design, dearth of pure conceptualization of sustainability, dearth of vibrant case for sustainability aids, and dearth of long-term perception on sustainability.","malingaka maoeng, e.i edoun, charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg malingakamaoeng@gmail.com, edounsen@hotmail.com, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","references of real estate developers for green buildings

252,Improving The System Failure Of Learner Management  Information System: The Case Of Service Seta,"learner management information system is very critical in the seta setting, however, past experience revealed that if it does not meet the expectations of the stakeholders, services seta will continue to deliver poor services to stakeholder. these poor services as a result will delay the processes because accreditation might not be granted on time for all relevant departments. accreditation will continue to take more months than the expected timeframe. the effect of the problem will delay the stakeholder’s in applying for discretionary grants, tenders, training of learner’s and getting the learner’s certificate. it is important to address the problem now in order for services seta to achieve and fulfil their mandate. this is a problem because the system unable to meet the mandate of minimizing the timeframe related to the process of accreditation. this study tries to find solutions to the system problems of the services seta learner management information system. the main objectives of this study is in the direction of examining in what way to improve the system failure of the learner management information system for accreditation of training providers. with the main objectives, the specific objectives are:","lmis, service seta, however","were drawn from the research study Without a digitized functional system for learners, Service Seta will not be able to fulfil orders or render its service to clients within agreed deadlines. Once a firm fail to honour its obligations to its clients, it runs the risk of tarnishing its image in the marketplace. In order to hedge the firm against such risks Service seta need to invest in latest learner information management technologies. These technologies ensure that client information are processed in real-time. Internationally most service provider’s activities are driven by advanced Information management systems. These systems are credited for delivering one of the world acclaimed data management systems. It is without doubt that the USA runs one the most sophisticated information management service system in the world. This make the USA model a good example to follow or emulate. In Africa, generally lack of technology is still a major factor and in order to grab market share from these resourced rivals such as the ones in USA etc., African-based service organisations need to embrace the digital revolution. The digitalization of the learner information management system in Africa is long overdue. The future of this sector lies in its ability to modernize its internal infrastructure as well as its ability to strengthen the skill sets of its champions. Recommendations It is recommended that Improved Learner management information system (ILMIS)be introduced, it is a software- based application that is used to manage, control and manipulate data processes, procedures in a way that deliver greater cost efficiencies to a service organisations. Africa as a whole can benefit a lot especially looking at how this system is utilized globally. Recommendations to Future research Some participants with intimate knowledge on the factors that can improve the system failure of Learner Management Information System in Service Seta failed to complete the questionnaire and the focus was also in Gauteng province.

253,Improving End Customers’ Satisfaction Trough Postponement  In The South Africa Automobile Supply Network,"despite limited research into postponement strategy in the supply chain as customer’s satisfaction enablers, there has been significant interest from the role players in adopting postponement strategy especially in the automotive industry. the digital age and the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution has change the business landscape substantially. customers are more demanding and their demands are growing exponentially with technological advancement and globalization. those changes has constrained business to compete over supply chain, which is the heart of many successful business strategic decision. as south africa desperately need economic growth to curb the high unemployment (30%). as a major contributor to the gdp and employing up to 457 000 (smith; 2019) people in south africa, increasing the current market share and ensuring customer retention and loyalty is crucial in achieving these objective. this paper explore how customers satisfaction can be enhance by using their input at the customers decoupling points, so that the customers perceived value of the products and services can be equal or greater than the expected value. a cross sectional quantitative research was conducted among south africa car owner, of which out of the two million registered owners, a random sample has chosen 484 respondents, which is slightly higher that the recommended size recommended by the slovin’s formula at 95% confidences level. it was hypothesized that more customer output in the supply chain service and product in the automobile increase customer satisfaction which hypothesis was accepted. more customer input trough the postponement strategy, at the customers decoupling point increases customers perceived value, leading to improve satisfaction. the main finding has shown that there is positive correlation all along between customers inputs trough the postponements strategy and customers satisfaction level, the association of the customers' input and the respondent genders was not significant and thus suggested that when correlating customers satisfaction and postponements strategy, the gender should not use as the mitigate variables. this study has found that postponements strategies in the automobiles supply chain in south african can be used as a main catalyser for services quality improvement, as more value gets added by customers inputs in the and the process leading to customers expectation been met, making them satisfied. the supply chain should thus grape the opportunity of the 4ir, the connectivity to establish better communications focusing on the end users, to grow the industry and achieved customers' satisfaction, retentions and loyalty. e-commerce is here to stay, and, everything can be purchased online; hence, globalization has removed the majority of trade barriers. the local market first, followed by the regional market as many south african neighbouring countries are still purchasing second hand and new vehicles from abroad and finally to their marketing to the continental level 1434",,"South Africa is still struggling with rising unemployment, the inequality that has been exacerbated and is going to be pressurized by the fourth industrial revolution, which impact can be adverse on the labour market that is already struggling to grow the economy. The primary purpose of this research was to design a framework for customer satisfaction using the postponement strategy. Service and operation excellence in the automobile supply chain of the country is one of the main catalysers of value add across the chain, customers retention and loyalty. Customer loyalty and retention should be trough satisfaction and not the lack of choice from the customer perspective. As the major contributor to the country economy, the South Africa automobile industry is at the centre of job creations and economic growth, thus addressing many social ills such as inequality, unemployment's, poverty and crime to name a few. It is therefore imperative to satisfy the customers to expect growth of the industry, which translates into job creation and economy growth and life improvement This study has found that postponements strategies in the automobiles supply chain in South African can be used as a main catalyser for services quality improvement, as more value gets added by customers inputs in the and the process leading to customers expectation been met, making them satisfied. Postponements strategies results in customers inputs in the process or product they acquire at the customer decoupling point, enhance values add perceptions of the clients on the supply chain At the dawn of the 4IR, taking into considerations its adverse impact on the untransformed current South Africa labour, the postponements strategies should be entranced in the supply chain strategy to achieve higher satisfaction and retention of its customers base and growth more customers base as it grows its industry. The supply chain should thus grape the opportunity of the 4IR, the connectivity to establish better communications focusing on the end users, to grow the industry and achieved customers' satisfaction, retentions and loyalty.

256,Determining The Impact Of Construction And Demolition  Waste Reduction Practices On Green Building Projects In,"waste reduction practices are applicable to virtually any construction and demolition project scenario. the goal is to divert materials from landfill disposal to the greatest extent practicable under any circumstances. there are two opinions about whether this is a realistic expectation under real world project conditions. one is that waste reduction processes cost money, and the other is that waste reduction saves money. as with any construction project, planning and project management will ultimately dictate whether the waste reduction is accomplished within the established cost, schedule, and quality parameters. considering the waste reduction cost to disposal variances, this study is aimed at determining the impact of construction and demolition waste reduction techniques employed in the various projects on construction sites so as to actualizing green building attainment. a well-structured 100 structured questionnaires were constructed and distributed, while a rational number of 78 data were collected. a mean-item score and standard deviation were used to identify the levels of impact and rank each waste reduction techniques accordingly. there are seven-7 categories of indicators of waste reduction or management called the “zero waste hierarchy 7.0” which were developed to carry out an impact analysis. furthermore, the impact analysis was used to determine how waste reduction practices could impact green building projects in gauteng, south africa. in the findings, the categories of waste reduction indicators used to indicate that avoidance of complex design and detailing, developing resilient secondary material recovery, and optimizing the waste management system is one of the greatest waste reduction techniques that have a huge impact on green building projects delivery in gauteng, south africa. thus, an understanding of the waste reduction system implemented, response to waste management policy, and ultimate evaluation of the performance of the construction industry in utilizing waste reduction techniques on-site is discovered. also, the challenges or obstacles to the utilization of waste reduction techniques are identified. also, with the knowledge of the waste reduction techniques practiced in gauteng province, this study makes known the optimality of these waste reduction techniques with potentially huge environmental benefits that could be obtained in using them. this indicates whether the waste reduction techniques are an optimal option and as such highlighted how it can impact green building projects delivery for achieving a balance in the economic, social and environmental impacts of development in south africa. moreover, the need for africa developing countries to shift from the usual culture of landfilling to more sustainable waste reduction techniques is endorsed.","green building, impact analysis, waste reduction","and Recommendations In South Africa, green building is considered the highest eco-friendly practices which can eliminate waste and the government encouraged every stakeholder in the construction industry embraces the culture. The waste reduction techniques indicators used can as well be a performance evaluation tool for determine how optimal the waste management system is and as well be able to identify possible future area where an improvement might be considered. Also, with the knowledge of waste reduction techniques practiced, the optimality of these waste reduction techniques with potentially huge environmental benefits that could be obtained in using them is identified in this study. From the results, every indication point to the facts that the waste reduction techniques practiced is an optimal option and as such can impact green building projects delivery for achieving a balance in the economic, social and environmental impacts of development in South Africa. Moreover, there is a need for other Africa developing country to shift from the usual culture of landfilling to more sustainable waste reduction techniques some which is identified in this study. In conclusion, the other waste reduction techniques should not be ignored as its highly dynamic and as well has a great impact on green building projects. Therefore, further studies should consider optimizing waste reduction techniques on construction sites to assist decision and policy makers on the best way to manage waste on sites. 6.

259,"Improving Parcel Sorting System By Utilizing Ocr, Asr,  And Robot Arm","in this project paper, the authors are going to utilize and use the knowledge, techniques, and skills of the industrial engineering department courses that can be applied to design and implement an automated parcel sorting system that utilizes ocr (optical characteristic recognition), asr (automatic speech recognition), and robot arm. the authors are aiming to improve the productivity and the efficiency of the sorting process and provide an economic and ergonomic system. also, the authors are going to improve the recognition accuracy since the ocr work very well with flat objects, but the performance decreases and the error rate increases with the parcels (due to curvature). the authors are going to combine between the ocr and the asr to improve the accuracy. in addition, in order to reduce the high cost of manual workers the authors are going to utilize a robot arm, which is faster, efficient, and functional. key words: automatic mail sorting, postal automation, optical character recognition, automatic speech recognition, robot arm. 1. introduction nowadays, e-commerce has become widely used and the orders from the e-commerce increase in every day in proportion to its popularity. moreover, because of the increase of the orders, the sorting of the parcels become such a hard process especially at the annual events when the orders multiply such as the pilgrim day and eid's events. in addition, as the manual way in sorting the parcels has a high error rate, low productivity, low performance rate and uncomfortable for the worker. for example, according to saudi post four workers sort 200 parcels in one hour. the authors are going to design and implement an automated parcel sorting system that will replace the manual parcel sorting system in order to increase the productivity, performance rate, decrease the error rate and increase comfortability. this system can be classified as an artificial intelligence system by utilizing ocr, asr, and robot arm. the system the authors proposing start with the ocr process. the ocr will take a photo for the label address in the parcel. if the input of the ocr is recognized, the robot arm will deliver the parcel to the destination shelf. if the input from the ocr is not recognized, the robot arm will deliver the parcel to the error shelf. the system will keep working and all the parcels that are not recognized will be hold in the error shelf. as it is shown in the figure. 2141",,"In this project paper, the authors has described clearly the importance of automatic sorting process. It is more productive, ergonomic and functional than the manual sorting. Also, the authors has represented a multimodal system for an automated parcel sorting system which includes OCR, ASR, and Robot Arm. In addition, the Authors has done some experiments related to processing time and error rate for ASR and OCR in order to find statistical data using Minitab software. Also the authors used Arena software to simulate the system for eight hours since the experiments is done while having a lack of resources. 2149","abdulrahman alharbi, hasan ahmad, mohammed alnazawi, othman sonbol industrial engineering department taibah university, main university, saudi arabia a.ayash.alharbi@gmail.com, ih2sn1997@gmail.com, malnazawi1@gmail.com, eng.othman1418@gmail.com","References

265,Modeling And Simulation Of Transmission Dynamics Of  Chronic Liver Cirrhosis,"cirrhosis of liver has become life-threatening for the human being all over the world. it is the result of long-term continuous damages of the liver. in this paper, we have developed a compartmental model of liver cirrhosis to study the dynamics behavior of this chronic disease. we have formulated the model in terms of a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (odes), based on the characteristics of disease transmission. the aim of this study is to take a close look at the transmission dynamics of liver cirrhosis. the model is developed with the focus on the concentration of the basic reproduction number and related stability analysis for the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. finally, numerical simulations have been performed to illustrate the disease behavior. our analysis reveals that infected and liver cirrhotic individuals continue to grow up and the recovered individuals start to decrease as the disease transmission rate and acute infection rate increase. as a result, the disease becomes progressive.","cirrhosis, viral infections","Liver cirrhosis is a major cause of illness and death worldwide. It affects millions of patients all over the world. Liver cirrhosis occurs throughout the world irrespective of age, sex, region and race. It is time to get rid of this fatal disease. Investigating the model (1), we have noticed that when the disease related terms i.e. disease transmission rate and acute infection rate increase then the infected individuals and liver cirrhotic individuals continue to grow up and the recovered individuals start to decrease. So, disease progression can be possible to reduce only if the disease transmission rate and acute infection rate can be controlled. We can conclude that the global human life is still under threat due to the chronic disease liver cirrhosis. Liver cirrhosis is a disease characterized by the long-term continuous damages of the liver. These damages may be occurred by the progression of viral diseases (hepatitis B and hepatitis C) and other liver diseases which have a development period within the liver of the body. So that early detection of these diseases has a positive impact on the reduction of liver cirrhosis transmission. But after the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, we should provide treatment to the infected individuals according to the underlying causes from which liver cirrhosis has been developed so that they can relieve from the disease. Since cirrhosis is not curable, the aims of treatment are to slow the progression of scar tissue (which called fibrosis) in the liver and also to prevent symptoms and complications of it. Moreover in the early stage of cirrhosis, it may be possible to minimize damage to the liver by treating the underlying cause. So it is time to take proper steps to make sure of the optimal combination of vaccination and treatment among the individuals to prevent hepatitis B infection and to reduce the liver cirrhosis incidence.

The full factorial design was used and found to be valid via testing data normality and equal variance. Then the results showed that all four factors and the two-way interactions were significant. The insignificants were the three- and four-way interactions. The model equation has been refined by taken out the insignificant factors and interactions. It was found that the R-Squared is high with value of 94.93% which means that our model is valid. After that, the response optimizer tool via Minitab was used to determine the optimal factors combination to obtain our target-quality concrete mixture. A high-quality concrete mixture with a compression strength of 35 MPa can be attained when using 50% replacement of recycled aggregate, 100% replacement of dune sand and only 1.5 % inclusion of steel fiber, then keeping the mixture to gain full strength for 28 days. After that, The Taguchi method was used to determine the main effects of factors. The results of both methods were the same except for the percentage of dune sand. In the full factorial method, when combining both types of sand, the compressive strength of concrete increased. In contrast, Taguchi showed opposites results. 1447","ziout, a., jaber abu qudeiri , mohammed alajouz, osama bassam, hana abusabiekeh department of mechanical engineering united arab emirates university alain, abudhabi, uae ziout@uaeu.ac.ae","References

274,Demand Driven Approach To Combat Nervousness Of Auto  Supply Chain In India,"indian automotive market is heading for one of the lowest sales over the last eight years. entire industry is in the state of confusion due to various factors like bs1v to bsv1 migration, electric vehicle, gdp decline, nbfc crisis and this led to overall negative consumer sentiment. globally retail numbers are reported by government agencies, however in india retail numbers are neither reported nor considered for sales and operations planning. there is urgency and necessity to incorporate retail numbers for planning for auto manufacturers in india. there are 3p’s of demand sensing and shaping which are position, protect and pull. this paper emphasises on theoretical framework for application of 3p’s which includes strategic inventory positioning, strategic buffers & its adjustment and real demand-based planning and execution. strategic inventory positioning helps to identify and position decoupling points to protect and promote the flow of relevant information and material. proposed framework of 3p’s will help to mitigate nervousness, supply continuity variability and bullwhip effect. this means current situation of overproduction, overstocking and lack of adequate working capital for india auto industry can be tackled.","demand sensing, decoupling points, buffer levels","Considering the current sluggish market condition and future potential for auto sector in India, 3P approach may be very beneficial to optimize cost and service levels across the supply chain among all stakeholders. This concept has been deployed in other industries across the globe and it has brought significant improvements in inventory turns and service levels. To gain agility, changes in demand and supply signals need to be timely propagated across the value network where sales channels have the visibility to the upstream supply signals and at the same time suppliers have visibility into downstream demand signals. As explained in the beginning of this paper that industry captains are emphasising on the need to consider retail sales numbers for the planning, this approach may be considered as the enabler for the same. 1454","aman sinha research scholar department of commerce and management savitribai phule pune university, pune (india) amansinha79@gmail.com satish s ubale director, matrix school of management, savitribai phule pune university, pune (india) satishubale@yahoo.com","References:

275,Lean Thinking And Workplace Safety: Insights From Two  Improvement Projects,"this article discusses the relationship between workplace safety and production management systems while analysing the empirical application of the lean thinking approach. in particular, this paper aims to determine whether the application of lean practices has beneficial effects not only on production efficiency but also on the health and safety of workers. the analysis is divided into two main stages: first, a review of the relevant literature was developed, followed by a case study analysis in an italian metal casting company describing two continuous improvement projects from a workplace safety point of view. both continuous improvement projects pursued the reduction of production interruptions and the elimination of defects, respectively. research findings indicate health and safety conditions improvements after the implementation and application of various lean practices, especially by reducing risk exposure in the first project and improving the level of ergonomics in the second. this paper is of great interest for both researchers and practitioners since it suggests various possible relationships between the continuous improvement approach, provided by a practical application of the lean philosophy, and the improvement of workplace safety while fostering production efficiency.","lean production, workplace safety, human resources, practices, ergonomics. 2210",". This paper is particularly interesting since the implementation of a lean improvement project has enabled the transition from a traditional lubrication method to a minimal lubrication method, and it has allowed an improvement of the 4% of the global efficiency index (OEE) with a payback of investment of four months. Additionally, the analysis carried in the second improvement project with a lean perspective of the post-painting defects has led to a complete redefinition of the workstation with a focus on maximizing the value-added activities carried out by the operator. More specifically, the root causes analyses have permitted the introduction of simple but effective modifications, and the participation of workers has enabled the balance of the workload between the different control stations operating at the same line. Thus, both lean applications have led to remarkable benefits regarding the risk exposure and ergonomics of the workers involved. An analysis of this scale requires an in-depth knowledge of both lean thinking and safety in the workplace, understood as requirements and risk assessment techniques. This study encountered a limitation since already completed projects were used, making it difficult in some situations to obtain information with a very high degree of accuracy. Hence, a future research direction could be the follow-up of a lean improvement project to understand its effects on the level of security for employees before, during and after its implementation. Moreover, it should be considered that the whole analysis was limited to the manufacturing sector. Therefore, there are several research opportunities in other areas, such as construction, healthcare, etc. that could be reviewed according to their specific regulatory requirements. In other words, lean manufacturing offers a range of practices and tools that need to be used in the right way and at the right time; the balance in the use of these tools is not established a priori but should be determined on a case-by- case basis depending on the company’s vision and specific characteristics. In contrast, the application of these instruments without having grasped the lean philosophy and without adapting them to each case will hardly allow the achievement of effective results.","marcos dieste department of management and engineering university of padova stradella san nicola 3, 36100, vicenza, italy marcos.diestegracia@phd.unipd.it alessandro baseggio department of industrial engineering university of padova via venezia 1, 35131, padova, italy alessandro.baseggio@studenti.unipd.it roberto panizzolo and stefano biazzo department of management and engineering university of padova stradella san nicola 3, 36100, vicenza, italy roberto.panizzolo@unipd.it, stefano.biazzo@unipd.it",

277,Event Of Crime Against Property: Robbery & Theft  Prediction Using Probabilistic Graphical Model,"this study analyzed the occurrence of robbery and theft in the city of manila using discrete bayesian network model. using a 5-year data of robbery and theft in the city of manila (with conviction), the results showed that february and july emerged as the months with highest probability of crime happening at 10.66 percent and lowest on april with 6.80 percent. in terms of crime happening on a week, the highest probability occurred on the 2nd week with 28.3 percent and lowest on the 5th week at 6.8 percent. most of the crimes happened between 3pm to 6pm with 17 percent and lowest occurrence between 6am to 9am at 7.0 percent. male population are more likely to be a victim of crime in almost all of the identified locations except for pandacan where female population has a higher probability at 53 percent. with these information, a patrol priority location table was developed to show the location where the crime is more likely to happen in a particular time range of the day. this information can help the philippine national police in the police resource deployment.",,"Given the assumptions on PNP operations regarding static patrolling and on-demand police resource deployment; this study would be relevant to optimize patrolling routes within Manila and enable pre-emptive police response on crimes (robbery/theft). The proposed model can be updated with concurrent conditional probability distributions of its factors to ensure relevance. This proof-of-concept may be operationalized to be evaluated, calibrated, and secure timely updating of CPDs; it is always better to have more quality data to be confident on a Bayesian network inference. The data that was used for the Bayesian network are crime records for robbery & theft with conviction; this provided enough information to generate inference. This study could be a benchmark on queries that would involve not only crime records with conviction, but also with reported crimes that did not make it until conviction due to some legal or moral (or other) factors. Some crimes are not filed by victims, some are arranged by the offender with the victim before formal crime report, and some are just false report, etc. More sophisticated Bayesian network are expected to handle different cases given the right data for representation, inferring, and learning. Data strategies should be implemented on future studies or operationalization, especially on what periods should be covered/considered for factor’s CPDs; we may consider monthly, quarterly, or yearly data coverage for CPDs. As stipulated from Crime Pattern Theory, crimes do not occur randomly but rather with pattern, it may relate geographically, socially, etc. (Bratingham, 2013). This study was able to infer a robbery and/or theft happening within Manila (location) given time; the model was able to infer a weekly pattern for robbery and/or theft incident . For future studies, if given more (quality) data, the researchers may be able to model crime (not limited to robbery & theft) incident with more factors. The researchers may be able to infer unusual crime pattern (geographic, social, etc.), and infer seasonality, trend, etc. It would be interesting to pin down a syndicate (or other offenders) using a Bayesian network as part of PNP intelligence tool.","rex aurelius c. robielos school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines racrobielos@mapua.edu.ph nico duran school of information technology mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines nlduran@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",
278,Experimental Investigation And Thermal Analysis Of  Heat Affected Zone Of Stainless Steel (Ss304),"rotary friction welding is widely used as a solid state welding method for joining of similar or dissimilar metals. it is an advanced joining technique that generates frictional heat and material goes under plastic deformation at the welding location, thereby affecting the formation of a joint while the material is in solid state. after heat generation phase an additional forging force is applied which completes coalescence. since no melting of material occurs during friction welding, but metal gets deform after heat generation at welding zone. the principal advantages of frictional welding, low distortion, absence of melt-related defects and high joint strength. in this paper the study has been carried out by using the friction welding process on all geared lathe machine. the material selected for study and experimentation of rfw is stainless steel ss 304 and specimen dia. ϕ 8 mm and ϕ 10 mm. the various parameters studied for the process is rpm, weld time, temperature, pressure, heat affected zone etc., the 2d modeling and steady state transient thermal analysis has been carried out for the selected specimen.","thermal analysis, tensile test, hardness","This work concerns the rotary friction welding of stainless steel SS 304, specimen dia. ϕ 8 mm and ϕ 10 mm. The various parameters studied for the process is rpm, weld time, temperature, pressure, heat affected zone, and the 2D modeling and steady state transient thermal analysis has been carried out for the selected specimen. This experimental work showed that this steel was successfully welded by rotary friction welding process. According to tensile test result analysis that the tensile strength for specimen of ϕ8 mm is 271.67 MPa and the strain obtained is 6.9 %. And for specimen of ϕ10 mm is 292.361 MPa and the strain obtained is 6.6 % respectively. It has been observed that if the diameter increases tensile strength also increases. From the experimentation it has been observed that as the rotational speed increases the tensile strength increases. According to thermal analysis the stresses generated because of temperature distribution along weld specimen. The micro-structure analysis is done for metallurgical phase which are generated at welded joint. From the micro-structure study it has been observed that after heating for ϕ8 mm coarse austenitic grains are formed and for ϕ10 mm fine grains are formed. After cooling for ϕ8 mm coarse martensitic grains are formed and for ϕ10 mm tempered martensitic grains are formed. By taking the cross section of specimen it has been observed that actual heat affected zone (HAZ) for ϕ8 mm & ϕ10 mm is not more than 30 mm. According to thermal analysis stresses generated because of temperature distribution along weld specimen. This is measured analytically and validated with the experimental temperatures. The experimental rotary friction welding set-up was found to be successful for the production of friction welds. The rotational speed of the job has been found to be an influential parameter for the friction welding process, which has been optimized for the process based on the results of the study. The mechanical properties of the friction welds were found to vary with the applied axial pressure.","using rfw process prof. vaibhav v.kulkarni1, asst. prof.(workshop), mitwpu, kothrud, pune. pursuing phd.

281,Improving Auditing System In Pre-Primary And Primary  Education: An Information System Integration Approach,the rapid evolution of technology resulted to the increase in dependability of the users to it. everything is becoming automated which are designed to make our lives easier and more convenient. the integration of automated information systems to an organization improves the quality of work and decreases the room for error that paves way to delays or any unnecessary processes which disrupts the flow of the operations. the objectives of the study are (1) to assess the information technology and auditing related information system of the school and (2) to recommend an implementation framework and auditing information system. the school was experiencing a bottleneck in terms of their inaccuracy of data and poor recording of accounts. the researchers improved the auditing process by designing a data flow diagram (dfd) which illustrates the flow of the enhanced system when automated. the automated system was developed to maximize the accuracy of recording data and provide convenience to the personnel in charge of auditing the data.,,"This study aims to assess the current auditing process of the private pre-primary and primary school in Antipolo, Rizal, Philippine. Another objective is to construct an improved auditing process through the use of information system. Through the conducted interviews and assessment of the current system, the researchers identified the key issues of the current auditing system of the school. The school has poor recording policy and procedure which results to misplacement of records and clerical errors. Additionally, the auditing activity of the school is done manually which also invites possible inaccuracy of data. With this, the researchers devised two (2) alternative solutions for each root cause to improve the auditing system of the school. Based from the cost analysis conducted by the researchers, the best alternative to solve the poor recording procedure is to retrain the current cashier and auditor with the improved recording procedure. This generated a much lower cost than hiring additional cashier. On the other hand, the best alternative to solve the problem of manual auditing is to develop an in-house accounting system for the school. This alternative is cheaper and more practical than incurring extremely high cost of purchasing expensive software. With this, the researchers created an improved auditing process which eliminates the delay in the submission of reports to the auditor. Additionally, the researchers created a data flow diagram of an automated auditing system that can handle the recording of expenses and other transactions of the school. With this, financial data can be easily stored and retrieved upon request. Also, this eliminates the chances of clerical errors in the process. This study can be further improved by extending the scope of the research.

292,Life Cycle Assessment On A 500 Mw Oil-Fired Power Plant  In Sudan,"in this study, the methodology of life cycle assessment was used to assess the environmental impacts of a 500mw oil-fired power plant in sudan. ecoinvent database along with primary data obtained from the sudanese thermal power generating company ltd (stpgc) were utilized. life cycle analysis was conducted with the aid of openlca software and the recipe method was employed. results revealed that the environmental impact is dominated by climate change with a value of 1.07992 kg 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2-eq followed by the fossil fuel depletion category, which is equal to 0.39320 kg oil-eq. furthermore, the third most pronounced category is human toxicity with a value of 0.08983 kg 1,4-dcb-eq followed by ionizing radiation category with a value of 0.07341 kg u235-eq. additionally, in regard to the endpoint level, it was found that 46% of the overall life cycle impact damages the resources , 36% affects human health and 18% contributes to ecosystem quality damage. moreover, the operation phase and oil upstream processes were found to be the most burdensome on the environment. finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the primary influential factors on environmental impacts, it was evidently clear that plant efficiency is the most dominant parameter affecting the results.","life cycle, oil-fired, power plant","In conclusion, the environmental impact was evaluated, for the midpoint level, by four major impact categories namely, climate change, fossil fuel depilation category, human toxicity, ionizing radiation. In regard to the endpoint level, it can be concluded that 46% of the overall life cycle impact damages the resources and 36% of the overall impact affects human health and the remaining 18% contributes to ecosystem quality damage. Furthermore, major impactful processes on the environment encompassed by the system boundary were identified. The operation phase and oil upstream processes account together for more than 80% of the impact in each midpoint impact category. Therefore, these processes are considered to be the most burdensome on the environment and further attention should be directed towards them for the purpose of enhancing the environmental profile of the power plant. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the primary influential factors on environmental impacts that could be addressed to mitigate adverse environmental effects, it was found that plant efficiency is the most dominant parameter that yields a significant influence on the life cycle assessment findings compared to the remaining parameters. Consequently, corrective measures should be taken to boost the efficiency of the plant to considerably diminish the environmental impacts caused by the power plant life cycle.

293,Institutional Factors In Public Sector Reform:  A Theoretical Analysis,"there is a tendency for administrative reform in developing countries experiencing has limitations or even failure. the reason is not to consider the institutional factors in carrying out administrative reforms both formal and informal institutional factors. as a result, the results of the reform are not in accordance with the situation and condition of the community and the surrounding environment. for this reason, it is necessary to include institutional factors in every reform agenda undertaken by the government. the aims of these articles are to provide description and analysis that reinforces the importance of institutional factors both formal and informal in the context of administrative reform in a country. the analysis in this article uses a qualitative descriptive method with library research technique. the articles for the analyzed are international journals with the theme of institutional factors in the context of reform in various countries. the results of this analysis are illustrate that actually related to institutional factors in the context of administrative reform, this has been widely applied in several countries. from the results of this analysis also explains that an administrative reform tends to fail if they do not consider the institutional factors formal and informal. whereas for governments or countries that consider formal or informal institutional factors in any administrative reform tend to be successful.",developments,"After seeing the results of the analysis of the articles/journals of the research results above, it can be concluded several conclusions, the first; It is important to consider and include institutional factors as variables that have influence in the context of public sector reform. The second, these institutional factors can be formal and informal institutional factors that exist within and outside public sector organizations. The third, more important thing is that these variables of institutional factors determine the success of a public sector reform agenda that undertaken. The ability to define and understand institutional factors will be very helpful in arranging and scheduling public sector reforms that are appropriate to the circumstances surrounding the environment so that there is no rejection or failure. 2494","malse yulivestra doctoral program of administrative science faculty of administrative science universitas brawijaya malang indonesia malse_yulivestra@yahoo.com soesilo zauhar, andy fefta wijaya, firda hidayati public administration department faculty of administrative science universitas brawijaya malang, indonesia soesilozfia@ub.ac.id, andyfefta@ub.ac.id, firda_fia@ub.ac.id","References

294,The Energy In The Context Of Social  M Chairul Basrun Umanailo,"kalesang desa is a community development program carried out by the buru regency government in the context of community welfare. this paper aims to explain the function of kalesang desa which is carried out as an effort to develop the community and to map the potential of social energy contained in the implementation of kalesang desa. the results of the study show that the kalesang desa program as a development effort is able to become a medium for raising of social energy where locality, kinship and local leadership are positive signals of community development. the elements for the development of social energy are very strong because they are supported by the order of local values in the form of kinship, cultural values and local leadership owned by the community in buru regency. thus, very interesting from this study is the existence of synchronization between the implementation of kalesang desa with the potential of social energy which drives the dynamics of rural community development.","kalesang, village, community, buru",". Community empowerment is a series of systematic actions and involves various components of formal and informal organizations. Kelsang Desa as an initiative to build a village is a movement to gather the strengths and abilities of the community and their environment. Social energy in rural areas whose existence is part of the inherent of village community life has a strategic potential in driving the empowerment of rural communities. This energy is in the form of a solid blend of all potential elements of society, ranging from groups of educators, entrepreneurs, farmers, students, religious leaders, traditional leaders; which are all available in people's lives. The elements of Kalesang Desa, if compiled, consolidated, and utilized will produce social energy that can be utilized for the benefit of rural community development. Thus, it can be said that in the implementation of the Kalesang Desa there is the potential to develop social energy within the community in Buru district.","department of agricultural and forestry university of iqra buru namlea, 97571, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com",

The morpheme consists of inflectional adjective morpheme and derivational adjective morpheme. In addition to the morphological features, there are also syntactic and semantic characteristics to mark the class of adjectives in Sula Dalek falahu. This is important because not all words can be identified by certain morphological features that can distinguish absolutely identifiers from other word classes. When viewed in terms of morphology, adjectives consist of basic adjectives and formed adjectives. Basic adjectives and adjectives are formed in the Sula language falahu dialect. As for suggestions in research to foster and preserve the Sula Falahu dialect, it is necessary to conduct more specialized research on other aspects so that Sula language is not threatened with extinction.

This is a certainty given the need to provide the best service and achieve the maximum goals is a condition that cannot be avoided by local governments. On the other hand, the latest and globalized information and communication technology advancements require local governments to participate actively and progressively follow these developments. Integrating the idea of digitalization in local government requires the diffusion of existing institutional pillars, norms, regulations and cultural-cognitive. This is an absolute requirement so that the integration of digital technology in the administration of government does not run slowly. In order for this integration to be able to give birth to institutional changes that function optimally, efforts are needed to institutionalize these pillars, so that the role of institutional pillars can usher in institutional changes in local government bureaucracy through communication technology as a carrier of institutional change.","harsya harun doctoral program of administrative science faculty of administrative science universitas brawijaya malang, indonesia harsya_h@yahoo.co.id bambang supriyono, bambang santoso haryono, endah setyowati public administration departement faculty of administrative science universitas brawijaya malang, indonesia bambangsupriyono@ub.ac.id, bambangsfia@ub.ac.id, endah_s_fia@ub.ac.id",
297,Development Of Science And Technology  Towards The Formation Of Participatory Spaces,"the study of the development of science and technology cannot stand alone as a mere knowledge, the link between the development of science and technology has an impact on the formation of participatory space which is generally understood as a space for discussion or where individuals meet with their environment. this study explores and repositioned participatory spaces that are in ideal conditions and shifts into an illusion of reality and is able to shift participatory space that is material to the form of networked space that is directly related to the use of technology. the greater participation of the buru regency community in communicating on social media certainly can shape public sensitivity (sense of public). so that the community can monitor inequality and misappropriation which becomes bad behaviour and public services. the critical attitude of the citizens who are built in the alternative public space (in this case social media), is expected to encourage participation to jointly develop civil society. where social and civilization systems are built based on moral principles that guarantee a balance between individual freedom and collective stability.","science, technology, space, participatory","So the essence of digital democracy in the public sphere, the Internet brings in the convergence of text, audio and visuals in public dialogue in the public space of the Buru Regency community and increases lateral, interactive and discursive communication. This public space can be said to be a democratic space in building interactions and can also filter out a variety of opposing and supportive views. The people of Buru Regency must also be prepared to face the logical consequences of differences in opinion and analysis. Primordials should no longer emerge which will make the public space of Buru Regency people become the boundaries of the area of origin and interests and the regional government must continue to strive for the growth and development of public awareness to use public space as a means of exchanging information, learning and actualizing.","m chairul basrun umanailo department of agricultural and forestry university of iqra buru namlea, 97571, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com",
298,Case Study Using Multicriteria Analysis Methods In Project  Selection,"there are several models of multicriteria analysis methods, but there is no common agreement on the most effective method for project selection (archer & ghasemzadeh, 2004). in this article, we will present a case study for the selection of projects using two families of multicriteria analysis methods namely the methods of upgrading electre ii and i and utility methods, and then give a comparative summary of the two categories. through this case study, we note that the results obtained are different depending on the method used and the intended purpose, and the choice between a method close to the utility theory (maut) and outranking method must be made according to the advantages and limitations of these categories of multicriteria analysis methods (mam).","electre, maut","on MAUT methods We note that the results obtained are different depending on the method used and the intended purpose. Although the MAUT approach highlights a wide variety of easily comparable numerical solutions and uses fairly simple computational methods, it is still complex for the decision-maker to visualize what utility is associated with. performance given on each criterion and give a total pre-order. In addition, it is a totally compensatory method, that 2637","houda tahri and omar drissi kaitouni imosys, engineering, management and optimization of systems mohammadia school of engineers avenue ibn sina b.p. 765 agdal rabat, morocco htahri@gmail.com, drissi@emi.ac.ma","references

5. Conclusion: 
All multi-criteria decision support methods have the advantage of being able to make a decision based on multiple 
criteria and not on the basis of a single criterion (profit for example). Beyond this observation, the results obtained are 
different from one method to another. 
Thus, the choice between Utility Theory (MAUT) and outranking method must be done according to the advantages 
and limitations of these broad categories of multicriteria analysis methods (MAM). Indeed, MAUT has the advantage 
of being easier to use but its compensatory character makes the interpretation of the results difficult. Unlike the 
ELECTRE method, which is more difficult to apply, but it helps to inform the decision-maker about his choice 
between the actions or projects to be kept and those to be eliminated but doesn’t solve the problem of decision-making 
itself.  
This is why the use of other methods is still necessary to complete the decision-making process. For example, the 
AHP (Analytic hierarchy process) which allows to hierarchically structure a complex, multi-criteria, multi-person and 
multi-period problem. This method is used for decision making in complex situations where human perception, 
judgments, and consequences have long-term implications (Bhushan and Rai, 2004). Thus, the combination of several 
methods remains possible.

300,Sustainable Approach For The Production Of Biodiesel From  Waste Cooking Oil Using Static Mixer Technology,"this paper aims at designing a large scale plant for the production of biodiesel using 150,000 ton/yr of waste cooking oil produced from various hotels, fast food restaurants, and domestic areas in the uae. the transestrification reaction considered takes place at 60 oc, 400 kpa, methanol/oil mole ratio of 6:1, 1wt% koh and is carried in four parallel pfr each having an arrangement similar to shell and tube heat exchanger (1 shell and 2 passes & 200 tubes per pass) with static mixing elements inserted in each tube to achieve enhanced mixing even under laminar flow conditions. a detailed equipment design for the proposed flowsheet used for this process, its economic feasibility and profitability analysis is thoroughly done. the profit from biodiesel production along with glycerol as a byproduct is found to be $142,877,092 for a ten year project life. using 5% tax rate for uae, the discounted profitability analysis showed a payback period of 6 years and with a rate of return of 39%.","biodiesel synthesis, sustainability, static mixers, feasibility, used cooking oil","Data from various literature reviews were used for performing HMB, sizing, cost estimations, and profitability analysis. The results showed that the transestrification reaction in an optimum condition can produce annually 143,130 ton/yr of biodiesel from a feedstock of 150,000 ton/yr of WPO. Along with high conversion, due to the utilization of static mixers in PFR instead of the conventional CSTR, the process efficiency is higher because of better mixing of the reactants and less energy consumption as there is no agitation system. Considering 10-year plant with 2 years of construction and 5% tax rate for UAE, the economic analysis showed promising outcomes. The undiscounted and discounted analysis main results are PBP of 1.5 year with ROROI of 51% and PBP of 1.5 year with ROROI of 51% respectively.

By using the proposed treatment plant both environmental and waste minimization problems were addressed. Reusing produced water in petroleum refinery was identified as the best means to manage produced water. An economical study was conducted on the process plant focusing on capital cost and manufacturing cost. Overall recovery of the treatment plant was found to be 75.9% of feed produced water that could be sent to cooling tower unit. The treatment capacity of the plant is 1500 m3 hr of produced water in 15 to 16 hours. The treatment plant required 2 storage tanks, 1 sand filter, 1 activated carbon filter, 9 centrifugal pumps, 1 reciprocating pump, 6 EDR stacks and 200 RO modules. Recovery ratio for EDR stacks were 94% with recycle and 84% for RO unit.

304,Surrogate-Based Process Optimization: A Case Study On  Simple Natural Gas Processing Plant,"natural gas is a vital component of the world's energy supply. therefore, optimizing natural gas processes is important to facilitate more efficient and less costly operations. optimization which relies exclusively on simulation is impractical, due to the enormous computational cost of complex simulations. alternatively, surrogate models can be constructed from and used in lieu of actual simulation models. the proposed work aims to develop a black-box surrogate-based optimization model that represents the natural gas treatment process which consist of separation, sweetening and dehydration units. a combination of simulation, experimental design, data analytics and mathematical programming was utilized. the problem size was reduced by using a regression model of the system’s behavior. the regression model was based on the simulation and experimental design. this simplified model was then used in a mathematical programming model minimizing a cost function. the methodology is suitable for synthesis of large- scale complex problems with fewer degrees of freedom. linear regression along with polynomial feature transformation machine learning methods were used to generate the surrogate model. a case study was developed to investigate the impact of increasing h2s composition in the feed gas. it was observed that the feed pressure had the highest influence among the parameters. 1. introduction the design and operation of natural gas processing facilities tailored for the production of various natural gas derivatives and pretreatment is considered to be one of the fundamental problems in chemical and process systems engineering. however, planning and superstructure-based mathematical models of any chemical process involve many complex unit equation blocks which can be solved using conversion law or physicochemical engineering fundamentals and available simulation software (henao and maravelias, 2011) . despite the significant developments in realistic unit operation models (i.e. the kind of models featured in commercial process simulators considering non-ideal thermodynamics, kinetics, and transport properties calculations and the availability of commercial process simulators (gani et al. 2012) (e.g. aspen, hysys, promax, gproms), however, these models cannot be used for within optimization operations (e.g. supply chain management and planning models) due to computational expenses. data- driven surrogate modelling can be defined as a black-box modelling approach that can utilize available data (e.g. could be collected from commercial software), that can relate relevant inputs to relevant outputs to describe process operations. such models have been used in the industry and the literature to describe processes by replacing existing expensive models (serve as surrogates to reduce model complexity) and correlations which have not yet been theoretically explained (li et al. 2016). for example, jin and et al. in 2000 investigated the advantages and disadvantages of four metamodeling. in 2002, hetzel replaced some the detailed unit models equality constraints with surrogate models and results showed that the computation time for the refinery-wide optimization with surrogate replacement was reduced by one order of magnitude. henao and maravelias integrated surrogate models built from data generated via commercial process simulators into optimization superstructure-based framework. another recent study (li et al. 2016). developed a data-driven optimization framework for the production of refinery-petrochemical complex where product yields and properties of a petrochemical complex were predicted based on the abundant data. 1485",,,"falah alhameli1, mohammed alkatheri1, ali elkamel1,2, ali almansoori2, and peter douglas1 1department of chemical engineering, university of waterloo, waterloo, ontario, n2l 3g, canada 2department of chemical engineering, khalifa university of science and technology, san campus, p. o. box 2533, abu dhabi, united arab emirates falhamel@uwaterloo.ca, mohammed.alkatheri@uwaterloo.ca, aelkamel@uwaterloo.ca, ali.almansoori@ku.ac.ae, peter.douglas@uwaterloo.ca","References

305,Dust Particles Detection On Camera Lens  Dhinakaran K And Manoj Ravindra Phirke P,"in most of the imaging applications the camera is placed in outdoor conditions with the lens open to the environment. example, cameras installed on the buildings for surveillance, cameras fitted on cars that are open to the environment for adas applications, camera for flight passengers to view outside scenes on the fly etc. one of the most challenging problems in such scenarios is that the dust particles may easily form a partially or fully occluding layer on the camera lenses and block vision. there are more challenging scenarios like the presence of wind, rain, mist, sun glare etc. which can also lead to false imaging algorithm results. the purpose of this paper is to solve this problem efficiently by detecting dirt/dust if presents on the lens. this is helpful to stop the system functioning instead of providing misleading results. this application is more essential for safety critical applications like adas where the accurate real time detection of objects must happen. proposed approach has more than one algorithm like edge analysis, inter frame analysis, edge strength analysis etc. to produce accurate result for dust/dirt detection.","dust detection, adas, camera degradation","The idea of this paper is to resolve lens occlusion detection to stop its functionality that supposed to be performed, the introduced method has resolved the identified problem and been proven by shown metrics for various dataset with all environmental scenarios like rain, fog, mist etc., proposed approach uses sobel edge detection to find edge map as unsharpened area of images needs to be calculated along with nearest neighbor interpolation to downscale the images to find 3 levels of peak gradient value. Given fixed threshold values are verified with Elbow method. Since this paper uses basic image processing features such edge strength calculation, edge differences of frames proposed approach can be scale up to any of applications wherever the same problem exists even we can use it for indoor applications. Highlight of this paper is that no one steps of algorithm does not depend with features like color, size, shape etc., it may help to get good results in all the environmental condition like sunny, dusky, dark area, nighttime etc., 7.","imaging tech lab hcl technologies bangalore 560100, india dhinakarank@hcl.com; manojp@hcl.com",
306,A Simulation Study On Bed Capacity Management In A  Public Hospital,"it is important to effectively manage the allocation of limited resources such as beds in order to provide access to care in a timely manner. bed capacity management is essential in delivering high-quality health care. the aim of this paper is to optimize the number of beds in the hospital, reduce length of stay, reduce discharge delays, and evaluate alternative solutions to bed management. this research mainly focuses on developing a discrete event simulation to help and support in decision making on scheduling staff and optimizing resources. scenarios were tested to find out the effect of length of stay, queue length and waiting times of patients. data required to build the model such as patients’ length of stay, available resources, and processing times were collected from a public hospital. the results were found to be that the bottlenecks in the system is resulting from the over occupancy in wards (especially surgical wards) that is affecting the patient flow and overcrowding in the emergency department. optquest was used to optimize the number of beds in order to have bed utilization no less than 70% and no more than 85% which will give the optimal solution. in addition, four what-if scenarios were constructed and tested as solutions to be recommended to improve the system.","length of stay, bed occupancy","To sum up, management of bed capacity and availability will have a decisive impact on the hospital, meaning that improvement related to bed management will impact the availability of beds therefore improving patient flow. The objective of this project is to optimizing the appropriate number of beds in a public hospital to decrease the high occupancy rates and prolonged patients waiting time. By achieving this objective, the system will be improved in different aspects related to BC such as: reach a better utilization rates of beds that are between 70% and 85%, decrease the length of queues for beds, reduce patients waiting time, and increase the number of patients recovered. All the data that have been collected from the hospital were applied in Arena Simulation Software to understand the current system behavior. After running the base model, the outputs showed the bottle neck department that causes the congestion in the ED. The department with the highest utilization rate, queue length, and long waiting times are the male and female general surgery wards. Therefore, OptQuest for Arena™ have been used to provide the appropriate number of beds in each department to decrease the utilization rate and increase the number of discharged patients. Furthermore, four scenarios have been suggested for the base model to improve the performance of doctors and decrease the queue length of patients .The first one is changing the schedule of the doctors; second, adding mobile beds in MOR2 and FOR2; third, using two of the internal wards to be occupied by the general surgery ward; finally, reducing the bed cleaning procedure time by hiring extra cleaners for the wards. By using the output analyzer, the first scenario was shown that is the best to apply.","doha makarem, farah sarraj, fatemah alkandarie, shouq thuwaini, yara tafesh, dr.ufuk kula industrial engineering department american university of the middle east 250 st, eqaila, kuwait dohamakarem4@hotmail.com, farahsarraj@outlook.com, fatemahalkandarei@hotmail.com, shougthuwaini3@gmail.com, yara.tafesh@outlook.com, ufuk.kula@aum.edu.kw systems simulation and probability and statistics in engineering applications",
307,A Six Sigma Project On The Improvement Of A Pvc Pipe  Production,"this paper explains our project about a six sigma application to improve a pvc pipe production process. we began with introducing the company that we chose which is the national industry company (nic) and their production process of both pvc pipes and fittings. then we used the dmaic methodology to define the problem that they are facing which is defective pipes and fittings and in the measure phase we collected data regarding both productions and calculated the average defective pipes per month with their associated costs and decided to focus on pipe production lines. after that, in the analyze phase, we looked into the factors and found the root cause of the defective pipes are torque and feeder speed levels. in addition, we used minitab to draw x bar-r charts and found that the process was out of control, hence we used contour plots to find the optimal settings of both torque and feeder speed levels. finally, in the improve phase, we removed the out of control points that were out of the optimal settings found earlier and the process became in control indicating 89% improvements. finally, we provided an out of control action plan for when an outlier appears on the x bar charts during the monitoring of the process.","pipes, defect rate, torque","To conclude, we used six sigma methodology on a pipe production line in a plastic manufacturing company and we found that the problem they are facing is having 2.02% defective pipes per month. After conducting the phases of DMAIC we understood that the torque and feeder speed levels were causing the pipes to have less wall thickness and in return causing them to be defective. Therefore, we used Minitab to draw contour plots and were able to find the optimal settings for the torque and feeder speed level which when used provides us with an in control process plotted on an X bar-R chart. Hence, 89% improvements were achieved by providing the optimal settings of both factors.

308,Increasing Oil/Petroleum Supply Chain Distribution  Efficiency Through Using Autonomous Vehicle,"this paper explains the consideration of the implementation of autonomous vehicles as the main transportation modes pertain to logistic processes in the supply chain area, especially in the oil/petroleum distribution. the major challenge that companies currently facing is inflexible distribution processes. improvements can be done through lean logistics, for example by changes the old-fashioned transportation or conventional truck towards autonomous truck in the future. this alternative needs careful consideration to gain a competitive advantage and increase the efficiency of logistic processes.","supply chain, logistic","and Suggestion 5.1 Conclusion Autonomous Vehicles could be a breakthrough in the supply chain area which supports the logistics function. However, decision-making must be carefully considered. Simulation Modelling used to predict the future implementation of the alternative to gain insight and reducing time, cost, risk. As mentioned before, the case is about a solar fuel distribution in a small area of Jakarta. So, the route will be short, and therefore, the capability of the truck is not maximized. That leads to the inefficiency of autonomous vehicle implementation for this case. Here are some reasons why this thing can happen: 1508","rizky yonathan, sabrina putri kinanti, and zahra industrial engineering department university of indonesia depok, west java 16424, indonesia rizky.yonathan@ui.ac.id, sabrina.putri71@ui.ac.id, zahra71@ui.ac.id","References

312,Humanitarian Aid For Wuhan With Crisis Logistics  Management Approach,"humanitarian aid is one of the most popular and vital subjects nowadays. this is because, in some disasters like corona epidemy in wuhan, china, the regional assistance is not sufficient to compensate for the damages and to protect the people. therefore, the management and distribution of these humanitarian aids are of paramount importance. in this manuscript, first, we model the need for the first aids in the city by considering the current situation, e.g., total population, number of sick people, dead people, number of needed hospital staff, and so forth. then, this model solves two phases: (1) in the first phase, we ignore the cost criteria, and we use airplanes to provide the required materials to maximize the speed. (2) in the second phase, we consider the trade-off between cost and speed criteria, which introduces the train as the optimal solution.","humanitarian aid, 2019-ncov","To conclude this work, we have proposed a model to compensate for the damages caused by Coronavirus in Wuhan, China. In particular, in the first period of the epidemy, the speed criteria had the highest priority, and the cost was ignored; therefore, the airplane was the optimum solution to maximize the transfer speed. In the second period, the cost and speed were the two factors considered in the optimization problem. The best solution turned out to be the train according to the considered criteria. It is interesting to mention that by considering both factors, ships, trucks, and airplanes represent the alternatives, respectively. More researches will focus on cases of quicker spread of the virus in the future.","yonglin ren, shiva hajiebrahimi, mehdi azad, and anjali awasthi concordia institute for information systems engineering (ciise) concordia university montreal, quebec, canada royalencrypt@gmail.com, s_hajieb@encs.concordia.ca, azadmehdi1992@gmail.com and anjali.awasthi@concordia.com souraj salah hamdan bin muhammad smart university abu dhabi, uae sourajqs@gmail.com",

321,Batching And Resource Allocation Under Stochastic  Unreliable Flexible Flow Shop,"scheduling problems in manufacturing industries has received considerable attention from researchers under ideal environment in terms of certainty of information and stability of conditions. however, real life situations are much more complex, less stable and more uncertain. in such cases, researchers turn to the simulation methodology for optimizing scheduling decisions. in this study, a simulation model was built for the flexible flow shop problem using arena and optquest was utilized to determine the best dispatching rule, optimal batch size and the number of machines at each work center. average flow time and average total earliness and tardiness were selected as performance metrics. the studied problem is stochastic in terms of job arrival, processing time and machine failure. the problem becomes more complex with the existence of machine setup times in between job processing. computational results are reported to show the effectiveness of the developed simulation model in finding desirable solutions for both objective functions. different dispatching methods are tested and compared in terms of their effectiveness in optimizing different objective functions.","scheduling, flexible flow shop, simulation","can be drawn by looking at the configuration for different utilization levels. The model becomes sensitive to the changes of the minimum machine utilization. The number of machines drops to one for all work centers while minimum utilization is increased from 25% to 40%. Also, Dynamic SPT `seems to be the best dispatching rule to solve the flow time problem under problem considered. This dispatching rule may not always give the performance like in the second scenario. However, this rule frequently gives the optimal performance measure. 6. Conclusion Several dispatching rules are considered for job scheduling on unreliable flexible flow shop for two performance measures, average flow time and average earliness and tardiness time. The problem is highly stochastics in terms of job arrival, processing time and machine breakdown where the workshop consists of several work centers with multiple identical machines at each stage and sequence dependent setup time. A simulation model has been developed using ARENA and OptQuest has been utilized to optimize the problem. The objective of this study is to determine the best dispatching rule, the optimal batch size for each job type, the optimal number of identical machines at each work center, for minimizing the two performance measures. Sensitivity analysis with respect to the setup time and minimum machine utilization is conducted. The study found that the Dynamic Shortest Processing Time (DSPT) performs quite for the objective of minimizing the average flow time. The Dynamic Earliest Due Date (DEDD) is found to be preferable for minimizing earliness- tardiness. Furthermore, the model seems to be less sensitive to changes in setup time but sensitive to changes in minimum machine utilization. Further study is recommended for testing other dispatching rules for different performance measures such as minimizing weighted completion time and green production related measures. Further sensitivity analysis for other parameters such as the number of the work centers, number of job types or other parameters may be conducted.

322,Electron Beam Melting Of Γ-Tial And Minimization Of Its  Surface Roughness And Cutting Forces In Turning,"gamma titanium aluminide alloys are of high importance due to their lower density and higher strength as compared to their competitor alloys such as ti6al4v in the automobile and aerospace applications. the current paper reports on the electron beam melting (ebm) and turning of the gamma titanium aluminide alloy (γ-tial). the γ-tial cylindrical parts are fabricated by using the arcam electron beam melting machine. after fabrication, the γ-tial parts are characterized by checking their surface morphology, microstructure, hardness, and surface roughness. all these measured characteristics show the acceptable levels for various applications except the surface roughness. the key limitation of the γ-tial parts fabricated from the electron beam melting process is their extremely poor surface roughness. the roughness values are observed as high as sa = 34.9 µm. in this work, the surface quality of the ebm printed γ-tial components is improved by employing the turning process by using two different radii tungsten carbide inserts (0.4 mm and 0.8 mm). also, the effects of other important turning parameters such as cutting speed (v), feed rate (f), depth of cut (ap) and coolant flow rate is taken into account. it has been attempted to find the optimized machining conditions to minimize the surface roughness and the main cutting forces during the finishing process.","γ-tial, turning, surface roughness","This paper investigates the results of the electron beam melting of the γ-TiAl (gamma titanium aluminide) and shows the characterization of the 3D printed parts in terms of their surface roughness, microstructure and hardness. All the qualities (hardness and microstructure) of the electron beam melted parts are satisfactory except the surface roughness. The turning operation was utilized to reduce the surface roughness of the gamma titanium aluminide parts, by using a wide range of the machining parameters. The turning experiments were performed by using the L36 Taguchi array. The goal was set to optimize the turning parameters to produce lower surface roughness while also keeping the main cutting force low to minimize the risk of microstructure alterations beneath the machined surface. Following main conclusions could be realized from this work. 1. The S/N ratios and the ANOVA results show that the ap (depth) and f (feed rate) are the most noteworthy parameters concerning the Fc (cutting force) while the f (feed rate) and R (insert radius) appears to be the most dominant parameters manipulating the surface roughness. The cutting speed shows some influence on the Fc (cutting force), while the Q (coolant flow rate) does not seem to have any major influence on turning performance. 2. From the response surface plot of the Ra (surface roughness), an interesting finding is that the adverse effect of the f (feed rate) on the surface quality (Ra) could be diminished by using higher insert radius. 3. The results of the computed regression models for Fc and Ra closely agree with the validation experiments results with maximum errors of 11.92% and 4.95% respectively. This point out that the achieved models are reliable for predicting the turning performance in terms of the Ra and the Fc. 4. Seven optimal combinations of the turning parameters are reported by using the composite desirability approach for simultaneous minimization the Fc and Ra. The comparison of solution 3 of the multi-response optimization with the experimental data shows the prediction errors in Fc and Ra as 5.88% and 14.28% respectively.","saqib anwar industrial engineering department, college of engineering, king saud university, riyadh 11421, saudi arabia. sanwar@ksu.edu.sa",

324,Evaluating “Usability” And “Anthropometric Dimensions”  Of Atms In Kuwait For Ergonomic Design,"this paper is about evaluation of usability characteristics and anthropometric dimensions of automated teller machines (atms) in kuwait. as for the usability characteristics, efficiency, learnability, readability, and satisfaction are considered. additionally, as anthropometric dimensions of atms for ergonomic design, screen height, keyboard height, card slot height, and cash slot height are considered. in order to evaluate usability characteristics, a questionnaire with ten questions related to the mentioned characteristics are designed. the results of the questionnaire are analyzed by using minitab software using spearman coefficient correlation. spearman coefficient correlation was used to check if the questions from same categories are correlated or not. additionally, comparisons between customer satisfaction and learnability, efficiency and readability characteristics are performed. also, for the efficiency characteristics of atms, the total transaction time is measured by using a chronometer for each user. on the other hand, different anthropometric dimensions for three banks in kuwait are measured. these measurements are indicated that atm designers are not considering anthropometric dimensions for different users. finally, some solutions related to usability issues and anthropometric dimensions for kuwaiti banks and atm designers are recommended.","efficiency, learnability, readability","and Recommendation ATMs have been an important part of our daily life since we are using it for many banking operations such as cash withdraw or balance check. At this paper, evaluation of usability characteristics and the anthropometric dimensions of ATMs in Kuwait are performed. Usability characteristics of ATM are represented as efficiency, readability, learnability and customer satisfaction. In order to evaluate usability characteristics, a questionnaire with ten questions related to the mentioned characteristics are designed. The results of the questionnaire are analyzed by using Minitab Software using Spearman Coefficient Correlation. Spearman Coefficient Correlation was used to check if the questions from same categories are correlated or not. As a result, 66% of respondent disagreed on “ATMs are suitable for different users”, which means that people are not satisfied with ATMs design. As for other questions, respondents are happy about ATMs. Also, the efficiency of different ATM users is measured. We have found that elderlies are facing more issues while using ATM. Moreover, comparisons between different categories such as gender, ages and transaction type are analyzed. It is observed that female ATM users spent more time for a transaction and more cautious while using ATM. Based on results one can state that ATM designers are not considering neither the usability characteristics nor anthropometric dimensions of ATM in Kuwait. After the analysis of the questionnaire results, there is one major problem about the satisfaction of ATM users, more specifically, about the suitability of ATMs for different users. Kuwaiti banks should focus on the ATM user satisfaction by changing some of their ATM interface designs to reduce or remove unnecessary steps during the process to speed up the transaction process. They can provide more shortcuts for frequently used transactions. They can focus cognitive elements of design by providing such as clear and understandable descriptions and messages. Finally, for anthropometric dimensions, ATM designers should consider the population measurements, not only for Kuwaiti but also for majority of the population. For some features such as font sizes, written or audible messages, and language ATM designers should use adjustability feature to serve to wide range of users from different age and 3069","suat kasap, anaam b. alabhoul, farah m. alrasheedi, hessah h. alsumairi, manal a. almutairi, and rawan n. almutairi industrial engineering department college of engineering and technology american university of the middle east, kuwait suat.kasap@aum.edu.kw","References

326,Assessment Of Wind Farm Allocation Criteria  Mawadda M. Samkari And Abdulaziz T. Almaktoom,"in keeping with the urgent goals of maintaining a healthy environment and providing clean energy alternatives at reasonable prices, saudi arabia is moving towards electricity generation using wind. selecting optimal wind farm locations is an important challenge in which one seeks to reduce the levelized cost of electricity. a four-level multi-criteria decision-making model was developed that used the analytic hierarchy process to consider wind availability, electricity demand, employment costs, maintenance costs, infrastructure costs, sale prices, and energy production capabilities to optimize wind farm locations. in addition, this study introduced multiple factors that affect wind farm success. in this study, the analytical hierarchy process was implemented using mathematical simulations to compare three wind farm locations in saudi arabia.","renewable energy, wind farm, 2018",", the AHP is not sufficient for identification of a suitable wind farm location. Further studies should be performed. Thus, this area of research will continue to adopt other techniques to achieve its objectives. 5. Conclusions Wind farm turbine technology can make important contributions to the energy needs of Saudi Arabia. This study presented a model that can be improved to help in developing a model that help in reducing energy costs. This study used the AHP, which is an MCDM method, to rank and evaluate wind farm allocation criteria. Due to the weaknesses of the AHP in multi-level ranking and dealing with quantitative data, further studies should integrate other methods to help achieve better rankings. It is recommended to extend the study and use other MCDM techniques that are more effective in ranking multi-level problems using qualitative and quantitative data. To overcome this gap, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) described in Choudhary and Shankar (2012), Roszkowska (2011), Srikrishan et al. (2014), and Ahmadi et al. (2013) should be integrated with AHP. It is also suggested to conduct further studies that consider the effects of uncertainty like Almaktoom (2017), Almaktoom and Krishnan (2016), Wang et al. (2013, 2014), and Krishnan et al. (2016) on optimal location selection. 2389","department of operations and information management, effat university po box 34689, jeddah 21478, kingdom of saudi arabia mmsamkari@effat.edu.sa, abalmaktoom@effatuniversity.edu.sa","References

332,Investigation Of Factors That Affect The Quality Of  Village Financial Statements In Buru District,"this study aims to investigate the direct influence of the factors that influence the quality of village financial reports, including the competence of village financial managers, the use of information technology and the role of village facilitators. the target sample is village financial managers in buru regency, which are spread throughout the village. data is collected through a questionnaire and then tested using the smart partial least square technique. the research results obtained were sufficient to provide moderate support for these goals. this is evidenced from the inner model test, the r square value of 0.35 implies that 35% of the quality of financial statements can be explained by the competence of village financial managers, the use of information technology and the role of village facilitators, the rest is explained by other factors not examined. of the three hypotheses proposed, 2 hypotheses that showed significant positive results. the hypothesis that supports this research provides the conclusion that the use of it and the role of village facilitators are variables that affect the quality of village financial reports.","competence, financial, management",". The results of the study were moderate enough to provide strong support for the research objectives, this is evidenced from the inner model test, obtained an R square value of 0.35 means that 35% of the quality of financial statements can be explained by the competence of village financial managers, the use of information technology and the role of village facilitators, the rest is explained by other factors not examined. Besides, from the three hypotheses proposed, 2 hypotheses showed significant positive results. The hypothesis that supports this research provides the conclusion that the use of information technology and the role of village facilitators are variables that affect the quality of village financial reports. The procurement and use of technical facilities is very important in improving the quality of village financial reports. Likewise with the role of village facilitators, it also contributes to the quality of village financial reports. The hypothesis that does not provide support for this study can be concluded that the quality of village financial reports in regency. Hunting might be influenced by other factors apart from the competence of village financial managers. Based on the results and conclusions above, some suggestions can be explained as follows. 1) For village governments to always utilize existing technology to further improve the quality of village financial reports. Likewise with the competence of the village apparatus to always be given an understanding of accounting and village financial management because this can be seen from the filled demographic data. Most respondents are not from accounting background (respondent characteristic data). 2) Structural model test results that show the influence of the determination of the independent variables on the dependent variable that is moderate by 35% so it can be suggested for further research to add new variables that are predicted to improve the quality of financial statements such as the application of SAP, work experience, understanding of accounting and the other. 3) The consequence of predictive model testing in this study is that testing can be carried out without a strong theoretical basis so that for subsequent studies it can do another model testing such as estimation model testing or can use other research techniques.","kamala soleman, yudhy muhtar latuconsina, yunita marasabessy universitas darussalam maluku, 97128, indonesia maulidah_03@yahoo.com, muhtaryudhy@gmail.com, ymarasabessy@gmail.com m chairul basrun umanailo department of agricultural and forestry university of iqra buru namlea, 97571, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com",

The main objective of this research is to determine the factors that will influence the online shopping intention of Generation Z in Malaysia. From the inferential analysis result, three of the independent variables of this study have a positive effect on online shopping intention. The related independent variables are website characteristics reflected by H1, an online perceived value reflected by H2, and product reputation reflected by H3. Besides that, the correlation analysis had shown that all independent variables are highly correlated to the online shopping intention. The general objective can be supported by three specific research objectives which had mentioned in the introduction of the research. The data analysis result had provided evidence to accept the H1 which stated that website characteristics have a positive and significant relationship with the online shopping intention of Generation Z. Thus, a website with good characteristics can increase the online shopping intention of Generation Z. Among the subfactors of website characteristics, website quality is the only one which significant to online shopping intention. Thus, the model rejects hypothesis H1a and accepted hypothesis H1b. It can conclude that marketers should put more effort on the design of the website and its customer services, rather than focus on website creditability, in order to increase online shopping intention of Generation Z in Malaysia. The results show that there are a significance and positive relationship between online perceived value and online shopping intention. Generation Z in Malaysia will intent to purchase a product or service to fulfil their goals and objectives. Marketers can attract Generation Z by fulfilling their perceive value through advertising, product packaging, promotion, and social responsibility activities. In this study, online perceived value has two subfactors, which is utilitarian and hedonic perceived value. The results of the data analysis show that utilitarian and hedonic perceived value are significance to the online shopping intention of Generation Z in Malaysia. This suggests that during online shopping, Generation Z in Malaysia will look for the products and services that bring utilitarian value or emotional value or both. Product reputation has a positive and significant relationship with online shopping intention. Therefore, a good brand reputation will increase the purchase intention of Generation Z in Malaysia. From the research finding in Chapter 4, the impact of online customer review on online shopping intention is not significant.

Finally, the potential causes of combustion crack are no calculation of slope measurement for wood bending and no combustion training yet. Several improvements are proposed ranked by RPN values such as: developing facilities of automatic machines, sorting material at the time of purchasing, creating training program for burning and assembly, and brainstorming with some experts. We expect that in control stage, the proposed improvement are monitored and evaluated so that the boat building industry performance can be boasted through six sigma. 5.","chung pei road no. 200 chung li city 32023, taiwan weehm@cycu.edu.tw",
339,Influence Of Ethical Aspects On The Construction Industry  Performance In Egypt,"the construction industry is deemed to be one of the most flourishing industries in egypt. it greatly contributes to the national gdp and represents one of the leading sectors in the egyptian economy recorded at a reasonable growth rate recently. throughout the history of work in mega projects, particularly in the petroleum, chemical industries and power plants, it has been noticed that erroneous technical, managerial and ethical behavior of personnel is dominant in the egyptian work environment, which to a great extent affect passively the performance indices and success of the construction projects. therefore, the aim of this research work is to introduce a model that describes the influ- ence of ethical aspects on a number of selected performance indices used to measure the success of construction projects in egypt. to this end, questionnaire surveys and interviews were used as data collection means. the questionnaire contained 185 questions covering 24 independent variables. the independent variables were selected to cover a number of critical technical, managerial and ethical issues that take place during the subsequent stages of large construction projects. in this research, only results concerning the influence of ethical aspects are presented. a number of statistical analysis tools were presented, using non-parametric analysis techniques and a number of regression models were developed to evaluate the project performance during both the planning and implementation phases. the study has detected three dependent performance indices that have been correlated with three ethical in- dependent aspects.",,,"mohamed ahmed azzab and mohamed wagih badawi production engineering department, faculty of engineering, alexandria university, egypt moh.azab@yahoo.com, wagihbadawi@hotmail.com",
340,Sustainable Quality Culture: Company-Wide Management  System (Cwms) And Lean Six Sigma (Lss) As Enablers,"for any organization aiming to achieve sustainable quality culture of operational excellence, it is important to ensure that a proper foundation for a company-wide quality (cwq) culture exits. this foundation is a comprehensive company-wide management system (cwms) which can serve as an infrastructure for improving and controlling the different operation systems of any organization. the cwms mainly draws on five mss, strategic management, initiative management, daily management, process management and performance management. it ensures the proper alignment of all people and processes, the optimization of resources and sustainability of high performance. for any organization to succeed in meeting high-quality standards, the existence of quality culture is essential and this requires time and commitment. one key enabler of that is the cwms and lean six sigma (lss) methodology. this paper will explain how their proper implementation will sustain the quality culture and enable it to spread and take over. this paper follows a theoretical review of literature combined with the authors’ own experience to discuss cwms, sustainable quality culture and the lss culture-related aspects.",,,"souraj salah faculty of business administration hamdan bin muhammad smart university dubai, uae ssalah@hbmsu.ac.ae","References

341,Leadership Dependency Model For Lean Six Sigma  Alessandro Laureani,"the majority of lean six sigma corporate initiatives fail to yield the desired results: many are struggling in turning lean six sigma into a success, citing lack of leadership, changing business focus, internal resistance and availability of resources as the main impeding factors. while a lot of focus is usually put on on the technical side of lean six sigma, the leadership and cultural impact are often an afterthought, causing failure down the line. the aim of this doctoral research was to assess the impact of organizational leadership on the deployment of lean six sigma in organisations and thereby develop a dependency model to facilitate its successful implementation. a mixed-methods approach, using survey and semi-structured interviews, was adopted. building on the existing literature, this research extended and helped refine our understanding of lean six sigma and leadership, identifying the traits a leader needs to display to increase the chances of successful deployment: these traits, although not all completely new in the literature, are organized in a novel way, spanning across different leadership styles articulated in the literature. a new leadership style was suggested as the most conducive to lean six sigma deployments. its traits are as follows: ● visible ● excellent communicator ● inspirational ● three r’s (roles, responsibilities, relations) clearly defined ● consistent ● targeted ● building a philosophy, a way of working ● leading by example ● flexible ● three c’s (connection, competence, character) the research also showed that the more service-centred the sector and the smaller the company, the greater the need for strong leadership to successfully implement lean six sigma, leading to a leadership dependency model, into which the leadership traits outlined above were integrated. the leadership dependency model shows how smaller service organizations are particularly dependent on leadership to be visible, inspirational and the ability of its leaders to connect with employees; while larger manufacturing organizations rely more on leadership being targeted, flexible, and capable of building a philosophy of working around lean six sigma. this would help organizations about to embark on a lean six sigma deployment journey to determine where to invest more resources, either on up-skilling their leadership team or on more stable processes. 1",,,"design manufacture & engineering management university of strathclyde glasgow, scotland, uk alaureani@hotmail.com",
342,Identification & Awareness About The Development Of  Breast Cancer By Using Raman Spectroscopic Method.,"cancer is one of leading cause of death in developed countries. while the establishment brags that more cancer patients survive than ever before, the horrific side effects inflicted by conventional therapy often leave patients partially or severely debilitated, and set the stage for deadly secondary diseases. for those people suffering from cancer the dangerous mix of chemotherapy and surgery not only failed to cure the cancer, but destroyed their remaining quality of life. the laser treatment has the potential to destroy primary breast tumors. this unique treatment can also seek and destroy cancer cells that have spread (metastasized) from the original tumor to other parts of the body. this is especially critical as metastasized cells are the primary cause of cancer death. a laser beam operating in the near-infrared frequency of light heats tissue to a depth of several centimeters, allowing the beam to penetrate directly into a solid tumor with minimal damage to normal tissue because it can be focused directly through intact skin, no surgical incision is required. in recent years there has been much progress in the use of optical diagnostics methods in the detection & diagnosis of breast cancer. early diagnosis of breast cancer affords early intervention and greatest chance to cure. laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (lif); synchronous luminescence (sl) spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy are some of the technique used to detect the cancer in early stage. in our diagnostic studies, we used the technique of raman scattering. raman spectroscopy is based on the interaction of photons with the target material producing a highly detailed biochemical ‘fingerprints’ of the sample. it can be appreciated that such a sensitive biochemical detection system could confer diagnostic benefit in a clinical setting. raman spectroscopy has been successfully used as a key for the detection & diagnosis of breast cancer. raman spectroscopy could confer a great to a patient with early, rapid and accurate diagnosis. this technique is almost labour free without the need for sample preparation. it could reduce the need for whole pathological specimen examination, in theatre it could help to determine margin status, and finally peripheral blood diagnosis may be an achievable target.","chemotherapy, surgery, confer, great",,"mrs. priya sachin deole. department of physics, g.s.tompe art’s, commerce & science college, chandur bazar, dist. amravati (m.s) india drpriyadeole@gmail.com mr. nachiket sachin deole. department of engineering sciences and humanities, savitribai phule university, pune, india. nachiket.deole18@vit.edu mrs. manasi vyankatesh ghamande. department of engineering sciences and humanities, savitribai phule university, pune, india. manasi.ghamande@viit.ac.in","References

344,Adopting Building Information Modelling In Small And  Medium Enterprises Of Iraq’S Construction Industry,"the main problem facing the construction industry in iraq is the absence of proper management techniques during the project execution stages. over the past decade, a new concept, known as building information modelling (bim), has been rising and developing as a new construction management tool in the aec industry. building information modelling is considered as modern technological advancement and referred to as a new revolutionary tool in the construction industry, due to its platform of collaborative working techniques and its growing computer software which can be involved among all the project tasks to increase the level of performance during the project life cycle as well as reduce the project’s complexities and conflicts. bim has many benefits that play a significant role in the project execution such as visualisation of the project by creating 3d models, reduce the project’s cost, duration, and many other benefits will be investigated through this research paper. recently, bim is used and implemented in most of the developed countries such as the usa, uk, and eu, where it became an essential part of the construction projects to achieve the planned and anticipated project delivery. as of today, bim is not applied in the iraqi architecture, engineering, and construction (aec) industry and the companies are struggling in its implementation. therefore, the purpose of this research is to explore the process of bim adoption in the small and medium enterprise (smes) in the iraqi construction sector. the validity for selecting smes comes from the fact that 80% of the projects executed by these companies do not involve the use of bim, in addition to their limited knowledge about the subject. moreover, to achieve the research aim and objectives a mixed method of data collection was adopted and consists of questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with experts in iraqi construction companies with different specialities such as architecture, engineers, construction projects managers, etc. out of 90 participants in the questionnaire 38 457",,,"abdussalam shibani assistant professor in construction and project management school of energy, construction and environment coventry university, uk ab1732@coventry.ac.uk khaled abu awwad & michel ghostin phd researchers school of energy, construction and environment coventry university, uk abuawwa2@uni.coventry.ac.yuk ghostinm@uni.coventry.ac.uk kalim siddiqui senior lecturer in economics department of accounting, finance and economics huddersfield business school k.u.siddiqui@hud.ac.uk omar farji master student school of energy, construction and environment coventry university, uk farjio@uni.coventry.ac.uk","References

345,Investigating The Barriers Of Building Information Modelling  (Bim) Implementation In The Higher Education In Morocco,"the implementation of building information modelling (bim) has significantly increased in the last few years in morocco. however, it has been noticed from the literature that construction companies in morocco face barriers which limit the full implementation of this technology. one of these barriers has been identified to be the lack of bim courses within the higher education system, since is essential for aec students to get a clear and deep understanding of this process and technology in order to meet the industry’s requirements. currently, there is an increasing request to embrace bim within the educational system in morocco either for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in order to supply students with the required knowledge and skills to be able to work within a bim environment. therefore, the aim of this research is to explore the status of bim in the moroccan higher education and to identify the main barriers which limit its implementation in the moroccan higher education. to achieve the aim of this research, a mixed method approach has been adopted. furthermore, the researchers highlights some recommendations which will aid the implementation of bim within the higher education system in morocco.","architecture, barriers","and Recommendations The aim of this paper was to explore the current situation of BIM within the higher education system in Morocco. From the data collected using a mix method approach, it has emerged that the status of BIM in Morocco universities is at the very early stage. This has been justified by the participants by claiming that BIM is not required to be used in Moroccan construction firms, therefore there is no need to confuse students with an advanced technology such as BIM. Moreover, other limitations emerged from the data collection, such as lack of BIM materials, lack of experience among lecturers and high cost of training for BIM. On the other hand, the participants have proposed few recommendations to overcome these barriers and will help in the integration of BIM in Moroccan universities. One of the recommendations were based on mandating an obligatory use of BIM, as in the UK, which will consequently lead the industry and universities to embrace this technology. In addition, they have recommended training lecturers on new software and technology despite its high cost, since the availability of a BIM course will bring the attention of a higher number of students which will lead to a higher return on investment. Finally, the participants emphasized on the important role of the government in spreading BIM awareness between organizations and universities, as well as providing materials and textbooks in both Arabic and French, since these are the two official languages in Morocco.

During the semester, 
students receive feedback on their writing progress through in-class workshops, peer review, written and oral 
comments from the instructor. 
 
Following that one-credit hour technical presentation course, senior students are required to participate in the annual 
petroleum engineering student paper contest, in which SPE-style presentations are judged by industry representatives 
(Retnanto and Parsaei 2017). The student paper contest has a long tradition at College Station, and we have 
incorporated the activity in our program largely unchanged, although only for senior students. Students are required 
to make a 15-minute presentation on a subject of their choice, commonly one involving an independent project or an 
undergraduate research project, although students may choose to speak on any petroleum engineering topic. Students 
are responsible for proposing the topic, conducting independent research, and preparing the presentation. Students 
improve presentation skills and write an accompanying technical report in the form of a Society of Petroleum 
Engineers paper. Students are encouraged in their junior year to begin an independent study of a petroleum engineering 
topic that they could later present in the student paper contest. 
 
The contest is a daylong event that now occurs at the beginning of the spring semester. Usually, two or more 
presentation sessions run concurrently, with each session judged by panels of three to five industry participants. 
Typically, 15-20 technical industry professionals take part during the day. The contest day begins with an orientation 
meeting of faculty session leaders and technical judges. Judges rank student achievement on 1-to-4 scale with 4 
indicating proficient or skillful ability and 1 indicating lack of ability according to the rubric. Judges may also write 
comments concerning individual presentations, which are read and saved by the program. Judges rank the first and 
second place winners for each session. 
 
Winners from senior student paper contest submitted their abstract in the Society of Petroleum Engineers regional 
student paper contest, a very significant event held annually in one of the GCC capitals. Winners of that regional 
contest, in turn, present at the SPE international student paper contest, which takes place during the SPE Annual 
Technical Conference and Exhibition (ATCE), the major event on upstream oil and gas, usually attended by more 
than 8,000 people. 
 
Strong financial support has been provided by industry to TAMUQ Petroleum Engineering for prize money and 
contest expenses, indicating their recognition of the value of the activity. Texas A&M at Qatar has been successful in 
the contest having had students 1st place in 2014 and 2015 SPE Middle East Regional student paper contest 
undergraduate division and competed at the 2014 and 2015 SPE International Student Paper Contest during the SPE 
ATCE in Amsterdam and Houston, respectively. Texas A&M at Qatar students rank the 2nd place in 2016, 2017 and 
2018 at the regional contest undergraduate division. 
 
 
 
3. Observations Made and Recommendations Received from the Course Audience 
 
Student outcome in communication (ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences) is assessed for both 
writing and communication skills. The student is assessed on their ability to express their ideas logically and 
systematically, and clear statements of the significance of topic, problem, and solution (as applicable), and conclusions 
were included. In student presentation skills, the assessment covers the ability to communicate effectively orally. That 
includes that speaker engaged audience, referred to graphic aids, had appropriate eye contact and speaking voice and 
speed, and was at ease; the presentation was within and not excessively under-allocated time. Also, visual aides were 
informative, supportive of presentation, well designed, had appropriate content, attractive, not excessively wordy, and 
in an appropriate number for the presentation. The student is required to highly competent use of the library, online,

348,The Use Of Unified Theory Of Acceptance And Use Of  Technology In The Adoption Of M-Payment,"one of the financial technologies (fintech) innovations used by 46% of the internet user in indonesia is mobile payment, or m-payment. this quantitative research aims to examine the acceptance level of m-payment applications using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut). an online questionnaire was distributed among 102 respondents and processed with the software ibm spss statistics 25 using a multiple linear regression model. the result shows that independent variables such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions, significantly influence behavioral intentions of m- payment use.","utaut, m-payment","The results of this study explain that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions affect the users’ intention to use of m-payment. The results showed that the independent variables of UTAUT can be used to predict the users’ interest in using m-Payment by 69.9 percent, while the remaining 30.4 percent is explained by other variables that are not covered in this study. Therefore, the next research is expected to be able to test these variables. In addition, further research can also examine moderation variables, such as age, gender and voluntary use of m-payment. Another limitation is there is a large difference in the number of respondents who live in Jakarta with respondents from other regions, which reached 55%. In other words, the sample used has the possibility of not being fully representative. Further research is expected to cover more cities in Indonesia, since there are different conditions, such as the quality of internet connection or the purchasing power. 949","rindang widuri accounting department binus graduate program, master of accounting bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 email: rindangw@binus.edu muhammad kholil industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia 10340 phone: +62 21 31934471 email: m.kholil2009@gmail.com rara ganish kharisma nurbani accounting department faculty of economics and communication bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 raraganish@binus.ac.id hendri electrical engineering, faculty of engineering universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia 10340 phone: +62 21 31934471 email: hendriabubakar@mercubuana.ac.id","References

349,Efficient Identification Model Of Strategic Key Dimensions In  Smes,"small and medium enterprises (smes) make-up 99.8% of all enterprises which comprises 57.4% of added value and 66.8% of employment within the european union economy. in the age of the fourth industrial revolution, there will be an increasing competition among smes to operate efficiently, to hold on to their customers while capturing additional market share. most of the smes leaders have difficulties to establish an overall strategy that is consistent and optimised due to a lack of time, methodology and/or knowledge. for instance, the leader may focused on the internal performance of the company at the expense of its customers’ expectations; or launching innovative products/services but neglecting its industrial strategy; or improving its operating profit without involving its stakeholders in the business development. this article explores how the assessment of the environment threats and opportunities may help sme leaders to formalize their strategic vision through the identification of the key strategic dimensions. it comprises three sections: (1) the notions of strategy, strategic dimensions and performance measurement system (pms) are defined (2) the sme’s environment factors and their level of risks are evaluated, (3) the conceptual framework that identify the priority index of each strategic dimension is proposed.","strategy, risks",,"jean-marc vasnier and mourad messaadia cesi - lineact, boulevard de l’université – gavy océanis 44603 saint-nazaire, france jmvasnier@cesi.fr, mmessaadia@cesi.fr nicolas maranzana, ameziane aoussat arts et métiers – lcpi 151 bvd de l’hôpital 75013 paris, france nicolas.maranzana@ensam.eu, ameziane.aoussat@ensam.eu","References

352,An Intuitionistic Fuzzy Mcdm Framework For Selecting  Environmentally Responsible Freight Transport Service,"freight transportation practices accounted for a significant share of environmental degradation and climate change over the years. therefore, environmentally responsible transport practices (ertps) become a serious concern of freight shippers and transport service providers. past studies reported that a little attention is paid to assess the ertps of freight transport companies. this paper proposed a hierarchical framework consists of five ertps dimensions and thirty-three practices including four new practices. the transport firm selection is affected by multiple expert opinions, lack of information availability, decision- making ambiguity, and background of experts. the evaluation of such decisions requires a multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) method under group decision-making approach. this paper used an intuitionistic fuzzy set integrated analytic hierarchy process (if-ahp) and visekriterijumska kompromisno rangiranje (if-vikor) method. the applicability of the proposed framework is validated with indian freight transport industry. the importance weight of ertps are computed with the help of if- ahp method and performance of selected transport companies’ w.r.t. ertps are measured by if-vikor. the result analysis shows that environmental knowledge sharing among freight transport actors, quality of organizations human resource, collaborative green awareness training programs, promoting environmental awareness program for employees, and compliance of government transport emission law and practice have been ranked top five ertps which significantly contribute to the environmental sustainability of freight transport industry. the proposed framework is also ranked freight transport companies based on ertps. two different sensitivity analysis approach are presented to check the model robustness. this research is expected to provide a reference to develop ertps in emerging economies freight transport industry and contribute to the development of sustainable freight transport system.",mcdm,,"provider: a transport service buyer perspective aalok kumar, ramesh a. department of management studies indian institute of technology roorkee india-247667 southfield, mi 48075, usa aalokitbhu@gmail.com, ram77fdm@iitr.ac.in",
353,Outpatient Nurse Scheduling Under The New Labour Law:  Difficulties And Challenges Indicated By A Negative Case,"in a hospital’s daily operations, outpatient nurse scheduling is usually a key non-clinical procedure because a successful scheduling ensures worker satisfaction and the quality of nursing care, and may well keep hr costs under control. unlike other scheduling problems in a hospital, the outpatient nurse scheduling problem (nsp) is a niche problem because the schedule must be determined based on the demands of the physicians of the outpatient department (i.e., according to the ‘mother schedule’). in general, the set of criteria that are established for the outpatient nsp are two-fold: intra-mural and extra- mural. the intra-mural criteria include the aforementioned demand defined by the ‘mother schedule’, as well as the relevant regulations of the hospital, the preferences of the decision-makers, and even the customs or culture of the hospital. the extra-mural criteria usually include, for example, environmental factors (e.g., the location of the hospital) and legal requirements. among these factors, some are relatively fixed and some are subject to change, but a change in a previously fixed factor (e.g., the labour law) usually alters the scheduling decision problem intrinsically. in this paper, possible effects on the outpatient nsp resulting from changes in the law were examined based on the case of a real hospital located in southern taiwan. this hospital used to apply a previous binary goal programming (p-bgp) model that was proposed by wang, hsieh, zhuang and ou in 2014 as a decision support for the outpatient nsp. however, the new labour law of taiwan (where the hospital is located) that was unveiled and enforced in the last few years has imposed a stricter condition on the number of working hours that a nurse can work in a day and thus prohibited a nurse (whether full-time or part-time) from attending three due shifts on any weekday. with only two shifts a day allowed for each nurse under the new law settings, the p-bgp model obtained no feasible solution to fulfill all of the scheduling demands with the nursing staff resources available (including the staff size of 31 and the ratio of full-time/part-time nurses of 21/10). as the current nursing staff is no longer sufficient for the required nursing needs, the effects of the new law on hospital management are evident. 19",,,"study zheng-yun zhuang department of civil engineering national kaohsiung university of science and technology sanmin, kaohsiung 807, taiwan (roc) wayne@nkust.edu.tw yu-kuang hsieh management department antai tian-sheng memorial hospital, an-tai medical care corporation donggang, pingtung 928, taiwan (roc) m9682042@isu.edu.tw tien-hwa ho department of information management yuanpei university of medical technology xiangshan, hsinchu 300, taiwan (roc) howa@mail.ypu.edu.tw",
354,Design And Implementation Of City Car Scale Electric  Vehicle Powered By Brushless Dc Motor,"transportation has become sector dominantly consuming fossil fuels and causes air pollution. the solution is either using natural fuels that are also environmentally friendly or replacing the engine by electric motor. this paper presents modeling and developing a prototype of city car scale electric vehicle employing brushless dc (bldc) motor as a prime mover. a 1000 w, 48 v bldc motor is used and expected to provide a torsion of 30 – 50 nm. the chassis is constructed using aluminum chassis frame, which is lighter yet more rigid. the body of vehicle is designed to have coefficient of drag (cd) of 0.4 – 0.5 to reduce aerodynamic resistance. the energy is stored in a 48 v, 8.7 ah lithium-ion (li-ion) battery equipped with battery management system (bms). a 48v 350w 17a controller is employed including ic mc33035 to drive a mosfet to control the bldc motor speed. together with bms, this controller determines the most proper power consumption for the required speed and torsion. the weight of vehicle including the driver will determine the maximum speed of vehicle. the test drive demonstrated the maximum speed of 53.3 km/hour. this development may be further enhanced for building a real electric city car.","electric vehicle, bldc motor, controller, bms","Design and development of electric vehicle powered by BLDC motor have been carried out. These include the chassis, body, and controller. The prime mover of BLDC motor is commercially available and this is used for the developed system. The materials for the vehicle are selected so that these may be easily obtained but may provide good characteristic of the vehicle. The vehicle is produced by strictly following the design therefore resulting in minimum different between the estimated characteristics with the actual performances. The system has been tested proofing the capability of achieving some distance with minimum energy consumption. This will be the opportunity for further extensive application.

355,Towards Developing Quality Standards: A Review For  Managing South Africa’S Carbon Emissions,"united nations sustainable development goals, agenda 2030, entitled “transforming our world” has tabled aspirations for urgent action on climate change. cop 24, held in 2018 in poland, wants greater urgency of action from all countries in managing carbon emissions. human activity is the prime contributor to generating carbon emissions, primarily from electrical power generation from coal, oil and gas and transport driven by carbon based liquid fuels. south africa has an abundance of coal. south african electricity generation is historically embedded in thermal coal power generation, owning and operating large power stations of typical capacities of 6 x 600 mw turbo-generators. most recently, south african is busy adding another 12 x 800 mw super-critical turbo-generators. south african imports all its crude oil and natural gas. these are used extensively in transportation of persons and goods. the south african economy is totally based on the carbon economy. reducing the dependence on coal and liquid fuels will impact jobs and the economy. the interdependencies are complex. the paper presents the status of south africa’s contributions to carbon emissions and the country’s aspirations as committed at cop 24. the key performance indicators for the transition period of 2020 to 2050 are considered. the paper concludes with a research proposal for developing strategies and quality standards of measurement and management in moving south africa’s transition away from a carbon based economy over the next three decades.","climate change, transport, energy","The complexity of climate change requires a multifaceted approach. The proposed quality standard to be developed will need to be internationally acceptable, be standardized in data collection, analysis, measurement and reporting and have measurable impacts on national economic growth, risks and risk management strategies. Climate change is equivalent to poverty; it is man-made and it is only man with conditioned behavioral practices that could charter a new course for the environment.

356,A Lean 7S Methodology Framework To Improve Efficiency  And Organizational Performance: A Review Study In An Sme,"the efficiency and quality in manufacturing business are some of the key differentiators between competing entities in the business environment and the marketplace. therefore, improving efficiency and quality of means of production or services standards is the one of the main obstacle confronting south african’s small-medium enterprises (smes) as well as other firms globally. lean approach techniques and methodologies are efficiency and process management systems adapted largely from toyota production system (tps). . lean approach is a gradual transformation overall work environment. generally, lean approach is regarded as a set of tools to aid detection and eradication of wastes in the process system. 7s lean methodology which could be applied by any scope organizations is derived from five japanese lean 5s methodology; sort, set in order, shine, standardise and sustain, extended by safety as well as spirit in the recent years. this methodology aids organisation in work environment for effectiveness and reduction hindrances in processes also enhances quality standards as well as throughput, through scrutinizing a prearranged work environment. this paper intents to evaluate prior investigations findings regarding values realised on implementation of 5s, as well as the extended 6s and 7s application and ability to improve efficiency in organisations for enhanced organisational performance. to assemble theoretical analysis various pertinent to the study objective narratives, articles and papers domestically and globally have been referred to. the outcomes illustrate that lean 5s methodology as well as the extended 6s and 7s lean methodology is an effective system to enhance of organisational performance, irrespective of organization scope. therefore, 7s lean methodology would soundly aid the goals and purposes of organization to a realise sustained enhancement in organizational performance and throughput key words: lean 7s methodology, efficiency, lean approach i. introduction small-medium enterprises (smes) companies need to be sustainable and productive in order to thrive and contribute significantly towards the south african economy by creating jobs and eradicating unemployment. to be sustainable and productive, smes companies need to adopt efficiency improvement systems. efficient world-class operations make use of continuous improvement strategies and efficiency improvements methods to stay relevant and compete in the ever-changing business environment. most world class companies also started as small enterprises who me efforts to learn, adopt and improve via different efficiency improvement systems. this study focuses on 7s lean framework for packaging and fulfilment sme company, packaging and fulfilment is the process of designing, evaluating, and producing packages [1]. [1] further states that the efficiency of smes in packaging and fulfilment is the ability to use various lean techniques such as flowcharts; brainstorming; benchmarking and 5w2h (what, when, who, where, why, how, how much). this includes generation of products eliminating waste, ineffective time and unnecessary energy use in the business [1]. 962",,". With ever increasingly evolving business environment, intensified awareness and concerns of work environmental issues has prompted organisations to use various efficiency improvement tools. From the prior read publication works it is clear that one of the lean methodology tools does have significant positive impacts on organisations performance when effectively implemented. By understanding the results of the lean 5s and 6s in clear that the new Lean 7S Methodology can have positive outcome the organisation performance. It is noticeable that the goal of 7S function is broad and diverse. When successfully applied, the work environment improves reduce waste in different forms, organize work areas, promotes hygiene as well as team cohesion, the complete gains of 7S cannot be envisioned in firms, if the obstructions related, completely understood, addressed and removed. The lean 7s methodology has become the base for any lean method to be applied.7S methodology is a continuous improvement tool and should be constantly monitored and evaluated.","organization k. mahlaha, n. sukdeo and v. mofokeng department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg gauteng, south africa kmahlaha@gmail.com nsukdeo@uj.ac.za vmofokeng@uj.ac.za",

358,Artificial Intelligence Technique For Detecting Bone  Irregularity Using Fastai,"a bone abnormality is a medical condition which is caused by physical damage or diseases. there are many factors which can lead to various abnormalities. an irregularity in a bone is generally diagnosed by orthopedician and radiologists using x-ray images of the affected bone. bone abnormalities affect more than a billion people in the world. with more than 30 million emergency visits annually, there is a lack of expertise. although computer aided diagnosis is still very limited in the world. they are mostly confined to research projects and there’s been no real world applications. for the past few years there has been a great leap in the development of artificial intelligence which now makes it possible to implement and test deep learning models in the medical field. one can get an appropriate amount of data for these implementations. mura is a database that was made available by stanford university for testing purposes in a target of achieving a best model for detecting bone abnormalities. our paper mainly focuses on the advancement in medical imaging technologies targeting the diagnosis at the level of experts for improving health care access. we used python, as a programming tool, and fastai, to process images and implement the model for abnormality detection. the proposed model follows a feed forward network resulting in a good accuracy rate.","x-ray, neural network, python","We have able to achieve a kappa score of 0.674 with an accuracy of 0.84. It doesn't seem a lot but a lot of improvements can be brought to the model with further increase in the number of layers and change in hyperparameters. We can see that it's possible to build the models of deep learning in the field of health, and in particular in radiology. There has been a great outcome from the model and it shows promise in helping radiologists diagnose diseases present in x-ray images better. It would be possible to build a much better model if we have enough expertise in the specific field. Having expertise in the field helps us understand the features much better and thus selection of hyper parameters much easier. It also helps in optimizing the images and better augmentation of data in initial phases. We can also hear from some of the machine learning experts that it’s completely possible to replace the radiologist if we can build a model that can predict with more accuracy, but the truth is far from that. It’s really impossible to replace radiologists but we can surely say that we can see the use of Artificial Intelligence in every corner of the field. Recent developments such as portable ultrasound machines will help further to push the AI into the field Radiology. As precision is increasing along with the decrease in the price of GPUs we can expect the need for automation more than ever. When computation becomes more affordable and available we can expect many more algorithms that could teach 2397","meghna hooda and shravankumar bachu department of computer science srm university delhi ncr, haryana hoodameghna@gmail.com, shravan2311@hotmail.com surjeet dalal department of computer science srm university delhi ncr, haryana surjeet.d@srmuniversity.ac.in piya ghosh department of industrial and management engineering indian institute of technology kanpur, uttar pradesh piyagh@iitk.ac.in","References

359,Analysis Of Schedule Rates For Bridge And Road Works In  India Using Solid Transportation Problem,"in this paper we used solid transportation problem to analyze the cost of raw materials which are used for road and bridge works in pwd, west bengal. we all are aware of the classical transportation problem which involves only two components - supply and demand where a homogenous product is transported from various sources to different destinations in such a way that total transportation cost is minimum. but in real life situation mode of transportation plays an important role on transportation cost. from the practical point of view, an increase in transportation cost may also increase the selling price of commodity. so, keeping this in mind we can give our effort to slash down total transportation cost which in turn may reduce the selling price. that is why the mode of transportations is taken into the account in transportation problem and this causes the emergence of concept of solid transportation. solid transportation problem (stp) involves three components – supply, demand and capacity of conveyance. here the transportation cost is optimized by delivering a homogeneous commodity from various sources to different destinations in different conveyances. if there are m number of origins, n number of destinations and p number of conveyances, then for classical tp, no of feasible solutions is m+n-1, whereas for stp, number of feasible solutions is m+n+p-2. for making the problem generalized we have collected the data from pwd, government of west bengal. they published a rate book which includes different types of rates for different material which are used for construction in west bengal.here we are taking data from the ‘schedule of rates’ for road and bridge works, published by the superintending engineer building planning circle.",,We have obtained an optimal transportation schedule and the corresponding minimum transportation cost.

The paper evaluates this significant challenge in healthcare by understanding the nature of the problem and its potential causes. As highlighted throughout the paper, unwarranted variations may have an impact on optimal resource use, patient care and costs. Reducing this type of variation requires better knowledge of all the primary factors that are summarised in this study. Future research can zoom in each factor and identify all potential root causes in a systematic way in which industrial engineering tools can be implemented, such as lean and system modelling techniques. Such tools and methods can help identify sources of variations to optimize resource utilization and implement evidence-based practices in healthcare. Though this study is mainly based on the literature review covering this topic, further study can elaborate on the findings in an existing healthcare setting. Such a study can gather qualitative and quantitative data together to make insightful suggestions and develop better tools for variation reduction to optimize resource utilization and service delivery. 975","raja jayaraman, mecit can emre simsekler department of industrial & systems engineering khalifa university of science & technology abu dhabi, uae 100040099@ku.ac.ae ; 100049392@ku.ac.ae ; afraa.alsereidi@ku.ac.ae ; 100050163@ku.ac.ae ; 100040202@ku.ac.ae ; raja.jayaraman@ku.ac.ae ; emre.simsekler@ku.ac.ae zehra canan araci abu dhabi school of management abu dhabi, uae z.araci@adsm.ac.ae samer ellahham heart & vascular institute, cleveland clinic abu dhabi abu dhabi, uae ellahas@clevelandclinicabudhabi.ae","References

361,Cross Docking Network With Multiple Types Of Trucks  Takashi Irohara,"in this research, a distribution network that trucks transport various products including perishable foods from some suppliers to some stores are considered. in this distribution network, there are multiple cross docking centers. cross docking is a logistic management strategy in which products delivered by inbound trucks from suppliers are immediately loaded to outbound trucks to stores in same day. because products are not stored for a long term in cross docking center, cross docking center can save operation cost, reduce inventory space, shorten delivery lead time from supplier to store and avoid loss of sales opportunities due to deterioration of food etc. a distribution network that has multiple cross docking centers is called the cross docking network. this research considers effective truck transportation among cross docking centers in cross docking network. the main difference from the previous truck scheduling paper of cross docking network is that this research selects truck type considering temperature control zone (normal, chilled and frozen) of the products to be transported. we propose a mixed integer programming (mip) with an objective function which is to minimize total transportation cost among cross docking centers. and this research decides truck type, truck size, destination, quantity of loaded product and departure time to cross docking center. we show numerical experiment results using real data transported among cross docking centers and discuss the difference between the current and proposed transportation.","(12 font) logistics, optimization",,"department of information and communication sciences sophia university chiyoda-ku, tokyo 102-8554, japan aali@ltu.edu, dreimer@ltu.edu",

364,Screening Variables Using Computer Experiments: An  Application Using A Simulated Furnace,"despite advances in computer hardware and software capabilities, the expense of running experiments in computer models of a complex industrial equipment is still a relevant issue. to minimize it, experiments must be statistically designed and critical variables identified using appropriate analysis methods. in the study presented here, several easy- to-implement yet effective data analysis methods were used for identifying the variables that must be measured with more accurate devices and methods to estimate the energy efficiency of a billets reheating furnace. a furnace’s simulator was used to perform the experiments and results analysis shows that oxygen percentage in the combustion gases, fuel flow in the burners, and combustion air temperature are critical variables for quantifying furnace’s energy efficiency.","audit, climate, environment, factorial","As the trend in technology favors a shorter product development cycle and a quicker reaction to market opportunities, shorter-duration non-sequential experiments will become more popular in engineering. However, practitioners (engineers, researchers, …) cannot ignore that valid and practical conclusions drawn from experimental studies depend to a large extent on the way how the data were collected. To try out many settings of an input variable in a ""what if"" scenario or testing many variables simultaneously in an unstructured way to achieve a specified objective are counterproductive practices. To appropriately plan and run statistically designed experiments is a more structured, faster, cheaper, and reliable practice for that purpose at the systems design and manufacturing stages. The operation and the energy efficiency maximization of systems supported on user’s empirical knowledge is an unsustainable practice. Thus, even when it is not possible to perform experiments in industrial environment, due to technical, economic, lack of resources, or other reasons, running statistically designed experiments in a computer model and analyzing the results with tested and validated methods is an efficient approach for maximizing the systems performance. This study shows that fractional factorial designs and easy-to-implement methods for screening are alternatives to more sophisticated approaches for designing and analyzing results from computer models. Al-Shiha and Yang’s, Dong’s, and Benski’s methods are structurally different, efficient, and easy-to-implement in Excel by those who are not experts in statics and computation. Moreover, they can supplement or replace the popular Half-normal probability plot. In this case study, all the analysis methods lead to the same conclusion so one can assume their result confidently. In this study a computer model of a billets reheating furnace was used, and it was possible to conclude, only with 16 out of 64 experiments, that the percentage of O2 in the combustion gases (v2) is the variable with the greatest influence on the furnace’s energy efficiency. Its effect is 2.5 times higher than that of fuel flow in the burners (v1) and 6 times higher than that of combustion air temperature (v3). The monitoring and measurement as accurate as possible of the v2 value is determinant in the furnace’s energy efficiency evaluation, but a similar approach is required to variables v1 and v3. Results analysis provides evidence that v2 and v1 should be set at the low level, while v3 should be set at the high level. All the other variables must be set at low level. For future work, it is suggested further studies to identify the optimal value for v1, v2 and v3. To validate the presented results to other furnace zones is also recommended.

366,"The Impact Of Command Buttons, Entry Fields, And  Graphics On Single Usability Metric (Sum)","in recent years, the growth of internet has reached many organizations. web sites become an avenue for companies to widen their market and reduce facility cost. this calls for the need to develop websites that are more user-friendly, especially for government-operated sites where a large portion of the population is required to be a user. a case study on the professional regulation commission: licensure examination and registration information system (prc: leris) was conducted. the single usability metric (sum) was used to encapsulate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction score of the said web site. primarily, this paper presents a framework containing design factors seeking to address different design issues. this paper aims to improve the sum by implementing the improvements on the design factors. a new design was developed to compare the sum with the existing website. the increase in the sigma level indicated the evidence of effectiveness of the proposed framework.","usability testing, web design","The formulated hypotheses concerning the command buttons, entry fields, and graphics were evidenced through comparison between the SUM of Design 0 and 1. The improved value of SUM verified the usefulness of the established framework, specifically the design factors. Most of the metrics increased from Design 0 to 1 except task completion rate. Despite this, the improvement on other metrics greatly affected the SUM which significantly increased from 2.05 to 2.50. This denotes that researchers and web designers can use this study as a basis in achieving a successful website design. 6. Recommendation Given the contributions of this study, the design was still not able to reach the 3-sigma level. It is necessary to conduct further study on the site and uncover opportunities for improvement. Other area of exploration can be on implementation of the design factors in different website which can strongly justify the effectiveness of the framework. Further, the design must be further iterated to achieve a higher SUM reaching up to 6-sigma level. In relation to this, a more extensive review of literature must be done to uncover more design factors.

367,"The Interactional Effects Of Page Layout, User Workload,  And Lists In Improving The Single Usability Metric","with the rise of the digital age, people are increasingly exposed to the visual environment such as online websites that commonly contain usability issues. this study established a framework for improving the usability of an online birth certificate application website as measured through the single usability metric (sum), with completion rate, error rate, satisfaction, and task times as usability metrics. this is done by incorporating the concepts and guidelines provided by the design factors such as page layout, user’s workload, and lists. usability testing was conducted to gather quantitative information for measuring the usability metrics, which were standardized to obtain the sum of the current design. the design factors were then analyzed and improvements were applied to develop a new design. a follow-up usability testing for the new design was conducted and results showed that the sum increased from 1-sigma to 3- sigma level. the framework consisting of the design factors on web design development is deemed effective in improving the usability of a website.","usability, web design, usability design","The framework consisting of the design factors on web design development are deemed effective in improving the SUM score of the website. Based on the usability tests conducted, all the three hypotheses were proved to be true. The SUM of the birth certificate application website increased from 1-sigma to 3-sigma level. Improving from 1 to 3-sigma would mean decreasing the percentage of defects by 62%. With a process sigma of 3, there will be 66,807 defects per million or 6.7% percentage defects. In general, a sigma level of at least three is desirable for organizations. 54","gabriel john l. de leon, joana patrice m. gratuito, and ronaldo v. polancos industrial engineering department de la salle university manila, philippines gabriel_deleon@dlsu.edu.ph, joana_gratuito@dlsu.edu.ph, ronaldo.polancos@dlsu.edu.ph","References

368,Multi-Cyclic Scheduling Of Identical Parts In An N-Machine  No-Wait Robotic Cell,this paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to determine the best average cycle time for multi- degree cyclic scheduling in a no-wait robotic cell producing identical parts using n-machines and one robot to perform handling operations. we make a conjecture that the best average cycle time is always produced by a k-degree cyclic schedule. the problem is np-hard in nature and is solved using a brute-force method to obtain the exact solution. a numerical example is used to analyze the model and the proposal is validated through computational results obtained. the sensitivity analysis performed based on different parameters is used to obtain insights and implications of the model.,"average cycle time, np-hard, no-wait","This paper gives a few new results for scheduling in a no-wait robotic cell. The results obtained are convincing and it justifies the proposal. Multi-degree cyclic schedules are very useful when it comes to the scheduling of robotic cells that operates for very long periods of time. The results give the optimal value of 𝑘𝑘, which is of high significance for industrial applications and has immense theoretical value. This paper proves that the best optimal cyclic schedule is obtained from a cyclic schedule with 𝑘𝑘≤(𝑁𝑁−1)!. For future research, the mathematical model can be extended to analyze whether the same proposition stands in the case of a robotic cells working on a different parts scenario. Also, studies can be performed to analyze the validity of the results in the case of robotic cells having N>4. Algorithms with lower time complexity can be developed to solve the model, which will make the model more productive in an industrial environment.","dhirendra prajapati1, arjun r harish2, saurabh pratap5 department of mechanical engineering, indian institute of information technology, design & manufacturing, jabalpur, india *pdhirendra15@gmail.com, arjun.harish@iiitdmj.ac.in, s.pratapiitkgp@gmail.com mengdi zhang3 school of internet of things , nanjing university of posts and telecommunications, nanjing 210003, people’s republic of china mdzhang@njupt.edu.cn, yash daultani4 department of operations management, indian institute of management, lucknow, india yash.daultani@gmail.com,",

City logistics modelling and urban freight routing and optimization and identified the available approaches taken in terms of the modelling perspectives. It was found that there is a gap existing in modelling and optimizing using the multi objective and uncertainty for two-echelon city logistic modelling. Mostly the models and frameworks discussed here tries to link the end to supply chains and highlights the importance of integrating all the stakeholders in planning. but the attention to optimization of road network in two echelon vehicle routing under city logistics needs to be improved. Also on the other extreme there is optimization approaches looking to advanced freight distribution systems. However, there are many stages to be considered before these are fully employed and still there are challenges for a methodology in planning and building an operational model. It was identified that less attention has been given to modelling the effects of dynamic environments within a road network, variability of travel times and road capacity. The effect of different transportation scenarios will be further researched through a development of a simulation model. 6.","m.m. warnakulasuriya, d.h.h. niwunhella, l.d.j.f. nanayakkara and ruwan wickramarachchi department of industrial management university of kelaniya sri lanka warnakul_im14025@stu.kln.ac.lk, hirunin@kln.ac.lk, julian@kln.ac.lk, ruwan@kln.ac.lk",
372,Optimization Models In Aircraft Assignment And Airline  Disruption Management – A Systematic Review Of,"in an airline, fleet-related assignment decisions are crucial to the overall airline profitability and these are being subjected to increasing complexities with time. aircraft assignments are concerned with the allocation of a profitable aircraft to flights, given the constraints of airline fleet and flights the airline operates; the objective is to maximize airline profitability. a large range of constraints related to operations, passengers, airports etc. are to be satisfied in such an allocation. initial fleeting decisions so made are often unable to complete as planned owing to the highly unpredictable, interdependent and regulated environment airlines operate in. airlines almost never experience a day without disruptions, as observed in the research conducted. fleet re-assignment aims at minimizing the cost of the disruption while ensuring operational continuity by using remaining resources and satisfying the additional constraints thus created. this study presents optimization models related to fleet assignment and re-assignment, adapted from operations research literature with their applicability analyzed, constraints considered and performance evaluated. the review brings up the need to address specific operational constraints of airlines; especially those of medium scale, taking aircraft seating configurations and specifics into consideration in the models to enhance practicality, in addition to accommodating real needs of airlines such as handling parallel disruptions.",fleet reassignment,"This paper serves as a guide to identifying logical and defined models available in the areas of aircraft assignment and re-assignment, systematically.

378,Developing A Rectifying Inspection Plan With Repetitive  Group Sampling Based On Loss-Based Capability Index,"in the field of quality assurance, acceptance sampling plan is a widely-used method which applies statistical and quality control concept. it provides an efficient way to decide whether to accept or reject the lot under the allowable risks without having a full inspection of all products. to reduce the average sample number or inspection cost, many scholars have proposed various acceptance sampling plans over the years. rectifying inspection plan is a sampling system which can help to provide the quality assurance of the incoming product lots to the custom. in rectifying inspection plan, only a sample of n units will be inspected and the defective units should be replaced by non-defective one if the lot is accepted. instead, the remaining units will be 100% inspected once the lot is rejected by the rectifying inspection. process capability indices (pcis) is a practical statistical tool to provide the information of the ability of a manufacturing process or procedure to meet specification limit. juran (1974) proposed the first pci, process precision index ( pk c ) in 1986 and kane (1986) proposed another index, pk c , a yield-based process capability index, which is one of the most popular pcis. however, since the degree of deviation from center of the process is not considered when evaluating process performance in the traditional capability indices, the concept of loss-based capability index pm c was developed based on the taguchi’s loss function. for the propose to minimize the number of average total inspection, we consider a variable rectifying inspection plan with repetitive group sampling based on loss-based capability index pm c . the proposed pm c -based vrrgs plan has three parameters, ( ) , , a r n k k to be solved. in order to protect both producer and consumer, the probability of acceptance cannot be less than 1-α when the quality level reaches acceptable quality level (aql) while the probability of acceptance should be less than β when the quality level is at rejectable quality level (rql). therefore, we use minimizing ati as objective function and producer’s and consumer’s risk as two constraints to build an optimization model. through this model, the required unknown parameter ( , , ) a r n k k can be solved. lastly, the performance of the proposed vrrgs plan is also discussed with operating characteristic (oc) curve, ati and aoq in this article. for example, the performance comparison between vrrgs plan and vrss plan is tabulated. the results show that the ati required by vrrgs plan is smaller than required by vrss plan under the same condition. also, since the slope of oc curve of proposed vrrgs plan is larger 60",,,"chieh-hui ku department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university no. 101, section 2, kuang-fu road, hsinchu, taiwan s107034538@m107.nthu.edu.tw chien-wei wu department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university no. 101, section 2, kuang-fu road, hsinchu, taiwan",
379,A New Variable-Type Skip-Lot Sampling Plan Based On The  Process Capability Index,"as technologies develop rapidly nowadays, managing and improving the quality of products have become important issues in manufacturing industries. acceptance sampling plan is a quality management tool which has been commonly used in practice to provide reliable decision rules in lot sentencing. owing to the availability and efficiency of acceptance sampling plan, various acceptance sampling plans are proposed to handle different situations. skip-lot sampling plan (sksp) has been used extensively in the manufacturing industries for inspecting a successive series of lots or bulk materials. it takes the quality history into consideration and inspects only a fraction of the submitted lot. on the other hand, repetitive group sampling plan (rgsp) gives the submitted lots the chance of resampling which is helpful for maintaining long-term cooperation between the producer and the consumer. compared with single sampling plan (ssp), both sksp and rgsp can obtain a smaller average sample number (asn) in inspection. process capability indices (pcis) is another common tool in the field of quality management that has been used to measure the performance of manufacturing process. the advantage of pcis is that it is a dimensionless tool and is useful to quantify the process capability. among pcis, pk c is the most popular one in manufacturing industries because it not only considers both precision and accuracy of the process but also gives the estimation of the process yield. in recent years, scholars have applied pcis in acceptance sampling plans. the pci-based sampling plan can improve accuracy of inspection by using the exact sampling distribution. to consolidate the advantage of sksp, rgsp and pcis, this study develops a modified version of sksp based on pk c where rgsp is used as the reference plan. the optimization model of the proposed plan is constructed to minimize the average sample number and fulfill the quality and risk requirements by both producers and consumers. moreover, the performance of the proposed plan are compared with the conventional ssp and sksp.",,,"i-ting wei department of industrial engineering and engineering management, national tsing hua university, hsinchu, taiwan no. 101, section 2, kuang-fu road, hsinchu, taiwan wei40626@gmail.com chien-wei wu department of industrial engineering and engineering management, national tsing hua university, hsinchu, taiwan no. 101, section 2, kuang-fu road, hsinchu, taiwan cweiwu@ie.nthu.edu.tw",
380,Generalized Confidence Intervals For Assessing Process  Performance Based On Quality Yield Index,"in recent years, technology has improved dramatically, and consumers’ demands for quality have become higher. therefore, many scholars have investigated in designing advanced process capability indices for measuring the process performance with extremely low defect rate. process yield is a commonly used tool in manufacturing industry to evaluate process performance. however, process yield only consider if the product falls within the specification limits and assume the products which meet the specification limits have the same quality. to remedy for this situation, a more advanced and customer-orientated index, called quality yield index ( ) qy , was proposed. quality yield index takes quality loss into consideration by penalizing yield when the product characteristic deviates from the target value. unfortunately, the sampling distribution of the estimated qy is too complicated, which makes it difficult to establish the exact confidence interval. therefore, several approaches for constructing confidence intervals of the index qy have been presented including approximate distribution approach (ad) and bootstrap approach. approximate distribution method is constructed by subtracting the upper bound of expected relative process loss from the lower bound of process yield and can also be view as a conservative estimation method. bootstrap method is a useful technique for estimating sampling distribution no matter what the exact population distribution is. in this paper, we apply the concept of generalized pivotal quantities to construct the generalized confidence interval (gci) for qy . in order to examine the performance of gci method, a series of simulations are conducted and compared with the existing methods in terms of coverage rate and the average value of lower confidence bound (lcb). the simulation results indicate that gci method always performs the best for calculating lcb of qy . as a result, the gci method is recommended in practical situations for assessing the process performance based on the quality yield index.",quality yield,,"meng-tzu lin department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university no. 101, section 2, kuang-fu road, hsinchu, taiwan s107034539@m107.nthu.edu.tw chien-wei wu department of industrial engineering and engineering management national tsing hua university no. 101, section 2, kuang-fu road, hsinchu, taiwan cweiwu@ie.nthu.edu.tw",

384,"Vehicle Routing Problem For Multi-Product Cross-Docking  Aldy Gunawan1, Audrey T. Widjaja1, Benjamin Gan Kok Siew1, Vincent F. Yu2, Panca","cross-docking is a logistic technique that can reduce costs occurred in a supply chain network while increasing the flow of goods, thus shortening the shipping cycle. inside a cross-dock facility, the goods are directly transferred from incoming vehicles to outgoing vehicles without storing them in-between. our research extends and combines this cross-docking technique with a well-known logistic problem, the vehicle routing problem (vrp), for delivering multiple products and addresses it as the vrp for multi- product cross-docking (vrp-mpcd). we developed a mixed integer programming model and generated two sets of vrp-mpcd instances, which are based on vrpcd instances. the instances are solved by a commercial software ampl with cplex solver. the findings show that the small instances can be solved optimally by cplex. however, larger instances cannot be solved optimally within predefined computational times.","cross-docking, multiple products","This research introduces the extension of the VRPCD, the so-called VRP for multi-product cross-docking (VRP- MPCD), which consider the presence of multiple products in a supply chain network instead of single product (as in VRPCD). In order to solve the VRP-MPCD, a mixed integer programming model has been formulated. We consider several constraints with respect to the suppliers and customers, such as the number of vehicles to be used, delivery and pickup processes for multiple products, planning horizon for the entire process, and the vehicle capacity. We further modify the well-known VRPCD benchmark instances to consider multiple products, so-called VRP-MPCD instances. The VRP-MPCD instances are then solved by our formulated mixed integer programming model by using a commercial software AMPL with CPLEX solver. Optimal solutions for the first set of the VRP-MPCD instances with 10-nodes can be obtained. However, the experiments show that it takes a longer computational time of over an hour to solve the problem when we tested with 30-nodes instances. Therefore, future work may include how to design heuristics that provide good solutions and solves the problem more efficiently. Statistical tests need to be conducted in order to evaluate the performance of heuristics. The heuristics can be utilized to solve real industry data that possibly include a larger number of nodes. Another direction for future work is to validate that the presence of cross-docking facility could really reduce the transportation costs occurred when delivering products from suppliers to customers.

385,Measure Of Bullwhip Effect In A Closed-Loop Supply Chain  With Two Retailers Under Price-Sensitive Non-Arma,"the paper considers a closed-loop supply chain with one supplier, one manufacturer and two retailers, in which the customer demand is assumed to be price-sensitive. we induce retail price in the demand through an auto-regressive moving average (arma) pricing process, and characterize the customer demand by an auto-regressive non-standard arma(1,1) process. we use an order-up-to (out) inventory policy with minimum mean square error (mmse) forecasting scheme and measure the bullwhip effect at each echelon of the closed-loop supply chain. with the help of numerical simulation, we recognize that the bullwhip effect or the anti-bullwhip effect may occur depending on critical values of parameters of the underlying demand process. we observe that the bullwhip effect at the manufacturer is affected by retailer’s market share. moreover, a remanufacturing process in the reverse channel and a steady pricing mechanism for the product can significantly reduce the bullwhip effect at different stages of the closed- loop supply chain.",bullwhip effect,"In this paper, we investigate the bullwhip effect at each echelon of a closed-loop supply chain which consists of two retailers, one manufacturer, one supplier and one third party collector. We have assumed that the customer demand is influenced by retail price. We have incorporated the price dynamics in demand through an ARMA(1,1) pricing process. The market demand is then reduced to a non-standard ARMA(1,1) process. We have observed from the numerical results that the bullwhip effect occurs at each stage if it occurs in the first stage. On the other hand, if an anti-bullwhip occurs at the first stage, it may not propagate through all upstream stages. We have further observed that the remanufacturing decision in the reverse channel significantly reduces the bullwhip effect at the manufacturer stage. Furthermore, a steady price mechanism can considerably reduce the bullwhip effect at all stages of the supply chain. In this paper, we have assumed deterministic lead time at all stages. Future research may relax this assumption and consider stochastic lead time to investigate the bullwhip effect for a more realistic closed-loop supply chain.","demand process bibhas c. giri department of mathematics jadavpur university, kolkata 700032, india bcgiri.jumath@gmail.com",
