In addition, the importance of social media marketing could be evidenced, considering that a good campaign and all its dimensions directly impact the consumer's final purchase decision. This was reflected in the survey results that defined such correlation in addition to the results that indicated that people preferred online sales channels, promotions and using easy social networks. Therefore, it is believed that this will be a future sales method and the new trend to follow.","pablo farro-gómez de la torre, matias zamorano-ramos, martin collao-diaz, juan carlos quiroz-flores and alberto flores-pérez facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, lima, perú 20170548@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20172823@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, mcollao@ulima.edu.pe, jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe, alflores@ulima.edu.pe",
3,Optimal Redesign Of The Organisation Structure Of A Steam  Power Plant,"the purpose for which an organisation is established usually determines how the organisation will be set up in terms of office space, plant requirement and layout (if any), organisation structure, management philosophy to mention a few. this research was carried out to apply established quantitative methods to the redesign and optimisation of the organisation structure of a steam power plant. this is in dissonance with usual empirical strategies that were deployed in the past. the existing organisation structure was examined in light of the work content. this was used to estimate the number of operation level personnel (n0) and the human dynamic interactions rate (λ, μ). these estimates were then used to solve and maximise the personnel utilisation objective function (h). it was a non-linear constraint maximisation problem. the organisation’s operating labour man-hours was found to be 98285.149 and the operation level personnel (n0) was found to be 135 persons supervised and managed by 14 and 5 persons respectively. after optimisation, the redesigned organisation structure had a personnel utilisation of 97.91% and a personnel cost saving of 49.6% which led to the conclusion that the redesigned structure outperformed the existing structure.","optimisation, operations design",Personnel utilisation mathematical expression was formulated in terms of organisation design variables and parameters and applied as a design objective function. This confirmed the practicality of applying the quantitative approach to solving the organisation design problem. The redesigned organisation structure was compared to the organisation’s existing structure and it performed better than the existing structure. This gives credence to the viability of the quantitative approach as a tool for organisation’s design optimisation.,"oluwasegun akadri technical solutions, risk management and assurance department egbin power plc lagos, nigeria oluwasegun.akadri@egbin-power.com adepeju a. opaleye department of industrial and production engineering university of ibadan ibadan, nigeria. aa.opaleye@ui.edu.ng",

7,Appropriate Parameters Of 3D Food Printing From Gelatinbased Mixtures,"3d printing (3dp) technology, an additive manufacturing part layer by layer, has been widely used in various industries for prototype fabrication. in this project, the 3dp was utilized to investigate appropriate parameters for food fabrication. the objective was to determine processing factors that affected the quality of 3d printed specimens using the design of experiments (doe). gelatin-based food, one of the food mixtures commonly used in 3d food printing, was chosen as a case study. independent variables consisting of print speed, flow rate, and printing temperature determined their contributions to specimen variation in weight and dimension. the result indicated that all these key factors significantly affect weight accuracy. however, only print speed and temperature affect the dimension accuracy of the printed food specimen. furthermore, the optimal dimensions and weight accuracy conditions were found at 11.21 mm/s of print speed, 43.65 mm3/s of flow rate, and printing temperature at 35°c, resulting in 0% error on weight and volume of the 3d printed food product.","3d food printing, print speed, flow rate","From this study, 3DP technology can be successfully employed for food processing. The gelatin-based material was used as a printed food, containing 10.00 grams of gelatin, 25.00 g of water, 20.25 g of sweetener, 20.00 g of soy protein, 0.50 g of sodium alginate, and 75.00 g of coconut milk. With this material, the optimal printing speed was found at 11.22 mm/ s, flow rate equals 43.66 mm3/s, and printing temperature equals 35.93 °C where the food product had a standard deviation in weight and volume was 14. 94 and 15. 33, respectively. These fabrication parameters indicated the weight and volume errors equal to 0%. However, considering each dimension along the X Y and Z axis showed that the printed product has a lower value on height (Z-axis), while the size on the X Y plane is larger. The collapse of material could be the reason of this inaccuracy in product geometry. Further investigation to verify proper printing conditions and the rheology property of food prining materials were pursued to develop a 3D food printing system with accurate dimensions and volume.

8,The Impact Of Industry 4.0 On The Workforce Within A  Business Banking: Projects And Operations Environment,industry 4.0 is a concept that is critical for organizations to adopt to remain competitive. it is an entire new way of breaking the traditional approaches of operation in an organization. the changes brought about will also impact the workforce with the banking industry. this study sought to evaluate the impact on the workforce of the implementation of industry 4.0 in a business banking: projects and operations environment in a particular bank. a qualitative research approach was undertaken using semi-structured interviews with eight subject matter experts within the unit. the business unit is well advanced in implementing disruptive technologies and at a moderate level in terms of transforming current processes and operations. the business unit also transforms existing architecture to suit the design principles of industry 4.0. all these changes impact the workforce in the business unit such that it requires a modification of the working environment as well as modification of job profiles for both the lower and higher skilled workforce,"industry 4.0, digitization","The findings suggest that the Business Unit is aggressively seeking to implement disruptive technologies and digitally transform current processes and operations in order to remain competitive, improve internal capability, improve client experience and to reduce operational costs. Due to the changes brought about through digital transformation, in conforming to Industry 4.0 standards, the findings resulted in the development of 3 themes particularly related to the impact of the workforce in this setting. The research suggests that there would be changes to the working environment such that it requires existing employees to broaden their skill set to be able to adapt in this environment. There would also be increased collaboration and changes to the types of teams required to successfully implement digital solutions. The digital behaviour being driven in the current working environment was found to create both opportunities and threats for the workforce. Opportunities were found in new roles and the knowledge gained from working with new technology but also for employees that have content specific knowledge in which their roles can be transformed to subject matter experts or key decision makers. The use of technology in the Business Unit was found to free up capacity for both the lower and higher skilled workforce to perform more valuable tasks. The threat, however, is for the employees unwilling to adapt, with the concern around the loss of jobs and broadening the skills gap thus being a constraining factor to digital transformation. The findings outlined that it is not only the responsibility of the Business Unit to provide training platforms for employees but it is key for employees to take on the responsibility of making use of the training platforms and materials provided to them so that they can be transitioned into the new job roles offered rather than becoming redundant.","jared lee subramanien school of mechanical, industrial and aeronautical engineering university of the witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa bernadette sunjka school of mechanical and industrial engineering university of witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa berndatte.sunjka1@wits.ac.za",
9,An E-Commerce Marketing Decision Matrix Tool  Using Consumer-Behavior Analysis During,"nowadays, filipino online consumers are turning towards e-commerce for retail acquisition, especially in the pandemic where micro, small, and medium enterprises or msmes are affected. msmes make up 99.5% of the total businesses in the country. due to the pandemic, most msmes in the country faced adversities that resulted in temporary closures or running on limited operations in compliance with the government protocols imposed for restricting the spread of the virus. the proponents focused on the wholesale and retail sectors since they are the most affected by the setbacks brought on by the pandemic. hence, the study aims to identify the significant factors affecting consumers’ purchase intention. the results gathered are analyzed using exploratory factor analysis to assess the underlying factors present in the study. a total of thirteen (13) variables were selected from the review of related literature. exploratory factor analysis revealed that only nine (9) variables were significant. moreover, the nine variables were divided into two (2) resulting factors. the two resulting underlying factors were analyzed based on the relationship of the variables under these factors and were named present hedonism and platform reliability through thematic analysis. the proponents utilized analytic hierarchy process to determine the designated weights per variable under the two factors to complete the e-commerce marketing decision matrix tools. the e-commerce marketing decision matrix tools would help msmes maximize their digital footfall and profits.","decision matrix, msme","and Recommendations The present study aims to institute a decision matrix tool for MSME wholesale and retail owners in aiding them with their marketing strategies and maximizing their digital footfall using the marketing decision matrix. The study started with thirteen (13) variables in question. IBM SPSS results revealed that the variables Social Media, Trust and Security, Price Comparison, and Variety are insignificant factors or outliers in the study, having communality values of less than 0.4. The remaining variables were analyzed using Total Variance Explained and Scree Plot in identifying the two (2) underlying factors present. The proponents utilized Thematic Analysis and coined the two underlying factors as (1) Present Hedonism and (2) Platform Reliability. The first factor consists of Electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM), Convenience, Control, and Hedonic Values. On the other hand, the second factor incorporates Anxiety, Materialism, Actual and Post Purchase Behavior, Openness, and Enjoyment towards the Channel. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used wherein the researchers designed decision matrices and individual interviews with MSME owners to generate and assign weights in the said factors. Afterward, the proponents established the marketing decision matrix tools following the study’s primary objectives. Lastly, the proponents believe that through the marketing decision matrix tools, e-Commerce business owners, specifically MSME owners transitioning from a brick-and-mortar setting, would be able to benefit significantly from the decision matrices because these tools would allow them to increase their digital footfall through the marketing strategies that would result from these tools in compliance with the decision criterion provided. The final product of the study can be seen in this document; Marketing Decision Matrix Tool Instructions. Future studies could improve the methodology by incorporating other factors influencing purchase intention and identifying who represents most of the e-commerce consumer profile, preferably male and female respondents, based on recent studies and statistical information.

10,Commercial Segment Competitiveness In A Market  Disrupted By Digital Banks In South Africa,"the south african banking market has been largely dominated by the big four traditional banks i.e. fnb, absa, standard bank and nedbank, prior to the implementation of digital banks. the introduction of these new entrants has meant the domination is starting to cease as many of the consumer and small & medium enterprise companies that banked with traditional banks are migrating to these entrants. this is because of the affordable pricing options and contextual solutions they offer, which are enabled through the use industry 4.0 technologies. with this in mind, a qualitative study was conducted to unpack what the commercial segment of a particular bank, bank a, can do to bridge the digital divide opened by digital banks. the study concluded that bank a should accelerate the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies to drive operational efficiencies and cost reduction, optimize business processes, apply agile project delivery methodologies to market solutions quicker than their competitors. this could be achieved by implementing a hybrid core banking application to enable the bank to adopt a progressive modernization strategy by using the best of legacy core system coupled with the new core banking application and collaborating with fintech companies to drive contextual solution delivery.",digital banks,"From the study results, it may be concluded that that monthly account and transactional account fees have become important elements that drive the commercial banking segment competition. This is because of the launch of three digital banks i.e., Bank Zero, Tyme Bank and Discovery Bank in South Africa who have introduced commercial customers to the flexibility of having transactional accounts that do not require them to pay monthly fees. It is seen from the results that the commercial segment has large operational costs associated with operating and maintaining mainframe technology, having manual processes, operating branch and call center facilities, waterfall project delivery methodologies. These costs must be recovered through the customers transactional account and any other products they offer. In response the commercial segment must cut the operational costs by implementing the right industry 4.0 technologies as indicated by the results, enabling the core banking application that will benefit customers and optimizing the business processes. These implementations will enable the segment to shave off the monthly account fees and still provide the same value proposition that customers have. As such, the success of the commercial segment competing with digital banks will therefore be measured by the number of customers retained and new customers attracted because of the reduced monthly fees and the value they value proposition they have. Another important element that drives segment competition is the ability to enhance the customer experience by providing contextual solutions to meet and exceed customer needs, enabling easy to use digital channels, providing educational programmes to build customer trust and loyalty. Enhancing customer experience will also contribute to commercial segment competing with digital banks.","lebohang tshabalala school of mechanical & industrial engineering university of the witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa tshabalala.lebohang@gmail.com bernadette sunjka school of mechanical & industrial engineering university of witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa berndatte.sunjka1@wits.ac.za",

12,Risk Classification And Prediction: A Logistic Regression  Approach For Analyzing Property Risk Classes In Insurance,"risk exists in every aspect of a business, as it cannot be eliminated but rather reduced to an attainable level through the utilization of effective risk assessment techniques. risk impacts people differently, some can be seen as risk- seeking while the majority are risk-averse. for the insurance industry in particular, risk is traded and transferred to the insurance providers as insurance providers offer a shield from the exposure to risk consequences and the likelihood of loss, therefore, escalating the risk from the insured entity to the insurer for a given premium. in this research, a modern model to risk classification will be proposed for property lines insurance. the proposed model will be validated via data collected from case studies of an insurance company in the united arab emirates (uae). the model is expected to serve as a tool that helps provide better estimates of risk for various properties.","risk, insurance, property","and Future Research In summary, the paper evaluated the binary logistic regression model for predicting the risks in property lines in an insurance company. It displayed a high performance and accuracy in predicting risk for a given set of input variables regarding the properties. The model was capable of detecting majority of the points (89%) and cases accurately when comparing the predicted cases versus the observed cases in terms of risk classification. As a result, it can be concluded that this case study underlined the benefits of utilizing regression models in risk prediction, assisting the companies in making better decisions on whether they should insure a property given the level or classification of risk it falls under. Consequently, this will enhance their financial performance along with the client experience, since the insurer will be able to give the best cover option for the insured based on the outputs of the classification model. Future research can be further made on the basis of significant variables only, to see how the model will respond in terms of correct predictions.

15,System Dynamics Modeling And Simulation For Reduction Of  Scrap And Rework In An Automotive Manufacturing,"scrapping and rework are a manufacturing reality that influences the automotive manufacturing industry. this research utilizes system dynamics modeling and simulation tools to study the causalities and feedback relationships for defects which contribute to the scrapping and rework of vehicles in an automotive manufacturing company based in south africa. it also recommends remedies for scrap and rework reduction. the causes of defects were identified by consulting the company documents, and the cause and effects and improvement feedback relationship were explored using system dynamics (sd) models. the sd simulation models were created following the five steps of the system dynamics modelling process, namely problem articulation, formulation of a dynamic hypothesis; formulation of a simulation model; testing of the model; and policy design and evaluation. based on identified root causes for defects and the simulation results, resources and techniques for process improvement were recommended. the paper demonstrates the usefulness of system dynamics modelling tools for solving problems in the automotive manufacturing sector. building simulation models can reveal previously hidden relationships, provide systematic ways to analyse manufacturing defects, and allow the user to test effects of different alternative scenarios without having to make changes to the real system",system dynamics,"The purpose of this study was to identify the causes of defects and to develop a system dynamics model for studying the causalities and feedback relationships for defects that contribute to the scrapping and rework of vehicles, as well as recommend remedies for scrap and rework reduction in an automotive manufacturing company based in South Africa. The research objectives were accomplished, and the introduction of the proposed SD model can reduce defects, increase productivity and reduce overall cost. The causes of defects were identified from the company documents and the cause and effect relationships were explored using system dynamics models. The remedies for defect reduction were recommended based on the research findings and simulation results. For future research studies, the simulation models could be a starting point for defect reduction in the automotive manufacturing industry and they can be combined with actual organisation/plant data to further refine the model. Depending on the scope of the problem being investigated, the model can be further extended to include other factors such as costing per resource for process improvement, deeper detail for the causes of defects, and sub- systems for maintenance strategies. The research study has highlighted that there are limited published papers using system dynamics (SD) as a tool for problem solving in the SA automotive manufacturing sector. More research in this area is still required as SD modelling has proven to be an excellent tool for the tracing of problems to their actual root causes, assessing a system’s ability to adjust to change and to test new decisions that must be taken.

18,Applying Deep Learning For The Prediction Of Retail Store  Sales,"when it comes to brick-and-mortar retailing and e-commerce, anticipating demand accurately is one of the most important aspects in minimizing loss (through unavailability of items) and maximizing profit for any time period. this literature review aims to pursue a deeper understanding in founding a prediction model for forecasting retail sales by using deep learning techniques. the researchers gathered various papers from reputable publishers and institutions and sorted those that dealt with the use of deep learning techniques and machine learning techniques. the researchers found that the most frequent techniques used are long-short term memory and random forest for deep and machine learning respectively. thus, the researchers proposed a model using lstm with learning features inherited from common features observed through the related studies gathered and random forest as the proposed comparator or baseline model.","deep learning, machine learning, sales prediction, baseline model","In conclusion, the systematic literature review of this paper has been successful in terms of determining the deep learning techniques and machine learning techniques utilized in the chosen studies and their methods in implementing specific algorithms in testing the accuracy of the chosen prediction models as well as determining which technique has the greatest precision in forecasting and projecting future sales prediction. The study was based on 46 gathered research studies from reputable sources that have been thoroughly filtered. After the two-step filtering process, this has led to 20 relevant studies in which the set of deep learning techniques and machine learning techniques applied were considered. The filtered papers are related to our study about sales prediction with the application of deep learning techniques. Based on the 20 filtered studies, it has been identified that the most predominant deep learning technique used is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and the Random Forest (RF) for the machine learning technique.

19,Evaluation Of Database Management Systems And  Techniques Applied In Distributed Systems,"the technical solution used to improve and manage the storage and retrieval of data from databases is known as a database management system (dbms). a transaction signifies a change in the database's data. it is an activity or sequence of operations performed by a single user or application software to read or change the database's contents. a transaction can fail before all the actions in the set are completed, which is a concern. this might occur because of a power outage, a system crash, or other factors while concurrency control in a database management system is a method of controlling many actions at the same time without their interfering. to resolve these issues, the various techniques are presented in this study with discussion of techniques and algorithms used. concurrency control methods like locking, timestamps, and optimistic concurrency control can be used to handle concurrent transactions and avoid conflicts. studying a distributed database for relational (mysql) and nosql (mongodb), as well as the implementation and performance of acid transactions in nosql, is another proposal (mongodb).",retrieve,"Most distributed computer systems performed one or more interdependent or concurrent transactions. Concurrency control techniques such as Locking, Timestamps, and Optimistic Concurrency Control, and prevent conflict, can be used to manage concurrent transactions. The deadlock problem occurs in transactions when four requirements are met: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no pre-emption, and circular wait Hamied (2018). The use of cache-based query optimization to increase response time is a good alternative since it saves a lot of money and effort, especially when implementing a cache at each site instead of a single network-based cache. It has been discovered that caching is now used in homogenous distributed databases. In terms of future research, the presented approach may be used to implement heterogeneous distributed databases Rana et al. (2018). In the comparison of Relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB), MongoDB is a schema-less database with the ability to run in a distributed environment. It is ideally suited to instances when data is not precisely organized, and handling is not difficult. It may also be used in cloud services and can easily grow horizontally utilizing sharding Hamied (2018). Rather of competing, SQL and document-based databases are complementary. MongoDB is a schema-less database that may be used in a variety of applications a dispersed environment it is well positioned in situations when the data is not strictly structured and not complex to handle. MongoDB is a strong competitor/supplement to MySQL. Compared to MySQL, it outperforms SQL in various areas and scenarios. As a result, it becomes a popular database. Deari (2018). MongoDB performs better other databases in CRUD operations, especially when dealing with huge amounts of data and multiple users Pandey (2020). This study identified that several relevant studies were examined, and practically all of them concluded that NoSQL databases are a superior solution for big cloud-based applications. 7. Limitation and Future Research Future improvements and applications currently, cache is enabled. Only homogeneous distributed databases are suitable for based query optimization. This technology may be used in the future. implemented for a variety of database types Rana et al. (2018). Future researchers also will be able to examine and improve the research's limitations in comparable investigations. Another recommendation is also study on a distributed database for relational (MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB), as well as the implementation and performance of ACID transaction in NoSQL (MongoDB).","mary jane c. samonte school of information technology, mapúa university, manila, philippines mjcsamonte@yahoo.com sasky a. samonte school of information technology, mapúa university, manila, philippines saskysamonte@gmail.com",

The information on the prescription drugs prescribed by the doctors to the patients after consultation is immediately sent to the pharmacy for delivery to the patient’s home. After this has been implemented, respondents from the survey have recommended trying virtual consultations and appointments made through the web-based application. The yellow card system offered mostly to persons with disabilities and senior citizens, and the benefits it comes with given by the local government of Makati - allowing their residents to obtain free prescriptions and consultations - has proved through the documents and facts stated in this study that their current system can further be improved. The case study presents a problem in the current system with the yellow cardholders who are classified as either a person with a disability or an elderly who are considered not physically competent which is a complication in picking up their prescription medicine. This study used these problems to create a web-based application that would allow medical health tracking and medicine delivery for yellow cardholders to simplify the process for all involved. The results of the survey concluded that the web-based application developed made it possible to provide a systematic process of keeping track of the Makati residents and barangay health center patient’s prescriptions, as well as the delivery status of their upcoming prescriptions, rather than having to travel to the pharmacy repeatedly. The developed application also enabled doctors to keep track of their patient’s prescriptions if there is a need to update the prescriptions. The web-based application allows a lesser need to travel to pharmacies and consultations. This proves that the developed system reduced the need for physical contact between patients and physicians benefitted yellow cardholders who are physically incapable especially during Covid-19 restrictions or lockdown. It is also suggested to further involve more people in the study to lessen face-to-face interaction and movement especially for those not physically capable. Despite the creation of a new system, there can be further study needed for the improvements of this system that focus more on data analysis of health records that can project future legislation with informed decisions, not only in Makati City.","mary jane samonte doctor of information technology faculty member of school of information technology mapua university, manila, philippines mjcsamonte@yahoo.com timothy n. araña, kevyn john e. castro, gabrielle angeline g. uy, danielle c. samonte school of information technology, mapua university, makati city, philippines, tnarana@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kjecastro@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gaguy@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, dcsamonte@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",

23,Impact Of Variation Orders On Construction Project Cost  And Time,"variation orders are unwanted but inevitable reality of any construction project and affect project performance as they adversely affect productivity and project cost. moreover, projects with many variation orders cause the contrac- tor to achieve lower productivity levels than planned. therefore, the study is based on the impact of variation orders which adversely impact project performance in terms of cost, time, quality degradation, health and safety issues and professional relations. quantitative approach was adopted for this study. 159 questionnaires were analysed after the data was collected online via a structured questionnaire. factor analysis was conducted, correlation matrix, coeffi- cients has been conducted to ensure visibility of co-efficients greater than 0.3 and kaiser-meyer-oklim (kmo) and bartletts were conducted. from the findings it transpired that additional payment for contractors; delayed schedule completion; increases in project cost; time overruns, logistics delays also cause disputes among the professional team were some of the impacts caused by variation orders just to mentioned a few. the more the number of varia- tion orders, the more they are likely to affect the overall construction delivery cost. in fact, variation orders have both a direct and indirect effect on cost.","construction, change orders, impact, performance","Vo’s are a worldwide phenomenon, and the consequences include friction among clients, consultants, and contrac- tors. Most variations orders have a negative impact on construction performance which creates a significant finan- cial risk to clients. Also vo’s may cause painful experiences if they are not accounted for and adjudicated properly by the client quantity surveyor, furthermore, if vo’s are not properly managed may give rise to costly disputes be- tween contractor and client. The findings above clearly shows that variation orders indeed have negative impact on the overall project cost, site cost and indirect cost. Therefore, vo’s must be minimized to ensure a health, smooth operation of a project.

26,Development Of An Automated Coal Mine Methane Extraction  System,"the purpose of this project was to develop an automated coal mine methane control system for methane gas extraction from active and abandoned coal mine roofs, the lightest gas in coal mines. zimbabwe has the richest deposits of methane gas in coal beds in southern africa, which accumulates into the underground coal mines during mining operations and abandoned underground coal mines. almost 50% of the energy expended in coal mines goes to the ventilation system to ventilate the accumulated explosive gas which is also a source of clean energy. due to the lack of cost-effective technology to capture and fully harness this coal mine methane gas, its accumulations are resulting in 10+% downtime which is a huge loss to coal mining companies such as hwange colliery in zimbabwe. analysis of methane gas behavior in terms of emission and accumulation was done, circuit designing, conceptual modeling, simulations, and 3d modeling. a system was developed which could capture methane gas through a suction process. a model of the system was developed and tested which could detect, monitor, and extract coal mine methane gas. this project is recommended for methane gas extraction inactive underground and abandoned underground coal mines in zimbabwe and sub-saharan africa and right page margins and justified.","coal mine, methane extraction, keyword 3","The developed concept which can detect, control and extract methane from underground coal mines can be successfully applied in Hwange.

The Impacts Of Mother’S Internet Usage,"this study aims to investigate the impacts of the internet usage and bank account ownership on the iycf practices in indonesia. the data used was the results of the 2017 indonesia demographic and health survey. the unit of analysis was children aged 6–23 months comprising 4,880 children. the dependent variable was the iycf practices. the main independent variables were the internet usage and bank account ownership. the control variables were the age and sex of the children, mother’s education, household wealth, and place of residence. the results of the study showed that mother’s internet usage and bank account ownership had significant positive impacts on the iycf practices. children aged 6–23 months whose mothers ever used the internet and had a bank account were more likely to be well fed. older children, children with better educated mothers and better household wealth, and children who lived in urban areas were more likely to be well fed. therefore, the iycf practices improvement program in indonesia should utilize the internet to inform, educate, and communicate full iycf practices, empower mothers financially, and aim at younger children, children with lower educated mothers and lower household wealth, and children in rural areas.","stunting, feeding practice","The results of this study showed that only 42% of children aged 6–23 months in Indonesia were well fed, i.e. receiving full IYCF practices. In addition, mother’s internet usage and bank account ownership were found to have significant positive impacts on the IYCF practices in Indonesia. Higher odds of being well fed were associated with ever use of the internet and having a bank account among the mother’s. Older children, children aged 6–23 months whose mothers had better education, who came from wealthier households, and who lived in urban areas had higher odds of being well fed. Based on these findings it is recommended that in order to improve IYCF practices in Indonesia, the internet should be utilized in the IYCF practices’ information, education, and communication activities, mothers should be empowered financially, and target the program to younger children, children with lower educated mothers and lower household wealth, and children in rural areas.","and financial empowerment on the infant and young child feeding practice omas bulan samosir, dinda srikandi radjiman, flora aninditya researcher, lembaga demografi faculty of economics and business universitas indonesia omas.bulan@ui.ac.id, omasbr@yahoo.co.uk, dinda.srikandi@ldfebui.org, flora@ldfebui.org",
36,Integration Of Abc-Xyz Analysis In Inventory Management  Optimization: A Case Study In The Health Industry,"during the pandemic, the health sector has taken the lead. this is due to the growing demand for medical equipment and medications to treat covid-19, which has caused the healthcare industry to expand. manufacturing industry developments are inextricably linked to the strength of the supply chain. inventory management is a vital activity in supply chain management since, to fulfil consumer demand, especially during a pandemic like this, medical equipment supplies raw materials must be accessible to avoid stockouts, which have a serious effect. given these conditions, further investigation is required. this study aims to create an adequate inventory policy for medical items based on characteristics. inventory policy is defined by categorizing commodities using the abc and xyz classification methods integrated. based on the list of products and demand information, these things are categorized and prioritized in problem-solving to create improved and effective inventory management techniques.","pandemic covid-19, abc analysis","The integration of the accomplished ABC-XYZ analysis makes it easier to manage objects based on the criteria chosen. Activities performed by combining ABC/XYZ analysis allow for the identification of the company's goods based on the company's finances and the introduction of the amount of demand emergence. Businesses may use suitable and optimum strategies to predict inventory problems such as stockouts or missed sales with this connectivity. There are nine different categories of raw materials in all (PPSCG; PP; PPM; INKCT; PPHY; ETO30; PPHO; ETO80; PIGG) and 17 types of components (BJMI05MLK1; GLY05MLK1; NK24G05MLK1; NBLY24G05MLK1; PLJMI05MLK1; CANPT2300G05MLK1; GPT5MLK1; GPT5MLKML1; GPT5MLK1; CANPT21G5ML; CANPT22G1ML; CANPT23G3ML; GJMI05MLK1; NPT24G05MLK1; NSM24G05MLK1; PLLY05MLK1; CANPT27G005ML) which fall into the first category so that the right inventory policy for these products is a policy based on inventory stock information, where inventory reorder points are carried out or take into account the minimum limit for the amount of inventory that has been determined.

37,The Philosophy Of Integrating Technical Vocational Educational  And Training Ecosystem Into The Dynamics Of Industrial,"this paper discusses the fundamental roles of integrating tvet in industrial engineering and operational management ecosystem towards inclusive, resilient and sustainable growth. it further navigates the dichotomy confronted by africa technical and vocational education and training ecosystem created by the covid 19 pandemic. technical and vocational education and training ecosystem is depended on pracademic. migration to technology enabled learning is a mammoth task as african countries are constrained by non-availability of resources. compromisation of quality in higher education negatively affects industrial development as the two are intertwined. rebuilding and reconstructing higher and tertiary education in a transforming and disruptive environment creates a dichotomy which creates both paralysis and praxis. bold curricula rethinking, redesigning and resetting through consultative processes and elimination of disconnection and dismemberment between learning institutions, industry, political ecosystem and the cultural discourse. generally all engineering disciplines have their roots in tvet. such development require appropriate and relevant demonstrable pracademic and transferable practical skills anchored and grounded in tvet. creative industry is considered one of the most dynamic sectors of the world economy, offering innovative potential and growth opportunities for developing countries (un¶s creative economy reports, 2008, 2010, 2013). in 2020 zimbabwe embarked on educational overhaul based on the fulcrum of teaching, research, community service, innovation and industrialization which was preceded by enactment of manpower planning and development amendment number 12 of 2020. the researcher will argue that development of a vibrant technical and vocational education and training ecosystem should anchor on sound cultural and traditional discourse that enable participants and practitioners to relive, reconstruct and redevelop technical and vocational education and training ecosystem embedded in industrial engineering and operations management. industrial engineering and operations management that is grounded in cultural and traditional technical and vocational education and training ecosystem, discourse, dichotomous and dissonance is likely to be robust resilient and sustainable. the researchers will employ and deploy both quantitative and qualitative research to unpack and unbundle the philosophy of integrating technical and vocational education and training ecosystem into the dynamics of industrial engineering and operational management for resilient and sustainable economic development. to mobilize people we need to understand and embrace their culture ban ki-moon former secretary-general of the united nations (2013).","dichotomy, ecosystem","5.1 Empirical findings • Africa’s resilient and sustainable infrastructure ecosystem is rooted is foreign centric discourse. • Most projects are done without community engagement or consultations • Africa infrastructure is not resilient because it was designed and developed with colonial philosophy and it did not take in account demographic projections. • Most construction projects and mining ventures are given to foreigners who only look at the economic benefit to their countries leaving the host country in a poor state.

38,Optimum Gum Arabic Content As Bitumen Modifier In Hot  Mix Asphalt,"roads in nigeria and like any other developing country are hugely plagued with deterioration and damage due to excessive traffic beyond design load, environmental conditions and their interactions as well as low budgetary allocation for routine/preventive maintenance. in order to address the problems, researchers/practitioners in the highway community have engaged in the use of admixtures and waste material to enhance the properties of paving materials while reducing the cost of production. this study investigates the suitability of gum arabic (ga) also known as acacia gum to be used as bitumen modifier in hot mix asphalt (hma). ga is a natural material consisting or hardened sap of various species of acacia. its glue or binder property makes it a potential material for use as a modifier in hma. in order to determine the performance of asphalt concrete mix containing ga as modifier, 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5% and 10% ga (by weight of bitumen in asphalt concrete mixture) were added at bitumen contents of 4.5%, 5.5%, 6.5% and 7.5% each. marshall parameters (stability and flow) and volumetric properties of the asphalt mixtures were used to evaluate the performance of ga as modifier and determine the optimum ga content. the study revealed that asphalt concrete mixture prepared using 2.5% ga at a bitumen content of 6.5% performed better than the control sample (0% ga content) based on the evaluation parameters. this can be recommended for use in surfacing of heavily trafficked flexible pavements.","gum arabic, bitumen modifier","In this research, the influence of gum Arabic as a bitumen modifier in hot mix asphalt was investigated. Hot mix asphalt was prepared according to the Marshall mix design method. Preliminary tests were performed on all constituent materials to determine their conformity for use in hot mix asphalt according to relevant standards. The tests revealed that all the constituent materials are suitable for use in HMA. Results on Marshall analysis show that Gum Arabic at lower concentrations increases the stability and reduces flow of HMA. This improvement is attributed to increase in viscosity caused by presence of polysaccharide in GA. However, at greater concentrations of GA, an excess amount of polysaccharide resulted in decrease in stability and increase in flow of HMA samples. On volumetric properties, GA at lower concentrations increases the air voids in compacted HMA samples forming stronger lightweight asphalt concrete. HMA samples prepared with modified bitumen containing 2.5% GA showed superior performance compared to the control sample (0% GA content) and satisfy the performance requirements for use in flexible pavement surfacing (Table 6). 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 0 5 10 15 Voids filled with bitumen (%) Gum Arabic content (%) 20.5 21 21.5 22 22.5 23 23.5 24 24.5 0 5 10 15 Voids in mineral aggregate (%) Gum Arabic content (%) Figure 9.

39,Effects Of Sesame Stalk Ash (Ssa) As Partial Replacement Of  Cement In Concrete,"this work presents the results of the evaluation of sesame stalk ash (ssa) used as partial replacement for ordinary portland cement (opc) in concrete. ssa was used to replace opc by weight ranging from 0 to 20% at intervals of 5% replacement using the concrete mix ratio (1:2:4). experimental tests such as setting times, consistency, soundness, xrf and slump were carried out to determine the properties of ssa-cement paste and fresh concrete respectively. likewise, compressive strength test was carried out on 100mm cubes after 7, 14 and 28 days curing. however, from the result obtained it indicates that both the initial and final setting time increases with an increase in the percentage of sesame stalk ash (ssa). the values of soundness obtained at each replacement levels falls within the acceptable limit specified by bs en 196-3 (1995). also, xrf conducted on ssa indicate that the content of silica (sio2) is 11.636 %, aluminium oxide (al2o3) is 3.005 % and ferrous oxide (fe2o3) is 0.982 % sums up to (15.623 %) which is less than the minimum value for a good pozzolanic material. therefore, ssa is of low pozzolanic reactivity (astm c618, 2008). it was also confirmed from the research that the compressive strength of concrete decreases with an increase in ssa content. on the other hand, it increases as the curing age increases. the 5, 10, 15 and 20 % replacement of cement with ssa respectively gives a compressive strength of 15.55n/mm2, 9.08n/mm2, 6.00n/mm2, and 5.50n/mm2 at 28 days of curing. however, the 5 % replacement gives the optimum compressive strength of 15.55n/mm2.","sesame, stalk, portland, concrete",,"i. bello, t. a. sulaiman, m.m. musa, j.a. adamu department of civil eng., ahmadu bello university, zaria, nigeria belloi1040@gmail.com",
40,An Extended Period Analysis Of The Water Pipe Network  System In Calabar,"calabar as the capital of cross-river is the most populated city in the state. the present water distribution system, cross river state water board ltd(crswbl) serves an increasing population of over 605,000 persons and more(according to npc, 2021) posing an increasing water demand. however, there has been no significant improvement made to the water distribution network. an extended period simulation was performed on the crswbl distribution network to evaluate its performance with respect to hydraulic head loss, velocity, pressure and nodal demands at different times of the day using watercad and epanet. according to universal standards, a flow rate with a minimum of 0.15litrepersecond (lps) as well as a pressure head with a minimum of 15m and maximum of 70m were used as yardsticks. areas with flow rates and pressure heads that fell short of these standards were noted. both software used, watercad and epanet produced nearly the same outputs with statistically negligible differences. at the end of the study, it was concluded that the performance of the pipe distribution network in calabar under the current water demand is slightly inefficient in some areas and appropriate approaches were recommended.","water, demand, velocity, pressure","Recognizable from the analysis is the way that regions with low water pressure had high elevations, with cases around Ikot Effanga zone where some pipe intersections were laid on elevations higher than the height of the EWT. In a gravity fed distribution network, regions with such heights inside the network would probably encounter discontinuity and intermittency in water supply. Additionally, regions with the capability of pipe network infrastructural damage from water hammer instigated by high pressure were realized. The extended period simulation also mapped the flow activity of the water network inside the city. Perceptions from the outcomes likewise showed that there were altogether significantly more pipes with flow rates lower than 0.15 LPS at early afternoon in all the distribution zones, when water use is expected to be minimal or nearly insignificant. A number of pipes in the system were inadequate resulting in very low velocities at several points in the system where nodal demands were substantially low as well. This is responsible for the enormous pipe water quality reduction and blockages in the distribution system thereby reducing the general system performance. It was seen that the water distribution system in Calabar city was significantly inefficient and requires rehabilitative concerns.","professor charles chidozie nnaji, ph.d. department of civil engineering university of nigeria, nsukka enugu state, nigeria faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg south africa. chidozie.nnaji@unn.edu.ng nnaji cyrus chikwado department of civil engineering university of nigeria nsukka enugu state nigeria cyrus.nnaji.197982@unn.edu.ng",

The value of this positive coefficient parameters supports to the hypothesis. Every 1 unit increase in Global Marketing (GB) will increase the Product Sales Performance (PSP) by 0.35 level in level Likert scale 5. Every 1 level increase in Consumer Behavior (CB) will increase the Product Sales Performance (PSP) by 0.42 level in 5 level Likert scale. 6. Conclusion It is clear that Global Marketing (GB) and Consumer Behavior (CB) affect Product Sales Performance (PSP) positively and significantly within a tolerance of 5%. Planning and programs for global marketing efforts must be carried out with certainty covering all lines from top management to bottom lines. Because the global market has connected various countries and is increasingly following the dynamics of the times lately, companies must be able to control the external environment to gain a competitive advantage. Global marketing strategy plays an important role as global business oriented to connect target market segments with marketing mix elements. Global marketing orientation includes production, sales, customer, strategic marketing, and social marketing. The company must maintain the efficiency and quality of the products produced. Finally, efforts are made to integrate and standardize marketing operations across various geographic markets. Building a real feeling that individuals must have when interacting with the market environment is very important for company performance, especially sales. Consumers who can accept and feel they have the product will use the goods and services continuously. Companies must create ideas and meet daily needs. Likewise, product buying is also considered as a process in building one's attitude towards brands and products so that product sales performance increases.","sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan, tangerang-15811, indonesia john.purba@uph.edu wilson rajagukguk department of management faculty of economics and business universitas kristen indonesia, jakarta, indonesia wilson.rajagukguk@uki.ac.id",

45,The Role Of Quality Family Planning Services In  Contraceptive Switching To Long-Acting And Permanent,"the use of long-acting and permanent methods (lapm) is one way to reduce fertility rates. however, the prevalence of lapm use has decreased, while the use of non-lapm has increased significantly. the high prevalence of short-term contraceptive use increases the dynamics of contraceptive use, including contraceptive switching behavior. the switching contraceptive method will reduce unintended pregnancies if switched from a less effective way to a more practical approach. this study aims to identify the switching contraceptive methods from non-lapm to lapm and to study the relationship between quality of family planning services which consists of informed choice and family planning officer’s visit with switching contraception. the unit of analysis is short-term and traditional contraceptive use episodes during the 3-62 months before the survey among women in union age 15- 49. the dependent variable is the duration of the risk period up to the contraceptive switch to lapm. based on the results of the inferential analysis, it was found that quality of family planning services had a significant relationship with contraceptive switching from non-lapm to lapm.",lapm,"This study shows that the quality of family planning services is a factor that has a significant effect on contraceptive switching to LAPM. Family planning officer’s visit and informed choice significantly influence the possibility of family planning (FP) acceptor to switch their contraceptive method from non LAPM to LAPM. To encourage the switching of contraceptive methods to more effective ways, health workers need to increase visits to FP acceptor and increase the provision of informed choices to women who can use contraception. The government also needs to encourage more women to participate in empowerment programs, especially for family planning acceptors and couples of childbearing age. This is done as an effort to increase the role of women in decision-making about family planning use.

46,Evaluation Of Railway Ballast Degradation Using  Different Approaches,"the structural performance of ballasted railway tracks is adversely affected by the level of degradation of the ballast particles. the aggregate particles of the ballast bed undergo gradual degradation which results to an axial deformation of the railway track during the service operation. however, the study of ballast degradation has been very complex and to date, there has not been a single method that is universally accepted to quantify ballast degradation. hence, in an attempt to adequately quantify the degradation of ballast, this study compares the two most common methods used for the evaluation of ballast degradation; fouling index (fi) and marsal’s index (bg). the degraded ballast material was prepared in the laboratory using the los angeles abrasion (laa) method. the los angeles abrasion (laa) test was conducted eight (8) times continuously on the same sample at an interval of 250 turns of the laa test drum. a series of sieve analysis was conducted after each test run and the changes in ballast gradations were evaluated. based on the results obtained a strong correlation was observed between the two approaches with a coefficient of determination of 99.24%. hence, both marsal’s breakage index and the fouling index can be used for the evaluation of ballast degradation. however, marsal’s breakage index is recommended due to its ability to give the breakdown of the particle size variations.","ballast degradation, fouling, gradation","This paper presents an experimental study on railway ballast degradation evaluation. The ballast particle gradations were analysed during the degradation process, from 0-2000 turns at intervals of 250 turns of the LA abrasion test drum. Series of sieve analysis were conducted and the changes in ballast gradations were evaluated. At the end of the experiment, the following conclusions were drawn. The preliminary test results showed that the material satisfied all the relevant code requirements and hence, the material is suitable for use as ballast material. The ballast degradation in terms of breakage index (𝐵𝐵𝑔𝑔) , and the fouling index increases with an increase in the number of LA abrasion drum turns. The increase in the ballast degradation is attributed to the chopping off of sharp edges, surface abrasion, and breakage of larger particles into smaller sizes. Based on results obtained from the ballast degradation analysis, both Marsal’s breakage index and the fouling index can be used for the evaluation of ballast degradation. However, Marsal’s breakage index is recommended due to its ability to give the breakdown of the particle sizes variations.

47,Health And Socioeconomic Development And  Morbidity:,"there was a substantial inequality in health status across districts in indonesia. the purpose of this study was to examine the association between health and socioeconomic development and morbidity in district in indonesia. the data used came from the indonesia database policy and economic research (indo-dapoer) of the world bank. the unit analysis was district. the observation period was 2011–2014. multiple regression analysis was employed to study the impacts of health and socioeconomic development on morbidity in district in indonesia. the dependent variable was the morbidity rate. the health and socioeconomic development variables included the time, number of medical doctors, number of health centres and its line services, monthly per capita household health expenditure, and access to safe sanitation. the results of the study indicate that, in districts in indonesia, lower morbidity rate was significantly associated with increasing time, higher number of medical doctor, higher number of health centres and its line services, higher monthly per capita household health expenditure, and higher access to safe sanitation. these results imply that to reduce morbidity rate, the regional governments in indonesia should improve their health and socioeconomic development.","morbidity, districts",,"a district case in indonesia wilson rajagukguk faculty of economics and business, universitas kristen indonesia jl. mayjen sutojo no.2, cawang, jakarta 13630, indonesia wrajagukguk@yahoo.com; wilson.rajagukguk@uki.ac.id john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan tangerang-15811, indonesia john.purba@uph.edu sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu",
48,Development Of Business Process Model For Drone  Regulation And Improvement In South Africa,"processes are developed with activities that should be conducted to reach a set goal. there is no perfect process, and any process at a later stage will need to be improved to keep up with the time and the technology. business process management (bpm) is essential for any process for the management, monitoring and improvement of the developed process. there are different types of business process management models that one could adopt for process enhancement. drone approval process in south africa has challenges regarding the implemented processes of the drone regulation. challenges involve delays and there is a call by the drone industry to amend the regulation. this study explores six core elements and life cycle business process management models. the two bpm models were used to guide the development of the business process model to help improve the drone regulation in process in south africa.","drone, life cycle, model","The purpose of this study was to develop a process model to help improve the drone regulation process. The factors, which affect the growth of drones including the regulations in South Africa and other countries, were identified in this study through literature review. Two process models were also identified namely; BPM life cycle and six BPM core elements for the development of the BPM. Several elements of the Business Process Management were highlighted to improve the drone regulation in South Africa. Elements related to this study were selected from the BPM core elements and BPM life cycle elements, and thereafter combined and illustrated as a business process model to be used for drone regulation improvement in South Africa. Business process management models need to be continually improved to keep up with the new ways to do things. The business process model recommended in this study can be employed to any process that has challenges. This research will contribute to South African research and literature in drones since there are few research in this environment.

49,Eco-Innovation In The Built Environment: A Bibliometric  And Systematic Literature Review,"eco-innovation is quickly gaining traction to achieve the goal of long-term sustainability in the built environment. this is due to its capacity to reduce the environmental impacts of our production modes, improve nature's resistance to environmental challenges, and achieve more efficient and responsible use of natural resources while building infrastructure. this study used bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review to assess current state research on eco-innovation in the built environment to identify established and emerging research subjects for future study. the systematic research review we used in our study has not been grasped or assessed by other researchers on this topic. firstly, based on our methodology, the systematic review identified 84 publications raised from scientific journals, including literature from 2012. twenty-six publications were used after inclusion criteria were followed. according to our findings, 2021 produced the most articles and citations. china is the leader in publications and citations, and eco-innovation research in the built environment can be classified into five clusters. the research identified various limits that may allow new academics and practitioners to investigate eco-innovation in new ways. because most practitioners and policymakers are unfamiliar with this form of research, many remain theatrical and conceptual. instead of focusing solely on opinion, future studies should focus on practical applications.","built environment, eco-innovation","Eco-innovation is a process to address sustainability in the built environment. This article presents the outcomes based on the Web of Science core collection database from 2012 to 2022. This paper uses VOSviewer and Atlas.ti to analyse the development situation and research hotspots of 26 publications. Clear evidence was found that demonstrates that the Eco-innovation literature in the built environment is highly fragmented. The years 2013 and 2017, no publication was released. While 2018 saw the highest number of publications (8). Thus, this paper contributes to extending the current dominant theoretical perspectives. In total, 12 countries/territories were recorded as publication geographic distributions, and the most productive ones were the Peoples Republic of China, Italy and France. European countries make up 53% of the publications, while Asia makes up 38%, South America makes up 6%, and North America makes up 3%. Africa and Oceania have no representation. Future studies should look at eco-innovation in African and Oceania countries. The study also found sustainable production and consumption and journal of cleaner production to the leading journals in terms of impact and publications. Our network analysis conclusion shows that eco-innovation in the built environment can be divided into five clusters, with the popular cluster being cluster 1. The main limitation comes from our initial search.

50,Sawdust Waste Management In Enugu Timber Market,"this study sought to grasp how sawmill wastes are managed and disposed-off in the study area. the research was carried out at the enugu timber market in kenyatta, in nigeria's eastern region. the study used a descriptive, qualitative, and quantitative ex-post facto survey design to create an accurate profile of people, events, and situations. to obtain the required data, a triangulation method comprised of questionnaire, interview, and observation/photography methods was used. for primary data collection, stratified random sampling method was used to select a realised sample of 250 respondents from a finite population (of 1970 timber market workers) comprising of wood processors, carpenters, timber sellers, dealers on wood accessories, food sellers and fabricated cart haulers from the areas under survey. the survey results show that sawdust is the most common type of wood waste generated, accounting for 28.4 percent of total wood waste generated, and is closely followed by offcuts. the study also reveals that open dumping and burning are perhaps the most prevalence method of disposing of wood wastes in the study area, with only a small quantity recycled or reused. improper disposal of wood waste has negative effects on the environment because it affects both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. burning waste wood also emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing a range of health problems. these wood wastes can be best utilised recycling and reusing them to help lessen the impact on and the environment caused by improper disposal.","sawdust, waste management, timber market, pollution","and Recommendations Wood waste is generated on a daily basis in Nigeria, as in most developing countries, due to a high demand for wood products for a variety of uses. These wood residues have a variety of environmental and health effects. Based on the study conducted, it is glaring that the amounts of wood waste generated by this sawmill (Enugu timber market) can always be managed without burning it and as such reducing the degree of carbon emission into the atmosphere. The treatment of wood waste in the study area and most sawmills is done by open burning. The burning of the wastes cannot be totally ruled out, because burning is often the easiest and cheapest means of disposal, therefore, it is necessary to recommend that:  Only dried wastes should be subjected to burning because of their low moisture contents. Burning should be done in batches so that wastes do not smoulder and as such reducing the smoking effects. Also, it should not be done in the late afternoon or evening, as the air will be stable.  More so, Government and relevant law making agencies should enforce the payment of carbon tax. This would go a long way in deterring the use of products with low carbon emission properties.

52,"Investigation Of The Level Of Automation In Some Selected  Manufacturing Industries In Kano, Nigeria","this study investigated the level of computer numerical control automation in some selected manufacturing industries in kano nigeria. it details the extent of automation, type of operations automated, obstacles and motivators to automate. earlier research works in the area shows that automation is very low and there was little or no data to indicate the extent and obstacles to automation, a gap that this work fills. to stay competitive, manufacturing industries need to be flexible and adaptive to new tools that enhance efficiency and effectiveness of operations. tools such as lean and six-sigma principles that were found to reduce waste in terms of cost, time, and improved quality operates better in well automated industries. a field survey was conducted where 20 industries were mapped out and served with questionnaires. follow ups were made for clarifications, and data was collected and analyzed. the results from the study revealed low level of automation in the industries, but the motivation to automate is very high with cost of replacing manufacturing systems with automated ones being the major obstacle.",lean and six-sigma,"About 35% are food, and 35% are plastic processing industries. 50% produce between 1000 and 100,000unit. Only 20% of the companies have been for less than 10years while 5% are between 31-50years by age. 40% have 51 to 100 employees and only 15% have more than 200 employees. None of the industries is fully automated and 40% have no automation at all. Only about 10% will be fully automated and 10% will have no automation in the projected next five years. Operations are fully automated using computer-based automation in none of the industries, while 10% indicated that most operations are automated. This indicates that computer- based automation in the industries is very low. Some of the operations are: Receiving and inspecting raw materials: None of the industries has automation. Raw material preprocessing, 80% have automation. Processing/Filling/Wrapping, 30% have automation. Post process handling and inspection, none of the industries have automation. Packaging, only 30 % of companies surveyed have automation. Warehousing and Storage, only 5% have automated warehousing and storage. There this indicated that even simple operations are not well automated in the industries. None of companies indicated that the time is a major obstacle in automation. 30 % indicated that technical skills are a major obstacle. 30% indicated that management commitment major obstacle. 10% of companies surveyed indicated that nature of business is a major obstacle, while 70% reported cost of automation as the major obstacle. The Motivators to Implementing Computer-Based Automation in the industries include Reduction of cycle time with 75% indicating that it is a motivational factor. Lower production cost, with 80% of companies reporting it as a motivational factor. Improving personnel safety with only 40% of companies reporting it as motivational factor. Improving product safety, where 60% of the companies indicated that it is a motivating factor and about 80% of the industries reported improvement in quality as motivational. Conclusively, it can be inferred that manufacturing industries in the study are no candidates for the introduction of competitive tools such as Lean, Six-Sigma Just-In-Time, Total Quality Management, Total Productive Maintenance, Cloud Manufacturing. To improve automation, the managements of the various industries must show commitment for change, the culture of competitiveness must be imbibed in the industries and the responsible agencies must ensure the availability of cheap capital to the industries and promote competitiveness in the Nigerian manufacturing sector.","umar adamu alhaji and abali rukaiya department of mechanical engineering bayero university kano, nigeria aupins@yahoo.com, rukaiyaabali@gmail.com",
53,Determining Factors Affecting E-Service Quality For  Environmental Permits In Indonesia,"indonesia is one of the countries that implement e-government to overcome the problem of decentralization so that it can improve and expand the relationship between the government and other parties by utilizing information technology. based on presidential regulation number 95 of 2018 regarding the electronic-based government system, the government has begun to implement an electronic-based government system through e-government to encourage the improvement of public services. environmental management efforts and environmental monitoring efforts (ukl-upl) is one of the environmental permits that has to be made for decision making and the basis for issuing permits to conduct businesses and or activities. ukl-upl is made for projects whose environmental impacts can be overcome and the scale of control is small and complex. this study aims to build a service quality model on a government website that combines egovqual and tam so that it can improve service quality which can lead to an increase in the reputation of the service quality. partial least square structural equation modelling (pls-sem) was used to create a service quality model. this research produces priority service quality improvements in efficiency and suggests several improvements that the government of jakarta can implement.","service, quality, e-govqual","R Square R Square Adjusted VIF Value H1 Perceived Ease of Use affects Citizen Satisfaction -0.123 1.066 0.287 Hypothesis rejected 0.762 0.75 2.833 H2 Perceived Usefulness affects Citizen Satisfaction 0.364 3.244 0.001 Hypothesis not rejected 3.642 H3 Efficiency affects Citizen Satisfaction 0.368 2.435 0.015 Hypothesis not rejected 2.845 H4 Trust affects Citizen Satisfaction 0.082 0.969 0.333 Hypothesis rejected 2.389 H5 Reliability affects Citizen Satisfaction 0 0.001 1 Hypothesis rejected 3.979 H6 Citizen Support affects Citizen Satisfaction 0.278 2.248 0.025 Hypothesis not rejected 3.191 H7 Perceived Ease of Use affects Perceived Usefulness 0.705 13.573 0 Hypothesis not rejected 0.504 0.472 1 Based on the structural model results, the variables that affect citizen satisfaction are perceived usefulness, efficiency, and citizen support. To find out the variables that are prioritized in improving service quality in making UKL-UPL environmental permits on the Jakevo website is to look at the path coefficient values. Perceived usefulness has a value of 0.364; efficiency has a value of 0.368; citizen support has a value of 0.278. Based on these results, efficiency has the most significant path coefficient value and is the first priority in improving the service quality. Efficiency is related to the time it takes to find information and the quality of the information provided by the website. Efficiency considers a website structure that is clear and easy to follow, how well the website layout is, how well the website can be customized according to the user's wishes, whether the information listed is detailed and new, and whether there is sufficient information to complete permit processing through the website (Papadomichelaki and Mentzas 2012). Therefore, the solution that researchers can suggest is to design a user- friendly website by implementing the following things, 1) Easy-to-use navigation is applied. Navigation is one of the most important aspects of making a user-friendly website. Navigation serves to guide web visitors to find information and content, so the navigation provided on the website should be easy to use. 2) Content that is comfortable to read. Longer paragraphs can be divided into several shorter paragraphs to make it easier for visitors to read the content. In addition, the font size, font type, text colour, and background colour can make visitors comfortable when reading it. 3) The information provided is the latest. 4) Have a responsive design. Currently, many users on the internet access websites via smartphones or other mobile devices. Responsive design can provide convenience for web visitors because the web display will automatically adjust the size used. With this design, the appearance and content on the website page can look neat on all the devices used.

54,Simulating The Influence Of Spares Replacement And Reuse  Strategies On Equipment Availability And Maintenance Cost,"the deterioration and subsequent maintenance strategies significantly affect equipment reliability and availability. spares replacement and or reuse are critical and complement both preventive and corrective maintenance strategies, although sparse work on their influence on maintenance cost and availability has been done. a discrete event simulation model incorporating preventive (pm) and corrective (cm) maintenance actions on multiple critical equipment components are advanced to investigate the influence of reusing and replacing spares on equipment availability and maintenance cost. during pm, spare replacement is modelled using block policy (brp) or the pm kit. the stochastic component deterioration is modelled following the semi-markov decision process, where the impact of the maintenance strategy changes the remaining useful life of the components. the proposed study is demonstrated through the use case of a thermal power plant, where components of the turbocharger, one of the critical subsystems, are modelled. the study shows that reusing significantly improves availability but does not reduce cost due to compromising component reliability. the use of the pm kit improves performance significantly compared to using brp under pm. at the same time, an increase in the pm interval depicts an increase in the maintenance cost and availability. these findings have significant implications while understanding the dynamics of the various maintenance actions and further offering maintenance decision support to enhance the equipment availability and reduce the maintenance cost for critical equipment.","spares, degradation","The present research aimed to examine the effects of reliance on reuse and replace maintenance strategy, the PM interval, and the PM kit on both the Turbocharger availability and total maintenance cost. The results clearly show that reliance on a single variable for optimization would lead to the sub-optimal outcome. These findings provide significant implications for understanding how the investigated decision variables should be incorporated in the optimization processes. The insights gained from this study will assist the maintenance managers while prudently selecting the maintenance variables that will significantly affect their maintenance programs, especially as concerns optimization where various decision variables constitute the maintenance objective function. To attain near empirical performance measures, subsequent work incorporating the analysis of effect and interactions, condition-based maintenance, and utilization of an RUL threshold for maintenance intervention decision making is proposed.

The excessive use of these fuels will lead to serious environmental issues like global warming, air pollution and deforestation. It is high time we convert biomass wastes to useful briquettes, which will be the substitute for these fuels. This work focused on estimating the heating values of rice husk briquettes to ascertain its suitability for domestic use and small-scale industrial cottage application. Results obtained indicate that the briquettes made from rice husk have high heating value enough for domestic use and small-scale industrial cottage applications.","briquettes francis inegbedion and emmanuel ikpoza department of production engineering university of benin benin city, nigeria francis.inegbedion@uniben.edu, emmanuel.ikpoza@uniben.edu",
58,Cyber Security Awareness And Education Framework For  Zimbabwe Universities: A Case Of National University Of,"internet-related attacks have become prevalent and are expected to increase as the reliance on the internet also increases. consequently, cyber security has become an essential concept in everyday life and cyber security awareness is key in the protection of people and systems against cyber threats. the study is sought to establish the current levels of cyber security awareness among students and staff in universities and propose a framework for conducting cyber security awareness and education programs. data analysis was carried out using statistical package for social sciences (spss) and represented in descriptive and frequency ways as well as in percentage form. based on research findings in this study it has been established that students and staff at universities do not have the requisite knowledge and understanding of the importance of cyber security principles, their practical application in their day-to-day activities, and are not aware of how to protect their data. it is therefore recommended that universities should implement comprehensive awareness and education programs for the adoption of necessary safety measures and a framework for conducting such programs are proposed.","cyber security, data analysis, awareness, framework","and Recommendations In conducting this research, data were collected from 5 groups of respondents which comprised students, both undergraduate and postgraduate students and staff members. The gist of the research was to determine the level of cyber security awareness and education among the universities students and staff and propose a framework for CSA. Based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn: ● The university staff and students do not know the basic concepts of cybersecurity or of the best practices of protecting themselves from various forms of attack. ● The practice of key principles of online safety is very limited amongst universities. Cautiousness is not practiced, many users still use default or weak passwords, do not use 2FA, and do not hesitate to post their personal information online. ● The students and staff have a desire to learn cyber security concepts for their safety and that of the university. 6.1 Recommendations The Researcher is drawing the following recommendations based on the research findings and reviewed literature as aligned to the research questions of this study. The first recommendation is that universities need to implement comprehensive cybersecurity awareness and training sessions regularly to ensure that all users know how to recognize the most common cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. They should promote knowledge on common cybersecurity concepts, including vulnerabilities, attacks, and incidents, to their students and staff to strengthen their security position. The second recommendation is that universities should incorporate cyber security-related activities which address safety practices, vulnerabilities, incidents, and attacks during the induction of employees and orientation of students. This ensures that the users that are being introduced to the data network are well equipped with the issues of security and this will enable users to play their part by interacting safely online hence contributing to the reduction in the cyber security risk of the University. It is also recommended that universities should also make it a routine to occasionally hold symposia, seminars, and public lectures on this topical issue of cyber security. This enables students and staff to be educated on the issues of cyber security. It also helps in changing the perception of users so that they appreciate that cyber security requires collective action rather than just perceiving it to be an ICT technical role. This effort will not only see the reduction in the cyber security risk for the universities but is also an effort that will help in controlling this scourge in the Zimbabwean context. There is a need to integrate more proactive methods, such as training and interviews. A combination of both methods would be more effective and highly recommended. The delivery methods for cybersecurity awareness and training programs can be video- based, text-based, or game-based, as the target here is adult students. Security awareness must be taught at an early age to develop sustainable cybersecurity behavior among users. The research involved conducting a study at one university to ascertain the current level of cyber security knowledge of both students and staff and propose an awareness and education framework on cyber security concepts, risk, and vulnerabilities. The objectives that were set were met. Answers to the research questions were obtained from the data that was gathered. These answers included the current level of knowledge, skills, attitude, and behaviour of users online and ways in which cyber security awareness and education can be incorporated in Zimbabwean universities. The challenges that were identified assisted the researcher to suggest ways in which available knowledge, skills, and behavior of students and staff, about cyber security can be improved. Finally, a framework for implementing cyber security awareness in universities was proposed.","science and technology belinda mutunhu, dr sibusisiwe dube, nolwazi ncube and sizalobuhle sibanda computer science department, national university of science and technology belinda.ndlovu@nust.ac.zw, sibusisiwe.dube@nust.ac.zw, nolwazincub@gmail.com, sizalobuhle@gmail.com",

61,Heavy Oil Storage Tanks’ Inspection -Using Acoustic  Emission,"this paper presents a new inspection method in heavy oil storage tanks’. oil leaks may occur due to defects in tanks bottom, which pose a significant risk to the company's environmental, financial and reputation aspects. traditional inspection technique is a long process that needs shutting down the plant, emptying the tank, cleaning, decontamination, and sandblasting, which is cost-time consuming and interrupts production operations. recently, an advanced inspection technique called acoustic emission testing (aet) has been employed by many companies as an alternative to the old traditional technique. aet can apply inspection and evaluation of tank internal condition from the external side, without the need of tank emptying and shutting down the plant. the theory of aet is based on sonic sensors that can detect sound signals generated by tiny leaks or defects in a tank while the tank is filled and in service. the sensors are attached externally to the tank external body and data can be acquired, then filtered, analyzed and evaluated to give valuable information about the tank’s internal condition. in this case study, aet inspection was applied on a heavy oil storage tank in issran field-egypt/ eastern desert. the results yield a significant reduction in cost, time and overall risk.",heavy oil,"Storage tanks typically contain large volumes of valuable but potentially hazardous fluids. Inspection is a crucial element of the integrity management of storage tanks. The objective of the inspection is to provide information on the tank condition. Opening storage tanks for internal inspection is a lengthy and complex process, not only will the tank be unavailable during the internal inspection, but it must be drained and cleaned before entry is possible. There are also safety hazards associated with personnel entry for inspection. As such Advanced Inspection AET method offers an attractive alternative as they can be conducted while the tank is in-service and does not require tank entry. AET principle is based on sonic sensors that are attached to the tank external body perimeter. Those sensors can receive the sound signals generated from any defect or potential leak areas, then the data acquired can be processed, filtered and evaluated to give final inspection results shown as overall corrosion grading and potential leakage grading then a risk inspection matrix can be extracted from the two grading measures. The results obtained give information about tank internal condition, estimated remaining life, corrosion activityand recommendations for repair or replacement, or need for subsequent inspections. A Case study was applied in ISSRAN field -CPF2 unit -Storage Tank T 130A. The AET inspection procedure was applied on this tank as a demo trial to assess the actual benefits from adopting this advanced technique and to check the quality of data and sensitivity of the overall procedure. Results were analyzed using advanced management tools, including PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle, WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), Gantt chart and Bow-Tie model. Results have shown a significant reduction in cost, time and overall risk. Advanced Acoustic Emission Testing (AET) provides an effective superior alternative to the old traditional inspection techniques. The study showed significant benefits from adopting the AET technique as an inspection and maintenance planning tool for the above-ground oil storage tanks. These benefits include avoiding production interruption and multiple optimizations in time, cost and risk.","mohamed mounir department of industrial and management engineering, arab academy for science, technology and maritime transport, cairo, egypt mohamed_21002753@utp.edu.my yasser shaban department of mechanical design engineering, helwan university, cairo, egypt yasser.shaban@polymtl.ca",

From the research methodology and the Exploratory Factor analysis carried out in this study, it is concluded that government should set up a training institution for the automobile sector to train and recruit service personnel’s who will head start assembly plants that would be revived in future. Also, the government should reduce the importation of foreign vehicles into the country as most of these vehicles do come with faults that can cause damage to the user and the vehicle itself. Furthermore, scheduled maintenance should be carried out frequently on a vehicle, while the use of try by error technique should be reduced because most times it creates more problems to the existing ones, as a result, service personnel’s should encouraged to use diagnosing tool/machines to ease means of fault identification for more accuracy. Additionally, the government should revive and encourage assembly plants within the country for local car manufacturer and great reduction in the importation of vehicles and its parts. Lastly, Government should establish a policy that regulates the price/charges of spare parts, and a policy to regulate the minimum entry requirement to this Industry.

64,Making Africa 4.0: Possible Impact Of Implementing  Industry 4.0,"the fourth industrial revolution poses significant challenges to manufacturing companies from the technological, organizational, and management points of view. industry 4.0 has created a new production model where robots are effectively used in production, this new production model has begun to change daily life, production, and working relations. however, the potential impacts of industry 4.0 over the labor markets, manufacturing industries, and energy consumption in africa remain an understudied scholarly area. it is being evaluated that industry 4.0 will lead to technological unemployment via changing the structure of employment and bring new structural problems in terms of unemployment and labor relations. this paper aims to explore the impact of industry 4.0 in africa and its state of readiness. the authors applied a qualitative case study design involving semi-structured interviews with practitioners from industry and reviewed existing literature, to analyze the impact of the fourth industrial revolution in africa. company websites and annual reports were also examined to increase the reliability and validity of the results.","industry 4.0, labor life, making africa 4.0","This article presented a literature review, companies’ annual report and interviews from 8 companies implementing Industry 4.0 technology in Africa. This was done with the aim to investigate the state of readiness of Africa to fourth industrial revolution, by studying the impact of this new technology on labour life and manufacturing industries in Africa. Through our examination of 18 cases of Industry 4.0 technology implementation across Africa and from the existing literature, several key insights emerge. Our findings suggest that Industry 4.0 open a new range of opportunities to explore and develop further monitoring and control systems for supporting sustainable decision-making. Our insights also suggest that the perspectives of technology providers and users tend to be very different concerning opportunities and risk factors. As less labour will be employed, unit costs are getting cheaper in countries that have manufacturing that is compatible with industry 4.0. This change gives them a competitive advantage in the exportation of their products, leading to an increase in exports and a decrease in imports. Industry 4.0 investments will reduce the employment of low-level labour force while increasing the employment of qualified labour force in areas such as design and information technology. The increase in personalised product manufacturing will lead to an increase in sales and manufacturing. The quality of manufacturing increases with the implementation of Industry 4.0, which will lead to an increase in sales and reduction of loss. These developments in manufacturing will lead to an increase in economic growth, which is needed in most African countries. However, data security and organizational resistance has been documented as a major challenge of many industrialists. Furthermore, the study noticed organizational resistance to Industry 4.0 technologies in Africa, due to high risk of losing their jobs. The research suggests that training the young population on these foundations and providing the necessary qualified workforce beginning from primary education, vocational high schools and universities, and giving education on coding, software, robotic technology will ensure the evolution of the workplace. This approach is not implemented in the educational system in Africa which may delay the readiness of Africa to fully implement the fourth industrial revolution technologies. Lastly, Africa needs to urgently upgrade the global competitiveness index. The existing training system implemented by most African countries are no longer suitable for this Industrial Revolution and does not serve any functional purpose. Consequently, in order to educate the present generation, the National Education System needs a well- planned educational structure as soon as possible. Most African governments need to promote Industry 4.0 to increase exports and decrease imports, and thus make Africa stronger economically.","adedotun adetunla department of quality and operations management, university of johannesburg, south africa aadedotun@uj.ac.za nelson madonsela department of quality and operations management, university of johannesburg, south africa nmadonsela@uj.ac.za",
65,The Evaluation Of Technology Implementation To Support  Product Development Agility In Fmcg Industry In,"pandemic covid-19 and the shifting of the digital market and the conventional market in recent years have affected fmcg companies to run their business, not only on supply chain and marketing but also on product development. to be competitive, fmcg companies must be able to be more agile in developing products. technology adoption has been frequently proven to have a positive impact on agility in the fmcg supply chain. however, limited sources evaluate the role of technology adoption on product development agility. by using pls-sem (partial least square structural equation modelling) which the data were collected through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, this research evaluates the breadth and the depth of implementation of six technology groups (pilot plant and prototyping, knowledge management, project management, cloud and information sharing, big data analytic, artificial intelligent), and the effect of supporting technology implementation factors to company’s agile capability in product development. the results produce a model to understand the correlation between technology implementation factors and product development agility.","agility, agile capabilities","The use of technology is indirectly affected the product development agility of the FMCG industry in Indonesia through improving agility capability. It works by catalyzing the product development agility by increasing the company's ability to respond to the changes. However, among the six technology groups, only artificial intelligence is proven to affect sensing capability significantly by path coefficient 0.201. Moreover, only artificial intelligence technology and pilot plant technology affect responding capability significantly by path coefficient 0.177 and 0.181 respectively. By this, it is highly recommended for FMCG company in Indonesia to invest in pilot plant or artificial intelligence technology and to balance both sensing and responding capability. For those who have implemented it, they may improve it by increasing the breadth and depth of application of both technologies. Moreover, to achieve the best benefit of technology implementation company should build an organizational culture that is open to technology, have a congruent evaluation, and feedback system, congruent needs identification, adequate user training, and last communicate the goal of implementation technology clearly. There are several gaps in our knowledge around technology implementation in research that follow from our findings and would benefit from further research, including an in-depth exploration of how combinations of technology support each other’s to improve product development agility. It would also be helpful to develop a framework on technology implementation support comprehensively which may be used not limited in the FMCG industry.","indonesia bagas muhamad kartiko, novandra rhezza pratama, rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, 16424, indonesia bagas.muhamad01@ui.ac.id, novandra@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",
66,Aerodynamic Behavior Of An Ornithopter Capable Of A  Sustained And Controlled Flight,"an ornithopter is a device that mimics the flights of birds by flapping its wings. aircraft can fly at immense speeds and in harsh conditions, but to an extent, they lack the level of maneuverability seen in birds and insects. this work delves into the control and automation for stability of flapping wing flight due to its advantages over fixed wing fliers like increased maneuverability and its contribution to research and society. to ensure the model stays airborne and for the wings to create lift equal to the weight of the ornithopter, the design and selection of the components was carried out to meet the desired performance requirements of an ornithopter which stems from the features of bird flight such as good maneuverability, low speed flight capability, agility, and high propulsive efficiency. the ornithopter was built from materials commonly sourced and modelled by using solidworks simulation.","automation, ornithopter","The study offers an overview of the basic principles of the design of Ornithopters. The first prototype of ornithopter was flown for less than 1 min in Dec, 2004. Its wingspan was about 40 cm and weighed around 45 g. This research succeeded in increasing its size to 124 cm and its weight to almost 2000 g, which is similar to the average weight of a bird, therefore, ensuring that the developed Ornithopter fly in wind velocity of over 5m·s−1. In this paper, the aerodynamic behavior of the developed Ornithopter was characterized through experiment and simulation. It was evident that the aerodynamic model utilized agrees well with experimental data especially in regions of high angle of attack and dynamic-stall effects with no plunging motion. The findings presented in this paper could further increase the applicability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Manufacturing Industries.","bernard adaramola department of mechanical & mechatronics engineering, afe babalola university,ado ekiti nigeria. adaramolaba@abuad.edu.ng adedotun adetunla department of mechanical & mechatronics engineering, afe babalola university,ado ekiti nigeria. dotunadetunla@yahoo.com adeyinka adeoye department of mechanical & mechatronics engineering, afe babalola university,ado ekiti nigeria. aadeoye@abuad.edu.ng",

The modelled clinical ventilator employs several valves and sensors along with a processing unit to implement the required control algorithms. We showed that the performance of PCV system in terms of peak time, settling time and maximum overshoot are automatic. The utilization PID control architecture was done to improve response time, enabling patients to inhale gas in a timely manner in each positive pressure inhalation phase, and to have a better experience, which has less pressure shock during exhalation and inhalation, and has higher safety in certain special situations. It was also observed that the maximum pressure of the ventilation device increases slowly when the tidal volumes exceed 600 ml. In addition, influence of evacuation time of the ventilator predicted over high throughput in time regimes of 1 s; 1.2 s; 1.4 s and 1.6 s. showed that the pressure platform in the pipe might not appear if the exhaust time of the ventilator is less than 1.6 s.

69,Urban Resilience And Sustainability Through Regenerative  Urban Agriculture,"cities and urban areas are under constant stress from natural disasters and climate changes to pestilences and economic crises, due primarily to anthropological activities and demands. these extraneous circumstances have been aptly highlighted by the recent epidemic, which changed the modus-operandi of the world as we know it. nevertheless, the nature of this excessive pressure did not change the burden carried by cities to sustain a people, an entire ecosystem, and produce and manage ways that encourage economic successes. instead, the covid-19 pandemic merely revealed the cracks in cities and nations’ already flawed governing systems. urban resilience is the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses, and systems within a city to survive, adapt, and grow no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience. (urban resilience - resilient cities network, no date, para. 5). therefore, urban resilience can be achieved through effective strategies such as regenerative and sustainable urban agriculture (ua), which will be the premise of this research. human behaviour relative to the current environment requires understanding so that cohesive coexistence can be bolstered through regenerative and restorative practices found in the technology and ecology of the nature of reproduction, that is, urban agriculture. city and urban sustainability, specifically for developing countries (the global south), will shift from the conventional concrete jungle’s urban design. therefore, this urban agricultural perspective is primarily explored through the microscope of bee technology and how this simple practice and its principles can be incorporated within the urban space to enable resilience, food and nutrition provision and promote economic accessibility.","urban agriculture, city resilience, sustainability, urban beekeeping.",,"dr jackson sebola-samanyanga lecturer, department of town and regional planning university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa jsebola@uj.ac.za miss segakweng khutlapye masters candidate, department of town and regional planning university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa skhutlapye@gmail.com","References

The restrictions of this setup due to cost and time constraints forced the researchers to substitute expensive and hard- to-obtain actuators to be substituted by cheaper ones. The speakers, LEDs, and micro servo motor served as actuators that alert the sense of hearing, sight, and touch, respectively, making this proposed project assistive to various pedestrians even to those with disabilities. For the sensors used, the usage of IR sensors makes the project efficient in relation to its effectivity and cost while the ultrasonic sensors are placed for accuracy in proximity detection. Thus, this project is a modest attempt for a pedestrian assistance system and improve the safety of pedestrians with the prototype model using Arduino UNO and several electronic components.

74,Evaluation Of Performance Of Fixed Dome Biogas Digester  Surface Insulated With Mud,"the aim of the study is to exploit the potential of mud beyond its current applications in construction industries, to insulate bio-digesters against temperature fluctuations. to achieve this, six identical fixed dome biogas digesters (32 liters) were designed, constructed and used to carryout anaerobic digestion of three feedstocks namely cow abdominal waste, poultry droppings and 1:1 mixture of cow abdominal waste and poultry droppings. three digesters were charged and surface covered with mud for insulation while the remaining three were charged and kept on the surface uninsulated. the anova result indicates that mud insulation of digester and feedstock have significant effect on the performance of the fixed dome biogas digesters (α =.0.05). the range of ph, volume of biogas and slurry temperature (st) in all the feedstocks (cow abdominal waste, poultry droppings and 1:1 mixture of cow abdominal waste and poultry droppings) were 6.948-7.170, 3.643-3.865 liters and 29.917-30.242oc, respectively. the highest volume of biogas was produced by mud insulated surface fixed dome biogas digester with cow abdominal waste feedstock. the highest temperature evolution was from 1:1 mixture of cow abdominal waste and poultry droppings feedstock.","fixed dome digester, biogas, mud insulation, feedstock","Digester temperature and feedstock are some of the key influence parameters for optimal biogas recovery, and thus its optimization and stability are key requirements for every productive biogas plant. The study aimed to exploit the potential of mud beyond its current applications in construction industries, to insulate bio-digesters against temperature fluctuations. The results showed that the range of values for pH, volume of biogas and slurry temperature were 6.897-7.177, 2.404-5.327 liters and 29. 667-30.467 oC, respectively. Mud insulation of digester and feedstock have significant effect on the performance of the fixed dome biogas digesters (α =.0.05). There are significant differences in the mean values of volume of biogas produced and slurry pH for the six different biogas digesters at 5% significant levels. The mean slurry temperature of the six different digesters were statistically the same at 5% significant level. The highest volume of biogas and slurry pH were produced by mud insulated surface fixed dome biogas digester with cow abdominal waste feedstock.

75,Ergonomic Intervention Studies For Productivity  Improvement In Small Scale Utensils Manufacturing,"ergonomics is concerned with the design of equipment, workstation, facilities and work environment to match the human capability and limitations. most of the small scale industries (ssis) are characterized by several ergonomic deficiencies such as poor work station design, layout problems, awkward postures, excessive noise, heat and poor illumination. the present study is focused on the ergonomic deficiencies in a small scale utensils manufacturing industry. the typical manufacturing process consists of melting, molding, rolling, plate cutting, circle cutting, press work, spinning, polishing & packing. the work in characterized by repetitive activities involving awkward postures, frequent twisting, bending, stretching, carrying loads, contact stress and vibrations. 45 workers from different sections were selected for study and administered modified nordic questionnaire to know the prevalence of msds. ergonomic assessment tools rapid upper limb assessment (rula) and rapid entire body assessment (reba) were used to determine the postural risks. niosh lifting equation determined the lifting index in manual handling tasks. environmental parameters were measured by appropriate instruments. digital human modeling (dhm) approach using catia software was used to model the human postures and conduct rula analysis. the working postures are again built in catia to show improvements. the results indicate prevalence of msds among more than 50% workers. postural analysis results in 47% postures in high risk indicating immediate change. ergonomic interventions in workstation design is shown through dhm, which results in reducing the risk of postures. some of the manual lifting tasks indicated scores between 1 and 3 showing moderate risks due to lifting. several ergonomic interventions were recommended to improve the productivity and safety of employees.","msd, rula, reba, niosh",,"industry veeresh student, industrial & production engineering department p.d.a.college of engineering kalaburagi, karnataka, india veereshb4464@gmail.com qutubuddin s.m. associate professor, industrial & production engineering department p.d.a.college of engineering kalaburagi, karnataka, india syedqutub16@gmail.com kajal, aishwarya k., sampati bai students, industrial & production engineering department p.d.a.college of engineering kalaburagi, karnataka, india kajalkukanur8@gmail.com, koraaishwarya@gmail.com, sampatikori136@gmail.com",
76,Enhancing Sustainable Engineering Education And Practice  In The Developing Countries Through University-Industry,"the demand for skilled engineers due to dynamics of technology and socio-technological challenges could only be met in all countries through sustainable engineering education and practice. enhancing sustainable engineering education and practice is a global concern especially in developing countries. over the years, many economies have grappled with obsolete, inefficient traditional methods of technology transformation and lack of practical implementation of distributed problem-solving techniques, which can be traced to paucity of sustainable engineering education. good efforts had been made in this paper to explore university-industry collaborations as one of the robust means to enhancing sustainable engineering education and practice in nigeria. the identified areas of collaboration include establishment of institutional factories and industries, revamping students industrial work experience scheme, establishment of engineering schools for further quality practical training after graduation, collaboration in utilising efforts made by institutions in research and development, joint conferences and workshops for cascading effects, and sustaining periodic industrial visits, funding of researches by industries through the universities.","technology, sustainability","Constant demand for skilled engineers is sustained and propelled by constant need to address the dynamics of technology and socio-technological challenges. This demand cannot be met without enhancing sustainable engineering education through university-industry collaboration. Some factors, which have contributed to the decay in engineering education in the developing countries, are lack of political will in funding education, inadequate collaboration of the universities and industries for cross pollination of ideas, curricular content and programmes designed to pay attention to theories than practice. Good efforts had been made in this paper to explore university- industry collaborations as one of the robust means to enhancing sustainable engineering education and practice. The following areas of collaboration between the industries and the universities in the developing countries had been identified and recommended for enhancing sustainable engineering education and practice. a. University-industry collaboration is strongly recommended in enhancing sustainable engineering education and practice. b. Establishment of institutional factories and industries to match theoretical knowledge of students with adequate practical training in relevant disciplines while still in school. c. Revamping students industrial work experience scheme for institutions to adequately attend to their students and engage them usefully. d. Fresh graduate engineers should be subjected to further compulsory quality training through establishment of graduate engineering upskilling schools. Upon training completion, certification should be obtained through the regulatory body. e. There should be political-will by the government and trust by the industries in funding universities, especially in engineering education.","collaboration: a nigeria perspective celestine nnaemeka achebe, paul amechi ozor and nita inderlal sukdeo department of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering, university of nigeria nsukka department of quality and operations management, university of johannesburg, south africa nnaemeka.achebe@unn.edu.ng, paul.ozor@unn.edu.ng, nsukdeo@uj.ac.za postal address: 410001, nsukka nigeria",
77,Biomass Resources In Nigeria And The Conversion  Pathways,"in order to improve the socio-economic development of any nation, such factors as the amount and type of energy resources available, conversion and extraction pathways employed, the rate of utilization and sustainability must be addressed appropriately. nigeria is one of the developing countries that is lagging in that regard because of poor and disrupted investment in the energy sector irrespective of its enormous energy resources. nigeria has enormous potential in both fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. some of these renewable sources include hydropower, solar energy, wind power, biomass and geothermal energy. in this paper, the focus is on biomass energy because it is one of the sustainable renewable energy sources with high extraction potentials, due to the vast arable land and favourable climatic conditions in nigeria. the biomass resources found in nigeria include agricultural resources, forest resources, aquatic biomass, and waste. these resources are capable of generating about 2.33 ej of energy and about 144 million tonnes in mass, yearly, which can be harnessed through some pathways such as thermochemical, physio-chemical, and biochemical, for heating or cooling, electricity generation, and as fuel for transportation. some authors argued that the utilization of the available landmass for the production of biomass resources poses a great threat to food security in nigeria. however, this challenge can be offset by enhancing the existing agricultural practices to improve the quality of yield without tampering with the quantity of food produced. biomass is reliable, cost-effective, sustainable, and has the capacity to create both direct and indirect jobs.",,,"collins o. ugwu, paul a. ozor, chigbogu g. ozoegwu, agwu ndukwe, charles mbohwa department of mechanical engineering, university of nigeria, nsukka, 410001, nigeria faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa africa centre of excellence for sustainable power and energy development (ace-sped), university of nigeria, nsukka onyinyechukwu.ugwu@unn.edu.ng, pozor@uj.ac.za, chigbogu.ozoegwu@unn.edu.ng, agwu.ndukwe@unn.edu.ng, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

Meanwhile, in the GWP 100 assessment, the highest alternative value is in scenario 4, namely converting POME into bio-CNG, which is then used as fuel for vehicles. The three alternatives that use methane capture result in a significant reduction in carbon footprint, whether used for biogas, electricity, or vehicles. In order to obtain better results, it is necessary to use the multi-criteria decision-making method for further research. Alternative selection should be assessed by considering other environmental and sustainability aspects, especially in an uncertain environment (Sarasati and Dachyar 2021). The TOPSIS multi-criteria method can generate a closeness coefficient concerning relevant factors' weighted value and ranks the alternative performance (Sahir and Dachyar 2021).

82,"Project Financing Strategy And Financial Feasibility For  Geothermal Development Project In Lumut Balai, South","indonesia is located on the ring of fire and has a huge thermal potential of up to 29,000 mw, which is equivalent to 40% of the world's geothermal potential capacity. according to the latest records from the geological agency, indonesia's geothermal potential in december 2019 was 23.9 gigawatts (gw). according to the geothermal authority (2019), this potential can only be used for a total potential of 8.9%, or 2,130.6. mw. even though the government itself is targeting an increase in geothermal utilization to 7,241.5 mw or 16.8% of the total potential capacity in 2025, there is still much that has not been utilized. cnn indonesia (2016) stated the expansion of geothermal energy as a source of renewable energies requires a long time and very high risk. capital will return in the long term and investors will not explore much in this business. as a result, only a few investors are interested in developing geothermal energy in indonesia. it is necessary to analyze the project financing to assess whether a geothermal project is feasible or not. in this study, data that were used are qualitative and quantitative data such as using a questionnaire given to experts, policy makers, and producers. this study identifies geothermal project feasibility and calculates the capital return estimation using project financing and capital budgeting method.","geothermal project, feasibility study, wind","and Recommendations Based on data analysis and discussion that had been done, it can be concluded about the feasibility study of geothermal development project as follows: 1. The capital expenditure needed for geothermal development project is the same for three financing scenario with initial investment at 253.000.000 US Dollar and investment after COD at 192.000.000 US Dollar. 2. Geothermal development project is feasible and accepted to be executed for financing scenario 2 and 3 even the discounted payback period of financing scenario 2 is rejected. The project will unfeasible if the project run by financing scenario 1 as shown in Table 7. 3. Financing structure 3 give the best economic value of geothermal business development project. The NPV of financing structure 3 is amounting to 52.819.000 US Dollar, IRR is 9,61%, Discounted Payback Period is 7,61 years and the Profitability Index is 2.86.","sumatera yafiazmi dhaniswara, farizal f and m. dachyar department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia jakarta, indonesia yafiazmi.dhaniswara@ui.ac.id; farizal@ie.ui.ac.id; mdachyar@ui.ac.id",
83,Supply Chain Decolonization: An Overview  Ahmed Deif,"this paper reports on recent work that focus on investigating the decolonization need in supply chain management. the definition of the term decolonization will be explored and will be followed by the characterization of current colonization practices and dynamics. more precisely the current value chain perspective will be analyzed to compare and contrast with the corporate valuation versus the people valuation in some supply chain industries. the research will rely on literature review as well as secondary data of published case studies. the results of this work will help pave the road for more work in this under-served research track in supply chain management especially regarding the underpinning dynamics of modern colonial practices in global south supply chains. in addition, the analysis will shed some light on the challenges facing practitioners and policy makers to better plan for and correct important issues of power, finance and labor in today’s supply chains. finally, it is hopeful that this work will reveal some ethical problems in the field of supply chain management that will open the door for further research and different scholastic and practical discussions.","decolonization, supply chain, ph.d.",,"department of industrial technology and packaging california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 3407, usa adeif@calpoly.edu",
84,Material Flow In Production Process Its Effect On Economic  Sustainability,"this paper reports a structural equation model in which total productive maintenance (tpm), just-in-time (jit), overall equipment efficiency (oee) indexes are analyzed as latent independent variables how they affect the economic sustainability (es) of the companies through the flow of materials their disruptions. the variables are related using six hypotheses in the model, evaluated with information from 239 responses to a questionnaire applied to the mexican maquiladora industry. the partial least squares technique is applied to validate these hypotheses. the results indicate that tpm is highly related to jit, se, oee, likewise, jit has a direct relationship with oee se. it is concluded that lean manufacturing tools applied to materials flow in a production system must be highly monitored to avoid disruptions that affect the economic income of companies.","tpm, jit, oee, production system",,"adrián salvador morales garcía, josé roberto díaz reza department of electric engineering computers sciences, autonomous university of ciudad juarez. ciudad juárez 32310, chihuahua, méxico. al216669@alumnos.uacj.mx, jose.dr01@itcj.edu.mx jorge luis garcía alcaraz, marcela ivonne delgado armendáriz department of industrial engineering manufacturing, autonomous university of ciudad juarez. ciudad juárez 32310, chihuahua, méxico jorge.garcia@uacj.mx, al206531@alumnos.uacj.mx cuauhtémoc sánchez ramírez division of research postgraduate studies, tecnologico nacional de méxico/instituto tecnologico de orizaba, orizaba 94320, veracruz, mexico","References

85,The Relationship Between Challenges E-Learning And  Interaction With Motivation And Satisfaction Amongst,"the mental health of students has become an important concern since the covid-19 pandemic. however, the research on the influence of mental impact on students' achievement in online learning is still very limited, especially in relation to the motivation of students. this study which was conducted from july to august 2021, examines the relationship between e-learning challenges and limited interaction during online lectures on student motivation and satisfaction. respondents came from 3 universities in banten province, indonesia, totaling 425 students consisting of 280 males (65.9%) and 145 females (34.1%). respondents who reported their perceptions during online learning varied in grade, range from grade 1 to 4. descriptive analysis shows that satisfaction level of respondents taking online lectures is 3.36 which is categorized fairly satisfied. from structural equation modeling (sem) analysis it is indicated that there is an effect of challenge e-learning on students' learning motivation, but on the contrary there is no interaction effect on students' learning motivation. an interesting finding was that there was no direct effect of e-learning challenge, interaction or motivation on student satisfaction. however, research shows that there is an effect of e-learning challenge and interaction on student satisfaction through intermediate variable motivation. thus, it is important to consider the factors affecting student motivation, namely internet connection, learning environment, and development of interactive electronic content as the leverage for the improvement of the effectiveness of online learning.","covid-19 pandemic, online learning, motivation","The research findings show that there is an effect of e-learning challenges on motivation. Difficulty in adapting, difficulty in focusing during online lectures and the use of technological tools during online lectures which are less effective than physical meetings, apparently affect the motivation of students to take online lectures. This shows that the level of e-learning challenges has not been fully managed optimally by students so that it has an impact on their motivation. When students are faced with a new learning process (online), students still need time to reach the steady state stage on their learning curve, in order to understand and adapt to online learning. Subsequent research findings indicate that there is no interaction effect on motivation. Although students have limited interaction with lecturers, content and friends during e-learning, this does not affect their motivation to take online lectures. Mainly, although student-content interaction is low, it does not affect their motivation to attend online lectures. An interesting finding is that there is no direct effect of e-learning challenges, interactions on student satisfaction. In addition, the research findings also show that there is no direct effect of motivation on student satisfaction. These results are in accordance with the findings of the research done by Amabile et al. (1994) which states that people can be simultaneously intrinsically and extrinsically motivated, but it may or may not have a relationship with job satisfaction. Likewise, research by Deci and Ryan (1985) found that intrinsic or extrinsic motivation may or may not have a relationship with job satisfaction. However, the research shows that there is an effect of e-learning challenge on student satisfaction through the intermediate variable motivation, and there is an interaction effect on student satisfaction through intermediate variable motivation. This shows the motivation variable is an important intermediate variable in order to achieve student satisfaction. Therefore, it is important to notice the factors that influence motivation, especially connections and the home environment. Thus, the leverage factors for student motivation are internet connection, learning environment, and the development of interactive electronic content. The findings contribute to universities in Indonesia to see the impact of the shift from classroom-based education to online-based ones, which have been implemented during the pandemic of Covid-19. Nevertheless, this study also has some limitations.

86,Disruptive Technology Selection For Automotive Industry:   A Case Study From Indonesia,"automotive is one of the competitive industries supported by its significant technological advancement, but it is susceptible to disruption trends. in indonesia, the automotive industry has many vehicle segments. one of them is the medium sport utility vehicle (msuv) segment. the disruption phenomenon occurred in the medium sport utility vehicle segment due to the emergence of the x brand in 2019, enabled by disruptive technologies to challenge and gain the y brand’s market share as the incumbents. therefore, there is an urgency to determine disruptive technology used in the automotive industry. this research utilizes multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) method combining analytical hierarchy process (ahp) and technique for others reference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis). the main results showed that government regulation was the most important criterion, while electric vehicles became the most preferred alternative for disruptive technology selection in the automotive industry. this research arguably has theoretical and practical contributions. theoretically, this research was the first attempt to determine disruptive technology used in the automotive industry, while practically, this research could guide the automotive manufacturer to select the most disruptive technology while considering some critical criteria during the research and development process.",electric car,"This research aimed to determine disruptive technology used in the automotive industry using the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method. The criteria used for disruptive technology selection were Government Regulation, Cost, User-Friendly, Technology Classification, Value Proposition, and Infrastructure. Furthermore, alternatives used were Electric Vehicles, Connected Cars, and Autonomous Driving. The research resulted in criteria ranking (weight) as follows: Government Regulation (0.41), Cost (0.22), User-Friendly (0.16), Technology Classification (0.08), Value Proposition (0.07), and Infrastructure (0.06). The findings showed the most important criteria during disruptive technology selection was Government Regulation. On the other hand, the research also resulted in alternatives ranking (preference) as follows: Electric Vehicle (0.82), Connected Car (0.55), and Autonomous Driving (0.27). The findings showed the most preferred alternative was Electric Vehicles. This research arguably has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this research was the first attempt to determine disruptive technology used in the automotive industry. Practically, this research could guide the automotive manufacturer to select the most disruptive technology while considering some critical criteria during the research and development process. The limitations of this research are the lack of automotive manufacturers that have done using disruptive technologies. Hence, future research could gather more automotive manufacturers using disruptive technologies and consider other critical criteria during the disruptive technology selection.","fahmi ramadhan putra, novandra rhezza pratama, m. dachyar department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia fahmi.ramadhan01@ui.ac.id, novandra@ui.ac.id, mdachyar@yahoo.com",
87,Business Process Analysis In Revenue Administration In The  Oil And Gas Drilling Services In Indonesia: A Case Study,"the oil and gas drilling process in its implementation has a work agreement contract process that will affect activities from drilling services into organizational income. in this paper, the authors conduct research on the business processes that occur in a drilling service organization in the revenue line, such as making billing documents for the work done. we validate the equality of information criteria with experts in the administration of drilling services with information criteria in public administration. finally, the business processes that occur and the comparison of the duration of the process in the drilling service standard with the realization process are also described to identify the problem and determine the possibility for business processes development with bpr. the information criteria in the revenue administration process in the drilling service sector can be said to be the same as the information criteria in public administration. so that information must be correct, comprehensive, actual, and accessible. for further research, business process reengineering may be needed in the revenue drilling service line. thus, it can also be concluded that business process reengineering can be carried out on business processes in this drilling service.","business process, administration","Refer to the data, specifically to Figure 3 and table 3, it can be concluded that for the processes that occur in the drilling service organization, it can be related to some of the most popular best practices from business process reengineering. It can be seen that several revisions occur, it can be related to task elimination, where revisions are possible only once. For processes related to task composition, several processes can be combined, such as combining the documents needed for verification at certain stages. integrally technology and integration of these best practices, it can be concluded that the work between the user and the drilling service can be done by integrating between organizations with the use of technology to reduce the limitations that occur because previously it was done physically in the business process. In the performance indicator table, it can be seen in Table 2 that every year there is an increase in billing data units. This indicates that every year there is an increase in demand for drilling services. The information criteria in the revenue administration process in the drilling service sector can be said to be the same as the information criteria in public administration. so that information must be correct, comprehensive, actual, and accessible. for further research, business process reengineering may be needed in the revenue drilling service line.

92,Impact Of Personal And Academic Factors On Outcomebased Education Of Third-Year Engineering Students In The,"distance learning has been advancing in today’s time given the continuous enhancement of technology in the world. moreover, with the covid-19 pandemic that hit nationwide, the education sector had to turn to distance learning to save the education of students in this generation. the research aims to analyze how engineering students’ personal and academic experiences under an unusual online set-up create an impact on their well-being as an individual. through the dissemination of survey questionnaires to the students, the researchers will measure the results through statistical analysis. with that, the independent variables identified in the study are manipulated into warppls to foresee their relationship with the determined dependent variable through structural equation modeling. it enables a concrete evaluation of which factors affect a student of abundant or sparse weight.",distance learning,"Since there are abrupt changes in implementing online distance learning to recommence education on newly established systems, the study specifically sought to find out the significance of the three latent variables, Individual Profile, Learning Resources, and Class Delivery on the OBE Grade of UST Engineering students during the first semester when full-time Enriched Virtual Mode of learning was implemented by the institution, which was during the first semester of A.Y. 2020-2021. The researchers sorted the variables based on the formulated survey questionnaire and subsequently constructed a Structural Equation Model on the software WarpPLS to simplify and carry out the statistical analysis. After running the data, results showed that one independent variable, Individual Profile, was found significant among the three Independent Variables. There are six (6) observed variables under Individual Profile which are the following: Learning Style, Community, and Social Connection, Geographical Location, Self-motivation, Learning Environment, and Financial Capability. Considering the aim of the study to aid engineering students regarding their distance learning practices and techniques, the results from statistical analysis displayed satisfactory and specific outcomes. It allows the educational sector, including students, teachers, and academic institutions, to focus on students' Individual Profiles in creating new and improved learning approaches for the betterment of the whole educational system after being affected by one of the most challenging phenomena nationwide, the COVID-19 Pandemic. Highlighting the technical subjects being undergone in the Engineering course, implementation of various laboratory activities became a challenge for the institution to conduct virtually. The Individual Profiles of students are different under distance learning and possession of resources is one of the major issues encountered, taking into account that these classes would require several tools or machines. Also, with the limited hands-on experience that became unavailable for students, ensued a lack of confidence in the following entry to the professional engineering world. On the other hand, with the convergent validity of all the three latent variables, it can be concluded that despite Individual Profile being the only one of significance, all three variables still have a small interrelation. The study allows the concerned bodies to tackle the Learning Resources and Class Delivery variables after primary comprehension with Individual Profile.","university of santo tomas delivered through full online modality sophia jayelle p. dy, alyanna micayla t. lascano, joshua s. salvador and dioschwin n. sumo faculty of engineering university of santo tomas manila, philippines sophajayelle.dy.eng@ust.edu.ph, alyannamicayla.lascano.eng@ust.edu.ph, joshua.salvador.eng@ust.edu.ph, dioschwin.sumo.eng@ust.edu.ph",

With the consideration of health-related impacts, people perceived going to hospitals as a challenge due to the lockdown. Recent development in technology has led different countries to consider using telemedicine – an offsite, online, remote way to consult with health-related issues with professionals. This study considered factors such as environmental and political, personal, individual factors, and the UTAUT2 model. Employing a step-wise MLR analysis from a 533 dataset, it was seen that PE, EE, IU, GL, and HM showed a direct and high significance to PUA. Moreover, GL and RU were seen to have low significance in relation to PUA. Lastly, age was seen to have an indirect proportion to PUA. When people see the benefit, contribution, understanding, and purpose of telemedicine, they would have the perception to adapt with the technology. With that, the habit of using telemedicine may be developed and people would eventually consider telemedicine as a new normal with regards to consultation with different healthcare services.","ardvin kester s. ong, yoshiki b. kurata, sophia alessandra d.g. castro, jeanne paulene b. de leon, hazel v. dela rosa, alex patricia j. tomines department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, university of santo tomas, philippines. españa blvd, 1015, manila, philippines asong@ust.edu.ph; ybkurata@ust.edu.ph ; sophiaalessandra.castro.eng@ust.edu.ph ; jeannepaulene.deleon.eng@ust.edu.ph ; hazel.delarosa.eng@ust.edu.ph; alexpatricia.tomines.eng@ust.edu.ph ardvin kester s. ong, yoshiki b. kurata school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university, manila, philippines 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines aksong@mapua.edu.ph ; ybkurata@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",

96,Relationship Aspects Total Quality Management  Towards The Satisfaction Of Lecturers In The Independent,"the indonesian government in 2020 implemented the independent learning-independent campus (mbkm) policy, namely the independent learning-independent campus policy where students are allowed to study for 3 semesters outside their study program. lecturers play an important role in the implementation of mbkm policies. therefore, it is important to know the factors that influence lecturer satisfaction in the implementation of mbkm. these factors are part of the soft total quality management (tqm) concept which is responsible for lecturer satisfaction. this research takes a case study at the indonesian institute of technology (iti). the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of soft tqm practices on lecturer satisfaction in implementing mbkm policies. the soft tqm aspects studied are: (1) top management commitment; (2) team work; (3) lecturer empowerment; (4) training; and (5) culture. respondents as many as 70 lecturers where only 58 valid questionnaires. multiple regression method was used to examine the relationship between all aspects of soft tqm and lecturer satisfaction. the results showed that the variables that leveraged the satisfaction of lecturers in implementing mbkm were lecturer empowerment, top management commitment and teamwork. but cultural factors and training are not leverage for lecturer satisfaction. the results also show that top management commitment, teamwork, lecturer empowerment, training and culture simultaneously have no effect on lecturer satisfaction.",mbkm,"This study describes the relationship between aspects of soft TQM and job satisfaction in the context of changing MBKM policies in Indonesia. This study aims to close the gap of limited research on the influence of soft TQM aspects on lecturer satisfaction, especially when a new policy is implemented in Indonesia. The main conclusions that can be drawn from the results of this study can be stated as follows: 1. The research findings show that top management commitment, lecturer empowerment, training, team work, culture simultaneously have no positive effect on lecturer satisfaction. Thus, the five soft aspects of TQM simultaneously did not affect the level of lecturer satisfaction in the MBKM era. 2. The most important aspects of soft TQM to determine the satisfaction of lecturers in the MBKM era are the commitment of top management, empowerment of lecturers and team work. 3. The interesting thing in the findings of this study is that training and culture do not have a significant relationship with lecturer satisfaction in the MBKM era. 4. The findings contribute to educational organizations in Indonesia to create an understanding of the application of soft TQM aspects that result in increased teacher satisfaction in the MBKM era. However, this study has some limitations. First, the research design is cross sectional, where the questionnaires are collected at a certain time. In fact, lecturers' perceptions of the implementation of soft TQM aspects of the MBKM era can change over time. Second, this research is only a case study in a private university.

98,Integration Of Linear Programming From The Overall  Equipment Effectiveness Machine Performance Evaluation,"according to a study on the philippine manufacturing activities by the board of investments (boi) in 2017, the philippines is regarded as asia’s new manufacturing powerhouse; its top 1,000 corporations include 322 manufacturing firms and post gross revenues totaling php 3.2 trillion. the manufacturing industry is a significant player in the economic sectors, generating both wealth and employment. however, many processes experience significant delays due to machine downtimes and erratic work schedules, resulting in low machine efficiency and product throughput. through careful consideration, this research study focuses on a 3rd party logistics company specifically, the b-mirk enterprises. b-mirk enterprises is one of the premier providers of manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, and manpower services in the philippines. the research study aims to evaluate the company’s performance through the overall equipment effectiveness (oee) criteria and identify parameters that influence the outcomes of the company’s production processes. the research study focuses on the company’s newly implemented services within the labeling department which are also identified as the lowest in terms of its efficiency. a mathematical model is generated through the use of the linear programming technique, which is an analytical method of problem-solving and decision-making that is proven to be useful in the management of organizations. the overall study evaluated the company’s overall production performance as a support in developing an lp algorithm which made use of lingo optimizing software and excel solver and was able to maximize machine efficiency and uptime for 7 hours or 2.3 hours per shift for b-mirk’s labeling department.","machine downtimes, bmirk enterprise, oee","The study was conducted to further assess the production downtime of B-Mirk's labeling machine. The labeling production from a third-party logistics such as B-Mirk Corporation became the focus of this research through the motivation of a new production process emerging amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and the specific hurdles that needed to be addressed. These hurdles influenced the need to provide greater improvements in terms of productivity in overall labeling production. The production reports provided by the company were analyzed, and Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) was utilized to perform an in depth assessment of the machine performance, which revealed that the downtime is a critical factor in the machine's availability and performance rate, which affects the production output. As seen in Table 5, the availability and performance rate was one of the causes which affected the overall OEE score of 1.12%, which indicates that having a considerable duration of downtime corresponds to a decrease in the actual production time. In manufacturing, actual production time is the overall duration that the machine is working, which therefore also affects the machine's performance, resulting in a decrease in the production output for the said shift. This decrease in the actual production time was also influenced by the 1-hour maintenance, given that a considerable amount of downtime occurred for the said shift. This study proved that it is possible to reduce downtime through evaluation of production time and output, and allows the focus of improvement on specified characterized downtime that had a major contribution to the decreased machine efficiency. The optimization model was also solved with the use of the software tools such as LINGO and Excel solver, which exhibited a maximized uptime for a single shift for each of the SKUs. From the optimized values obtained from the LP model, uptime was maximized by 7.0256 hours for the three consecutive shifts representing each SKU. This constitutes an uptime of 2.3419 for each shift. Results obtained from the excel solver indicate as well that classified downtime, D1, and D4 could still be further optimized through the company's focus on improving efforts in having a fixed time for Preparation, Set-up, and Cleaning Area, respectively.","to maximize uptime vanessa joyce encarnacion, daphne mae muyargas, von jacob rivera, cryzxia bhene yulo department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of santo tomas manila, philippines vanessajoyce.encarnacion.eng@ust.edu.ph, daphnemae.muyargas.eng@ust.edu.ph, vonjacob.rivera.eng@ust.edu.ph, cryzxiabhene.yulo.eng@ust.edu.ph",
99,Comparative Analysis Of Specific Energy Consumption And  Energy Consumption Benchmarking In Galvanising Plants,"the inadequacy of sustainable energy is endlessly posing major challenges globally. the issue of energy optimisation is indispensable for manufacturing sector, particularly for a hot-dip galvanising process where galvanising furnaces are the significant energy users. this study is aimed at comparative analysis of specific energy consumption and energy consumption benchmarking in four galvanising plants with the view to necessitate the identification of best practices. energy baselines were used as quantitative reference points to compare energy performance indicators and quantify fluctuations in energy performance during the baseline and reporting periods. a quantitative analysis was also conducted to benchmark four galvanising facilities on factors that included the electricity/zinc ratio, electricity /dips ratio and product tonnage/zinc used ratio. the results revealed improved performance for plant 4 over time relative to the baseline consumption when compared to plants 1, 2 and 3. plant 4 also outperformed other facilities after the energy efficiency interventions in terms of electricity/zinc ratio and electricity/ product tonnage ratio. given the disparity between the results of specific energy consumption (sec) for the four plants, it was concluded that sec alone should not be used as an energy performance indicator.",agrawal and pandey,"Bottom-up energy efficiency and saving calculations can be used to derive the energy savings that could be achieved by the galvaniser after the implementation of energy efficiency measures. Best practices were identified in Plant 4; covering of process tanks with insulating material prevented heat loss and led to improved energy performance. It was concluded that SEC alone should not be used as an energy performance indicator since it is not influenced by production only but affected by other variables such as material handling efficiency. Energy consumption benchmarking can be focused on poorly performing Plant 4 and necessitates the identification of best practices from Plant 4 that can be replicated across other Plants 1, 2 and 3. 7.","mendon dewa department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, south africa mendond@dut.ac.za",

101,Tagalog Sentiment Analysis Using Deep Learning Approach  With Backward Slang Inclusion,"as the internet users in the philippines have become increasingly rampant, tagalog sentiment analysis is essential when determining general sentiments correlated to a topic. among tagalog tweets, backward slang has gained increased popularity on social media. deep learning algorithms such as long-short term memory (lstm) and bidirectional lstm (bi-lstm) have been proven more effective than traditional machine learning algorithms. this study explored and evaluated the effects of backward slang on two deep learning models using performance metrics for classification models. results show that backward slang helps in the expressivity of textual data, given the improvement in overall sentiment scores.","sentiment analysis, deep learning, backward slang, netspeak","This study conducted a series of experiments wherein the Backward Slang was included on tweets as a feature to classify sentiment polarities. The models developed in this study do not use any feature engineering to extract special features or any complex modules like sentiment treebanks. Every version of models in this study only relies on pre-trained word vector representation. The study used LSTM and Bi-LSTM as these deep learning architectures can extract further contextual information from dealing with forward and backward dependencies from feature sequences. Despite the complexity of Filipino tweets, especially in the domain of politics due to the presence of sarcastic and satire tweets, the models developed can classify their respective sentiment polarities, having good to great performance metrics. It is conclusive that the inclusion of Backward Slang helps improve overall sentiment scores and performance metrics. While Backward Slang can be used to express negative or positive opinions on a tweet, the presence of these features on tweets has appeared to improve the expressivity of negative opinions more than positive opinions on sentiment analysis. For future studies, the inclusion of another domain aside from politics when mining tweets is encouraged to be explored as the study is limited to identifying political tweets wherein the presence of sarcastic and satire tweets may often occur in the corpus.","aaron john v. boquiren, raymond a. garcia, chrisrenee jerard d. hungria, and joel c. de goma school of information technology mapua university makati, metro manila aaronjohnboquiren@gmail.com, ragarcia@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, chrisrenee.h123@gmail.com, jcdegoma@mapua.edu.ph",
102,Waste Minimisation Through Sustainable Manufacturing,"waste management is a challenge, especially in developing countries. the rapid economic and population growth has further exacerbated the consumption rate, the main driver behind massive waste generation. recent studies have indicated that residents in urban areas generate waste that is roughly 1.2 kg per person, which is an estimated 1.3 million tons per year. statistically, this is likely to increase by 1.42 kg per person and 2.2 billion tons in 2025. therefore, to counteract the impact and consequences of spiralling waste generation, it is essential to do away with unsuitable and flawed means of production and adopt sustainable manufacturing. the emerging concept of 6r- based sustainable manufacturing with its technological elements has given light to new ways of production that can be adopted to achieve environmental protection and material efficiency. material efficiency reduces industrial waste volumes of virgin raw materials, extraction and consumption, increasing waste segregation, decreasing energy demand, reducing extraction and consumption of virgin raw materials, increasing waste segregation, and decreasing carbon emissions thereby, reducing the environmental impact of waste generated by the manufacturing industry. however, the concept of 6r and material efficiency are poorly researched, with minimal information on their role in waste minimisation, especially at manufacturing levels. waste generation can only be reduced if material consumption and material flow are monitored at the early stages of production; this can be done by emphasising material efficiency at the industrial level.","waste management, 6r, optimisation","Although sustainable development and sustainable manufacturing are developed concepts, putting them into practice remains a challenge due to their broad scope, including several factors that need careful evaluation to ensure balance within the environmental, economic, political, and social aspects. Given the diverse interests of all involved stakeholders, it is essential to ensure balance in the trade-offs by integrating all objectives and observing the mandatory policies and procedures (Rosen and Kishawy, 2012). Sentime (2014) also argues that the application of policies and legislation has proven inconsistent. The lack of favourable and comprehensive policies hinders the possibility of sustainable socio-economic service delivery and cost-effective waste management systems; there are fragmented strategies instead of integrated approaches. There is a need for Tshwane municipalities to integrate material efficiency and the 6R model into their existing Integrated waste management plan; this would help address the existing challenges in waste management. The emphasis on waste reduction at the production and end-use phase from the two approaches is exactly what the city needs to reduce the amount of waste diverted into landfills, mainly because their existing landfills are reaching their life span. This paper emphasises prevention and reduction of waste generation, thereby advocating for waste segregation at the source for effective recycling and recovery and as a step toward material efficiency. The paper highlights the need to develop a shared understanding of material efficiency in manufacturing and links existing performance measurements to this shared understanding through material-efficient operations.","anelisa kanyisa nokele masters student university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa khanyienokele@gmail.com dr jackson sebola-samanyanga, ph.d. lecturer- department of urban and regional planning university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa jsebola@uj.ac.za",
103,Implementation Of The Lean Service To Increase Productivity  In The Procurement Of Goods And Services Of Mro,"in the procurement process of goods and services an effective and efficient process is needed in its implementation, to get the ideal process requires a system or process that is integrated with each other, therefore there are many companies that have not applied the concept of lean in the process of procuring goods and services because it is too focused on maximizing production performance. the aim of this study is to identify and analyze the performance of the process of procuring goods and services in the mro industry using the lean service and vsm and dmaic methods. this study shows that there is still waste or waste in the process of procuring goods and services, i.e. there are still activities is manual and not integrated with this technology based on the findings of the number of waiting times current state is 952.78 minutes with va time is 405.78 minutes and process cycle efficiency process is 43.83%, after repairs have been made by changing work processes and work tools with an online based system, it has been improved waiting time by 525.49 minutes and va time is 280.49 and increased process cycle efficiency to 53.37% along with increasing the output of making purchase orders to 951.1 a year from the beginning of 762.2. from the results of this study, it is recommended that companies apply the concept of lean to the process of procuring goods and services and try to use information technology as a tool to carry out procurement activities. keyword procurement of goods and services, lean service, value stream mapping, dmaic. 1. introduction at present there are many improvements made to the production line, but not many improvements or evaluations have been made to the goods and services procurement line where the procurement of goods and services should also play a role in increasing the company's revenue through efficiency, this study aims to apply the concept of lean service to the procurement process of goods and services, during covid-19 pandemic conditions, savings from all lines need to be made, especially the production line, this study shows that in the procurement line there is a gap to make improvements that have a significant impact on costs that come out of the company productivity and quality of the procurement process. this research was conducted on one of the aircraft mro industries in indonesia, where previously there was an inability to fulfill procurement requests from an average of 861 requests per year in the initial conditions, only 762 procurement per year were able to be achieved. the objective of the project is to identify waste in the procurement process of aircraft mro company. and provide suggestions for improving the process of procurement of goods and services also to increase the output purchase order and reduce delays in the process of procurement of goods and services 2. literature review the previous research which is the basis for this research is: the first research was conducted by (pradipto 2018). the proposed application of the lean service concept in the invoicing process, in this study there is an idea to reduce invoice input errors that cause delays in billing payments proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management nsukka, nigeria, 5 - 7 april, 2022 ieom society international 1012",,"Using Lean Service along with Value Stream Mapping and DMAIC can identify waste that occurs in the procurement process which is the number of shortages of documents in procurement request activities which causes a waiting process for procurement fulfillment (waiting), then the document delivery process is still manual, causing a high process waiting time (In-efficient transportation movement of information and Paperwork), then the goods procurement process and services that are still manual, for example: offline meetings, document verification is manual. Causing a large enough waiting time (unnecessary motion), then there are still deficiencies and errors in document making (defects) which causes excessive use of paper (inventory) and the lack of training provided to employees causes the procurement process to be often hampered due to lack of ability (underutilized employee abilities).

104,Design Of A Risk-Based Vendor Selection Model In The  Implementation Of Vmi In Retail Company,"there is a varied way for a company to compete in the market, creating an effective supply chain could be the choice by building a new way of a partnership with vendors. eliminating non-added value through the supply chain such as lead time uncertainty can be done by implementing vendor managed inventory (vmi). information exchange between roles related to point of sales which cause vendors to have control over the inventory owned by retailers is a characteristic of vmi. a large number of actors had a positive impact from vmi, mainly it can control the bullwhip effect in the supply chain. with all the benefits derived from this concept, it comes with some risks involved. most people pay more attention to what suppliers faced by implementing this concept instead of what’s on the retailer side. selecting the right vendor to implement this concept by knowing the risk have to be a concern since retailer needs to rely on the vendor’s decision of their inventory. the objective of this research is to identify the risks faced by retailers and design the appropriate vendor selection model to apply the concept of vmi. integrating method for identifying the risk (fmea) and a method for solving multi-criteria decision making (fahp) is believed to be able to obtain a robust result and reduce bias by considering the combination of assessment. collecting data at retail company that already applied the concept of vmi was carried out as a case study in this study.","risk management, fmea","From the comparison of these two suppliers, it can be seen that supplier A is the most decent supplier to apply the concept of VMI by conducting the lowest level of risk. In other words, supplier A can be called a reliable supplier to manage inventory from retailers. There are some things that need to be developed in this research, such as adding more alternatives for comparison from a wider scope. This assessment has different characteristics depending on the type of business being run, therefore it would be better if this model could be implemented in other fields with a different perspective.","rischa aninditha, teuku yuri m. zagloel industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, jawa barat, indonesia rischa.aninditha@ui.ac.id; yuri@ie.ui.ac.id",
105,Prototyping For An In-Month Seed Forecasting System,"the current covid pandemic saw a surge in the demand for vegetable seeds in the philippines. local farmers continued to try new vegetable crops using seeds in small packets seed distributors struggled to keep up with the increased demand. this positive market development amidst the uncertain times necessitated the need for an improved sales forecasting system for business organizations distributing seed products. this study aimed to develop a low fidelity prototype for an in-month seed sales forecasting system. a systems analysis of the current process observed in typical seed distribution operations confirmed an opportunity for a computer-based forecasting system. during the systems design phase, a hierarchical input-process-output chart, a use case diagram, and data flow diagrams were generated. microsoft access was used to develop the database. tables, queries, forms, and reports were likewise generated. low fidelity prototyping was used using justinmind. compared to the current process, the new system provided several advantages. flexibility and capability were afforded to a seed distributor, in strengthening the forecasting process to cope with the growing demand for vegetable seeds amidst the uncertainties brought about by the pandemic. an exciting opportunity is an application to the development of a coexistence system for genetically modified (gm) crop seed production. more importantly, highlighting the tools and processes leading up to the development of a simple, low-fidelity prototype provided great academic opportunities, particularly in the design of improved agricultural systems,","seed forecasting, systems design","The ongoing pandemic required the availability of an improved seed forecasting system for seed distributors in the Philippines. Systems analysis of the typical practices of seed distributors presented opportunities for a computer- based in-month seed forecasting system. Process maps such as Use Case Diagrams, System Flowcharts, and Data Flow facilitated the systems design process. Diagrams helped clarify information flow, users, and data requirements. A simulation of databases, forms, queries, and reports using Microsoft Access was very instrumental. As a result, a low-fidelity prototype using Justinmind was effectively developed. Compared to the current process, the new system provided several advantages. None bigger was the flexibility and capability afforded by the new system to a seed distributor, in strengthening the forecasting process to cope with the growing demand for vegetable seeds amidst the uncertainties brought about by the pandemic. Most forecasting methods used in the vegetable seed industry focused on market historical demand, i.e., a reactive approach. This prototype provided a more proactive approach. While considering historical demand, the in-month feature provides real-time information from the dealer and allows the adjustment of the six-month rolling forecast as necessary. The sales forecasting process is unique for each organization and varies across industries. This proposed in-month forecasting system represents an enhancement to existing systems by the incorporation of real-time inputs from the Dealer within the current month. The in-month inputs and information captured by the system as provided by the Dealer are captured both in the current month’s forecast and in the next month’s forecast. As a result, the Sales Manager can incorporate such developments into the six-month rolling forecast as these market developments happen. This adds the proactive approach to the current sales forecasting processes observed. The simple low-fidelity prototype developed for three (3) users in an in-month seed forecasting system present several opportunities for the development of other computer-based information systems in the seed industry. Such opportunities may include, but are not limited to the following: (a) a Business-to-Business (or B2B) tool to manage the relationship between a seed producer and seed distributor, particularly in the areas of forecasting, sales, and credit management; and (b) a Business-to-Consumer (or B2C) tool to manage the relationship between a seed distributor and a farmer, particularly in the areas of demand planning and other relevant farmer feedback; and (d) a component of a coexistence system to sustainably manage the production of GM crops such as Golden Rice and Bt eggplant in the Philippines. The new forecasting system represented by the prototype likewise finds application in industries with operations like the seed industry. Equivalent users in similar industries working with crop protection, feeds, animal health, and animal nutrition, among others, should find this improved forecasting system useful. Industry. Another exciting opportunity is the instructional value available in this study. Highlighted was the process of systems analysis and design and the emphasis on the concept of prototyping, as applied to agriculture. The detailed steps involving the selected tools represent a simple and effective example of the systems analysis and design process. This can be used as instructional material for college-level courses in the systems design and management information systems domain. The emphasis on prototyping as a process opens the possible integration of systems design into the academic curriculum of the agricultural and bioscience engineering field. Innovation of agricultural systems becomes mandatory as the world struggles with a growing population against the backdrop of limited, if not dwindling natural resources. The benefits which can be derived from the prototyping process, as part of these innovation projects, can certainly help.","eric de vera reynoso school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila, philippines ereynoso@mymail.mapua.edu.ph grace lorraine intal school of information technology school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila, philippines gldintal@mapua.edu.ph",

107,Productivity Prediction Of Sea Water Reverse Osmosis  Desalination Plant Using Robust Regression,"multiple linear regression (mlr) is utilized to correlate the process parameters to the output permeate flow rate for a seawater reverse osmosis (swro) desalination plant. thorough residual analysis robust regression provided alternative methods to predict the response with higher accuracy compared to basic mlr analysis. robust regression methods are developed in this study to predict the productivity of a seawater reverse osmosis plant based on key empirical correlations. the robust regression methodology considers important input operating parameters such as feed flow rate, feed pressure, outlet pressure of the multi-media filter, inlet and outlet cartridge filter pressures, outlet pressure of the high-pressure pump, and inlet seawater flow rate to pressure exchanger and correlates them to the permeate flow rate. the robust regression models are capable of accurately predicting response for any input operating parameters for the reverse osmosis plant. the regression models demonstrated strong statistical goodness-of-fit measures using huber’s method in terms of three-way interactions with a high r2 of approximately 0.99 and a mean absolute percentage error of 2.4%. furthermore, the robust regression results have been validated experimentally and the results showed very good agreement with measured values, with an error of approximately 0.8%.","desalination, reverse osmosis, robust regression","Robust regression provides an alternative approach to basic multiple linear regression that works through a robust residual analysis to minimize the influence of outliers. In addition, more independent variables are generated as a result of the interactions of the input variables, which are analyzed to generate strong statistical correlations using robust methods. Four different robust regression models have been developed using Huber's and Tukey's Biweight methods. Their performance was evaluated in terms of R2, mean square error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error. From the statistical analysis carried out in this study, the following could be concluded: 1. Multiple linear regression performs poorly without input data preprocessing. 2. Three-ways interactions have a higher accuracy performance, as expected. 3. In terms of up to three-way interactions, Tukey's Biweight method provides the highest R2 after robust weighting. 4. Huber’s method correlations have higher accuracy which generates correlations that describe the real physical behavior of the system. This was confirmed by experimental validation even though Tukey's Biweight develops a higher F-Ratio in ANOVA. 5. Huber’s method provides higher performance in terms of error metrics and the Huber’s robust equation has been experimentally validated yielding a very low relative error. 6. The data preprocessing and robust regression improved the fitting R2 coefficient from 0.63 (before preprocessing) to approximately 0.99 with an improvement of approximately 57%. 6.","ahmed s. sabry, yehia m. youssef, and khaled s. el-kilany department of industrial and management engineering department of chemical and petrochemical engineering college of engineering and technology arab academy for science, technology, and maritime transport alexandria, egypt. eng.ahmed.elmasri@gmail.com, yehia.youssef@staff.aast.edu, kkilany@aast.edu",
108,Proposed Utilities Billing Information Management System  Using Google Workspace Platform For A Property,"cloud computing's popularity has been dominant in the it industry over the past year. one of the widely-used cloud platforms among the business organization is the google workspace (formerly g suite), an integrated cloud-based service that offers real-time document collaboration and increased cloud storage capacity. in this paper, the cloud platform was utilized to create an online computer-based information system (cbis) for utilities data management and processing to eliminate work handoffs and prevent human error throughout the utilities billing information processing for a property management services company. the proposed cbis, called ubis (utilities billing information system), also aims to automate the traditional manual generation of forms and reports required in the utilities data processing. the first three phases of the sdlc waterfall model were used as a guide in developing the proposed online cbis - systems planning, systems analysis, and systems design. in the system review, five manual processes are identified that can be automated, and four out of these five processes are also considered unnecessary work handoffs. the use case diagram, system flowchart, and dataflow diagram (dfd) were used in the system design. the four work handoffs were eliminated in the system testing, and the five manual processes were automated successfully through the ubis using google workspace. the criteria analysis using a scoring model is used to evaluate the proposed ubis and the traditional system. results show that the ubis is the better system overall by scoring higher in 6 out of 8 criteria based on the company's business model.","google workspace, information system, cloud computing, process automation","and Recommendations While the use of Google Workspace in creating the proposed UBIS was successful, more functions in the cloud platform can be used and integrated to improve business processes.

110,Design Of Mass Rapid Transit (Mrt) Service Quality  Through Analysis Of Factor Affecting Passenger Behavior,"jakarta’s massive economic growth has led to rapid urbanization. the urbanization and population growth, incommensurate with the infrastructure development, has caused transportation problems. this has triggered the government to establish sustainable transportation policies by adopting mass public transportation as a tool to attract people to use mass public transportation and reducing private vehicle users. several modes of mass public transportations have been introduced by jakarta government such as bus and train services, but the number of public transport users is still low. one of the causes of the small number of public transport users in greater jakarta is the low quality of transportation services compared to other modes. therefore, the government introduces mass rapid transit system (mrt) as a new mode of public transportation, the first underground rail system in indonesia. considered as a new public transportation mode, the provider needs to evaluate the quality service offered to persuade people to use it and to retain them. this study aims to assess the importance dimension of service quality and customer satisfaction on mrt passengers’ behavior intention using partial least square structural equation models (pls-sem). this paper will explore the impact of several factors on passenger behavior intention towards public transport services. a comprehensive investigation of the factors regarding the relationship between mass rapid transit (mrt) service quality and corporate image on customer satisfaction and behavior intention of transportation public user is a contribution that will be made through this research. we introduce the development of pls-sem analysis into an important performance matrix as the basis for formulating a service quality strategy by mass rapid transit public transport operators through the house of quality method.","service quality, satisfaction, behavior intention, pls-sem","The aim of this study is to assess the importance dimension of service quality and customer satisfaction on MRT passengers’ behavior intention and selecting the strategy to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. PLS-SEM can be used as a framework for predicting MRT customer satisfaction and behavior using the proposed research model. The result of hypotheses testing shows that among seventeen hypotheses proposed, fifteen hypotheses are accepted. All the service quality dimension has a positive and direct effect on perceived service quality. In line with that result, perceived service quality has a positive and direct effect on passenger satisfaction and passenger value. Both were mediation service quality into passenger loyalty. Using IPMA as extension analysis on PLS-SEM is establish in service quality dimension. So, the factors which influence the user satisfaction and behavior with MRT and several measures which might improve passenger satisfaction and loyalty were investigated. Based on the IPMA result, the responsiveness dimension has the lowest performance value with the highest level of importance. Then followed by the tangibility, empathy, reliability, and assurance dimension. Recommendations are given to MRT providers to make strategies to improve the quality of MRT services according to ability based on priority technical responses and requirements. The main five strategies to be implemented are: 1) conduct the technical and soft skill training for operation and maintenance staff, 2) improve train availability and reliability, 3) conduct preventive and corrective maintenance to maintain the reliability of train operation, 4) establish standard operating Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Nsukka, Nigeria, 5 - 7 April, 2022 IEOM Society International 1098","intention using pls-sem and qfd amalia hasanah nur ahlina, dendi p ishak industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, jawa barat, indonesia amalia.hasanah@ui.ac.id, dendi@ie.ui.ac.id","References

116,The Influence Of Job Search Activities And Evaluation Of  Shortlist Of Possible Jobs On Application Intention,"the covid-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on several world industrial sectors, the health industry is forced to work harder to suppress the spread of the covid-19 virus. not only the industrial sector that accepts, but also the economic sector accepts the limits of normal business activities. several countries have activities both nationally and internationally or commonly known as lockdown. many countries have experienced an economic crisis until they experienced a recession, but there are also several countries that have survived the economic crisis due to the covid-19 pandemic until they do not experience a recession. however, this pandemic has actually become an encouragement for job seekers, besides that there must be interest in adjustments, but also the consequences of the new system implemented by the company to continue working with limited activities due to the covid-19 pandemic. the population used in this study are job seekers who are of working age and preparing to enter the world of work. the sample used was 100 respondents and analyzed using path analysis and the help of the third version of the smartpls application. the results showed that all variables had a positive and significant effect on the decisions proposed at the job vacancy provider company. keyword job search activities, job awareness, persuasion, evaluation and shortlist of possible jobs, application intention. 1. introduction the impact of the covid-19 pandemic that has hit all corners of the world, which not only attacks the world health sector but also attacks all sectors, especially the world economic sector. restrictions are carried out, both semi and total area lockouts, commonly known as lockdowns. these efforts are aimed at suppressing the spread of the covid- 19 pandemic, which has made poor countries worse off, developing countries and developed countries have been battered. almost all aspects of the economy are affected, starting from micro to macro businesses, the performance of the manufacturing industry, the financial sector, world trade, export and import to the service sector which is most affected by tourism, this pandemic is the tourism service sector owned by each country around the world as shut down by the covid-19 pandemic. several commodities, such as world oil traded in the west texas intermediate (wti) futures contract, fell to minus 37.63 us dollars per barrel, due to the drastic decline in demand from the united states and globally. until now, world economic activity is still up and down considering global economic conditions are colored by uncertainty along with concerns that this pandemic will never end, as well as the emergence of a new wave of the covid-19 variant on the european continent. the world bank said the crisis experienced due to the covid-19 pandemic caused the worst recession since world war ii. elsewhere, the imf also said that this crisis was the worst since the great depression of 1929 which spread throughout the world. in the asean region, several countries have also experienced negative economic growth, firstly, singapore has experienced a recession in the first quarter and second quarter with contractions of 0.3% and 12.6%, respectively. furthermore, thailand experienced a recession, namely negative 2% and 12.2%. and the indonesian state is more ""profitable"" than other countries where in the first quarter they grew by 2.97% and in the second quarter they experienced a negative number of 5.32%. the world bank also said that the pandemic and the torment of the global economy will have a domino effect, namely, an increase in poverty rates throughout the world. the world bank estimates that this pandemic has pushed 71 million and even up to 100 million people worldwide into extreme poverty. then, the unemployment rate will automatically increase due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic and the stalled industrial economic activity. the eocd (organization for economic co-operation and development) maps that the unemployment rate in april 2020 rose to 8.4% from the position in march where in that month only the proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management nsukka, nigeria, 5 - 7 april, 2022 ieom society international 1123",,"Some conclusions that are expected to provide answers to the problems formulated in this study are as follows: Activity Factors Job Search Activities and Job Awareness according to the respondents' views as a whole are in a fairly good and significant category. This shows that the Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs and Application Intentions are highly dependent on the Job Search Activities and Job Awareness activity factors. So that this is one of the factors that need to be considered by job seekers in looking for work and the intention to apply, they must raise enthusiasm in Job Search Activities and Job Awareness. Job Search Activities and Job Awareness as a whole affect the Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs and Application Intentions. Furthermore, there is the persuasion factor which in the eyes of the respondents as a whole is in the very good category and has a significant effect. These results indicate that the Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs and Application Intentions are highly dependent on the Persuasion factor. So that this is also one of the criteria that need to be considered by job seekers in looking for work before there is an Application Intention. The Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs factors in the eyes of the respondents as a whole have a fairly good and significant influence on the decision to apply. So these results indicate that the decision for Application Intention is strongly influenced and depends on the category of Evaluation and Shortlist of Possible Jobs. So that this is a criteria that needs to be done by Generation Z in looking for work and before there is an intention to apply.","dava arla gammal muhammad, mahendra fakhri, syarifuddin syarifuddin, anita silvianita school of communication and business telkom university arladava@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, mahendrafakhri@telkomuniversity.ac.id, syarifuddin@telkomuniversity.ac.id, anitasilvianita@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

121,Towards High-Performance Buildings Using Iot And Ai  Technologies: A Comprehensive Review,"improving buildings’ energy efficiency while preserving indoor thermal comfort conditions of hot climate regions has been within the high-interest topics among academics. researchers have noted that achieving both concepts is essential to improve buildings’ sustainability and energy management system. therefore, it pushes the need to conduct a comprehensive review to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure solid foundations for future research. this paper aims to present a review on the state-of-art of internet of things (iot) technology and artificial intelligence (ai) techniques to integrate better building energy management systems. this is achieved through a systematic literature review of 30 related papers from the past ten years. the paper argues that very few studies demonstrate the implementation of iot-ai based methods in the building industry, and its full potential is not realized yet. therefore, it calls for more attention from academics within the application perspective in the related field.","sustainability, thermal comfort",,"lama alhaj husein department of industrial engineering and engineering management, college of engineering university of sharjah sharjah, uae. lhusein@sharjah.ac.ae prof. imad alsyouf sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group, department of industrial engineering and engineering management, college of engineering, university of sharjah sharjah, uae. ialsyouf@sharjah.ac.ae dr. emad mushtaha department of architectural engineering, college of engineering university of sharjah sharjah, uae. emushtaha@sharjah.ac.ae dr. ahmad alzghoul data science department, princess sumaya university for technology amman, jordan a.alzghoul@psut.edu.jo",
122,Inter-Rater Reliability Of Manual Anthropometric  Measurement Of Students Of Tertiary Institution In North-,"anthropometric data remain an essential requirement for designing safe and comfortable facilities and workstations. anthropometric data collection using manual measuring instruments employs many measurers because they are generally slow and time-consuming. using multiple measurers introduces the challenge of inter-rater reliability because the measurers may be selected from different professions and cadres despite the initial training for the measurement exercise. this study analyzes the inter-rater reliability of the anthropometric data measured by lecturers and students to determine if the different cadre affects the measurement's reliability. two lecturers and two final-year students participated in the measurement test. after the initial two-day training, fifteen anthropometric dimensions for 38 students were measured using the standard anthropometric measuring instrument. the students were divided into two groups, and each group of measurer measured both groups at different sessions. a retest was conducted on 5-6 days after the first test. an average measure two-way random effect with absolute agreement at a 95% confidence interval was selected for the analysis. the results show that the vertical anthropometric dimensions such as stature, shoulder height, and sitting height have excellent inter-rater correlation coefficient (icc) of 0.9 to 0.98. other vertical anthropometric dimensions such as knee height, popliteal height, and eye height have icc ranges of 0.8 to 0.9. however, dimensions that have to do with body length, such as buttock to popliteal and knee lengths, shoulder breadth, etc., have icc values of 0.4 to 0.8. all dimensions that require a change of posture during measurement also recorded low icc. the study shows that inter-rater reliability was affected by the availability of landmarks, posture, and participants' orientation. therefore, if possible, professionals should measure dimensions with significant variability.","school ergonomics, anthropometry, nigeria",,"west nigeria. ademola james adeyemi department of mechanical engineering school of industrial engineering waziri umaru federal polytechnic birnin kebbi kebbi state nigeria department of mechanical engineering usmanu danfodiyo university, sokoto sokoto state nigeria folashademola@gmail.com olusegun isa lasisi, muyideen abdulkadir department of mechanical engineering waziri umaru federal polytechnic birnin kebbi kebbi state nigeria paul ojile department of architectural technology waziri umaru federal polytechnic birnin kebbi kebbi state nigeria",
123,Impact Of Effective Layout In Reducing Noise Pollution In  Birnin Kebbi Central Market In North-West Nigeria,"the central market birnin kebbi has been identified as one of the noisiest locations in the capital city of kebbi state, located in north-west nigeria. the milling section of the market is a major contributor to noise pollution. the area is also one of the busiest because its access gate is close to a parking lot, thereby exposing the operator and their customers to noise and other visitors who want fast access into the market. a major source of noise is the diesel- powered internal combustion engines, which are the convenient choice because of the country's economy and standard of living. this study investigates the effect of a recent relocation of the milling section on the noise level and the different impacts such relocation has on machine operators' health and economy. the noise level at both locations was measured using a noise level meter for five consecutive days from 9 am to 3 pm each day. the traffic intensity at both locations were also compared, while a survey among the operators was conducted to determine the health and economic impact of the relocation on them. the activity relationship (ar) and to-fro charts were used to assess the impact of the relocation on customers' patronage. the result showed that while the noise level remained high above the harmful level of 85dba, the effect on population decreased significantly as people exposed to noise reduced from 100/m2/minute to 20/m2/minute during peak hours. however, the ar and to-fro analysis revealed a significant increase in the distance covered between the milling section and other sections that are auxiliary to milling. this finding also correlates with the reported decrease in the patronage level of customers and job satisfaction of the milling operators. therefore, there is the need to adopt an optimized layout that will relocate the axillary sections closer to the milling section with minimal exposure to noise. also, there is a need for increased awareness among operators on the short-term and long-term effects of excessive noise pollution. the market administrators also need to adhere to sound level standards in the country.","sound level meter, nigeria",,"semiu adedeji yusuf, ademola james adeyemi, abubakar arzika zaki, olusegun isa lasisi department of mechanical engineering waziri umaru federal polytechnic birnin kebbi kebbi state nigeria semiuadedeji@yahoo.com ademola james adeyemi department of mechanical engineering usmanu danfodiyo university sokoto sokoto state nigeria folashademola@gmail.com",

126,Integrated Location And Technician Routing Problem With  Profits And Time Windows For Supporting Maintenance,"information technology has been widely used in many industries in recent days, and many companies use outsourcing services through managed service schemes with revenue sharing patterns. to maintain the services, the managed service providers need to have a well-planned maintenance activities for both preventive and corrective purposes. several operational parameters of maintenance are the number and location of the technician depot. these parameters must be determined optimally to meet the targeted service level. meanwhile, there are some constraints that make the service providers require to design the optimum maintenance travel route for the maintenance technicians. this research use a case research of a service provider and adopts a vehicle routing problem (vrp) concept to develop an optimum route to support the maintenance activities for information technology infrastructure. to define the location of the depots and the maintenance routes, an algorithm of integrated location and technician routing problem with profits and time windows is developed. the numerical experiments show that the algorithm provides a better solution compared to the existing practice in the case research. this work provides not only a better solution and simple practice for the service provider companies but also enrich the literature in the development of vrp concept.","maintenance, technician route, profit","From the results of data processing and analysis above, it can be concluded that for the research object of 15 Customer locations it takes 2 depots of operations technicians and maintenance, namely Depot 1 (Provider Office) which serves 7 Customers and Depot 2 (Site Operation Gubeng) to serve 8 Customers. While in determining the vehicle travel route of the maintenance technician team, it can be concluded that it must be done to break the route into 2 routes in order to meet the limit that the vehicle must return to the depot before business hours end, with the total cost for both depots is Rp. 176,333 per travel cycle. The existence of these 2 routes became the basis for Provider Management to determine the operational policy, whether the addition of the team and fleet of vehicles or maintenance scheduling the next day. The use Location and Routing Problem with set covering models and team orienteering problems with profits and time windows can solved by an exact and heuristic approach that meet the objective function and limitations, but need to be compared with other methods in anticipation for local optimum phenomena. For the further research, this research can be extended by considering application of the model to a larger number of objects.

134,Designing A Domestic Biodiesel Generation Machine For  Rural Communities,"this paper discusses the design of a biodiesel pilot plant that uses waste cooking oil collected from fried food retailers to produce biodiesel. greenhouse gas emissions, land pollution, a bad rural economy, a lack of foreign exchange, and unemployment are all issues that have a negative impact on the south african national economy, and the machine is designed to address these issues. user-friendly, raw material storage capacity, cost- effectiveness, and environmental friendliness were all requirements for the designed machine. three designs of the biodiesel pilot plant were generated to reduce the problem by converting the waste cooking into biodiesel. the most convenient design was the pilot plant ‘one reactor tank’ since it is cost-efficient due to fewer components used when manufacturing. safety considerations have been integrated with the design to minimise the possible risks that may be experienced while using the machine. in the second semester, the supervisor recommended that a group design a biodiesel pilot plant to improve on the ones done individually. in theory, the final design is more efficient, cost-effective, and simple to construct when compared to the others. the biodiesel pilot plant recycles used cooking oil to promote environmental social responsibility as a commodity while also informing the public about the importance of renewable energy sources. the model also encourages communities to get involved in the recycle economy concept. the machine will reduce the country's dependency on imported fossil fuels while also promoting long-term rural development. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management nsukka, nigeria, 5 - 7 april, 2022 ieom society international 1280",,"and Future Research The project aimed to develop a Biodiesel pilot plant that would generate biodiesel from waste cooking oil collected from restaurants and fried food sellers. The machine must be user-friendly, can store raw materials, be cost- effective, and be environmentally friendly. Three designs of the biodiesel pilot plant were generated to address the problem, the more convenient design was the one reactor tank since it is cost-efficient due to fewer components used. Safety considerations have been drafted to minimise the possible risks that may be experienced while using the machine. The design was based on the standards provided by the South African National Standard (SANS). The machine's prototype can be constructed so that testing can be run to see if the machine satisfies the aim of this project. Methanol is a highly costly fuel, and its price is linked to the change in oil prices. The objective should be to create a long-lasting yet low-cost pilot unit by including a methanol recovery phase in a design. The recovery is ensured by heating the processor tank to 65°C to ensure that all methanol boils. The evaporated methanol is then passed through a condenser before being recovered and reused in the next biofuel production. For further optimisation, the simulation may be done with the aid of Autodesk Inventor and ANSYS to test if the machine will be able to resist the temperature, pressure, and forces being applied. 8.","o.g. tiro department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. bokangtiro093@gmail.com a.t. molale department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. tumelomolale451@gmail.com m.m. setwaba department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. 217026898@student.uj.ac.za s. khumalo department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. 217038503@student.uj.ac.za d.v.v. kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. dkallon@uj.ac.za o. awogbemi department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. jolawogbemi2015@gmail.com",
135,Elasticity Of Labor Demand And Real Wages Rigidity By  Sector In West Java Province (2000-2020),"this study aims to measure the elasticity of labor demand and the level of rigidity of real wages and to study the dynamic behavior of sectoral real wages in west java. the elasticity of demand for labor was analyzed using the ols method, the level of wage rigidity using the error correction model (ecm) and the dynamic behavior of real wages using the impulse response function (irf) method. the results show that the elasticity of demand for labor to real wages is inelastic in all sectors. the elasticity of demand for labor on changes in various sources of economic growth is also inelastic in all sectors. employment opportunities in the agricultural and industrial sectors are more responsive to increasing exports and investment, while other sectors are more responsive to increasing public consumption. labor productivity and imports significantly reduce employment opportunities in all sectors. furthermore, the industrial sector has real wages that are more rigid than the real wages of the agricultural sector and other sectors. the real wages of the industrial sector need time to reach equilibrium, as well as the agricultural sector and other sectors also need time to reach the equilibrium level. increasing the competitiveness of export commodities and creating a conducive investment climate are strategic steps to expand job opportunities. in addition, policies such as setting the minimum wage that is more in line with market wages are also considered strategic to reduce wage rigidity in west java province","demand elasticity, real wage rigidity, m.b.a",,"nur azmi karim entrepreneurship departement, bussiness school undergraduate program bina nusantara university bandung campus bandung, indonesia nur.karim@binus.ac.id",
136,Development Of Internet Of Things Model For Acoustic  Maintenance Of Boilers,"this report documents the design of an acoustic horn and development of internet of things (iot) model for acoustic maintenance of boilers. the aim was to design an acoustic horn cleaner which use acoustic energy or sound waves to blast off particles build-up from the boiler tubes while the boiler is operating. autocad invertor 2021 was used to generate a modelled acoustic horn which was then simulated using real life forces, pressures and temperatures encountered in the operation of the boilers. different sources were also used to develop an internet of things model. the application of the acoustic cleaner is in a boiler which is a critical environment with an approximate pressure of 552 kpa and a maximum temperature of 300 °c. stress (static ad transient dynamic) and thermal analysis simulations were conducted on the critical components of the design using ansys r2 student version. the deflection of the diaphragm was determined under the action of maximum pressure supplied by the compressed air to deflect to approximately 0.546 m without restrictions., however, in actual sense the diaphragm deformation is restricted by the housing and thus, excessive deformation above 100mm of the diaphragm is unlikely. the endcap of the housing has a deflection allowance of 80mm which is enough for the membrane to vibrate at natural frequency of 75.322 hz. an iot model was developed for remote access to the developed acoustic cleaning system. the developed iot boiler maintenance model is also known as a smart boiler model.",internet of things,"The simulations indicate that the Acoustic horn assembly has an output of 75.322 Hz frequency. The Diaphragm that generates this frequency is not subjected to excessive stresses and hence does undergo permanent or excessive deformation which will lead to fracture (Shandu and Kallon, 2020b). The diaphragm housing assembly that houses the diaphragm restricts the amount of deflection of the diaphragm to 80mm and thus as the diaphragm will be able to expand and allow for the evacuation of the pressurized air particles without exceeding deformation of 80mm.

137,Concept Development Of A Vibration Sensor For Industrial  Boilers,"an acoustic horn has been developed for sasol synfuels in secunda. it has been concluded that this is the best methodology for dislodging ash agglomeration on the boiler tubes, since it can perform this act while boilers are in operation, thereby eliminating the need to shut down boilers for cleaning. the acoustic horn utilises sound energy that induces vibration and strain on the boiler substructure components. this results in a concern to develop vibration and strain sensors in order to measure these phenomena. an accelerometer is considered to monitor vibration signals, while a secondary strain-gauge sensor is considered to measure strain signals. the analysis entails a predetermined assessment of the suitable sensor parameters for the anticipated input signals. the appropriate accelerometer for this kind of application is concluded to be a piezoelectric accelerometer with a sensitivity of 1000 mv/g as most suitable. furthermore, a strain-gauge sensor of a quarter-bridge type one with a gauge factor of 2 and nominal resistance of 350 ω is deemed to be most suitable.","vibration, strain, sensitivity, nominal resistance","Fundamental sensor parameters were established in order to proceed with design, analysis, and simulation. A piezoelectric accelerometer was elected and defined to have a sensitivity of 1000 mV/g for a vibration signal of 0.1 g. While the strain-gauge sensor was defined to have a resistance of 350 Ω with a gauge factor of 2. In addition to the strain-gauge sensor, a quarter-bridge configuration type I proved to be suitable for development.","t. mafokwane department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. thabithabz@live.co.za d. v. v. kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. dkallon@uj.ac.za l. j. tartibu department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. ltartibu@uj.ac.za",
138,Review Of Acoustics Technology For Cleaning At Industries,"acoustics can primarily be defined as the discipline that deals with the creation, reception, transmission, control, and properties of sound, where mechanical waves propagate in an elastic medium such as solids, gases, and liquids. such mechanical waves transfer energy from one point to another without inducing permanent displacement on the medium. as such, waves do not transfer mass but energy, therefore, mass is only moved perpendicular in the direction of propagation. based on the scientific principles of acoustics technology, many industrial plants have adopted this form of technology for internal substructure cleaning methodologies of plant equipment. this form of cleaning methodology is known as either acoustic cleaning or sonic cleaning. an acoustic cleaning device is utilized to inhibit particulate material accumulation on various plant equipment such as boiler units, ducts, hoppers, and electrostatic precipitators. surface cleanliness is maintained without intrusion into the internal substructure of plant equipment. this paper reports on the state or arts in the development of the acoustics cleaning technology.","acoustic horn, oil","The term acoustics in itself has a broad meaning whereby it is applicable in various fields such as music, architectural spaces, and ultrasound medical imaging just to name a few. It has been demonstrated that sound is a form of energy that creates atmospheric pressure fluctuations generated by turbulent fluid flow and vibrating surfaces. A device that utilizes this phenomenon is an acoustic horn, that generates sound energy to inhibit ash and particulate material accumulation on various equipment such as hoppers, ducts, and boiler units. One of the benefits of using acoustic energy is that none intrusive cleaning of the plant’s internal substructure apparatus can be attained. The nature of sound propagation induces vibration on surrounding objects, such that if not monitored and controlled, the device may have detrimental effects on plant equipment (Mhlongo and Kallon, 2021).","t. mafokwane department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. thabithabz@live.co.za d. v. v. kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. dkallon@uj.ac.za",
139,Optimal Production Run Length Of A Deteriorating Process  With Investment In Setup And Quality Improvement,"process deterioration is a leading cause of mediocre production plan adherence and hence not satisfying customers' demand. process setup and quality improvement are two common factors that return the production system to its designated status. the proposed research integrates production control, capital investment, and quality control aspects to enhance the reliability and productivity of the production-inventory system. to achieve this goal, a mathematical model is formulated to decide the optimal production run length (oprl), cost of setup, and cost of process quality improvement. it is assumed that the production process starts in an in-control state with a fixed defective rate and may shift to an out-of-control state with a linear increase of defective rate. a numerical example is provided to demonstrate model practicability and to derive managerial insights. for instance, investment in setup cost reduction and quality improvement can achieve a 61.07% reduction in the total cost.",production cycle,"The proposed model computes the OPRL, setup cost, and process quality. The production process starts in an in- control state and may shift to an out-of-control state after an elapsed time. The time to the shift is assumed to be exponentially distributed. After the shift, the process became out-of-control, and the deterioration increases linearly to the end of the production cycle. Defective items are produced at a constant rate during in-control; this rate increases linearly after the shift due to process deterioration. The results from the proposed model show a direct relationship between investment in setup cost reduction and OPRL, whereas an inverse relationship exists between investments in-process quality and OPRL. The OPRL depends on a, b, and c, representing how costly it is to reduce setup cost and how costly it is to make process quality improvement. Since an increase or a reduction in OPRL affects the produced quantity and hence the inventory level and shortage, it is important to investigate the optimal allocation of investments among different options. As future work considers the deterioration during the out-of- control state increases exponentially and integrates maintenance planning to restore the process to its original condition, i.e., in-control state.","ahmed m. attia, ahmad al hanbali, haitham h. saleh department of industrial and systems engineering, interdisciplinary research center of smart mobility and logistics, king fahd university of petroleum & minerals, p.o. box 5067, dhahran 31261, saudi arabia amattia@kfupm.edu.sa1, ahmad.alhanbali@kfupm.edu.sa2, haithamhs@kfupm.edu.sa3",

144,Service Quality And Risk Analysis-Based Maintenance  Policy Selection For Rail-Transport,"in recent years, maintenance activities have become more complex along with the trends of automation in various industries. it implies maintenance being a dependent factor to service quality, one of which is urban rail transportation that already adhered to the grade of automation. in addition to its complexity, maintenance is also a major contributor in the cost-of-service delivery, reaching 15% of the total operating costs for urban rail services in indonesia. maintenance itself was a risk-based business process considering potential failures of technical equipment that affect equipment availability or service revenue indirectly. previous studies recognized that the increased expectation of service quality and risk of maintenance activities are still linear to maintenance costs. furthermore. most companies only follow oem (original equipment manufacturer) rather than develop their own strategy. several studies have been conducted to determine maintenance strategies but have not considered the quality and risk of failure comprehensively. therefore, this study aims to design a model of determining maintenance policies through priority arrangement of maintenance activities based on the risk of failure and its impact on service quality. data are obtained from service quality attributes survey and stakeholder interview of urban rail company. using house of quality (hoq) the importance of each maintenance activity is identified and prioritized subsequently based on potential failure and detection capabilities using fmea (failure mode effect analysis). the result shows priority indexing on each maintenance activity. afterwards those priority can be utilized as the main criteria for determining maintenance and inventory policy.","service quality, house of quality","and Future Research Throughout this study, maintenance policy has been selected by consideration to service quality and failure risk of the system. By using two phases of QFD and FMEA principle comprehensively, maintenance policies can be derived as priority basis so that company may not be burdensome of the maintenance cost. Using this scheme also can be increased the accuracy of “severity” when analyzing risk using FMEA. Priorities also made by considering the technical capability in terms of detecting the failure. When the system as is has already been adopted advanced monitoring or inspection equipment so that the number of detectability rating can be decreased as well as the risk priority number. However, this framework already consume time to calculate and gather the responses of technical rating. It will be great if there is automated model which can be used regularly and also to monitor the ‘probability of occurrence’ which may be changed over the time being.","arsy karima zahra and teuku yuri m. zagloel department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia depok, jawa barat, indonesia arsy.karima@ui.ac.id; yuri@ie.ui.ac.id",

146,Evaluation Of Elements Affecting The Effectiveness Of  Maintenance Policies Following The Asme Code And Delay,"root cause analysis of two years breakdown data of a beverage company in nigeria reviews that man and method are the predominant cause of failures in a production system. this further relates to the competence of maintenance personnel. this study adopts a method based on the implementation of the american society of mechanical engineers (asme) boiler and pressure vessel code section xi appendix viii) (boiler and committee, 1962) integrated to a delay time model to analyze and predict the expected downtime from different technicians based on capability. as a large series of tests was not feasible, a smaller “weed out” 8/10 test was designed using binomial power curves to determine the probability of perfect inspection (ppi). numerical analysis shows that as the competence of a technician drops, there is a disproportionate increase in the proportion of downtime. for a given cycle of 24 hours, when an inspection is been carried out by a technician with a probability of detection (pod) of 0.8, the expected downtime is 1.8 hours. when this activity is performed by another with a pod of 0.65, the expected downtime is 4.2 hours. there is about a 56% increase in the proportion of downtime compared with the corresponding 24% difference in pod score.","maintenance, maintenance policy, asme code","Analyses of breakdown data without understanding the underlying failure mechanisms will lead to a wrong conclusion and subsequent recurrence of failure. From the study, over 90 per cent of downtime experienced during production was attributed to either man or method. Man and method issues are functions of skill of the workforce. The performance of a technician during evaluation does not exactly represent field performance. The ASME standard performance evaluation was used to determine the corresponding probability of perfect inspection of a technician based on the obtained performance demonstration score. A delay time model was used to account for the effect of competency levels on machine failure, leading to significant downtime. From the case study, as the competency of a technician increases, the probability of missing defects during inspection decreases and also the number of defects leading to breakdown is reduced. The competency of a technician also affects the time to repair a fault and the overall maintenance integrity. To maintain a certain threshold of downtime, it is paramount to focus on Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Nsukka, Nigeria, 5 - 7 April, 2022 IEOM Society International 1399","time model christian ighohor okonta and raphael olumese edokpia. department of industrial and production engineering university of benin edo state, nigeria okonta.christian@yahoo.com, ralphedokpia@yahoo.com","References

147,A Causal Loop Analysis For Proposed E-Waste Funding  Scheme In Indonesia,"the dilemmatic condition between economic benefits, environmental drawbacks, and social dependency aspects of electronic waste (e-waste) rapid growth requires immediate attention and right policy structurization from the indonesian government. currently, regulations in indonesia regarding the management of e-waste have only covered the collection procedures for the municipal environmental service (dlh) and the recycling procedure for the third- party recycler. meanwhile, the regulation regarding the various financial and material responsibilities between actors is still in the form of advisory. this paper provides a conceptual model that structures the current e-waste management system and the proposed funding scheme policy. later, the model understanding of the current actors’ relationship, factors dynamics, and the feasible policy is validated and evaluated by three stakeholders in the system. from these findings, policymakers could use such alternative schemes to improve the nation’s waste management.","e-waste, funding scheme, conceptual model","This study aims to conceptualize the Indonesian e-waste management system and the developed funding scheme for funding policy structurization. The model provides a qualitative causal analysis of loops and links between variables in the system. The model is discussed with three stakeholders and finely tuned to their approval. The proposed model shows that the deposit-refund scheme managed by BPDLH and funded by tax or advance fees can help KLHK goals reduce hazardous waste exposure. The deposit-refund scheme finding is consistent with Damanhuri et al. (2019) financial policy recommendation for Indonesia’s e-waste management system. Nevertheless, the clear causality between BPDLH and several economic instruments provides a novel and valid logic for future e-waste policy. However, the valid conceptual model is only the fundamental step in understanding the e-waste management system's complexity and its potential funding scheme. Further research can be done quantitatively via system dynamic simulation modeling to test different scenarios (i.e., funding scheme, tariff, and social tension) with more relevant data. Within that approach, policymakers can measure the system’s behavior effect and determine the optimal funding scheme.","muhammad irfan kemal and romadhani ardi department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java muhammad.irfan08@ui.ac.id, romadhani.ardi@ui.ac.id",
148,An Analysis Of The Crispy Mushroom Business For Small  And Medium-Sized Enterprises (Smes) In Indonesia,"the purpose of this study was to determine the income and financial viability of the crispy mushroom industry in indonesia for small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). as indicators, four techniques are used: revenue/cost (r/c), benefit cost (b/c), return on investment (roi), and break event point (bep). investment appraisal is used to establish whether a financial part of the transaction is possible, based on measurements against stated criteria. the evaluation technique offers several advantages and downsides. as a result, it is preferable to employ multiple methodologies simultaneously when evaluating a business to acquire the best results. it begins by calculating the entire revenue, which comes to 1.64. the total income and total manufacturing expenses exceed zero, resulting in a profit of rp. 64. return on investment (roi) can be defined as the ratio of net profit to costs in each business, which in this example is 64%. break event point has two searches, one in rupiah and one in number of productions, and in this study, the results of the break event point are 36 pcs, which means that if the crispy mushroom produces less than that amount from the total quantity of production, the business will be concerned about cost loss.","business analysis, investment, smes","Based on the results of calculations on the data that has been collected starting from the cost of equipment, then the cost of raw materials, packaging costs and labor costs, into fixed costs and variable costs, the gross income from the crispy mushroom business is Rp. 10,500,000 and a net income of Rp. 4,115,000. When viewed financially, this crispy mushroom business can also be said to be feasible to carry out or continue, because from the results of Revenue/Cost (R/C) the value is 1.64 > 1, then the result of Benefit/Cost (B/C) is obtained the value 0.64 > 0, then the Return Of Investment (ROI) value is 64%, and finally the Break Event Point (BEP) is 36 units.","ahmad efendi, muhammad rizki, fitriani surayya lubis, muhammad isnaini hadiyul umam, ismu kusumanto, lianny industrial engineering, faculty of science and technology universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau indonesia angaie77777@gmail.com, muhammad.rizki@uin-suska.ac.id, fitriani.surayya.l@uin- suska.ac.id, muhammad.isnaini@uin-suska.ac.id, ismu_uin@yahoo.co.id, liannywahyuni08@gmail.com",
149,Analysis Of Oee Improvements In Blow Molding Machines  In The Plastic Packaging Manufacturing Industry Using Six,"the plastic packaging manufacturing industry is a downstream industrial sector, so far it has become the supply chain of customer products, especially being part of the food industry, pharmaceutical industry, cosmetics, and medical devices. with the increasing demand for plastic packaging, industry players are required to maintain the productivity and quality of the products they produce. in order to maintain product performance, control over the production process must be carried out, including maintaining engine performance. the effectiveness for measuring the performance of production machines is the oee (overall equipment effectiveness) indicator. the oee value is influenced by 3 variables, namely availability, performance, and quality. these variables are translated into six big losses which consist of breakdown losses, set up and adjustment, start-up, idle and minor stoppage, speed losses, and defect losses. the purpose of this research is to analyze six big losses on blow molding machine units in plastic packaging manufacturing companies. the analytical method used in this study is to use a fishbone diagram and why why analysis to find out the cause of the low oee value and use fmea (failure mode and effect analysis) in determining corrective actions. based on the results of the analysis, it was found that the first largest losses were breakdown losses with a value of 36.4% or 15,849 hours from. while the second losses are setup and adjustment losses with a value of 20.1% or 8,752 hours of machine operating time. improvement efforts made are by performing autonomous maintenance, changing the frequency of pm (preventive maintenance), and making spare part stock planning by determining the minimum stock of spare parts. from the results of the improvements that have been made, it can be declared quite effective because the oee value increased by 10.6%.","six big losses, fishbone diagram","The conclusions of this research activity are: 1. The low OEE value is caused by high losses in the blow machine and the root causes of the problems found include: a) Stock of spare parts that are not available b) PM is not conducted consistently c) Spare parts replacement scheduling has not been effective d) Spare part components do not meet specifications 2. Improvement efforts made are by performing autonomous maintenance, changing the PM frequency from 3 months to 1 month and making good spare parts stock planning by determining the minimum spare part stock that must be met. Based on the results of the research that has been concluded above and in an effort to improve the performance of this blow machine, several suggestions are submitted for further research: 1. The implementation of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is very important to maintain machine performance in accordance with the initial design of the factory. This will be able to reduce losses on the machine such as breakdown losses. TPM must be run with a high commitment from the maintenance department. 2. The blow machine operator is advised to be able to run the machine optimally according to the work instructions that have been made. In addition, the blow machine operator must carry out autonomous maintenance consistently so that the engine performance is better.

151,Inherent Factors Affecting The Effectiveness Of Maintenance  Using Root Cause Analysis.,"the downtime experienced in the nigerian manufacturing sector has become a threat to its existence due to the cost implications. despite different maintenance strategies, the results have not been too promising, hence the need to understand the factors causing downtime and effect on machine availability. root cause analysis of two years breakdown data of a beverage company in nigeria using the five why approach reviews that man and method are the predominant cause of failures in a production system which are both a measure of the organizational workforce competency. the result shows that 95 per cent of the total downtime was due to man and method problems while a cumulative of 92 per cent of the total number of failures could be linked to man and method. man and method issues are functions of skill of the workforce with the effect is obvious in the percentage of breakdown and the incurred downtime in restoring the failure on a machine.","root cause analysis, five why, breakdown analysis, maintenance","Analyses of breakdown data without understanding the underlying failure mechanisms will lead to a wrong conclusion and subsequent recurrence of failure. The failure mode of any breakdown must be linked to the root cause before such failure can be permanently eliminated by the implementation of appropriate countermeasures. From our study, over 90 per cent of downtime experienced during production was attributed to either man or method. Man and method issues are functions of skill and attitude of the workforce in following a defined maintenance system. Deficiency in either skill or attitude greatly affects the resulting functional competency as the performance of a technician during evaluation may not exactly represent the field performance. Thus, the major factor that contributes to this deviation is the nature of maintenance activities which include the utilization of alternative maintenance approaches and the knowledge gap in the maintenance team in carrying out efficient maintenance regarding a Nigeria case study.","a case study christian ighohor okonta and raphael olumese edokpia. department of industrial and production engineering university of benin edo state, nigeria okonta.christian@yahoo.com, ralphedokpia@yahoo.com",
152,Implementation Of Data Science And Decision Analysis To  Determine Shale Gas Sweet Spot Depth Interval,"shale gas has been regarded as one of the most promising energy sources to sustain the world’s energy demand. however, its exploration is still underdeveloped in several countries due to a lack of methods and technology implementation compared to conventional hydrocarbon exploration. in addition, the technology, methods, and data available in various oil and gas companies are currently still concentrated on conventional hydrocarbon exploration. the purpose of this study is to propose a new comprehensive method in shale gas exploration by utilizing the existing conventional hydrocarbon exploration data using data science and decision analysis approaches. the methods used in this study are k-mean clustering to cluster the similar rock characters (toc, porosity, water saturation, and poisson ratio) then continued by multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the best rock cluster for shale gas exploration. the study takes banuwati shale formation in asri basin as a case which is well known as one of the promising source rocks in indonesia. based on this study, the rocks in the study area can be classified into three clusters. cluster 1 is determined as “high fractability cluster”, cluster 2 is determined as “water saturated cluster” and cluster 3 is determined as “high organic content cluster” based on its physical and chemical properties. meanwhile, cluster 3 is determined as the best cluster with 10212 ft – 10412 ft (3113 m – 3174 m) depth interval preferred as the sweet spot for shale gas exploration based on multi-criteria decision analysis result.","shale gas, data science, k-mean clustering, decision analysis","This study analyzes the new method to determine shale gas weet spot depth interval using data science and decision analysis approaches. The data obtained from one exploration well data located in Asri Basin, Indonesia with Banuwati Shale Formation as the main target of the study. The result of sweet spot determination is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. Sweet Spot Determination Result for Shale Gas Exploration The methods used in this study are K-Mean Clustering, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT). The result of data clustering shows that the data in this study can be clustered into three clusters. Cluster 1 is determined as High Fractability Cluster, cluster 2 is determined as Water Saturated Cluster and cluster 3 is determined as High Organic Content Cluster. The preferred cluster was obtained from AHP and MAUT methods using experts judgment questionnaires as the data. The result suggested that Cluster 3 is the most preferred cluster with a 0.793 preference score followed by Cluster 1 with 0.242 and Cluster 2 with a 0.124 preference score. Mckeon (2013) stated that the minimum thickness of shale layer to be able to produce hydrocarbon commercially is 100 ft. or equal to 30.5 m. Referring to the actual condition in the exploration well, there is one horizon of Cluster 3 rocks which exceed 100 ft. thick and can be determined as sweet spot zone that is the 10212 ft. – 10413 ft. (3113 m – 3174 m) interval or equal to 201 ft. (61 m) thick. This interval determined as the most preferred spot for shale gas exploration. 6.1 Proposed Improvement Future research is highly recommended for the more accurate and more comprehensive result of the study. Future research suggested utilizing more petrophysical properties as parameters to minimize uncertainty. Aside from that, more data utilization of the well is also highly recommended so the result of each well can be correlated and produce more comprehensive sweet spot mapping in 2D and 3D results.","muhamad aditya, andri d. setiawan, armand o. moeis industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, depok 16424, indonesia muhamad.aditya01@ui.ac.id, a.d.setiawan@ui.ac.id, armand.omar@ui.ac.id",
153,System-Based Optimization Of Pumping Capacity Of  Centrifugal Pumps,"in this study, the impeller is optimized in order to make advances in the performance of a centrifugal water pump. a centrifugal pump design incorporates many limitations that affect pump performance. by modifying the parameters within an acceptable range, it improves pump performance and results in saving of costs and energy for companies. the design parameters from vane plane improvement are chosen for the impeller plan, and the influence of the plan parameters on the pump's performance is analyzed using computational fluid dynamics to optimize the impeller. the findings shows that suction diameter, impeller diameter and discharge diameter have a significant impact on the performance of a centrifugal pump.","centrifugal pump, design, pump proficiency, cfd","and Recommendations The pumping system capacity and optimization has been carried out for water as the working fluid. The impeller diameter plays a huge role in centrifugal pump performance and decreasing impeller diameter result in a decrease in the flow rate, head, and power consumption. A decrease in the impeller diameter gives a centrifugal pump a new operating point. If the pump is to be trimmed, the pump manufacturer should be consulted first because the reduction of impeller affects the flow rate and head. Affinity law was mathematically used to analyse. This was to better understand the effect that varying impeller diameter has on the overall performance of a centrifugal pump and to actually enable the analysis of different impeller diameters. The diameter of the impeller, impeller suction diameter and the discharge diameter were changed to optimize the pumping capacity of a water pump. The original impeller diameter was 223 mm, and this was then varied to 217 mm and 211 mm. Final results found showed that reducing the impeller will have a reduced flow rate power consumption and head. To accomplish bigger head and flow rate, a bigger impeller is required, but higher energy usage because of a larger impeller is the biggest challenge. This bigger energy consumption can be decreased by using a lesser weight impeller. It can easily be accomplished by using a lesser weight material for the impeller. When selecting the material of the impeller, the fluid being pumped should be taken into consideration and the life span of the impeller should also be considered.","a. stulumani department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. astulumani@gibb.co.za a. mpoko department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. mpokoprince@gmail.com o. khumalo department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. oscarkhumalo98@gmail.com m. e. matlakala department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. motsiephrey@gmail.com d. v. v. kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. dkallon@uj.ac.za",

156,"Relationship Between Service Quality And Customer  Satisfaction In Restaurants In Los Olivos, Peru","the objective of this research is to determine the degree of relationship between the quality of service and customer satisfaction in the restaurants of the los olivos district, in the year 2021. the study is based on a quantitative and correlational approach, with a non-experimental design and cross-sectional classification. to measure the two variables, a sample of 381 customers visiting restaurants in los olivos was taken. for service quality, the servqual model was used, and for satisfaction, a tool based on factor analysis was used. a survey of 43 questions with a likert scale from 1 to 7 was applied, and the following results were obtained: the general hypothesis was accepted with a significant coefficient (p-values < 0.05). regarding the specific hypotheses, reliability, empathy and tangibles are accepted with significant coefficients (p-values < 0.05) in contrast to the dimensions of responsiveness and safety which are rejected with non-significant coefficients (p>0.05). in conclusion, restaurants should train staff to serve efficiently and improve safety, as well as modernise their facilities and technological capacity to ensure their success.","service quality, servqual model","It was determined that there is an acceptable relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction in restaurants in the district of Los Olivos in 2021. The hypothesis put forward in this research is established as valid. Likewise, service quality has an impact on customer satisfaction and has repercussions on the continuous improvement of the infrastructure and services offered. The dimensions of reliability, empathy and tangible elements were found to have a positive influence on customer satisfaction in restaurants, while sensitivity and safety had a negative influence on customer satisfaction. Tangible elements have a greater positive impact on customer satisfaction. Therefore, it is necessary for restaurants to improve the image of their staff and strive to provide facilities with reliable technological equipment to their customers. Restaurants in the district of Los Olivos in 2021 should prioritise the modernisation of their facilities and technological equipment, as these are features that the customer evaluates along with the quality of the food and the service. If they comply with these three elements that relate to and influence satisfaction, it would be an important support to meet the objectives and profitability of the restaurants. It is recommended for future research on the relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction in restaurants, to classify the speciality of the restaurants (Creole, marine, traditional) and to extend the study to Metropolitan Lima, in order to achieve quantitative research and obtain more precise results that will allow the owners of these establishments to make better decisions to satisfy the needs and desires of their customers.

157,A Mixed-Integer Robust Programming Model For Reverse  Logistics Network Design Of Plastic Waste Management In,"plastic is a wear resistance, easy to use, and cheap material. it was required by so many industries, so the quantity of plastic production in indonesia increases every year. the increase in plastic production makes the volume of plastic waste generated by households. the unmanaged plastics waste releases various harmful substances for humans and the environment. to reduce this negative impact, a reverse logistics network for plastic waste, the recovery flows of plastic waste, is designed. this study constructed mixed-integer linear programming (milp) for reverse logistics network design for plastic waste management in indonesia to minimize the total cost from opened facilities cost, processing cost, and transportation cost. then, due to uncertainty of the quantity of returned plastic from the consumer, the first milp model is reformulated into mixed-integer robust programming (mirp). the mirp model also figured out the optimal location of selected facilities and the quantity of plastic transported from one facility to the others, under uncertainty.",plastics,"Due to uncertainty in RLND of plastic waste management in Indonesia, a MIRP model is proposed using Robust Optimization. In this study, RL network of plastic waste management in Indonesia consider consumer, Waste Bank, TPS/TPS3R, TPA, Collector, and Recycler. The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost from the cost of the selected facility, the process at the facility, and transportation between facilities. First, a MILP model for RLND for plastic waste management in Indonesia is constructed. To cope with uncertain parameters in MILP model, the quantity of returned plastic from the consumer is assumed to reside in the box uncertainty set. Then, a robust counterpart of the uncertain MILP model is formulated to find an optimal robust solution. For application of the model, the optimal robust solutions, i.e., the optimal location of selected facilities and the quantity of plastic transported from one facility to the others, are obtained from the MIRP model by a plastic waste management case study in Jakarta. This study can be developed in the future to address the limitations. For example, the model considers another form of uncertainty sets for the uncertain parameters. Also, because uncertainty in optimization problems is often, other parameters such as transportation cost, processing costs at the facility, and capacity of the facility can be considered in the model.","indonesia syifa nurkamila and romadhani ardi department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java syifa.nurkamila@ui.ac.id, romadhani.ardi@ui.ac.id",
158,Developing Key Performance Indicators For Supply Chain  Resilience In Indonesian Automotive Industry,"since the covid-19 pandemic entered indonesia in april 2020, the automotive industry experienced the most significant decline compared to the other sectors. the downfall was due to weak demand for cars and motorcycles from the domestic and foreign market, leading to production cuts. this incident forced the entire automotive industry to adjust to returning to normal conditions after the disruption occurred as quickly as possible. there in need for key performance indicators (kpi) for supply chain resilience (scr) to control and manage the company's target plans when a disruption occurs at any time. this study aims to design kpi to help firms in assessing the indicators related to disruption as long-term measures. this study utilized expert assessments, gathered from questionnaires, while quantitative data was processed using the content validity index (cvi). from the literature review, 11 indicators such as security, knowledge management, visibility, risk management, collaboration, agility, flexibility, efficiency, redundancy, financial strength, market position and 46 sub-indicators of scr were collected. using the cvi approach for validity test results, 27 scr sub-indicators were validated by six experts in the sector, with an average i-cvi value of 0.81.",content validity,"Supply chain resilience is a hot topic in the research world. It attracted the attention of many individuals due to its relevance to the current pandemic conditions. Supply chain resilience itself is a concept that developed from traditional risk management. This study reveals that the Indonesian automotive industry is still vulnerable to disruption, shown by the experienced automotive industry's most significant decline compared to the other sectors during the pandemic. That is why we need indicators that are practical to develop a resilient supply chain. This research resulted in 11 indicators and 27 sub-indicators of SCR, collected from previous research and validated by automotive field experts as shown in figure 1. Therefore, this research contributes to decoding the concept of resilience into performance indicators to create a useful managerial tool for improving performance. Figure 1. Indicators and sub indicators SCR in automotive industry There are some limitations to this research. This study only discusses the SCR indicator, collected from previous research and relevant to Indonesia's automotive industry. Six experts from different automotive companies represented the validation of these indicators. There are still several indicators and sub-indicators not mentioned in this study that may be relevant in other sectors. Thus, the basis of this research cannot be generalized. Future research should be directed at indicators from other sectors that have not yet been explored and find new indicators. That way, the SCR indicator can be generalized and used in different kinds of company's sectors.","sela diah kenanga and romadhani ardi department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java sela.diah@ui.ac.id, romadhani.ardi@ui.ac.id",
159,Assessing The Supply Chain Risk In Indonesian Cosmetic  Industry,"the trend of using cosmetic products in indonesia is not only exclusively for women but also has expanded for men and children. until 2019, the indonesian government recorded 797 domestic cosmetic companies from small, medium, and large scale, which increased compared to 760 companies in the previous year. the cosmetics industry's performance also grew by 5.59% in 2020 and contributed to foreign exchange for export with usd 317 million, increasing 15.2% compared to the previous year. supply chain flow in business activities is undoubtedly a complicated issue to discuss because the activities, connections, and interrelationships between elements from upstream to downstream are full of risks and uncertainties. this study aims to conceptualize a supply chain risk model in the indonesian cosmetics industry to ensure the development of appropriate risk mitigation strategy. this research used qualitative data in a questionnaire assessment by experts, processed using a content validity index (cvi) approach. a total of 20 sub-indicators have been successfully validated from 36 sub-indicators by five experts in the cosmetics industry with an average i-cvi value of 0.91.","content validity, cosmetic industry, risk design, lipstick","The slightest risk that arises in the supply chain flow will undoubtedly affect the organization's smooth business activities. This research successfully identify the possible risks that emerge in the supply chain of Indonesian cosmetics industry. A total of 36 risks have been found, consisting of 6 factors: supply and logistics, manufacturing, organizational and strategic, financial, marketing, and macro. After validation process with experts, the researcher found 20 relevant risks in the supply chain of the cosmetics industry in Indonesia with the average of I-CVI value is 0,91. The limitation of this research is that the research is limited to identifying, classifying, and validating risks in the supply chain of the cosmetics industry in Indonesia. Further research can be carried out using the Multi-criteria Decision-making (MCDM) method such as ANP-based DEMATEL to determine the priority of the risks that arise so that they can be carried out for consideration inappropriate risk mitigation strategies.","tia atika putri and romadhani ardi department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java tia.atika@ui.ac.id, romadhani.ardi@ui.ac.id",
160,Occupational Accidents Due To Personal Factors And Work  Factors In Road Work Projects In The City Of Lima Perú,"the occurrence of accidents in the construction industry in peru has been a great concern since they generate delays in the fulfillment, but above all, they generate justified absences to the injured workers, due to the medical breaks generated, in addition to not being able to perform their duties due to the acquired disability, this also affects the workers' daily life, since, being injured, they cannot perform activities ranging from helping with housework to healthy recreation with their families, such as playing with their children or enjoying a family outing. when an accident at work occurs, the investigation protocol is initiated to identify the root cause of the accident, generally identifying personal factors, since in every accident there are always personal factors and work factors present.","incident, unsafe act, unsafe condition","The immediate causes for all accidents are unsafe acts and unsafe conditions; that is, the occurrence of an accident is because the worker is committing an unsafe act, related to a dangerous condition, there is no accident in which only the worker has performed a hazardous act without being under a hazardous situation. The elimination of unsafe acts and unsafe conditions is an effective tool to avoid accidents, the base on which the pyramid of the proportion of accidents indicates that the bottom is the incidents without injury or visible damage because this base is supported by unsafe acts and unsafe conditions, which are the immediate causes of accidents, which is why by eliminating the primary reasons are avoided possible accidents. In this study, it is demonstrated how, with the elimination of immediate causes, accidents were reduced in significant proportion in the years 2017 and 2018. Leadership is the main link in preventing accidents; the leader’s motivation to his workers serves as a guide to do things the right way, complying with the established work standards. Above all, this motivation will drive the worker to follow the leader’s example. Supervision is an effective tool for eliminating immediate causes; therefore, it is the primary tool for accident prevention. Personal factors are the ones that cause the worker to commit unsafe acts, while work factors affect in an underlying way the decisions that the worker makes to commit a dangerous act. 6.","juan carlos quiroz-flores facultad de ingeniería universidad peruana de ciencias aplicadas lima, perú pciijqui@upc.edu.pe juan francisco salazar-tenorio dirección general de estudios de posgrado facultad de ingeniería geológica, minera, metalúrgica y geográfica universidad nacional mayor de san marcos lima, perú juan.salazar23@unmsm.edu.pe",
161,The Relationship Of Human Capital Management And  Productivity In A Construction Company In 2021,"the aim of this research is to determine the relationship between human capital management and productivity in a construction company. the research methodology used is quantitative, applied and correlational, with a non- experimental design and cross-sectional classification. for data collection, the survey technique was applied, using the questionnaire as an instrument in a sample of 21 workers in the company. subsequently, for the statistical analyses, the spss programme was used, and the spearman correlation coefficient analysis was used, which yielded a significant value of p-value < 0.05, with a positive correlation coefficient of 0.818 on the relationship between the two variables studied. finally, according to the results obtained, it is concluded that there is a positive and strong relationship between human capital management and productivity in a construction company in the year 2021.","productivity, efficiency","It was possible to determine that there is a positive and strong relationship between human capital management and productivity in a construction company in the year 2021, establishing as valid the general hypothesis put forward in the research. Likewise, it was found that the capabilities, behaviour and labour compensation of human capital are positively related to the productivity of the company, as correlations with high coefficients were found between these dimensions and labour productivity. This reflects that the capabilities, competencies and positive behaviour of personnel, linked to cooperation and teamwork, contribute to the productivity of the company. Similarly, the recognition and the fair and equitable wage policy that the company has in place to motivate, retain and engage staff results in competitive labour productivity. On the other hand, the limitation in the development of the study was the access to the people, since, being in working hours, they did not have much time available to answer the survey or because of the pandemic some of them were doing remote work. However, after several visits to the plant and sending the questionnaire via email to the remaining workers, it was possible to survey all workers in the company. Finally, it is concluded that the present research contributes to the existing literature, because researchers who wish to study the sector or the variables human capital management and productivity will be able to use it in their studies. Therefore, it is recommended that future studies related to these variables be conducted, since business and professional success is directly connected to good practice in human capital management.","hammer jose trujillo-quiroz , ruth elizabeth ortega-córdova , ralphi jauregui-arroyo , evelyn rondon-jara faculty of business universidad privada del norte lima, perú",
162,The Developing Key Performance Indicators For Sustainable  Supply Chain In Indonesian Fashion Industry,"the indonesian fashion industry has continuously been growing since the last decade. however, the fashion industry practices produce negative environmental and social consequences. to overcome these issues, the indonesian government encourages indonesian fashion industries to adhere to sustainable practices to maintain and improve competitiveness in the global market since it is believed to be the future of the business. therefore, it is necessary to determine the main indicators of sustainable practices in the fashion industry to measure the performance of a sustainable supply chain system. this study aims to develop a set of relevant key performance indicators (kpis) in implementing a sustainable supply chain for the indonesian fashion industry. initially, this study reviewed the existing sustainability indicators to develop an initial short-list of indicators. then, indicators were assessed and validated by a group of eight experts consisting of five industry representatives, a government official, a non- government organization leader, and an academic through a questionnaire. this study utilized content validity index (cvi) methods to get consensus indicators from all experts. from this study, 21 indicators were validated and could be further used by the fashion industries to improve their sustainability performance.",,"It is crucial to identify the relevant KPIs for economic, environmental, and social dimensions to evaluate a sustainable supply chain performance. This study explored the appropriate KPIs for a sustainable supply chain in the context of the Indonesian fashion industry. We reviewed some literature and identified 31 indicators. These indicators include 6 economic indicators, 14 environmental indicators, and 11 social indicators. Then, validation by eight experts was carried out and calculated the CVI. Finally, 21 KPIs from the three sustainability dimensions (6 economic indicators, 8 environmental indicators, and 7 social indicators) were selected with a minimum I-CVI of 0.875 and S-CVI of 0.847. The fashion industries can use those KPIs to increase their sustainability performance and competitiveness. This study focused on identifying and validating a set of KPIs for evaluating the performance of a sustainable supply chain in the fashion industry. In future research, it is recommended to prioritize and analyze the interrelationship between indicators by using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. It is also recommended to develop a performance evaluation model that the fashion industries can utilize to measure each indicator and overall sustainable performance, so they can regularly evaluate and increase their performance.

Individual elements relevant to social media exposure include personality, mood, emotions, perceived risk and perceived opportunity. Knowledge factors relevant to social media exposure include ethnic and social class. Knowledge factors relevant to social media exposure include corruption, the standard of living, politics, leadership and general knowledge areas; these knowledge areas attract or influence social media users’ interests on the social media platforms. The study found that that social media platform exposure has a significant effect on the attitudes and perceived norms of social media users in Abu Dhabi. It is however concluded that social media exposure does not have a significant effect on perceived behavioural control. These conclusions indicate that social media platform exposure has the tendency to change attitudes and affect the what users consider socially normal; however, the social media users still retain control over their own behaviours in terms of their propensity and locus to act. The study findings indicate that the attitude and perceived norms influenced by social media exposure does not lead to fake news behavioural intention. Social media users rather control their fake news behavioural intention through their perceived behavioural control. And their perceived behavioural controls are not exposed to the influencing traits of social media platforms usage. This conclusion affirms that the transformation of social media exposure into behaviour is impeded by a critical break in the chain within the exposure-behavioural antecedents- intention continuum, at least within the context of Abu Dhabi Emirate. It was also found that that fake news behavioural intention has the propensity to influence actual fake news behaviour of social media users in the UAE, and specifically Abu Dhabi.

The results show that headmasters practice instructional leadership in schools. Headmasters also understand and implement the three dimensions of instructional leadership (define the mission, managing the instructional programs and promotes) have a positive learning climate. This study also indicates that headmasters are able to convey the mission of the school clearly and can be understood by teachers with appropriate communication. Through the explanations presented, teachers understand that through clarity in formulating and conveying the school’s mission contributes to the improvement of school performance excellence. The expertise of the headmaster in conducting instructional supervision and guidance, coordinating the curriculum and monitoring student progress facilitate the process of managing instructional programs in schools. Such actions are realized to be able to help improve school performance. But, the actions of principals by controlling teaching and learning time, cultivating professional development, maintaining visibility, providing initiative to teachers, providing initiative to students and emphasizing student excellence are less effective towards creating a positive school learning climate. Most importantly in instructional leadership, headmaster must be clear and know how to implement.

171,Design Of An Electromagnetic Suspension And Regenerative  Braking System For Electricity Generation,"this research aim was to design an electromagnetic suspension and regenerative braking system for power generation. it looks at ways in which the heat dissipated into the environment from the brakes and suspension can be reused by converting it into another form of electrical energy stored in batteries. my research findings indicate how the braking efficiencies vary with a number of factors. these include road geography (slopes), braking velocities and traffic volumes. the results of this research then helped to narrow down which types of road geography would lead to an optimum amount of energy being recovered. journals of past researches on the topic were reviewed in order to help determine how best to design a system that will integrate regenerative braking and the electromagnetic suspension. calculations on determining the optimum braking force needed were done which has led to the final chosen concept. this project focused on electrical vehicles.","electric vehicles, power generation","and Future Research An electromagnetic suspension and regenerative braking system approach was proposed. The electromagnetic suspension system is capable of providing a substantially smoother ride than any luxury sedan, as well as significantly less roll and pitch than any sports vehicle. Vehicle Suspension Energy Generation is a very efficient and practical method of turning kinetic energy from vehicle movement, particularly the suspension, which is generally wasted, into electric energy that may be utilized to power auxiliaries in the vehicle as well as charging the battery. The two systems combined ensure that an optimum amount of energy is recovered by making use of clean energy which would otherwise be lost into the environment. As technology advances this combined system may become one of the promising trends in the vehicle industry. To achieve maximum efficiency throughout the process, some areas that could be investigated further in future work in order to improve the mechanization of the braking system and electromagnetic suspension were identified. The following are some suggestions for future work a) The findings of simulations are not always accurate representations of real-world scenarios. It only serves to give a rough notion of whether the chosen approach has enough potential to be implemented in the actual world. As a result, it is recommended that the simulation tactics be tested on a real vehicle to fine-tune the recovery values. b) In this project brushless DC motors were used due to the availability, characteristics like high starting torque, high efficiency and cost. Induction motors can also be used due to their ability to withstand rugged.

172,Generating Electrical Energy From Bacteria: Harare Waste  Water Management Case Study,"the biological nutrient removal waste water treatment process requires large amounts of electrical power mainly for pumping and aeration. this traditional waste treatment processes proves to be expensive mainly because of this huge electricity demand. however, waste water contains 9.3 times more energy than is used to treat an equivalent volume, this is useful energy that is not being tapped into. herein, an industrial scale microbial fuel cell system is proposed to harness this energy in the form of direct electricity using the bacteria found in the waste water whilst simultaneously treating the waste water from the municipal waste water treatment plants with an assumed biological oxygen demand (bod) and chemical oxygen demand (cod) removal of 75%. microbial fuel cells directly capture the electrons generated when electrochemically energetic bacteria breakdown organic substrates. creating electrical energy from microbial fuel cells is basically as a result of microbes acting as catalyst in degrading the organic content and the existence of a potential gradient across the microbial cell membrane. this work evaluated the operational parameters of microbial fuel cell system and estimated the electricity generation potential of firle waste water treatment plant (treating a volume of 90ml a day) as 900 kw. a cost analysis showed that microbial fuel cells could be competitive as a sustainable and energy-efficient technology for municipal wastewater treatment.","microbial fuel cell, waste water, bacteria","and Future Research This current work assumes that alcohol, chemical, disinfectant, bleaches or cleaners in the wastewater stream do not adversely affect the electricity producing bacteria found in the waste water, rather this work anticipates that the waste water contains many electricity producing bacteria. From this work it has been shown that it is feasible to adopt Microbial Fuel Cell system at an industrial scale but the technology still has several limitations, assumptions and challenges that must be addressed before broad adaptation is possible. One critical problem hindering the large scale application of Microbial Fuel Cell system is its high capital cost, which mainly arises from the expensive construction materials. Reducing the capital cost can be achieved by using highly efficient, scalable and less- expensive anode, cathode and reactor materials. Carbonaceous materials are more favourable because they are cheaper, they have a big surface area that maintains a large ratio of electrode surface against reactor volume and is compatible with the exoelectrogens bacterial growth in the anode making a good cost-effective option. Managing power output is another critical issue in the scaling up of Microbial Fuel Cells as to date there is no way to efficiently harvest the electrical energy produced in the microbial fuel cell. Electrodes that contain current collectors can be considered for effective current collection. It is difficult for an MFC to directly support a practical load, even at the maximum power generating point, due to the low voltage and current level. Thus, a power management system is needed to be incorporated into MFCs to make the energy feasible for powering electrical devices.","jacqueline chipo nyambiya and mufaro kanganga department of industrial and mechatronics engineering university of zimbabwe jcnyambiyah@gmail.com, mkanganga@eng.uz.ac.zw, mufarokang@gmail.com loice gudukeya and nita inderlal sukdeo quality and operations management department phd in engineering management lgudukeya@eng.uz.ac.zw, loicekmg@gmail.com, nsukdeo@uj.ac.za",

178,Effect Of Green Supply Chain Management On  Organisational Performance Of Selected Manufacturing,"several industries start focusing on the green concept in supply chain management (scm) to reduce waste, emission and to preserve the quality of natural resources. however, it is still very difficult to understand and analyze the effect of individual activities of green supply chain and their corresponding contribution. therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of green supply chain management on organizational performance. this study is a conceptual review based on existing literatures in the area of green supply chain management. efforts were made to examine the impact of reverse logistic, green procurement, green distribution as a component of gscm on organizational performance in the area of manufacturing and logistics firms in nigeria. based on critical literature review conducted, the existing literature on the effects of green supply chain management practices on firm performance provides support for the idea that there is a positive relationship between gscm practices and firm performance. they also enhance the understanding of how different types of gscm practices are related to financial, operational and environmental performance in manufacturing and logistics. the empirical results suggest that while internal gscm practices have the strongest effect on environmental performance, environmental collaboration with customers seems to be the most effective way to improve financial performance. in terms of operational performance, most findings were more mixed, suggesting that the operational performance of firms is more likely to be affected by firm characteristics than by the choices they make regarding their environmental collaboration.","green innovation, green procurement, reverse logistics","and Contributions From the review of the empirical studies, the study presents a theoretical framework for the reverse logistics outcomes of sustainable supply chain initiatives and organizational performance. The research hypotheses reflect input from a wide array 1of literature 1and the discussion 1of findings. Though the study identifies three components of sustainable supply chain, 1other components could exist, and ongoing research should investigate them. Therefore, the findings of this study will have important implications for managers in emerging markets seeking to initiate ecologically friendly business 1practices. The study will offer strong evidence of the benefits obtained from reverse logistics in sustainable supply chain 1initiatives. Policy makers 1and firms attempting to nurture sustainable supply chain initiatives should not overlook the important role of eco-reputation and eco- innovation strategic orientations, which the results identify as important enablers. Therefore, this study will offer evidence of the critical role of eco-reputation and eco-innovation strategic orientations in deploying sustainable supply chain initiative programs, as 1well as of their mutual effects. This study will also offer empirical evidence that implementing sustainable supply chain initiatives leads to reverse logistics, creating value, and a new source of competitive advantages.

179,The Digital Twin Model Of Vehicle Containers To Provide An  Ergonomic Handling Mechanism,"late order loss for difficulty handling (loading and unloading) activities left an alarm message to make traditional transportation handling for distribution e-commerce more accessible through mitigating it to semi-auto actions. this article discusses the idea of vehicle containers made up of permutational drawers, i.e., vcpd, that ensure ergonomic handling. the proposed ergonomic digital twin (edt) manages the vcpd by the internet of things, i.e., iot. the vcpd object has two dimensions: drawers' size and motion mechanism. these targets are implemented via establishing the digital twins' model, i.e., dt, for these drawers to test its qualifying for implementation, mainly if supported by iot. there is still much confusion regarding the dt and how it will apply to the vcpd in medium-sized schemes for transportation enterprises. this work activates the iot to bolster and simplify transportation activities through designing vcpd and control via a unified framework having several standard steps to reduce execution time, effort, and transportation costs.","digital twin, iot, ergonomic design, mechanism design","The digital twins are a future of development and control for transportation schemes to acquire adaptation skills (flexibility) to keep up with the VOC (i.e., the voice of customer) of satisfaction factors, whether the products or services are delivered in minimum time through distribution activities. The DT receives the VOC and/or stakeholders data fed to the IoT dataset to create a perception of steps to enhance and develop the designed product in its first generation schemes, discussed in Eqn. (1-24). Some of the indicators, such as the over-processing (waste) activities reduced by 27%, the average execution time of loading and unloading activities reduced by 40%, and the delivery time by 15%. The future of transportation lies in employing digital twins to increase serviceability for related KPI and cut expenses, which will become increasingly popular. By 2025, Up to 89% of all services must have their DT models controlled via IoT platforms in real-time. Nearly 36% of executives across various industries are aware of the benefits of digital twinning, with almost half aiming to implement it by 2028 (ASME, 2021). As time goes on, digital twin technology establishes itself as one of the essential software tools for changing product creation. The DT models are designed to study how to reduce the efforts, service time, service costs and increase the performance up to 59%, as shown in Table-5 (i.e., this value is different according to the studied case). Also, test, experiment, and develop the mechanism of the physical object to achieve the previous aims.

180,The Relationship Between Energy Intensity And Gdp Per  Capita In Eastern African Countries (Eac): Evidence,"the link between economic performance and energy efficiency is a continuing debate. this paper investigates the long-term equilibrium and causal relationship between energy efficiency and gdp per capita in east african countries for the period between 1990 and 2021. the analysis of eac countries do not provide clear evidence of convergence in the sense that poor economies tend to grow faster than rich ones in per capita terms. the co- integration test indicates a long-run equilibrium relationship between gdp and energy intensity. in particular, the result based on johansen shows that the energy intensity level of primary energy and gdp per capita are co- integrated in rwanda, burundi and uganda while the co-integration based on pedroni occurs in burundi and rwanda. the granger causality shows that there is a unidirectional relation running from gdp to primary energy use in all countries except kenya. south sudan is observed to have a bidirectional relationship between variables. finally, we find that the long-run coefficient of gdp per capita is negative and significant, indicating a change in trend of energy intensity. the results suggest that economic growth in eac countries can be supported by promoting growth in productivity of the energy industries.","energy intensity, gdp per capita, co-integration, convergence",,"from co-integration and granger-causality investigation analysis desire sekanabo sekanabod1@gmail.com hakizimana khan jean de dieu african centre of excellence in energy for sustainable development, college of science and technology, university of rwanda, kn 73 st, p.o.box 3900, kigali, rwanda hakizimanajd@gmail.com elias nyandwi centre for geographic information systems and remote sensing, university of rwanda (cgis-ur), college of science and technology, kn 73 st, p.o.box 3900, kigali, rwanda. nyasept@gmail.com valerie m. thomas h. milton stewart school of industrial and systems engineering, and school of public policy, georgia institute of technology, vt34@gatech.edu, valerie.thomas@isye.gatech.edu",
181,Conversion Of Diesel And Petrol Engines To Biogas Engines  As An Energy Transition Strategy,"the use of internal combustion engines is a reliable and relatively efficient means of getting mechanical power for automotive propulsion and prime movers for generators in power plants. the transport sector is a major consumer of fossil fuels and accounts for over 60% of total air pollution coming from automobiles running on fossil fuels. in this study, an analysis was done on the feasibility of converting conventional engines to biogas or biomethane engines. the study showed that dual fuel engines can be used with little or no modifications to ran on biogas. however, to run on pure biogas as a fuel, the diesel engines need introduction of the ignition system in addition to gas storage and supply system. conversion of a petrol engine to 100% biogas is the simplest as it requires minor adjustments related o introduction of the biogas storage and supply system.","biogas, biogas engine, engine performance, dual fuel engine","The results of this study showed that biogas is a feasible substitute of fossil fuel as an alternative fuel, but conversion should be carefully done to minimize engine emission like NOx, CO, particulate matter, and others. The use of a heat exchanger in the EGR system resulted in reduction of emissions in the atmosphere. The use of the EGR in improved thermal efficiency and is eco-friendly but optimum level of recirculation should be established for tradeoff between NOX and other emissions which are influenced differently. The modification of diesel engine into a dual fuel engine would involve introducing an air-fuel mixing chamber along the air intake system to provide an effective means of admitting the gaseous fuel into the combustion chamber and for homogenous mixing of air and the gaseous fuel. A modification has also to be made at the diesel injection pump to allow adjustment of the injection quantities of the pilot fuel as may be necessary. The study showed that brake power and the brake thermal efficiency decreased with use of biogas due to the calorific value of biogas being lower compared to diesel. The lower heating value of biogas is at least 50% lower than for diesel. Both CO and HC emissions of the dual fuel engine are higher than for diesel operation by upto 2 and 12 times respectively. This was majorly attributed to displacement of the air necessary for combustion with biogas. Biogas is a good fuel for dual fuel engines and can form a perfect supplement to the fossil fuels used in the country since it is renewable and affordable. Biogas can also be used alone but adjustment to the engine may be necessary depending on whether the engine is compression ignition or spark ignition. This study demostrated that a petrol and biogas-petrol blend yield higher torque, more brake power, higher indicated power, high brake thermal efficiency, and higher brake mean effective pressure. But, it has lower fuel consumption and creates higher exhaust temperature than petrol. The stufy showed that a spark ignition engine fueld by biogas-petrol was more economical, ha has low fuel consumption and contributes to to fertilizer production and better sanitation. Therfore biogas has a significant role to place in the energy transition by cutting down emissions in bothe power generation and transport indiustry.","moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi, oludolapo akanni olanrewaju 22064693@dut4life.ac.za, oludolapoo@dut.ac.za department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment durban university of technology, durban, sa",

185,Valuation Of Mining Low Coal Calories   Using Real Option Analysis,"the purpose of this research is to calculate the valuation of coal mining projects, especially low-calorie coal using the real option and discounted cash flow methods for comparison. research has been carried out in pt. pesona khatulistiwa nusantara (pt.pkn), which one has low-calorie coal reserves in four mining areas, and currently has production in two mining areas. at the opening of the two previous sites, the feasibility calculation was carried out using the discounted cash flow method, which this method did not describe the movement of coal prices that occurred in the future so that management was not flexible in setting strategies to dealing with fluctuating coal prices. where in that period there was a continuous decline in coal prices from 2011 to 2016. currently pt. pkn plans to open a new mining area, namely at the ardimulyo mine operation (amo) site, to get a more detailed analysis the valuation of this amo project will be calculated using real option to accompany the calculation with discounted cash flow. the calculation using the real option method (without abandon) shows the npv value below the discounted cash flow method, while the exit option/abandonment value increases as the selling price of coal decreases. so it is recommended to run an exit option/abandonment when the selling price of coal is not economical.","real option, mining valuation, exit option","From the results of the research on the production scenario set by PT.PKN, it produces NPV (DCF) : $7,576,503, NPV (RO without abandon) : $5,266,160, NPV (RO with abandon) : $12,319,932, and the value of Option exit/Abandonment : $7,053,771. The difference in NPV between the option with abandon and without abandon is the value of the Exit Option/Abandonment, where there is potential for additional NPV if there is a delay in production and sales when the selling price of coal is not economical. However, there are limitations in carrying out this Exit Option/Abandonment practice, where companies that have run production are not flexible in exercising this option because there are costs that will arise when running it. These costs must be considered when choosing to exercise this option. This research is limited to the calculation of feasibility using real options methode and estimated costs to exercise the exit/abandonment option when the selling price of coal is not economical, which this study discusses only the planning stage. The execution stage of running the exit option/abandonment has not been discussed in this study, it is hoped that further research can detail the stages of execution and evaluation.","yuani and sri parwati business management, binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia yuani@binus.ac.id, sri.parwati@binus.ac.id dewi tamara executive strategic in management, binus business school bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia dtamara@binus.edu",

More research is required to assess the decarbonization of LPG and Bio-LPG fuels in the transportation sector. Whether LPG can be used as a primary fuel or alternate fuel is unknown. Very little research has been done about the use of LPG and Bio- LPG. • Biofuels are environmentally friendly, but they are not economical compared to conventional fuels. Much research is required in this direction. • LNG is economical and offers some reduction in greenhouse gas- common pollutants and particle emissions. The methane leakage issue needs to be addressed. But more research is required in this direction • LNG as fuel is already tested in a few countries such as America, Canada, India, and China for LD and HD transportation. • The demand for LNG in India, like in other parts of the world, is growing, and researchers have much scope for studying operational, economic, safety, and environmental aspects. • India is emerging as a significant LNG market shortly. There is a massive demand for consumer-friendly regulatory authority for achieving long term goals, • The main limitation of this paper is that only fuels that can be used in IC Engines are presented in this work.

189,A Natural Convective Passive Noise Control System For  Mini-Generators,"in this research work, the acoustic characteristics of noise produced by tg950 generator is studied and a suitable physical full scale model acoustic enclosure for it has been designed and evaluated and is hereby presented. the generator was treated as a point source and the insertion loss of the produced model of full enclosure was found to be quite good. the results show that the noise level was reduced by about 17 % at the optimum stack height of 1600 mm. the effect of exhaust tunneling was investigated. results showed that exhaust tunnel projection beyond 200mm did not significantly improve the enclosure insertion loss. the enclosure model and the generator were discovered to have good thermal conditions under natural convection, with a maximum temperature rise of 9oc from ambient temperature of 30 oc, thereby eliminating the need for artificial cooling and its consequent ancillary power consumption.","mini-generators, acoustic enclosure, noise reduction, petrol engine","It has been observed that the mini generator set can be approximated to a point source with no directivity at a minimum listener position of 1 m from the source. The generator noise decays with increasing distance away from the generator and at a rate which is in agreement with the theoretical prediction. The insertion loss of the full acoustic enclosure is substantial and hence can provide succor to the menace of noise pollution from these categories of generators. Worthy of mention is the fact that the generator can be operated at safe temperatures inside the enclosure. Hence, the enclosure which would provide protection as well as noise reduction can therefore be put outside the immediate user’s environment, under rain or sunshine, without fear of damage or loss. This will therefore save the population from the harmful effects of the generator fumes which has been pointed to have caused the death of many users.

In this study, the content variable and the ease of use variable have a positive and significant influence on user satisfaction, this means that if the e-learning content is complete, useful, and in accordance with the user needs it will increase the satisfaction. Similar to content variable, if the system is easy to use for students in Poltekkes Kemenkes Riau, it will increase the satisfaction. The developers of the e-learning must pay attention to these two variables for the success of e-learning in the future. Content, accuracy, format, ease of use, and timeliness variables in this research represent strongly (83.8%) variance of the user satisfaction based on the coefficient of determination calculation.","stedico anderjovi department of information system universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau pekanbaru, indonesia 11750314757@students.uin-suska.ac.id muhammad luthfi hamzah department of information system universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau pekanbaru, indonesia muhammad.luthfi@uin-suska.ac.id idria maita department of information system state islamic university of sultan syarif kasim riau pekanbaru, indonesia idria@uin-suska.ac.id tengku khairil ahsyar lecturer, department of information system universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau pekanbaru, indonesia tengkukhairil@uin-suska.ac.id",
191,Machine Vision Based Techniques For Inspecting   3D-Printed Spur Gears,"spur gears are employed for transferring both motion and power from driver shaft to driven shaft. the performance of spur gears largely depends upon its design and construction. thus there is a need for inspecting spur gear before deployment. during the inspection, a spur gear will be checked for pitch circle, diametral pitch, center distance, outside diameter, etc. many techniques have been proposed by researchers for the measurement of gear elements. many of these techniques are contact-based and are fit for sampling inspection. these techniques are not amenable to automation. sampling inspection techniques are not fool-proof. with the advent of 3d printing and industry 4.0, there is a thrust is toward 100% inspection. this has necessitated the need for designing and developing new inspection techniques for measuring spur gear elements in real-time. in the present research, an attempt has been made to design and develop a new non-contact and online, technique for inspecting spur gears in real-time. the measurements made by using the proposed method are validated by standard methods and are in good agreement.","3d-printing, texture assessment, image processing","The present research work demonstrates a novel technique for the inspection of Spur gears. The method makes use of a Vision system for acquiring images of the Gears. These images are then processed for image quality enhancement. Then the images are used for computing the following Gear parameters. a. Gear tooth thickness b. Gear pitch c. Gear profile The method also does gear profile as well as texture analysis through GLCM. The method is also capable of classifying gears into Good/Bad/Rework categories. Thus, the proposed method is a non-contact means of comprehensively inspecting a Spur gear, in a single set-up. The method finds application in the online inspection of Gears. The classification accuracy was 94%. The method was tested for repeatability and has shown a repeatability error of ± 5.14%.","m. b. kiran associate professor, department of mechanical engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal energy university, gandhinagar mb.kiran@sot.pdpu.ac.in",
192,Wind Energy In Saudi Arabia Opportunities And Challenges,"wind energy has been recognized as one of the fastest-growing energy sources in world and as a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing dependence on oil, diversifying energy supply, and providing electricity at a low cost. in its 2030 vision, the kingdom of saudi arabia has recently set ambitious targets to move away from oil dependency and redirect the efforts towards more higher-value exploitation of oil and gas, mainly meeting 10 percent of its energy demand through renewable energy sources. this paper attempts to explore the feasibility of using wind turbine machines for energy generation in saudi arabia by presenting a study of the opportunities and challenges that can arise while installing these machines. the paper also highlights several technical challenges and gaps that have been anticipated for this design motivation. observations and upcoming trends show that by 2030 renewable energy, including solar and wind, will provide up to 50% of electricity production in the kingdom.","wind energy, opportunities, challenges, china","The weather forecast Saudi Arabia from KAPSARC showed the latitude, Longitude, wind direction angle, and wind speed-rate data between 2018 and 2019 and its great potential of wind energy in the Kingdom. According to wind speed and Air temperature analysis at peak-time, wind energy challenges showed the potential and challenges of using wind energy in Saudi Arabia during the time since wind speed has different reading during the year.
