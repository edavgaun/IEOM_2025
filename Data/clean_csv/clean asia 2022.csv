0,The Development And Validation Of A Mathematical Model  Of Output In A Manufacturing System,"the construction of mathematical models includes a variety of strategies for closing the gap between the model and real-time data. this study uses a data mining technique to expand mathematical model construction to include simulation optimization. at the same time, this procedure is used to verify the mathematical model. in addition to dynamic property validation, the paper suggests mathematical programming as a static property validation method. the validated mathematical model is compared and examined with real-time data, and the results show that the mathematical model applies to real-time systems. the mathematical model has a low error margin estimate and can be used to forecast. the paper's main contribution is to investigate simulation optimization, mathematical programming, and mathematical models to handle the increasing complexity of variables to improve prediction capabilities and lay a solid foundation for tackling factory planning issues.",,"In this paper, an enhanced methodology that involves mathematical model development through simulation optimization and its concurrent static validation properties is proposed to improve the mathematical model in manufacturing systems. The main goal of the mathematical model is to minimize the gap between theory and practice. The data mining on simulation optimization is used for the mathematical model development. The developed mathematical model is further validated with static properties of mathematical programming. The paper emphasizes the quantitative analysis during the mathematical model development and validation. The effectiveness of the developed mathematical model is evaluated with real-time data. The mathematical model and real-time data result show that the model is satisfactory and acceptable for prediction analysis in the manufacturing system. Future studies must focus on enhancing the proposed methodology for the mathematical model development and its validation to narrow the gap between the mathematical model and real-time data. The findings can be used to continuously enhance the developed mathematical model and apply the model in real-time manufacturing systems in the future. Although this methodology is an improved version of current literature, the mixture of data mining on dynamic properties of the simulation model and static properties of mathematical programming in this proposed methodology provides a new platform for researchers to address further these limitations for future enhancement of the mathematical model. 10","ho kok hoe phd graduate, department of industrial engineering faculty engineering and green technology universiti tunku abdul rahman kampar, perak, malaysia hokokhoe1980@gmail.com joshua prakash assistant professor, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and green technology universiti tunku abdul rahman kampar, perak, malaysia joshuaj@utar.edu.my ong kok seng professor, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and green technology universiti tunku abdul rahman kampar, perak, malaysia skong@utar.edu.my","References

1,Development And Validation Of A Production Planning  Model For Throughput Shortage Recovery Through Process,"existing production planning models plan throughput to meet customer demand. however, there are limitations, such as a lack of quantitative correlation between process parameters and throughput shortage and emphasis on qualitative exercises in productivity improvements to recover throughput shortage. most notably, recent developments show little attention is paid to quantitative means of throughput shortage recovery. this will result in jeopardizing the goal of meeting the demand. the study aims at developing and validating a production planning model incorporating throughput shortage recovery using mathematical programming. the literature review identifies opportunities such as the inclusion of process parameters and throughput shortage in the production planning model, which are integrated to develop a feasible production planning model. the study objectives are to perform throughput estimation and recover throughput shortage in a series of processes. the model encompasses three stages. in the first stage, the mathematical model of make span is developed as a function of process parameters for a series of processes. the mathematical model is formulated based on simulation data using statistical software (jmp). in the second stage, the mathematical model of planned throughput is formulated from the mathematical model of make span and validated with simulation-optimization throughput and mathematical programming throughput. in the third stage, a two-stage production planning model utilizes the mathematical model of planned throughput and mathematical programming to search for optimized process parameters to meet both planned throughput and throughput shortage. in the first stage of production planning, the model compares planned throughput with actual throughput for each day to identify actual throughput shortage. if there is a throughput shortage, on the subsequent day at the 2nd stage of production planning, the mathematical programming search for optimized process parameters to estimate attained throughput that can at least meet the projected throughput. the projected throughput is the summation of planned throughput from the current day and the actual throughput shortage from the previous day. if there is a throughput shortage available, the mathematical programming procedure for the next day is repeated. the simulated throughput shortage at 2nd stage of production is further carried forward to the subsequent day for the mathematical programming to estimate the attained throughput that can meet the projected throughput. if there is no simulated throughput shortage, the 2nd stage of production planning is terminated, and the 1st stage of production planning is repeated for the subsequent day. the mathematical programming in this study is to adjust process parameter values within the range of the allowable values when there is a throughput shortage. the model is validated in a manufacturing system for a period. the results show that, compared to existing production planning models with no throughput shortage recovery, the proposed model can reduce accumulated throughput shortage incurred over each period. the study introduces the novelty of formulating multiple processes parameters in mathematical programming to recover throughput shortage at the 2nd stage of production planning. the streamlining of the throughput shortage reduction approach indirectly enables manufacturers to reduce inventory buffers, optimize cycle time, and meet customer due dates.",process parameters,,"parameter adjustment in manufacturing industry ho kok hoe senior lecturer, robotics and mechatronics discipline school of engineering monash university malaysia subang jaya, selangor, malaysia ho.kokhoe@monash.edu",
2,Reliability Analysis Of Covid-19 Risk Management System In  Malaysia Higher Learning Institution,"reliability concerns the extent to which a measurement of a phenomenon provides a stable and consistent result. reliability is also concerned with repeatability. for example, a test will be reliable if measurement is repeated and conducted under constant conditions, hence will give the same result. this article attempts to present the result of a reliability study in the development of the covid-19 risk management system in a malaysia institution of higher learning. the system is called c19-hirao. two types of reliability study were explored for this purpose namely interrater reliability study and test-retest method. interrater reliability study consists of cohen’s kappa statistic and percent agreement (conventional method). interrater cohen’s kappa and test-retest method were performed by the raters from universiti malaysia pahang (ump). the result proved that the developed c19-hirao has achieved an almost perfect agreement (0.92), moderate agreement (0.75) and very high relationship (1.00) for interrater percentage agreement, interrater cohen’s kappa and test-retest method respectively. in conclusion, although this system is still newly developed, the risk rating value obtained is consistent among different raters. the value of this risk rating is also stable and reliable over the time when test-retest reliability is conducted within the stipulated time frame by the same rater.",however,"In short, the developed C19-HIRAO meets all respective risk assessment criteria that emphasized hazard and risk recognition, a full assessment of risk, and dynamic opportunities plan to mitigate the risk to the acceptance level which may less harm to the staff and student in the university. The objective of this paper which is to present the result of a reliability analysis in the development of the C19-HIRAO in Malaysia Higher Learning Institution meets its purpose throughout the result discussed earlier on. A better result can be achieved by ensuring less guessing among the raters when the reliability study is conducted, it is important to ensure that each participant is given comprehensive training through a clear conceptual understanding of the system developed and their understanding of the training attended should be well assessed. Finally, it can be concluded that both inter-rater consistency (Cohen’s Kappa analysis and percentage agreement) and test-retest reliability capable to measure the agreement between rater either the stability of scores between 2 points of time within the same raters. In addition to this conclusion, another method that can be suggested to measure reliability is known as Fleiss Kappa Analysis (FPA). FPA can be applied to determine the level of agreement between two or more raters as long as it meets a few basic requirements and assumptions of Fleiss’ 24","khairil anuar abdul hamid senior teaching engineer, centre for design and innovation of technology (print) industrial technology engineering creativity space university malaysia pahang pekan, pahang, malaysia khairil@ump.edu.my ezrin hani sukadarin and mirta widia occupational safety and health program faculty of industrial sciences and technology (fist) universiti malaysia pahang kuantan, pahang, malaysia ezrin@ump.edu.my, mirta@ump.edu.my","References

3,Optimization Of Humanitarian Logistics Distribution Routes  In East Jakarta,"dki jakarta often experiences flood disasters when the rainy season hits. the floods caused a number of residents to be affected so that residents needed to evacuate to safer places, such as refugee posts. citizens who secure themselves at the post certainly need some necessary needs such as humanitarian logistics goods. humanitarian logistics goods need to be distributed quickly and precisely so that optimal distribution lines are needed. this research aims to find out the route of distribution of humanitarian logistics goods that occur in jakarta, especially east jakarta. this problem is solved by using the saving matrix method with the nearest neighbour and nearest insertion method as a route sorting method. the results of the route determination are known that the optimal distribution path is obtained from the first alternative using the nearest neighbour method with a total distance of 130.25 m.",jakarta flood,"There are several conclusions that can be drawn based on this research, namely: 1. East Jakarta is a very affected area in 2020 because East Jakarta has 50 wards out of a total of 157 wards affected by flooding in DKI Jakarta. So that, there are 5 routes formed based on the Saving Matrix Method, namely W- JT23-JT20-JT22-JT11-JT24-JT26-JT25-JT27-W, W-JT5-JT10-JT7-JT6-JT13-JT2-JT14-JT8-W, W-JT12-JT9- JT16-JT1-JT15-W, W-JT17-JT18-W, and W-JT3-JT19-JT4-JT21-W. 2. There is one alternative route that is formed based on route sequencing using the Nearest Neighbor Method. The route for the 1st alternative has a total distance of 130.25 m. There are 2 alternative routes formed based on route sequencing using the Nearest Insertion Method. The route for the 2nd alternative has a total distance of 137.65 m, while the total distance for the 3rd alternative is 139.1 m. If both routes based on the Nearest Insertion Method are compared, then the shortest route is obtained on the 2nd alternative route. Based on the three alternatives formed, it is known that the alternative route using the Nearest Neighbor Method has the shortest total distance when compared to all the alternatives formed. The shortest total distance of the three alternatives has 130.25 m. The advice that can be given based on this research is that the DKI Jakarta government can consider determining the route using the Saving Matrix Method with the Nearest Neighbor Method as a method of sorting the route.","sarah aggahra and rienna oktarina industrial engineering department faculty of engineering bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 sarah.aggahra@binus.ac.id, rienna.oktarina@binus.ac.id",
4,Improving Industrial Engineering Student' Soft Skill Using  Project-Based Learning (Pjbl) Method,"this paper introduces the use of pjbl (project based learning) to improve engineering student soft skill. soft skill in the engineering student includes problem solving, creativity, critical thinking, initiative, analytical thinking, communication skill, responsibility, discipline, and attitude. these abilities will really impact to their future career and need to be engage in student course in the curriculum. the method used to improve them when lecturer give the subject that can be developed through several methods of teaching and learning approaches, for example pjbl. this research aims to find out how pjbl will affect student soft skill and performance. due to covid 19, there were less movement in lecturer's view, to apply the method during online learning. most pjbl were used in direct teaching or onsite where the student must visit the class along with the facilitator. when lecturer face online teaching there are some difficulties in applying teaching method esspecially in undergraduate student which concern about high order thinking (hot). the research starts form developing framework, defining student who will participate the treatment and developing assessment test to evaluate the study outome. there are 38 student form project management class that will be given serial project activites based on pjbl method. the research shows that pjbl could increase student softskill particularly analytical thinking and problem solving.","pjbl, covid-19, online learning, challenge","As the conclusion, the success rate of the PjBL in virtual class be seen from the comparison between the achievement of stage 1 and the achievement of stage 2. In accordance with the purpose of the grant, namely increasing student understanding regarding the application of project management theory in the field. Improvement in the affective aspect of lecturer assessment in the second stage, from 4.88 to 5.44. While in the field supervisor's assessment there was a slight decrease, but not significant, namely from 5.77 it decreased to 5.65.","devi pratami lecturer, school of industrial and system engineering telkom university bandung, indonesia devipratami@telkomuniversity.ac.id wawan tripiawan lecturer, school of industrial and system engineering telkom university bandung, indonesia wawantripiawan@telkomuniversity.ac.id ika arum puspita lecturer, school of industrial and system engineering telkom university bandung, indonesia ikaarumpuspita@telkomuniversity.ac.id","references in the field. The average assessment of field supervisors is still higher 
than that of lecturers (academic supervisors) because field supervisors are more intense, directly involved, and more 
aware of student conditions in each project process. 
 
The aspect of problem solving, carried out by students in the internship project is scored higher by company 
supervisors than lecturers. This means that students can apply project-related materials in solving problems in the 
internship’s activity. In addition, the assessment score from the supervisor is also higher than lecturer's score because 
students had the more often face-to-face meeting, both physically or virtual using Zoom or virtual meeting platform 
which increase the task responsibility and trust. Most problem occurred due to the proper and right method, tools/ 
techniques which fit to the actual problem. There was a huge gap between theory and the actual one so the student can 
learn the implementation of the right solution and the challenges which was not learned in the class meeting.  
 
The value of the field supervisor is higher because in the field it will be more visible how student creativity and 
improvisation of problem solving. Meetings with class lecturers are held once a week so that lecturers are less able to 
assess in detail the creative process carried out by students in the field. Therefore, the application of the project Based 
Learning method in this course is very helpful to explore the potential of students and increase students' understanding 
of projects.

6,The Application Of Student-Centred Learning Method In  Theory-Based And Studio-Based Online Courses.,"this paper focuses on the application of the student-centred learning method in three architecture courses conducted in 2021 with online learning. as covid 19 pandemic hit, online learning became compulsory and all stakeholders have to adjust to the situation. the main difficulties with online learning are that the students become less active, and more difficult to control the quality of learning. another difficulty such as the lack of internet access in remote areas also present. to deal with those problems, we use synchronized learning through video conferenceing software (vcs) – with video off- to encourage interactions. the student-centred learning (scl) method was used to activate the students so that the lecturers can control the output. we used three courses with different states of application of scl in comparison. out of three courses, two of them are theory-based and another is studio-based which is very different to that from the former. we used a similar method for three of them, which is the jigsaw method. despite the differences in the conditions of each course, students become more active in learning. the course which has full student-centred learning has more benefits than the others in which the method was only applied partially. in the studio-based course, however, scl brings the smallest effect, which is due to the nature of the studio-based learning which is more hands-on on individual projects. generally, the students are happier dan appreciative of the application of the student-centred learning method.","online learning, learning method","The adoption of Student Centred Learning in online courses during the Covid 19 pandemic can help to increase their effectiveness. This can be seen from what happened in three architectural courses with different characters and at different stages of adoption. APDM, which was designed to be SCL based in the first place shows a very good outcome and satisfaction from the students. ABP and ADS2 which adopted SCL in mid-semester also show improvement even when not optimal. ADS2 which is a studio-based course shows the least satisfaction, which is mainly due to the character of design studio learning that needs more interactions among the students and instructors to yield a better outcome. 75","ofita purwani associate professor, school architecture faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia o.purwani@staff.uns.ac.id m. muqoffa senior lecturer, school architecture faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia","References

9,The Mediating Role Of Attitudes Toward Usage On  Consumers’ Intention To Use The Traveloka (E-Commerce),"various fintech services have sprung up along with the changing lifestyle of the indonesian people who are now completely online because of the fast and easy-to-use factor. one of the discoveries in the fintech industry is by transacting using a feature called paylater. this study aims to analyze the effect of perceive usefulness, perceived risk and perceived trust either directly or through the mediating variable attitude towards using on intention to use traveloka paylater. the total number of respondents used in this study was 417 respondents. based on the data that has been collected and has passed the testing process with the multiple linear regression method using smart pls 3 software. the results obtained from the hypothesis prove that perceived usefulness, perceived risk, and perceived trust influence intention to use traveloka paylater. this research has limitations, it only covers one fintech, which is traveloka paylater and the research results cannot be generalized to other fintechs. in future research, the researcher suggests getting more respondents and covering a wider area to produce more accurate data.","pay later, perceived risk, perceived risk","can be drawn: 1. There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Usefulness variable directly on Attitude Towards Using. Thus, the first hypothesis can be accepted. 2. There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Usefulness variable directly on Intention to Use. Thus, the second hypothesis can be accepted. 3. There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Risk variable directly on Attitude Towards Using. Thus, the third hypothesis is rejected. 4. There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Risk variable directly on Intention to Use. Thus, the fourth hypothesis is rejected. 5. There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Trust variable directly on Attitude Towards Using. Thus, the fifth hypothesis can be accepted. 6. There is a positive and significant effect of the Perceived Trust variable directly on Intention to Use. Thus, the sixth hypothesis can be accepted. 7. There is a positive and significant effect of the Attitude Towards Using variable directly on Intention to Use. Thus, the seventh hypothesis can be accepted. 8. There is a positive and significant influence from the Attitude Towards Using variable which mediates the indirect relationship between Perceived Usefulness and Intention to Use. Thus, the eighth hypothesis can be accepted. 9. There is a positive and significant influence from the Attitude Towards Using variable which mediates the indirect relationship between Perceived Risk and Intention to Use. Thus, the ninth hypothesis can be accepted. 10. There is a positive and significant effect of the Attitude Towards Using variable which mediates the indirect relationship between Perceived Trust and Intention to Use. Thus, the tenth hypothesis can be accepted. Based on the analysis obtained from this study and the results of the distributed questionnaires, there are several suggestions that can be taken into consideration by the company. There are also suggestions as an advice for further research, as well as for users who will use the results of this research, as follows: 1. This study only covers one fintech, Traveloka Pay Later and the results of the study cannot be generalized to other fintechs, because the name of the company that makes the fintech product can also affect the respondents' answers. 2. In future research, the researcher suggests getting more respondents and covering a wider area to produce more accurate data. 3. The number of respondents will also be influenced by the number of Traveloka users when this research begins, so that the number of users in the future will increase from before. 4. The pandemic situation has also reduced the frequency of using the Traveloka application and has an impact on the use of Pay Later.","pay later application amelya larasati wijaya, dean fadhurohman hafizh, frans david ginola damanik and nur damayanti binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia amelya.larasati@binus.ac.id, dean.hafizh@binus.ac.id, frans.damanik@binus.ac.id nur.damayanti@binus.ac.id",
10,Techno-Economic Study On Improvement Of  Slaughterhouses By Considering Sensitive Analysis And,"this article discusses the improvement of aqidawati & sutopo's (2017) article, related to the analysis of the feasibility of investing in facilities that meet the standards to obtain safe, healthy, whole, and halal beef at the surakarta slaughterhouse. previous studies evaluated using a technical-economic approach with investment feasibility criteria indicated by the value of npv>0, pp <20 years (economic age), b/c ratio 1, and production yields greater than the amount of bep. then, a proposed improvement is made by adding aspects of the techno-economic study by considering exchange rates and sensitivity analysis. as a result, the best alternative is obtained; namely alternative level 1-c with an npv value of rp 88,462,036, marr < irr (3% < 7.23%), bc ratio value of 1.06, and a payback period that meets company requirements (11.15 < 20). so it can be concluded that the investment can be said to be feasible. in addition, the sensitivity analysis results also show that the annual worth (aw) is the most sensitive to changes in retribution prices so that it considers the government in determining the decision on the amount of the retribution price.","slaughterhouse, cleanliness","Based on the analysis of the improvements, the are some conclusions to answer the objective of the research: a. The analysis produces the best alternative, which is still the same as Aqidawati & Sutopo's (2017) article, namely the level 1-C alternative. Choose alternative 1-C because it met the NPV > 0, PP < 20 years, IRR < MARR, and the shortest payback period than the other alternatives. However, with different values, one example is the NPV value of Rp.88,462,036, compared to the original article, which had an NPV of Rp.206,107,298, etc. This different value can occur because several additional factors include in the analysis, namely the tax factor and the conversion of actual values. It expects to provide a more definitive conclusion and align with the situation. b. The relationship between the two alternatives that meet all the requirements, namely 1-C and 2-C, has a delta or the difference in the annual worth of the cash flows of the two alternatives, which is always constant. It can happen because both have the same level of effectiveness; the two alternatives only have differences in annual costs and initial investment. So alternative 1-C will always be better in all intervals compared to alternative 2-C. c. Initial investment and annual costs have the same relationship with AW, a negative relationship. An initial investment or annual fee increase will decrease the AW received and vice versa. While the retribution price has a positive relationship with AW, adding the retribution price will cause an increase in the AW received, and vice versa. In addition, from the gradient (steepness) of the line, the AW value is the most sensitive to changes in the retribution price.","exchange rate muhammad hafiz aditya1, hafid maulana yunizar1, ananda wahyu nur said1, sayyidah maulidatul afraah2 1undergraduate of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering 2graduate of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia mha.hafiz@student.uns.ac.id, hafidmaulana02@student.uns.ac.id, anandawahyu223@student.uns.ac.id, sayyidahmaulidatula@student.uns.ac.id muhammad hisjam1, wahyudi sutopo2 1,2research group industrial engineering and techno-economic 1,2industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering 2centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia hisjam@staff.uns.ac.id, wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id",

13,Improve E-Learning Ecosystem With Big Data In Higher  Education,"e-learning as the main system that supports the learning process in higher education turns out to have several problems such as inadequate compatibility between service technology design and the psychological components of the learning process, shallowness in learning caused by various methodologies, certain types of reduction of the relationship between learners, between themselves and the lecturer, the possibility of a loss of direct communication and direct collaboration. on the other hand, big data can determine and analyze the causes of a problem that occurs in the system, including the e-learning system. the purpose of this research is to help higher education optimize e-learning by using big data. the research method uses a qualitative approach through literature review to find e-learning problems in universities. while the qualitative approach is through observation to analyze alternative solutions with a big data approach.","e-learning, big data","Based on observations of the implementation of e-learning in several universities and literature reviews, e-learning provides a lot of convenience in the learning process, especially in universities, but the existing problems cannot be solved comprehensively. The use of big in e-learning not only solves e-learning problems but can increase the competitive advantage of higher education from the output of big data because it will have an impact on many aspects such as student satisfaction, lecturers, staff, and all other stakeholders","inayatulloh information systems department school of information system bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 inay@ binus.ac.id *nico djundharto djajasinga politeknik transportasi darat indonesia-sttd nico.djajasinga@ptdisttd.ac.id destiana utarindasari sekolah tinggi ekonomi bisnis islam syari’ah bina mandiri. destiana9985@gmail.com rizky muslim fadhillah fachri data science cyber security swiss german university rizky.fachri@student.sgu.ac.id *correspondent author",
14,Modelling The Combined Effect Of Indoor  Environmental Condition On Neurobehavioral Trends Of,"the current study is aimed at evaluating the combined effects of indoor noise, light and temperature on human neurophysiological responses. this study included 34 individuals who were exposed to varying temperatures (16 degrees celsius, 22 degrees celsius, and 31 degrees celsius), light (150 lumens per meter square, 250 lumens per meter square, and 500 lumens per meter square), and noise levels (20 decibels, 50 decibels, and 90 decibels) in 27 sessions in a simulated indoor setting. 67% accuracy was achieved for knn model. accuracy can be increased with increasing amount of data of participants. furthermore, the effects of temperature on heart rate were more substantial than the effects of noise. overall, noise for longer duration has a stronger negative impact on working memory of male, whereas temperature has a more severe influence on neurophysiological response of female. on other hand, male performed well in high temperature than female. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between ecg and ieq. the study culminated with directions for further studies.","electrocardiogram, machine learning, noise, temperature","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between ECG and IEQ. Human brain and heart behave differently under different environmental conditions. Our focus is to make a correlation between ECG, light, noise and temperature. First, we convert automatically all ECG images into numerical columns and then we apply machine learning algorithms to make final prediction. The emphasis in this study is on detecting and extracting patterns from Electrocardiogram picture reports. The requirement for time-consuming human intervention to understand the report can be avoided by digitizing ECG recordings. The automation of diagnosis and analysis may be accomplished more quickly with digitalization. We achieved 67% accuracy for KNN model. Accuracy can be increased with increasing amount of data of participants. ECG images were transformed into 1D data and then we add more information about memory condition, age, gender, profession after experiments of noise, temperature and light. From results noise mainly effect male as compared to female. Females show positive attitude when they were exposure to high noise. On other hand, male show outstanding performance when they exposed to high temperature. Light has natural effect. If we increased light intensity this effect headache but overall, on 200-500 Luminance is best for office work environment. Noise cannot be removed in any office completely so people are used to it. Temperature can be managed and mainly this effect our breathing and hence effect our ECG and brain working. Working memory and neurophysiological responses were disrupted in the investigated experiment settings as temperature and noise increased. The results showed that noise had a substantial influence on working memory when compared to air temperature. The combined impacts of noise, light and temperature were greater than the influence of each factor alone. The rise in light intensity had no effect on reaction accuracy in the context of high noise levels. However, in the presence of loud noise, the increase in temperature exacerbated the mean value of neurophysiological reactions. 0 100 200 300 400 500 Noise Light Temperature Memory Indoor Environment Effect with normal ECG Male vs Female Comaprison Male Female 143","individuals through electrocardiogram mohammad hashir mehmood1, ezutah udoncy olugu 2, wajeeha ansar3 1 student, department of mechanical engineering, ucsi university, malaysia. 2 associate professor, department of mechanical & mechatronic engineering, ucsi university, malaysia. 3 research associate, department of computer science, comsats university, pakistan.","References

To develop the required facility layout, measurements for workstations were taken to ensure the design was appropriate for the layout. Two development layouts were designed to be submitted to Erul Food Industry. These facility layouts were designed by adhering to the MeSTI and Halal JAKIM checklist requirements for SMEs while building layouts. The current layout has been observed in terms of additional machines and the workflow is disorganized which results in certain workers being unable to do their tasks efficiently. Two proposed layouts are being prepared and analyzed. The reduction in time may be considered an achievement when the time for each layout is less than the starting time for producing a single batch of products. A comparison of the proposed and current layouts is presented to optimize the time, cost, and efficiency of the production process. Significant improvement is predicted based on data from the simulation by using FlexSim software for time and cost comparison with the current layout. The simulation of the proposed layout is projected to reduce time and cost for Erul Food Industry's workstations. According to the analysis, altering the layout percentage of efficiency improvement for the time analysis showed Design 2 had the highest percentage improvement which is 6.4% compared to other designs. Therefore, it was demonstrated that the objectives were met by lowering the time and expenses. Based on the current design and the two proposed designs, Design 2 is more appropriate since it takes the least amount of time and costs the least amount of money. Design 2 layout will be recommended to Erul Food Industry for consideration to ensure that Erul Food Industry has a good facility layout to improve work efficiency. Besides, an appropriate layout is required to provide a smooth and consistent flow of manufacturing. The layout of the facility is designed to ensure that workers operate in a productive workflow and that the equipment is in the proper location. In addition, improvements in the quality of facilities layout and increasing productivity are critical in today's global competition. This could be accomplished by resolving constraints in both the production process and the layout. It was discovered that the proposed layout improved both cycle time and expenses while enabling significant capacity for the production and helping to avoid any repetition movement in the production process which could improve employee health and productivity. Also, a well-organized of facilities layout helps to eliminate the bottleneck which are allowing employees to work faster, reduce idle time, increase production rates, increase efficiency in the production process, and reduce the injury risk of workers or any other damage.

18,Analysis Of Continuous Vibration Monitoring On Frequency  Domain Using Various Sensors,"manufacturing industries nowadays are looking for a possible competitive advantage to increase their production line output while lowering costs by adopting condition-based maintenance (cbm). one of the initiatives taken to address this issue is to study the condition monitoring solutions which, are becoming more popular for predicting machine problems through predictive intelligence systems in production machines such as motors and drives. this will prevent sudden equipment failures and unscheduled downtime. tapping the vibration signals at the various section of the motor and drives and analyzing them is one of the most effective methods for preempting and early detection of equipment failures. vibration analysis is a process that detects a machine's vibration level and frequency and then analyses the machine and its components' health conditions. the development of iot-based machines and drive vibration sensor detection helps to increase production efficiency by minimizing unscheduled machine downtime. the captured vibration signals are analyzed by using sliding window technique to study the variations with respect to the machine speed and running time. based on the studies, the vibration of a machine increases as the speed of the machine increases but stabilizes over a period. any continuous abnormal signals denote that the machines warrant further investigations and maintenance.",vibration analysis,"The development of an IoT-based machine vibration monitoring system is said to be successful despite some improvements that can be made. The IoT-based machine’s vibration monitoring system is capable of remote monitoring vibration data by using a wireless connection and web-based application to remote monitoring anywhere using smart devices. Hence, the objective is achieved. The system is beneficial for its proper measurement to analyse the continuation of vibration signals and temperature. The sliding window technique used in this system has resulting more accurate data to analyse the changed behaviour of vibration signals and temperature. Finally, the IoT-based machine’s vibration monitoring system is yet to be improved to provide more precise data for analysis. MLX90640 infrared thermal sensor was considered to replace DHT22 temperature, it is also to observe the effect and impact it could bring to the vibration IoT monitoring IoT system.","nagesparan ainarappan faculty of engineering, technology & built environment ucsi university kuala lumpur, malaysia nagesparan@ucsiuniversity.edu.my tham ming sum faculty of engineering, technology & built environment ucsi university kuala lumpur, malaysia 1001540344@ucsiuniversity.edu.my kanesan muthusamy faculty of engineering, technology & built environment ucsi university kuala lumpur, malaysia kanesan@ucsiuniversity.edu.my",

31,A Resource Allocation Model For Higher Education Based  On The Combination Of Efficiency Measurement And Market,"this study aimed to develop a method for prioritizing resource allocation at universities based on the results of measuring resource efficiency and the market position of study programs. the efficiency was measured using the data envelopment analysis (dea) method, followed by mapping the market position of the study program using the growth-share matrix (boston consulting group/bcg) and the ge mckinsey matrix. those methods were combined to create a priority order for allocating organizational resources. the objects of this research were 12 undergraduate programs as the decision making unit (dmu) at the engineering faculty of diponegoro university. the efficiency measurement result showed that five departments were inefficient: civil engineering, urban and regional planning, electrical engineering, and geodetic engineering. based on market position mapping results, industrial engineering and urban and regional planning were categorized as stars. computer engineering, environmental engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and geodetic engineering were classified as question mark categories. the remaining department, geological engineering and marine engineering were denoted by lose category. the integration of the dea method with bcg and ge mckinsey matrix to determine resource allocation matrix based on efficiency and market position was the scientific contribution of this study. the research was conducted based on a business perspective, with the university as a profit institution and the study program as a business unit. this research is intriguing because the indicators used to measure efficiency in a higher education institution are very different from those of a business organization.","resource allocation, university",,"position mapping ratna purwaningsih, heru prastawa, faradhina azzahra, niari prittu maypemi industrial engineering department faculty of engineering diponegoro university semarang, central java, indonesia ratna.purwaningsih@ft.undip.ac.id, heruprastawa@lecturer.undip.ac.id, faradhinaazzahra@lecturer.undip.ac.id, niaripmay@gmail.com m. mujiya ulkhaq analytics for economics and management department of economic and management university of brescia brescia, italy m.ulkhaq@unibs.it",
32,Analysis Of Driving Factors For Used Cooking Oil  Management In Catering At Yogyakarta City,"based on a preliminary study, it was found that several catering businesses have not managed waste cooking oil properly. waste cooking oil that is not managed correctly can cause environmental pollution, and if it is still used, it will cause health problems. this study explored the driving factors that motivate catering entrepreneurs to manage used cooking oil using the dematel (decision making trial evaluation and laboratory) approach. fifteen catering businesses in the eastern part of yogyakarta are the objects of this research. the results showed that public health was the dominant driving factor influencing other driving factors, most often found in the catering businesses studied, although some catering showed different results. another result of this study is that the availability of facilities is the factor that has the greatest relationship with other factors. furthermore, the management's commitment and increasing company profit are also factors that can influence other driving factors. environmental awareness, social awareness, government regulation, and product innovation are independent factors. one of the benefits of the results is that the government can use it in regulating the used cooking oil management by taking into account these driving factors.","driving factors, used cooking oil, catering","The behavior of the catering manager or owner is that the used cooking oil produced has not been managed independently but acts as a supplier and cooperates with third parties, namely used cooking oil collectors. Most catering managers or owners have sufficient knowledge about the management of used cooking oil even though they feel some internal and external obstacles in managing used cooking oil. The results showed that the public health factor was the most prominent in the management of used cooking oil in the research area. Meanwhile, the factor that has the greatest relationship with other factors is the availability of facilities. In addition, two other factors, internal policy/ management commitment and increasing company profit affect other driving factors. Meanwhile, environmental awareness, social awareness, external policy/ government regulation, and product innovation are independent factors.

35,Assessing E-Customer Loyalty In Relation To Customer  Satisfaction During Covid-19 Pandemic Using M-S-Qual,"this paper extends the research on understanding of the essence and specification, as well as the relevance of the online service industry that affects customer loyalty in relation to their satisfaction in the philippine context. quantitative method was utilized in the study by quantifying four hundred filipino online shopper’s respondents to provide a comprehensive information of which from 9 dimensions of mobile service quality (efficiency, system availability, content, privacy, fulfillment, responsiveness, compensation, contact, and billing) positively affects the customer satisfaction and understand the level of customer loyalty under the covid-19 pandemic. the results were drafted and analyzed using service quality gaps, ordinal logistic regression, and spearman correlation analysis. the modified model found the surge of online sales under the pandemic can impact the overall expectation and perception of customers towards online shopping. it is further concluded that the significant factors that have a major influence on the customer satisfaction and loyalty are efficiency, fulfillment, and content. the results also suggest that the customer’s loyalty are antecedents of customer satisfaction.","customer loyalty, serv-qual","Indeed, COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the consumer trends in the Philippines and, globally due to inevitable adaptation to digitalization, Ecommerce have embraced the digital phenomenon. It is obvious that this shift demand challenges to satisfy customers’ need which is represents a key driving force in enhancing competitive and delivering service quality. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the factors affecting customer online shopping satisfaction in relation to customer loyalty from the response of 400 online shopping customers. Research question 1: What is the respondent’s level of online shopping satisfaction in terms of the 9 dimensions of mobile service quality? The level of online satisfaction in terms of nine dimensions of mobile service quality was measured using service quality gap. The scores of nine M-ServQual dimensions were all negative, indicating that the performance failed to reach the customers’ expectations mainly on contact and responsiveness dimension which has the largest gaps. The two dimensions are associated with the availability and efficiency of customer service assistance of the platform. Therefore, the customers were dissatisfied with all the service performance provided by the online shopping platforms during the pandemic as it was perceived not to meet customer expectation in the M-ServQual dimensions. Research question 2: What are the significant factors that have a major influence on customer's online shopping satisfaction and loyalty? In order to identify significant factors that have the major influence on customers’ online shopping satisfaction and loyalty, the Ordinal Logistic Regression was used. As generated from the results of the ordinal logistics regression, the Efficiency and the Fulfillment are both factors that significantly affect the customer satisfaction out of the 9 dimensions of mobile service quality mentioned. While for customer loyalty, the factors that have a major influence are the Efficiency and the Content. The online service providers should focus on improving the said dimension in order to satisfy and retain the loyalty of their customers. In conclusion, the significant factors that have a major influence on the customer satisfaction and loyalty are Efficiency, Fulfillment, and Content. Research question 3: What is the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty? The relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty towards online shopping platforms are validated through correlation analysis. Through spearman’s rho correlation analysis, the association between two variables was determined. The result suggests that overall satisfaction and loyalty have a strong relationship. As the correlation coefficient lies between the strong positive ratio. The authors also argued that customer loyalty are great antecedents of customer satisfaction. Moreover, the link between customer satisfaction and loyalty supports the theory which states that the positive or negative purchase experience of a customer influences their purchase behavior. Therefore, the researcher concluded that there is a strong relationship between customer satisfaction and loyalty. The test significance also supported our conclusion, as the test significant value of the relationship is less than 0.05 (p = <.001), which suggests to reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. 6.1 Recommendation By fulfilling the purpose of the study, the researchers aim to help the online shopping platforms, businesses and providers of m-commerce and future researchers to further expand the applicability of the research topic. Provided by the impact of 9 dimensions and relationship of customer satisfaction and loyalty, the m-commerce providers or any online shopping platforms can use the research study as a basis for more efficient and effective service quality after pandemic. The service quality has two core elements, the customer expectation and perception. Closing or eliminating the gaps between expectation and perception on the service quality can provide the highest customer satisfaction. By identifying what factors affect service quality, it provides understanding of which customers’ expectations are fulfilled and which factors need to be satisfied. It can also help platforms, businesses and service 351","model mary ann pimentel, jlord jeus czar ramiterre, venusmar quevedo and sheila mae carungay department of industrial engineering college of engineering adamson university, manila, philippines mary.ann.pimentel@adamson.edu.ph, jlord.jeus.czar.ramiterre@adamson.edu.ph, venusmar.quevedo@adamson.edu.ph, sheila.mae.carungay@adamson.edu.ph","References

38,The Integration Of Ahp And Saw Methods With Multiple  Decision-Makers For Supplier Selection.,"supplier selection is a decision-making process that considers many criteria. the industry has developed and implemented many multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) methods for supplier selection. the analytic hierarchy process (ahp) method is one of the most widely used methods, however, the ahp method requires a lot of pairwise comparisons between criteria and alternatives, which will be more complex when there is interdependence between criteria and alternatives. in order to produce better decisions, the ahp method is often implemented with other methods like the simple additive weighting (saw) method. the saw method applies simple calculations and does not require complicated computer programs. in previous studies, a single decision-maker carried out ahp and saw together in the manufacturing industry. in this study, a decision-making method was developed by several decision- makers (dms) by integrating the ahp and saw methods. the results of integrating ahp and saw with multiple decision-makers were tested at a wood trading company called ud bsa for supplier selection. in this study, 3 alternative suppliers were considered. the literature results and brainstorming with the company resulted in 5 criteria and 8 sub-criteria that were considered in selecting suppliers at ud bsa with 2 dms: the owner as dm1 and experienced purchasing staff as dm 2. the dm weighting was determined by considering each dm’s expertise in assessing the criteria and sub-criteria. the integration of the ahp and saw methods with 2 dm produces the output weight of each dm and the calculation results of the supplier's assessment with the highest ranking. based on the calculation results, dm2 has a higher weight of 56.13%, which means that dm 2 is more expert in assessing criteria and sub-criteria. in addition, the best-selected supplier is pp, with the highest overall score of 0.8354. from this case study, ud bsa designed a supplier ranking system, which the company can use if there are new suppliers or future supplier performance changes","supplier selection, for example","The supplier ranking system design that has been designed by integrating AHP and SAW can facilitate and speed up the decision-making process of the two decision-makers in supplier selection. Based on the results of the research that has been done, it is found two decision-makers from UD Berkat Syukur Abadi, namely DM1 and DM2 considered several criteria and sub-criteria in supplier selection, namely the cost criteria with the sub-criteria of price suitability and payment convenience; quality criteria with sub-criteria of product quality and quality consistency, delivery criteria with sub-criteria of delivery time and product suitability, responsiveness criteria with sub-criteria of ease of communication and accuracy of completion, and flexibility criteria. In addition, the results of the DM's Importance Weights calculation show that DM2, as the company's administration, has the largest weight, which signifies that DM2 is more expert in providing assessments on each of the existing criteria and sub-criteria. 395","a case study of ud bsa, surabaya tasya florencia, joniarto parung*), evy herowati industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of surabaya, indonesia jparung@staff.ubaya.ac.id*)","References

39,"Causal Model For Evaluating The Performance  Technological, Organizational, Capacity And Financial When","this research presents a model of structural equations to evaluate the effects of capacity, financial, technological, and organizational performance achieved when developing suppliers. the information was obtained from a questionnaire applied to engineers and managers working in manufacturing companies in ciudad juárez, chih. mexico already has a specific list of suppliers and collaborators; 200 completed questionnaires were obtained from approximately 50 companies. the results indicate that, when it is intended to develop existing suppliers, it is important first to measure and evaluate the technological performance that they have achieved by participating as a strategic company, and secondly, to consider organizational and capacity performance, since together all of them will directly and positively influence the financial performance obtained in companies. this referer to industrial practice, to incorporate suppliers through a supplier development program, a key factor is the assessment of the performances that they have achieved in a certain time, with the purpose that the long-term strategy between company-supplier works properly to remain competitive, especially in costs. the model presented validates the fact that when selecting suppliers to develop them, the choice and the prior evaluation of their performance in the short-, medium- or long-term influences.",performance,"In the model of structural equations, it was found as the most important factor that technological performance is crucial to improve the rest of the aspects since it has direct and positive effects, and when it changes to a proportion of one standard deviation, everything will change positively in the proportion shown, 0.563, 0.332, 0.324 and 0.165 respectively. It means that all model aspects are key to obtaining greater economic benefits for companies and improving supply chain performance. In general, there is an acceptable level of interest in evaluating these performances in the suppliers that currently collaborate in the manufacturing companies in the region studied; however it is necessary to deepen the methods of monitoring suppliers methods since the incorporation of suppliers in supplier development programs in the manufacturing industry in Ciudad Juarez is scarce, it is required on the one hand to define a method of selection of suppliers and on the other, one of evaluation of the performance of the same. Companies adapt to their particularities to incorporate suppliers; a standardized procedure is not followed that includes most of the criteria or requirements that a supplier must meet as a long-term collaborator who works together for the same organizational objectives. For future research, it is recommended to expand the study to achieve a larger sample size, include other complimentary items and incorporate the methodology used to develop the providers. These would allow us to investigate more about how it is currently carried out, and thus, we will propose new strategies to develop suppliers.","developing suppliers liliana avelar sosa, jorge luis garcía alcaraz, luis asunción pérez domínguez professor and researcher on department of industrial and manufacturing engineering faculty of engineering and technology autonomous university of ciudad juárez ciudad juárez, chih., mexico liliana.avelar@uacj.mx; jorge.garcia@uacj.mx; luis.dominguez@uacj.mx josé roberto díaz reza department of electrical and computer engineering faculty of engineering and technology autonomous university of ciudad juárez ciudad juárez, chih., mexico roberto.diaz.reza@gmail.com",
40,Industry 4.0 Practices Of Turkish Companies: A Qualitative  Research,"whilst the industry 4.0 concept emerges, practices and benefits of this new digital phenomenon is still vague for many enterprises and researchers. one of the most important reasons for this vagueness is that there is no strict consensus for the definition of the industry 4.0. as the concept can be defined as digitalization of production processes, thanks to the emerging technologies day by day, industry 4.0 still may be confusing for many businesses and researchers. in the name of clarifying this vagueness, in this study, it has been aimed to investigate the practices of the industry 4.0 concept in the companies. “what kind of technologies are used for which activities in the companies under the industry 4.0 concept?” is the main question for this study. to answer this question companies which are listed as the “top 500 hundred industrial enterprises” by the i̇stanbul chamber of industry have been investigated. after reviewing annual reports of these companies, it has been detected that 30 of them are dealing with industry 4.0 concept as a strategy and/or application practice. in this study, results of this qualitative analysis will be presented to identify what kind of technological concepts are being used in the turkish companies. according to the results, artificial intelligence and the robotic applications are the most popular industry 4.0 technologies used in the reviewed companies.","industry 4.0, digitalization","In this study 30 Turkish companies which are selected from the “Top 500 hundred Industrial Enterprises” list, that has been published by İstanbul Chamber of Industry, has been reviewed to clarify what kind of Industry 4.0 technologies are used in the companies. The aim of study is to clarify the industry 4.0 applications with real life stories rather than analyzing the situation of companies. Results showed us artificial intelligence and the robotic applications are the common Industry 4.0 applications. Results that are mentioned in Section 4 should not be generalized to all Turkish companies. The possibility of not covering all the industry 4.0 aspects in the reviewed companies is the main limitation of this study, so as future research, this study may be expanded with other techniques such as interviews and questionnaires which can be conducted to the reviewed companies.

41,Recommendation System For Matching Patients And Doctors  In Telemedicine Based On Hybrid Filtering,"telemedicine is a technology that can make it easier for patients to interact with doctors through online media. the influence of the doctor on the patient in real life can occur physiologically at any time. therefore, patients must choose a suitable doctor to communicate with to get the right and appropriate health services. many previous studies have focused on patient-physician matching, but such technical implementations have not been carried out in much healthcare, especially the remote healthcare domain. currently, the selection of doctors for telemedicine depends only on the available doctor information while the number of doctors there is not small, which causes patients difficulties in choosing a doctor. the recommendation system can be helpful in providing doctor recommendations. this study created software that can provide recommendations for matching doctor patients in telemedicine using a hybrid filtering method that combines two methods, namely the collaborative filtering method using rating parameters and the content-based filtering method using the availability of content contained in the doctor's profile. the study was conducted on the get-well app. from the results of the calculation process that has been carried out, the content-based filtering method can recommend new doctors who have never treated patients and have no previous ratings, while collaborative filtering methods can recommend doctors who have a history and have had a rating from patients. after the implementation, we conducted a test of accuracy. the test was carried out using a confusion matrix with the accuracy results obtained, which was 91 %. in these results, the hybrid filtering method can help choose the right doctor according to the criteria and needs of the patient. for future research, it can use other parameters in providing recommendations, such as comments or likes and dislikes.","telemedicine, hybrid filtering","Based on the results of this study, it is stated that the content-based filtering method can recommend new doctors who have never treated patients and did not have a previous rating, while the collaborative filtering method can recommend doctors who have a history and already have ratings from patients. After implementation, the next step is to test the accuracy. The test was carried out using a confusion matrix with an accuracy of 91%. In this result, the hybrid filtering method can help choose the right doctor according to the criteria and patient needs. For further research, other parameters can be used in providing recommendations, such as comments or likes and dislikes.","yesi sofia department of informatics universitas jenderal achmad yani west java, cimahi, indonesia yessisofia18@if.unjani.ac.id faiza renaldi, irma santikarama department of information systems universitas jenderal achmad yani west java, cimahi, indonesia faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id, irma.santikarama@lecture.unjani.ac.id",
42,Improving Knowledge Of Covid-19 For Elementary School  Students Using Gamified Software,"gamification focuses on applying game mechanics to non-gaming contexts for audience participation and incorporates little fun from routine activities other than generating motivational and perceptual benefits. businesses, schools, universities, and many other types of organizations have harnessed the potential of gamification. digital health services also take advantage of emerging trends such as remote monitoring of the elderly during the covid-19 pandemic. as we read all this information, nothing is made especially for kids. this paper aims to apply gamification in covid-19 learning and measure the increase in children's knowledge, especially from 6 to 8 years. we performed two measurements; the first is an internal context measurement to test whether the system follows the original design or not. the second is on students. thirty-five students at several schools participated in the implementation and were surveyed using their automated activity logs and then conducted a seven-day monitoring survey. the results showed a significant increase in the total increase in the average score from the first experiment compared to the best experiment, namely 1.26 times in the corona jump, 2.00 times in the corona quiz, and 1.10 times in the corona labyrinth. on the other hand, we found a 28.57% decrease (10 of 35 children) in quitting the game. this condition proves that children need a lot of scenarios and content to enjoy the gamification process in the long term to achieve all abilities and need to take advantage of game mechanics skills and psychological effects.","gamification, covid-19, early education","This study proposed implementing a gamification method to improve users' knowledge of COVID-19. Providing gamified software to our users of 6-8 years old was challenging, especially on how to create interest with, in the end, improving the knowledge. The results indicate that gamification can increase the involvement of participants who interact or engage in the game and encourage those who do not have previous knowledge of COVID-19. We created three types of gamifications on COVID-19 to define COVID-19, describing its behavior, its symptoms, and how to take preventive actions. The improvement recorded was significant, as it can go as high as 2.25 times on average on the game of the corona quiz and as low as 1.04 times on the set of corona labyrinth. The corona jump and corona labyrinth were less improved than the corona quiz since the two games need more motoric involvement than the latter. Consequent to its rapid development time, this gamification also had its limitation. After conducting A 7-day monitoring survey of 35 users (children who played the game), we found a 28.57% decrease (10 children), leaving only 25 children still playing the game. This condition proves that children need a massive variety of scenarios and content for them to be able to enjoy the gamification process in the long run. For our gamification effort to reach its full potential, it is necessary to exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics on the children who will play the game. Acknowledgment We send our highest gratitude to all the students, parents, and teachers involved in this study, albeit with minimum engagement in discussions, testing, and evaluating the game due to the pandemic.","zaki tifani fauzan department of informatics faculty of science and informatics universitas jenderal achmad yani cimahi, indonesia zakitifani.fauzan@student.unjani.ac.id faiza renaldi*, irma santikarama department of information systems faculty of science and informatics universitas jenderal achmad yani cimahi, indonesia *faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id, irma.santikarama@lecture.unjani.ac.id",
43,Gamification Of Stem-Based Evaluation Software On  Online Learning For Elementary School Students,"the impact of the covid-19 virus cases continues to increase and impacts many lives, including young children. schools are closed, and students are studying from home. using online platforms is advantageous because it helps the teaching and learning process. even though it is online learning, must be evaluated students' work. similar research has occurred in vocational education but is considered boring and has not been standardized. this study combines gamified software as a practical application among lower primary students to provide interesting evaluations on stem learning, which is considered helpful for evaluation for many schools. we built the software using a 6d framework with stages of development, starting from determining business goals and describing the target's behavior until deploying the software. the evaluation period was carried out for 7 days using 30 respondents by analyzing pre- test vs. post-test and activity logs. the results individually showed significant improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, with an average of more than 20% and 13%, respectively. finally, through this study, we confirm that carefully designed gamified software for lower primary school students has helped achieve non- gaming-related goals and improved evaluation techniques for online learning.","gamified software, 6d framework, covid-19","We researched the effect of gamification on students' evaluation experience, which ultimately aimed to increase their knowledge, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We build gamified Software by carefully assessing what features should be included in the game to increase their motivation to evaluate learning, keep practicing achieving a better understanding of a subject, and raise the standard of grades in each school. The three objectives are broken down into features and measured quantitatively during the implementation phase. The results show that by adding gamification to the Software, we can achieve all the goals and increase user knowledge. The target audience is elementary school children who enjoy fun, motivation, and stimulation while doing their learning activities. The increase in knowledge individually and groups was quite significant, with an average of more than 20% and 13%, respectively. Lastly, choosing a suitable method for creating gamified Software.

44,Systematic Literature Review: Comparison Analysis  Of Online And Offline Shopping,"the development of internet users in indonesia has increased in recent years. the rapidly increasing internet users support e-commerce businesses and online shopping. online shopping is a shopping activity carried out by consumers through media or intermediaries namely social networks that have been provided by sellers, both products in the form of goods and services. this study uses the systematic literature review method. the study aims to find out there are differences in consumer decisions and consumer satisfaction in doing online and offline shopping. consumer decisions in choosing online and offline shopping have no difference because they both have balanced advantages and disadvantages. this certainly comes back to consumer preferences in choosing online shopping or offline shopping. the level of consumer satisfaction in doing offline shopping is higher compared to online shopping. this is also based on the results of previous research as a literature review for our research. keyword: online, offline shopping, electronic commerce, systematic literature review 1. introduction with the covid-19 pandemic that hit the whole world in early 2020, people cannot and are afraid to get out of the house and forced them to do almost all their activities online, including shopping. the number of internet users in the world continues to experience rapid growth that has an impact on business activities through the internet, so it is known as e-commerce (nuraini and evianah, 2019). the online business movement that occurred in indonesia began in 2010 which was marked by the existence of online transportation applications (astuty, winatha, and putri, 2020). along with the progress of the times let alone entering the industrial revolution 4.0, online shopping activities have developed very rapidly, so that shopping activities have become more practical and easier. people are more likely to be interested in doing shopping activities online because it can be done anywhere and anytime. based on the results of research from wardoyo and intan andini stated that the advantages of doing online shopping are that it can provide convenience, especially in making payments. this happens because when shopping online, the payment method that can be done is through atm or mobile banking (fauzi and sicily, 2020). basically, online and offline shopping activities have something in common, namely both doing product purchase activities. however, the thing that distinguishes is from how to buy it. online and offline shopping activities have their own advantages and disadvantages. this certainly comes back to consumer preferences (nuraini and evianah, 2019). 456",,"Online shopping or commonly referred to as e-commerce is a shopping activity carried out by consumers through media or intermediaries, namely social networks that have been provided by sellers, both products in the form of goods and services. Meanwhile, offline shopping is a shopping activity carried out by consumers directly without the presence of media or intermediaries and sellers can offer their products directly to consumers. Basically, consumer decisions in choosing online and offline shopping have no difference because they both have balanced advantages and disadvantages. This certainly comes back to consumer preferences in choosing online shopping or offline shopping. The results of our study also state that the level of consumer satisfaction in doing offline shopping is higher compared to online shopping. This is also based on the results of previous research as a literature review for our research. 7. Recommendations Online and offline shopping have their advantages and disadvantages. This of course goes back to consumer preferences about where to shop online or offline. Consumers must be wise in determining their decision to do online or offline shopping. Consumers must also be careful and continue to seek information about products and services in doing online or offline shopping. Services provided by sellers, both through online and offline have the same goal of providing consumer satisfaction. In addition, the role of digital needs to be increased again so that the level of online shopping satisfaction also increases.","haryadi sarjono; mulyono*; rafli putra aldieka; ricky septian; stevando magara. bagus anggoro management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 haryadi_s@binus.ac.id; mulyono@binus.ac.id*; raflialdieka@gmail.com; ricky.kemit@binus.ac.id; stevando.sihombing@binus.ac.id *correspondence author",

47,Integration Of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment And  Material Circularity Indicator For Circular Business: Case,"along the years, sustainability concept has been increasingly relevant to tackle the problem of fulfilling the growing human needs with limited resources. aside from it, circular economy (ce) has also been recognized as one of the initiatives to achieve sustainability. as the two concepts expand, researches that bridge both concepts and develop assessment tools keep flourishing. in this context, this research aims to suggest a framework integrating life cycle sustainability assessment (lcsa) and material circularity indicator (mci) to produce an aggregate index reflecting all aspects of triple bottom lines and circularity. moreover, this research intends to implement lcsa for circular business. literature review was done to build the framework by combining a couple existing methods. following it, a study case was conducted to implement the framework. the study case’s object was company xyz in jakarta, a company leasing silicone containers as a substitute for single use plastic food takeaway packaging. the integrated framework produced single scores for the following aspects: environment (5.231), economy (0), social (0.534), and circularity (0.392). through normalization and weighting, a final single score ranging from 0 (worst) to 1 (best) was constructed. using this index, companies can attain easier communication and more straightforward comparison for all triple bottom lines and circularity, making it more convenient to design improvements. all things considered, the framework and index are more suitable for micro scale analysis due to its data intensiveness.","circular economy, measuring tool","In this research, LCSA was implemented in circular business while adapting it to a more circular setting by integrating it with MCI, adjusting the LCA with material circularity, as well as replacing the conventional LCC that has not yet considered circular strategies with the CE-LCC. The assessment of the other two sustainability pillars, environment and social, was carried out using the standardized LCA ISO 14040 and S-LCA by UNEP/SETAC 2020 with the RS S-LCIA impact assessment method. Through data processing and analysis, four single scores from each assessment were obtained. In addition, these four scores were then normalized and weighted to generate a single aggregated score (final single score) that reflects the sustainability and circularity performance in the range of 0 (not sustainable and circular) to 1 (very sustainable and circular). The object of study case in this research is Company XYZ in Jakarta, Indonesia that leases silicone container as a substitute for single-use takeaway plastic container used by the partner merchants. Company XYZ mainly implement the reuse strategy in its business by picking up the silicone container after being used by customers to be washed and used again by another customers. According to the conducted LCA, Company XYZ scored 5.231 point in environmental aspect (ReCiPe single score). CE-LCC calculation showed a total cost of IDR1,594,310.60 per container during its assumed 3 years lifespan. On the other hand, Company XYZ scored 0.534 on social assessment and 0.392 in circularity assessment done with MCI. Through normalization and weighting, each aspect’s score was normalized to: 0.025 for environment aspect, 0 for economic aspect, 0.534 for social aspect, and 0.392 for circularity. The final single score of 0.231 was also acquired, which means that Company XYZ still relatively far from being sustainable. This is due to the fact that Company XYZ has just been established, meaning that Company XYZ is still at its very early stage and has a huge room for improvements, either in increasing the number of customers or partner merchants across Jakarta or even Indonesia. There are some limitations occurred in this research that might be considered for improvements of upcoming researches. The first limitation is related to the availability of environmental impact database and threshold, which in this research is needed during the normalization step. The second limitation is related to study case’s object’s scale and industry. This LCSA and aggregate indicator are more suitable for micro-scale analysis due to the data intensiveness and relatively time consuming. It is also more preferable to have a manufacturing industry as the study case object rather than a service industry because the assessment frameworks under LCSA are mostly more suitable for manufacturing industry. Other suggestions are compiling preceding LCA results and building a database to simplify impact comparison and compliance, also polishing the normalization and weighting method (for environment and economic aspect which have no constant threshold) to be easier and more straightforward.","study of company xyz jakarta brigitta ancelina, amelia santoso*, and joniarto parung industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas surabaya surabaya, indonesia s160318007@student.ubaya.ac.id, amelia@staff.ubaya.ac.id, and jparung@staff.ubaya.ac.id",

54,Quality Control Analysis Of Conveyor Production In Curing  Machine With Statistical Process Control,"a transmission belt manufacturer in indonesia, producing v-belts and conveyor belts. many faults remain in the conveyor belt manufacturing process, causing product quality to deteriorate. bubbles in the canvas cover are responsible for more than half of all faults. as a result, a quality control process is required to ensure that the finished product meets consumer expectations. the percentage of defective goods in total production and the percentage of the main contributors to defects are determined using p control chart approach and pareto diagram. fishbone diagrams are used to investigate the sources of faults and prioritize the adjustments that need to be done. the findings revealed that faults in conveyor production are caused by human factors, machinery, and techniques. this study proposes that quality control be used to improve the quality of conveyor products by identifying the major contributors to defects and their causes.","quality control, conveyor belt, defective products","Chart p shows that the conveyor production process in the curing machine is out of control for the proportion between the number of defects and the amount of production, based on the results of data processing using a control. There were eight types of flaws in the conveyor belt production process in the curing machine from January to July 2019, namely: bare (A), bubble Canvas-Canvas (B), Bubble Cover – Cover, and Bubble Cover – Cover (C). Canvas (G), Marking Defect (M), Porosity (S), Ply Embossed on Cover Surface (R), and Foreign Body Defect are all examples of bubble covers (X). The bubble cover canvas is the most prevalent sort of product defect. The Fishbone Diagram and the 5 M methodology are used in product defect analysis to examine the factors that cause the most problems by examining five elements: person, machine, method, material, and environment. However, only human, machine, and method elements are important to this challenge. Improvement suggestions can be made, for example, in terms of human factors, such as giving instructions to maintain stabbing the green belt on the provided base so that the green belt can be punctured optimally. It is standard procedure to do maintenance on the machine or tool factor, such as sharpening the awl once a week in order to pierce the green belt. The procedure entails increasing the number of punctures while maintaining a 2 cm spacing between them and flattening the punctures to reduce the amount of air trapped in the conveyor belt.","arinda soraya putri, rifa ari setyawan, nadiea aurealnisa syazili industrial engineering department faculty of engineering universitas muhammadiyah surakarta jl. ahmad yani tromol pos 1, surakarta, indonesia asp835@ums.ac.id, d600160108@student.ums.ac.id, d600170025@student.ums.ac.id",
55,Habit Tracker Gamification Software Development In  Community–Based Daily Personal Hygiene Using Octalysis,"personal hygiene is crucial for each human being as they have their way of maintaining them daily. while one person can maintain their hygiene, they are still prone to diseases that others can spread. performing daily hygiene is mostly about habit. habit is a settled or regular tendency or practice, especially one that is hard to give up. to change from one habit to another, we need a constant reminder. the development of information technology provides a more convenient way to do reminder activities. apps such as habit tracker, sure wash, and epic to-do list are available freely in google play store and apple appstore. although many gamified reminder applications exist, most of them only work on one individual. while for daily hygiene, the problem is not only the individual habits but also the society. this study improved the awareness of personal hygiene by building gamification software. we use the octa lysis framework to analyze and design the software, using three levels: data collection, calculation, and analysis from 47 respondents using the octa lysis 8 core drive measurement. the evaluation period was carried out for 14 days using 30 respondents by analyzing pre-test vs. post-test using hmsam. finally, this study showed a significant increase in changes in daily personal hygiene with an average of 82%, which concluded that a mobile application equipped with a reminder feature for particular groups could trigger other people to do the same.","gamified software, daily hygiene, habit tracker, community–based","We researched gamification's effect on users' daily personal hygiene, especially in a community, which ultimately saw the impact of using this software. We make daily hygiene gamified software carefully incorporating what game elements are included in a game to increase their motivation to do daily personal hygiene and keep practicing maintaining better daily personal hygiene. The results show that by adding gamified elements into the non-gamified context in the software, we can achieve all the goals set and which ultimately have an impact or impact on the daily personal hygiene of a person in a group. Target users aged 15 – 65 who can engage in fun daily personal hygiene activities while doing them. The increase in daily personal hygiene, individually and in groups, was quite significant, with an average of almost 82%, and concluded that a mobile application with a reminder feature for groups could trigger other people to do the same. Group discussions have a positive impact on bringing users to a better understanding of daily personal hygiene. Lastly, choosing the correct method for creating gamified software daily hygiene is also very important. This study chose the Octalysis framework developed by Yu-kai–Chou, which divides several game elements into eight core drives that must be considered when creating gamified software.","framework azwar tri endrayadi, rezki yuniarti department of informatics universitas jenderal achmad yani cimahi, indonesia azwartriendrayadi18@if.unjani.ac.id, rezki.yuniarti@lecture.unjani.ac.id faiza renaldi* department of information systems universitas jenderal achmad yani cimahi, indonesia *faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id",
56,The Impact Of Covid-19 Pandemic On E-Commerce Firms:  Data Mining For The Provinces In Indonesia,"the covid-19 pandemic has brought an impact on the global retail industry. some studies have investigated e- commerce during the pandemic. however, most of them focused on consumer behavior in online shopping. this paper focuses on e-commerce firms, as an aggregate, among regions. this study departs from a question: what we can learn from the e-commerce firms in regions during the pandemic. the objectives of this study are: (1) to classify the intensity of e-commerce firms in a region and to specify the regional and e-commerce profiles, (2) to classify the intensity of pandemic impact on e-commerce firms and to specify the regional and e-commerce profiles, and (3) to specify the observed association between the characteristics of e-commerce, pandemic impact, and region profiles of e-commerce firms with high intensity and high pandemic impact. this quantitative and secondary research collected data from the indonesian official statistics and google mobility report. data mining was implemented with the knime analytics platform. the analysis classifies provinces with high and low e-commerce intensity and high and low pandemic impact and specifies the regional and e-commerce profiles regarding those classifications. this article contributes to the literature by presenting data mining using the official statistics among regions at a country level on e-commerce during the covid-19 pandemic. more facilitation for regions with low e-commerce intensity is suggested. for example, local governments and marketplace companies could support firms entering online sales channels.","e-commerce, online retail, data mining, covid-19","This study has implemented a data mining approach for official statistics about e-commerce firms among Indonesia provinces during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis reveals that a region with high e-commerce intensity has a high population density and inhabitants with IT skills. Those e-commerce firms use the marketplace more than low e- commerce intensity as a sales channel. Furthermore, the finding shows the pandemic impact of e-commerce firms in all provinces regardless of regional and e-commerce profiles. This article adds to the literature by presenting data mining using the official statistics among regions at a country level on the topic of e-commerce during the pandemic. Furthermore, the data-driven analysis implemented in this study reveals an empirical association between variables based on the available secondary data. However, the generalization of the finding is limited to e-commerce firms in Indonesian provinces. Further study in other countries could generalize the finding. In addition, as the unit of analysis is e-commerce firms as an aggregate number in a region, the behavior of any single firm responding to the pandemic could not be identified. Motivated by the economic impact of e-commerce activities, this study suggests more facilitation for regions with low e-commerce intensity. For example, local governments and marketplace companies could support MSMEs entering online sales channels through training about e-commerce, product quality, production process, and management. In addition, the improvement in Internet access and ICT skills among residents, as this study found, could become a priority program for the local governments. 535","gunawan lecturer, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia gunawan@staff.ubaya.ac.id","References

62,Feasibility Study On Improvement Of Investment Lithium  Batteries By Considering Depreciation And Income Tax,"a lithium battery is a very lightweight battery but has better storage capacity and longer endurance than conventional batteries. developing lithium batteries for motorcycles requires a business feasibility analysis to replace a motorcycle with lithium batteries. lithium batteries are lightweight, environmentally friendly and safer than other types of batteries. this article is an improvement from kurniyati et al. (2016), which discusses the feasibility of investing in the lithium battery business for motorcycles. previous articles have not considered taxes and interest rates inflation. therefore, improvements are needed to produce a better outcome. in this article, a feasibility analysis of investing in the lithium battery business using the npv (net present value), pp (payback period), irr (internal rate of return) method with a marr value of 7.5% and a time horizon of 8 years. in addition, this article also considers the tax rate and interest rate inflation. based on the calculations, the npv value > 0 is idr 198,366,208.00, the pp value is 14 years, four months longer than the eight-year time horizon, and the irr < marr is 12%. therefore, investment in the lithium battery business for motorcycles is not feasible and contradicts the research of kurniyati et al. (2016), which has not considered income tax and inflation interest rates. then, all values can meet the feasibility test aspect when the initial selling price increases by 5%.","lithium battery, income tax, depreciation","Based on the analysis in this study, the conclusion obtained is that the economic efficiency applied for shows that the investment in the feasibility of the lithium battery is not economically feasible. Even though the NPV value of this investment is IDR 198,366,208.00 or NPV >0, the PP value analysis is 14.4 years or PP > n (8 years). In addition, the IRR value (4%) is lower than the MARR value (12%). This research contradicts previous research (Kurniyati, 2016), which indicates that this investment is feasible. The difference in research results is due to several considerations not being reviewed, such as income tax, depreciation, and price changes in previous studies. Then, all values can meet the feasibility test aspect when the initial selling price increases by 5%. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that currently investments that receive depreciation and income tax schemes are considered less feasible if the price used in the case study still refers to the research of Kurniyati et al (2016). As time goes by, every year the country will experience increasing inflation. For sure this will affect the investment value of a business.

64,Lean Manufacturing Approach Using Smed Method And  Value Stream Mapping On The Spring Beds Production Floor,"p.t. alpha jaya manunggal mandiri is a manufacturing company enganged in the furniture sector. in the spring bed production line, the time required to produce one spring bed requires a long machine set-up time and has many non-value- added operations. the first step is to minimize the spring bed production time and the distance of spring bed production by doing a waste analysis on the spring bed production process to identify the non-value activity and then remove that process. after that, create a new alternative layout with the s.l.p. method. the new alternative layout was created using process activity mapping to compare spring bed production time and distance from the old layout and the new alternative layout. then, the set-up time on spring bed production is reduced by implementing a single smed method. then the last step is creating current value stream mapping and future value stream mapping. then comparing the efficiency of current value stream mapping and future value stream mapping. from implementing smed, removing the non-value-added activity, and implementing the new layout of spring bed production. with this implementation, the set-up time and the spring bed production process were reduced, reducing the set-up time on the spring bed production process and increasing the efficiency of value stream mapping.","smed, waste analysis","From the waste analysis that has been done, there is 5 non-value-added activity in the spring beds production process. The non-value-added activity then will be eliminated to reduce spring bed production time. Then the new alternative layout was created by using Systematic Layout Planning (S.L.P.) Method. The new alternative layout has been made in 2 forms: alternative layout 1 and layout 2. From the alternative layout, the distance and operation time were decreased. The total activity of the process activity mapping for the alternative layout 1 and alternative layout 2 decreased from 41 activities to 36 activities which decreased by 12.2%. The total operation time of the old layout was 9410 seconds by implementing waste analysis and creating the new layout. The total operation time was reduced. The total operation time for alternative layout 1 is 8704 seconds and the total operation time for alternative layout 2 is 8568 seconds. The total distance of the old layout was 85 meters by implementing waste analysis and creating a new layout. The total distance was decreased. The total distance for alternative layout 1 is 44.5 meters and the total distance for alternative layout 2 is 36.75 meters. From the process activity mapping, the alternative layout 2 has the least total operation time of 8568 seconds, which decreased the total operation time by 8.95% and had the least distance of 36.75 meters, which reduced the distance of the spring beds production process by 56.77%. So alternative layout 2 was chosen to become the new layout for P.T. Alpha Jaya Manunggal Mandiri. Before implementing SMED, the set-up activity total time was 710 seconds. Then after the implementation of SMED, there is some activity converted into an external activity, such as taking the raw material from the raw material storage, etc. By converting some internal activities to external activities, the set-up time for the spring beds production process was reduced by 165 seconds, decreasing the set-up time by 23.23%.

65,Decision Support System Model To Support The Selection Of  The Best Supplier For Small Medium Enterprise Supply,"one important component that supports the performance of production smes is supply chain management because supply chain management or scm integrates the raw material procurement process to the sales process. one of the important parts of scm for the procurement of raw materials for sme production is determining the best supplier who can provide raw materials with several predetermined criteria such as competitive prices, quality products and others. however, the selection of suppliers who provide raw materials for smes is currently still done manually, resulting in inappropriate supplier selection decisions. on the other hand, a decision support system or dss is a computer-based system built to assist the decision-making process by considering criteria and alternatives. thus, the 627",,"Supplier selection for SMEs is an important process because the best suppliers will provide the best services for SMEs. The best service from suppliers will affect the effectiveness and efficiency of the SME supply chain and will ultimately affect the overall performance of SMEs. Thus, the adoption of DSS for supplier selection is very helpful for SMEs to choose suppliers based on the criteria determined by SMEs. The request analyzer which is part of the proposed model increases the flexibility of the DSS to be able to offer analysis capabilities of the existing problem. Likewise, the mechanism selector feature enhances the functionality of the DSS which supports several selection methods that can be used by SMEs","chain management inayatulloh information systems department school of information system bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480, inay@ binus.ac.id computer science department, binus graduate, program doctor of computer science bina nusantara university jakarta west jakarta indonesia inay@ binus.ac.id harjanto prabowo computer science department, binus graduate, program doctor of computer science bina nusantara university jakarta west jakarta indonesia harprabowo@binus.edu harco leslie hendric spits warnars computer science department, binus graduate, program doctor of computer science bina nusantara university jakarta west jakarta indonesia spits.hendric@binus.ac.id togar alam napitupulu computer science department, binus graduate, program doctor of computer science bina nusantara university jakarta west jakarta indonesia tnapitupulu@binus.edu",

69,Life Cycle Assessment Using Supply Chain Strategy On Palm  Oil Agro-Industry,"this case study was conducted in the indonesian government's palm oil agro-industry. this company shows that pollution from exhaust emissions is the most pollution data during the palm oil processing process. this study aims to determine how much environmental impact is caused and strategies to minimize environmental impacts in the supply chain in the oil palm agro-industry. the problem-solving approach is carried out by identifying supply chain strategies ranging from oil palm plantations to crude palm oil (cpo) using the scor model and life cycle assessment methods. furthermore, the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in the palm oil agro-industry is carried out using the environmental impact analysis method. the results of this study indicate that the analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in the palm oil agro-industry involves the plantation process unit is 62 kg co2-eq/ton cpo, the distribution process unit is 1069 kg co2-eq/ton cpo and the cpo production process unit is 49 kg co2-eq/ton cpo. the most significant emission occurs in the distribution process unit in the supply chain strategy in the palm oil agro-industry. the implication of this study is to provide a solution to overcome the problem by recommending the efficient use of trucks and the transportation distance from the plantation to the factory. in the palm oil agro-industry, it is better to use trucks with a larger capacity so that later this can reduce the number of trucks and reduce truck fuel used in transportation activities.",,"The oil palm agro-industry research was successful in defining the supply chain strategy of the oil palm plantation agro-industry from planting to becoming CPO. This study also discusses the impact of environmental emissions on the environment of the company. Pollution in the form of the highest greenhouse gas emissions in the distribution, with a value of 1069 Kg CO2-Eq/ton CPO (90.56 percent), has an environmental impact. This is due to an imbalance between the amount of FFB to be transported from the plantation and the truck capacity. The development of a life cycle assessment (LCA) scenario is the solution for reducing potential CO2 greenhouse emissions and enhancing energy efficiency. Recommendations to minimize emissions are implemented by enhancing the efficiency of truck use and transportation distances from the plantation to the factory. The purpose of this research is to provide recommendations for difficulties. To obtain changes that occur, it is preferable to create a recommended modification with the application of simulation results for further investigation. It will then be able to identify more effective approaches to enhance business productivity.","fitra lestari, naufal abdurrahman hawari, and raka maureka industrial engineering department uin sultan syarif kasim riau, indonesia fitra.lestari@uin-suska.ac.id; naufalabdurrahmanh@ymail.com; maurekaraka@gmail.com susmardi masti casoni chemical engineering department muhammadiyah riau university riau, indonesia smcasoni@gmail.com",

73,Is The Mastery Of Work Enough? A View Of Public Service  Sectors In Greater Jakarta,"public service sectors require professional and innovative public officers to support economic growth. multiple regression is used in this study to examine the research hypotheses of knowledge-intensive public services in the indonesian development department in greater jakarta. the empirical findings demonstrate that knowledge development and pro-social behaviour are significantly associated with knowledge-intensive public services. while training and development are essential tools for improving public sector officers' knowledge, when knowledge development and pro-social behaviour are combined, they can have a greater significant impact in developing knowledge-intensive public services. furthermore, the research revealed that knowledge development alone is insufficient to ensure qualified public service officers in the public sector. in conclusion, a more significant impact on knowledge-intensive public services can be achieved when knowledge development is combined with pro-social behaviour.","public sector, knowledge, training, development","Knowledge development in public sector companies will help ensure that civil service personnel can provide these services with a holistic perspective. Knowledge development should aim to address the development challenges of knowledge-intensive public sector organizations with various knowledge assisting in knowledge-based activities. The knowledge acquired in knowledge development must be strategically aligned, crossing the strategic vision with competencies and activities with critical knowledge. Therefore, it is imperative to use knowledge based on different criteria, transform strategic and essential knowledge, and transfer it to learning. Pro-social behavior is unstructured employee behavior that is not job-specific, is not contractually regulated, and benefits the organization. It requires employees to carry out their responsibilities out of a desire to assist their colleagues and the business, not for personal gain. It assists organizations in the public sector that rely heavily on knowledge. 704","maria grace herlina* dicky hida syahchari senior lecturer, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 *corresponding author: herlina01@binus.edu dicky.syahchari@binus.edu michael aaron tuori senior lecturer, international business management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 mtuori@binus.edu","References

74,"Relationship Between Kaizen, Employees Work And  Quality Of Service","hospital management must improve their performance and services, especially during the covid-19 pandemic. one way that might be done is by implementing kaizen. this study tries to see the effect of the application of kaizen on improving the quality of work and overall service in indonesian hospitals. from this research, it can be identified the factors that drive and inhibit the success of kaizen implementation in hospitals. in this study, the kaizen aspect is viewed from 4 variables, namely company policies and awareness; education and training; work culture; and internal training. data was collected by distributing questionnaires to 150 employees in 2 hospitals in south jakarta-indonesia, using a random sample, consisting of executives, managers, and hospital employees. statistical analysis using pls- sem (second generation sem approach) yielded more significant results. the findings of the study indicate that the application of kaizen affects the overall improvement of work and the quality of hospital services through the intermediate variables of employee work. thus, the increase in employee work is a strong predictor of the overall increase in employment and services in hospitals. one of the interesting findings shows that culture is a leverage that drives the success of kaizen implementation, especially employee commitment to continuously improve work systems and when employees believe what they are doing will add and build company value. internal processes are an important factor that needs to be improved so that the implementation of kaizen is successful, especially regarding working in teams and being process oriented.","kaizen, hospital, employees work, service quality",,"a pls-sem approach linda theresia, ni made sudri, yasmin mauliddina, besta rahmasari industrial engineering department, institut teknologi indonesia indonesia tarlind@yahoo.com ; sudrimade@yahoo.co.id ; yasmin.mauliddina@gmail.com correspondent author: linda theresia (+62)81510559729","References

The calculated values are considered feasible because they have met the proposed indicator limits. This result is slightly different from the article Asyifa & Sutopo, (2017) because this article considers data and information that is more holistic and accurate. The choice of the depreciation method based on a combination of the straight-line method and the DL method can result in a significant depreciation amount being charged at the beginning of the investment. Meanwhile, the tax used is 1% of gross income following the provisions of Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 23 of 2018. In addition, price change and sensitivity analysis are also considered in this article. 2. Calculation of the relationship between capital investment, annual cost, and MARR to the interest percentage product is considered in this article. The value of the painted product is susceptible to the annual cost and MARR. Adding the percentage value of interest to the annual cost causes the business unit to suffer losses because the annual cost is higher. In line with the annual cost, the MARR value also suffers the same fate, experiencing a decrease in income if the interest rate increases.","price changes cita tri cahaya sakti1, danendra dimas aryasatya1, desyana ratna pinasthi1, evelyn nathania1, imam sya'roni2 1undergraduate of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering 2graduate of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia cita.sakti@student.uns.ac.id, danendradani@student.uns.ac.id, desyanartn02@student.uns.ac.id, nathania275@student.uns.ac.id, imamsyaroni114@student. uns.ac.id muhammad hisjam1 wahyudi sutopo2 1.2industrial engineering research group and economic technology 1.2department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering 2center for excellence in electrical energy storage technology sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia hisjam@staff.uns.ac .id, wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id",

77,"Problems And Solutions, Quality Management Systems In  Startups Business","startup business success stories, especially in the creative industry, currently dominate businesses in the world, including in indonesia. start-up businesses are expected to develop and master various lines of business, which change human civilization and habits, especially in the use of digital technology. this study aims to see how the implementation of quality management by startup businesses, the constraints, and solutions are carried out. the research was conducted on mses based on creative industries, especially food. the startup business studied is in the bootstrapping stage, where the business is still run by the nuclear family and there is no capital investment. the research method is a survey, on a startup business that is developing in west java, indonesia. the data shows that smes experience problems in the quality management system, especially looking for forms of quality planning and control, collaboration is still low both from upstream and downstream which results in low product and service quality. start-up businesses will develop well if they use digital marketing as a marketing base and collaborate with suppliers and distributors who have reliability in product quality and distribution.","startup business, quality management, sqc","of the results of the interview: (1) ASS management understands and believes that quality must be number one in business management, they are very understanding when consumer disappointment occurs both from the service aspect (late delivery of the product) and from the product aspect (stale product) causing losses from the financial aspect directly and also Consumers don't make purchases anymore. (2) ASS management is very aware that promotions must be accurate and more careful, because based on the records of many consumers, they compare the products received with the images provided in online media. ASS management's understanding of the principles of quality management, based on the results of interviews and observations, is as follows: (1) The principles of the first quality management system related to focus on consumers have been well implemented by ASS, some of the activities that lead to this are, always replacing goods when consumers give complaints, goods until more than 24 hours, ASS will replace with new goods the next day. (2) Partial continuous improvement was carried out, especially in the use of raw materials, but in the distribution process, there were still obstacles due to cooperation with third parties. (3) Leaders from ASS have not maximally concentrated on the quality management process, because they are still focusing on sales targets, promotions, and branding. ASS management apart from being a leader also acts as a sales force that is in continuous contact with consumers every day. 749","ayi tejaningrum senior lecturer, school of economic and management stie ekuitas, bandung indonesia ayi.tejaningrum@ekuitas.ac.id","References

78,Improving The Quality Of Electric Bicycle Production During  The Covid-19 Pandemic Using The Fmea Method,"in march 2020, who declared the coronavirus (covid-19) a new world pandemic. different countries have implemented different strategies to control the impact of the pandemic. for example, france and germany implemented relatively strict lockdown policies and empowered people to work. in addition, public transport is advised to keep passenger levels low and avoid overcrowding, while people over the age of 70 are encouraged to abstain from public transport altogether. as a result, the use of bicycles as an active mode of transportation has increased and this mode is highlighted to overcome problems related to social distancing in the transportation domain. this is what underlies the bicycle industry to increase productivity and improve quality during the pandemic. this research is focused on analyzing the quality improvement of the electric bicycle production process using the fmea method. this fmea method is based on a simple dmaic problem solving methodology, namely: define (formulate), measure (measure), analyze (analyze), improve (improve) and control (control), which combines several statistical tools and other process improvements. the steps carried out using the fmea method are identifying several types of problems, determining the severity rating value, occurrence rating value, detection value, and calculating the risk priority number (rpn). after obtaining the rpn value from the fmea method, then an analysis is carried out in determining the priority of problems in the bicycle production process. the result of the research is that there are three processes that must be prioritized.","bike, dmaic, fmea","Based on the results of observations and observations that have been made, several conclusions have been obtained, namely that in the bicycle industry during the Covid-19 period there was a significant increase in production, namely with brands such as Polygon, United, Pacific, and Element, which increased from 60% to 80% by reaching more than 8-9 million units, both for bicycles for adults and children. From January to May, the company had an average request of 22056 and the number of complaints was 23. After the company experienced the impact of the pandemic, from June to October the average demand was 44045, a significant increase of 99.7% and the number of complaints was 73, which increased by 218. %. And from the results of the FMEA analysis that has been done, it can be concluded that the RPN value contained in the welding & press process shows varying results. In the wheel station process, it ranks first with the highest RPN, which is 128. For the Accessories station process, it is in the second rank, which is 112. The third rank is occupied by the shifter station process with a value of 80. It can be seen that these 3 processes are the main problems that must be prioritized in order to reduce the number of defects and improve the quality of the bicycle production process.","yulizan rizki s.t. master of industrial engineering student, faculty of engineering universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia 55320110028@student.mercubuana.ac.id sawarni hasibuan master of industrial engineering program, faculty of engineering universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia corresponding author: sawarni@mercubuana.ac.id",
79,Lean Six Sigma As A Strategy For Increasing Knitting  Manufacturing Profitability Through Fabric Quality And,"recently, global cotton prices have increased by 107.15% in the last two years, and the demand for fabrics has decreased, having a significant impact on the company's profitability by 15%. this research was conducted at a manufacturing company specializing in knitting fabrics made from polyester, tetron cotton, and chief value cotton. during observation, it was found that the company's expectations regarding the good quality of the fabrics produced were different from the reality that almost 75% of the fabrics produced had to go through the repair/rework stage due to defects. the purpose of this study is to prepare a strategy for companies to increase profitability during a crisis in company profitability. this research focuses on the production area, from the raw material preparation process in the warehouse, the knitting process, the quality checking process, and the storage process in the warehouse. one month of production data was utilized in the study. this research begins by observing the production process, interviewing employees, and collecting daily production data and waste identification using waq and a wrm. the problem- solving process uses the dmaic method, starting by defining the problem and measuring the capability of the production process. wrm and waq are used to analyze the type of waste, and the root of the problem is analyzed with a fishbone diagram. the results of this study indicate that the most common types of defects are holes in the fabric, broken threads, and broken needles that cause other waste in the production process. the root of the problem is that there are no qc procedures for raw materials, machine operating procedures, or periodic inspection procedures. the proposed improvement to overcome this problem is to conduct qc inspections on incoming raw materials and make a periodic machine inspection procedure. from the validation process for the proposed improvements, it shows that lead time was reduced by 15.13%, efficiency increased by 11.23%, and profitability by 6.17%.","lean six sigma, waste, defects, profitability","In the production process, quality inspection is needed for every raw material that comes from suppliers to evaluate supplier performance as part of the supply chain of the textile industry. No quality inspection process on raw materials results in receiving raw materials with poor quality so that defects in fabrics are a consequence of this. Defects as one of the main problems in this case are the main triggers in causing other waste such as waste of waiting, waste of overprocessing, and waste of overproduction. The result of these defects and waste is reduced work efficiency, increased manufacturing lead time, and increased costs. Based on the validation results on the proposed improvement, an increase in efficiency of 11.23%, a reduction in manufacturing lead time by 15.13%, a reduction in production costs by 6.17%, and an increase in company profitability by 6.17%. This research limitation is about the time to research and the observation process is one month, so a study with a longer time span is needed so that the production data and defects obtained are more and the short observation time has the potential to be influenced by other factors such as the amount of seasonal fabric demand, pandemics, and so on. This research also doesn’t emphasize the company’s readiness for implementing lean green six sigma to maintain company’s sustainability. In the next research, an assessment of lean green six sigma readiness is needed, and the observation data must be longer to prevent some factors like seasonal demands that lead the research into bias conclusions.

82,"Production Planning, Inventory And Capacity In  Pt. Wdy And Erp Simulation Open Source","production planning is an important activity in the company, production planning at pt. wdy experienced several problems, namely the company tended to use intuition or experience in determining lot sizes and sometimes ordered only as needed. this has resulted in several problems such as increased costs, shortage of raw materials, etc. therefore, it is necessary to improve the lot determination process. the improvement process starts with forecasting, where the forecasting method chosen based on the smallest error rate of 19.46% is the winter method. then proceed with the manufacture of mps, checking capacity using the gross capacity method, calculating the number of lots and calculating the capacity of each machine. the results of the calculation of factory capacity show that the factory capacity is larger so that mps can be implemented. the method of calculating the number of lots selected is the wagner within the method with a cost reduction of 14.24%. in the calculation of machine capacity, it is found that each machine has a capacity greater than what is needed, which means that each machine can meet consumer demand keyword production planning, forecasting, capacity planning, mps 1. introduction pt. wdy is a manufacturing company engaged in printing, this company produces snack food packaging. the main product produced is in the form of box-shaped snack packaging. not only snack packaging but also various other product packaging, such as instant noodle packaging, canned drinks, and mosquito coil packaging. pt. wdy produces tens of thousands of packages in one day from various orders, seeing many orders, the production process carried out by the company requires sophisticated and modern machines and tools (manahan, 2012). the method of planning and quality control must also be precise, so that it can fulfill a high customer order based on information from discussions with the production staff of pt. wdy is known that the company in determining the lot size of raw materials has not used the right method. generally, companies use intuition or experience and order according to consumer demand. the absence of the right and optimal method and ordering only based on consumer demand, causes companies to have to order raw materials repeatedly (kusuma, 2009). of course, this will cause ordering costs to rise. in addition, the company also often experiences delays in receiving raw materials and shortages of raw materials so that the production process is disrupted. the company also informed that the procurement of raw materials also accounts for 65% of the company's total costs. therefore, the company needs a proposed improvement design for the new lot sizing method which is expected to help the company overcome the problems that occur. thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the right lot sizing method for each material that will be used to make the product, 792",,"Based on the research that has been done, several conclusions can be drawn. The following are some conclusions that can be drawn. a. Forecasting is an important first step in production planning. The right forecast in this study based on the smallest error is forecasting with the winter method with alpha 0.9 which has an error rate of 19.48% MAPE, 87576.90 MAD, and 11225900000.00 MSE. b. The comparison of factory capacity and required capacity using the RCCP method states that the total required capacity of 446.58 hours can be fulfilled by the factory of 131152 hours. c. The method of determining the right number of lots used by the factory is the Wagner Within method with a cost reduction percentage of 47.5%, a percentage decrease in ordering frequency by 10%, and a decrease in the amount of inventory by 75.8%. d. The calculation of the capacity of each machine using the CRP method shows that the time it takes for each machine to produce consumer demand can be met. The need for 4546 hours on the cutting machine can be met with a capacity of 16960 hours, the need for 5891 hours on the printing machine can be met with a capacity of 57701 hours, the need for 10340 hours on the coating machine can be met with a capacity of 19843 hours, the need for 7432 hours on the ponding machine can be met with a capacity of 25446 hours and the need for 2136 hours on the glue machine can be met with a capacity of 11200 hours. e.

83,Lean Maintenance Implementation To Analyze Overlock  Machine Maintenance At Pt Xyz,"maintenance of company facilities or machines has an important role in supporting work productivity within the company to achieve the production targets that have been set. results based on the research conducted, it can be seen that pt. xyz has problems with the current maintenance system. the problem that still occurs is that there is still waste in its maintenance activities. pt. xyz is a company engaged in the garment sector and has been established in 2003. the products produced by pt. xyz, namely, polo shirts, t-shirts, sweaters, shirts, field service clothes (pdl) and jerseys. one of the damages is the overlock machine which has a downtime per year from january 2020 to december 2020, which is 11944 minutes. the data is carried out using maintenance value stream mapping (mvsm) to trace the causes of waste in maintenance activities which will then be deepened with root cause analysis (rca), which uses five-whys analysis and fishbone diagrams to recommend improvements in these wasteful efforts. based on the recommendations for improvement, the maintenance efficiency of the servo motor component has increased from 36.36% to 42.90%, while the looper component has increased maintenance efficiency from 24.27% to 32%.","lean maintenance, five-whys","Based on the waste identification carried out for the component with the highest downtime, there were 4 types of waste found in the maintenance process of PT. XYZ is waste process, motion, waiting and defects. In the identification of waste carried out on components with the highest downtime, it was found 5 factors causing waste contained in the maintenance process of PT. XYZ. These factors include man, method, machine, material, environment. The results of the comparison between the maintenance efficiency of the current state map and the future state map that have been carried out by eliminating delays in the maintenance process, show that the value of the maintenance efficiency of the servo motor component increased by 7% with an efficiency value of 7%. previously by 36% to 43% while for the looper component it increased by 8% with the previous efficiency value of 24% to 32%. The suggestions for improvement recommended by the author are the application of 5s, the proposed digitization of the maintenance system, the proposed training/training plan for technicians and the proposal for making a checklist on maintenance activities. Some of these proposals are expected to help companies improve the effectiveness of overlock machine maintenance.","hadi wilianto, lina gozali, adianto industrial engineering department faculty of engineering tarumanagara university jakarta, indonesia hadi.545180004@stu.untar.ac.id, linag@ft.untar.ac.id, adianto@ft.untar.ac.id",

86,Monitoring Working Hours Of Nurses At Azra Hospital  Using Smartphone Based Geofencing,"position of nurses in hospitals has a vital role in providing medical services to patients. still, these nurses often cannot offer high-quality work due to the enormous workload, and this is in line with previous research that conducted questionnaires on 364 nurses who stated that most nurses had 2.875 working hours/week excess. because of these problems, in this study, a geofencing system was created which is used to monitor the presence of nurses in hospitals using the pull service technique so that nurses get the feature to be able to turn on geofence when starting work and entering the hospital, and also turning off geofence when finished working and leaving the hospital. geofencing in this study is set at a radius of 200m or equivalent to the area of azra hospital, which is 20,323m2. based on the geofencing accuracy test, the system can produce native real-time positioning with an error rate of 1.4 to 3.7 m and has a time delay of 4.45 to 15.30 seconds for user position switching, depending on the device used.","geofencing, gps, nurse, monitoring system","This study's working hours monitoring system consists of several components, namely Android smartphones, and GPS. The function of this system is simple. Namely, the system will access the GPS on the smartphone user to get the user's location and automate the user so that they can ""Clock in"" and ""Clock out"" within the limits of the hospital area. This monitoring system is expected to be an option that makes it easier to replace the manual attendance method that still exists on the running system. The system can calculate the adequate time of nurses in the hospital area from the implementation results. Based on geofencing performance testing, the system can produce real-time positioning with an error rate of 1.4 to 3.7 m and has a delay of 4.45 to 15.30 seconds of user positioning, depending on the device used. Expectations for research are to develop this application for other operating systems besides Android, such as Blackberry and Ios. Besides that, it is also hoped that future research can track the presence of nurses in hospitals so that they can record nurse activities automatically.","anesa noor aulia putri, asep id hadiana department of informatics universitas jenderal achmad yani west java, cimahi, indonesia aneesanoorap18@if.unjani.ac.id, asep.hadiana@lecture.unjani.ac.id sigit anggoro, faiza renaldi universitas jenderal achmad yani west java, cimahi, indonesia sigit.anggoro@lecture.unjani.ac.id, faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id",

The use of Grid search CV to find the best parameter works very well and should be doing for the future project to compare. Seeing the predicted sentiment class give 54% positive sentiment on review dataset and the word that most occur show in table 3 mean that most of the customer used Gojek app are satisfying with the performance of Gojek app and its feature such as Go Ride, Go food Delivery systems, Gopay and the services from the driver. Performance and quality services are an important elements of standards achievement that must be met, by achieving the standards that have been set mean that the company has performing well and vice versa (Kasmir, 2016). Improving the quality services cannot be separated from 5 dimension of service quality to achieve customer loyalty. The driver from gojek doing good communication relationships and sincere attention to customers, gain trust, and provide responsive service is a form of 5 dimension of service quality (Lee & Moghavvemi, 2015). Meanwhile from Gojek app giving discount and offer on its feature, doing a lot of promotion strategy to attract more consumers, and provide a stability performance from its application will create a strong relationship between consumers and the company, where consumers or the users will be commit to using the services again for the future (Jayanti, 2016; Nikin Hardati, 2021).

97,The Implementation Of Eco-Friendly Packaging Design For  Cafeteria,"an environmentally friendly life is a lifestyle where the things that are done or used do not harm the surrounding environment. today, you can still find many kinds of garbage and waste that are not environmentally friendly, for example, plastic. the community environment is increasingly experiencing a decline in quality due to a lack of public understanding of education about environmental friendliness. this is the background of the author to find a solution to this problem. this study aims to determine the effect of eco-friendly packaging design on public education and interest in using it. this research design thinking method to describe design process of eco-friendly packaging. the solution offered by the researcher has an output in the form of a packaging design. from the results of the questionnaires that have been distributed, researchers can design according to the preferences of most people within the scope of the research survey. the solution target to be achieved is in the form of environmentally friendly product packaging designs that have an educational element. elements of education can be in the form of instructions on where users should dispose of their waste, the type of packaging product that is used, and several other educations on environmentally friendly issues.","design thinking, food packaging","In this paper, research has been carried out on environmentally friendly packaging. An environmentally friendly life is something that we must start living for the health of the environment around us. We have seen from what has been discussed that the data shows that the waste produced is increasing every year, and without us realizing it this will have a bad impact on all aspects of human life and the earth. The main problem raised in this study is the lack of public understanding and education on environmentally friendly living, more specifically in using food product packaging and plastic bags. From these problems, a brainstorming process was carried out to find solutions to these problems and it was found to design an environmentally friendly food container packaging. The packaging material is planned to use cassava starch. The design process is carried out in several stages, namely making a design draft, sketch, final prototype, and final mock-up of the prototype. The original icon is made for this project a hand-drawn picture of the earth and leaves. After all the elements are ready, then proceed to the stage of merging design elements into the final prototype. In this paper, the prototype of the packaging that has been designed aims to become a campaign and provide education to the public. Another goal is to spread and invite more people and communities to use environmentally Figure 8.

99,"Investigating The Impact Of Leadership Styles On Employee  Loyalty And Turnover Intention At Pt Bank Xyz, Indonesia","the indonesian banking industry had the highest voluntary turnover rate in 2019. this might indicate a low level of employee loyalty in the indonesian banking industry. therefore, it was urgent for this research to investigate and explore the impact of leadership styles on employee loyalty and turnover intention in a bank in indonesia. this research was conducted using a qualitative research method and the data were collected by conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews. twelve employees and one senior human resource manager working at pt bank xyz were interviewed. then thematic data analysis was used to analyze the data. the interview results indicated that leadership style had a strong impact on employee loyalty and turnover intention at pt bank xyz. transformational and democratic leadership styles are the most suitable leadership styles to enhance employee loyalty and reduce turnover intentions of employees at pt bank xyz. moreover, the interview results showed that there were eight main factors that were equally important that affected employee loyalty and turnover intention of pt bank xyz’s employees, such as: work- life balance, passion for job, salaries, bonus and benefits, relationship with leader, relationships with team members, leader’s appreciation and respect, career path, and personal developments. it can be concluded that leadership style was the most crucial factor that influenced employee loyalty and turnover intention. meanwhile, transformational, and democratic leadership styles were the most suitable leadership styles to enhance employee loyalty and to reduce the turnover intention of pt bank xyz’s employees.","employee loyalty, leadership styles","and Recommendation Leadership style has a strong impact on employee loyalty and turnover intention. The transformational leadership and democratic leadership style were the most suitable leadership styles to enhance employee loyalty and turnover intention of employees working at PT Bank XYZ including the quality of the leader-member exchange relationships. The factors that affected employee loyalty and turnover intention in PT Bank XYZ included: work-life balance, passion for job, salaries, bonus, and benefits, relationship with leader, relationships with team members, leader’s appreciation and respect, career path, and personal development. Laissez-faire leadership style and autocratic leadership style had their own pros and cons from the employees’ and senior human resource manager’s points of view. Autocratic leadership style was most suitable for the sales team. For transactional leadership style, it existed at PT Bank XYZ as there was a system called the ‘Key Performance Index’ to track employee’s performance and to reward them based on their performance, contingent rewards as mentioned by Bass (1998). For the managerial implications, the findings of this research were not only beneficial for the specific banking industry in Indonesia, but it could also be beneficial for the financial services sector such as: investments companies, real estate firms, and insurance companies. Meanwhile, since this research was being conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the interviews were conducted through WhatsApp online calls. Therefore, the facial expressions of the interviewees could not be observed during the interview process. Besides that, the researchers could not visit PT Bank XYZ because of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the researchers had limited connections in the company. These are the limitation of this research. This research would get higher validity and reliability if the researchers could get access to the managers of the interviewees for triangulation purposes. The interview with the HRS Senior Manager and the exploration of the company’s documents served as the triangulation for this research. 966","edward gunawan and nurianna thoha international business program, management department, binus business school international undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta 11480, indonesia. nurianna@binus.edu","References

100,Determining Synonymy Of Risk And Priority In Maintenance  Prioritization.,"for many decades, the industry has been using risk as to the basis for prioritization of maintenance activities in the form of risk priority number (rpn) and risk matrices. the risk here is defined as the product of severity and frequency. however, priority is defined as the product of importance and urgency. this study is to determine whether risk and priority are synonymous. for the determination, maintenance data for various trades were collected from two malaysian hospitals. these data were then clustered for risk and priority using the k-means clustering algorithm and statistical tools. the results were sorted, ranked, and compared. the resulting comparison shows that risk and priority are metrics of different properties. it was found that risk is a scalar magnitude while priority is a vector. therefore, prioritization of maintenance by risk is a historical lagging indicator, while priority is a leading indicator and better predictor of future impact.","maintenance, risk, priority, prioritization","The results of the study show that a failure risk is not a failure priority. Priority has an element of rate of risk or risk velocity. As proven in the study, this risk velocity is a vector and not a scalar magnitude. This vector gives an indication of the speed of risk to the realization of the risk. The study shows that prioritizing by risks is prioritizing by the magnitude of risk. It does not prioritize by the speed to impact. This is shown by the difference in priority ranking by risk (severity-frequency) and by priority (magnitude-velocity). Prioritizing by risk is a scalar activity, whereas prioritizing by speed to impact is a vector with magnitude and direction. Incorporating speed to impact or risk velocity in maintenance prioritization schemas is a better leading predictor of future impact on budgets and resource allocations. Prioritizing purely on risk indicators such as risk priority number (RPN) is a lagging indicator that may or may not be a good future predictor. Further research in the usage of risk velocity in industrial maintenance prioritization is recommended.","abdul rani achmed abdullah, siti zura a jalil, and nik nadzirah nik mohamed razak faculty of technology and informatics, universiti teknologi malaysia. a.rani@graduate.utm.my",

102,Aircraft (Dornier 328) Tire Wear Reduction Using Six  Sigma And Dmaic Methodology,"the purpose of this research study aimed to determine different factors and conditions affecting the tire tread wear of a dornier 328 aircraft. so many studies and experiments were done to reduce aircraft tire wear, but none were patented because most literature describing the physical process that causes aircraft tire rubber to vaporize under landing loads is sparse, although multiple studies have been reported in the automotive field. the methodology used was the six sigma and dmaic methodology. to analyze the gathered data from the maintenance logbook of an aircraft charterer, the researcher also used the design of experiment. based on the results of the experiment, three factors are statistically significant to the aircraft tire wear: the experience of the pilot, the length of the runway, and the age of the aircraft. also, tests were used to determine the interaction between factors, and as a result, the 2-way interaction of pilot and runway gives the most significant interaction. these findings will help the charterer reduce their operational costs by minimizing the tire tread wear and also aid them in planning their flight schedules in consideration of the manning of the aircraft and its destinations. also, a decrease in rubber production for new tires will have a positive environmental impact. the findings will also serve as a guide for further studies by future researchers on other factors that might be contributory to the reduction of tire tread wear which the researcher was not able to consider due to some constraints.","aircraft tire wire, six sigma, dmaic","It says that tire life is dependent on the specific pilot. Based on the result from the cube plot (fitted means) for tire tread measurements, we can see that to achieve the least mean (tire tread measurement), the pilot should be experienced, short runway, and new aircraft. Some pilots seem to impact the runway hard, which gives even less time for the up spinning off the tires, and certainly more wear on the tires. This is one of the advantages of having an experienced pilot handling the aircraft. But we all know that the distance of runway to be used is our uncontrolled variable, we cannot always choose a destination with a short distance runway since an aircraft charterer always pleases its customers for business purposes. For the age of an aircraft to be used, the charterer makes the most of its life span and what they can do is to strictly implement their preventive maintenance so as not to shorten its life span as well as ensure that their aircraft is worthy of flying. Based on the summary of the findings and conclusions presented, the following recommendations were offered: 1. Management of PSAI – to be aware of the importance of skills upgrading for their pilots so as not to limit their manning schedule to experienced pilots only but skilled pilots, (a pilot can be a newbie but skilled). It can be done by implementing a program for continuous training and attending seminars. 2. Pilots – One of the uncontrollable variables in the experiment/study is the runway, but a pilot can be a contributor in lessening the encounter of an aircraft running on a runway with soft spots and damaged areas which causes an aircraft tire to be damage. A pilot must maintain a reporting system for any encountered damaged part in the runway 989","ma. corazon p. rubido researcher industrial engineering department, adamson university ma.corazon.rubido@adamson.edu.ph lourdes lasian co-adviser chairperson, bsie adamson university lourdes.lasian@adamson.edu.ph noe d. enriquez, pie, asean eng. adviser director, ippdo adamson university noe.enriquez@adamson.edu.ph","References

103,Car Creditworthiness Classification Using Naive Bayes And Credit  Scoring,"loans and their derivatives are one of the most important sources of income for financial services institutions such as banks and multi-finance companies. challenges happen when customers cannot pay their monthly installments or are defined as bad credits. the use of data mining has been known to be able to predict the suitability of new credit applicants. variables significantly influence the accuracy of car credit ratings. although there have been many studies related to the determination of credit rating, they still have a low level of accuracy because of these variables. in this study, we use the naïve bayes method and combine it with credit scoring to weigh each variable. we also added more specific variables to increase the accuracy level. 10.000 data from a leasing company in indonesia were used and produced a suitability level of 8,6%. calculations using credit scoring get a suitability value of 79%. based on the test results, prospective debtors using the naive bayes method have an accuracy of approximately 89%. further research is needed with better use of data that is already eligible for the convenience of the data training process.","naïve bayes, credit scoring, classification, even so","and Suggestions Based on the final project research results, it can be concluded that the computational model mechanism for the classification of auto loan dignity using the Naive Bayes method and the credit scoring model, branch can classify and determine the dignity of prospective debtors in making auto loans. To determine the level of the worthiness of prospective auto loan debtors using the Naive Bayes method results in a level of worthiness of 8,6% for Worth results and 0 for Not Worth results, and calculations using credit scoring get a value of 79%, these results can state that prospective auto loan applicants can be declared Worth to make auto loans, and to determine Worth or Not to make auto loans and to use a credit scoring model where if the score> 70% the applicant can be declared Worth making credit so that the debtor gets an auto loan dignity, the two methods should produce a Worth value and a score of> 70%. %. The test results were conducted using the k-fold cross-validation method with k = 10, and the confusion matrix test results show that the accuracy of the Naive Bayes method is 89%. We suggest that for further research, it is better to use data that already has value for the convenience of the data training process.

104,Sentiment Analysis Of E-Wallets On Twitter Social Media  With Naïve Bayes And Lexicon-Based Methods,"sentiment analysis is one of the areas of application of text analysis and nlp (natural language processing). it builds a system to identify and analyze personal information from textual sources, which are generally divided into positive and negative categories. many case studies are chosen to measure the accuracy of the computational model of sentiment analysis. in this study, we use social media's perception of electronic wallets usage. the naïve bayes method was chosen. it can help classification because it is assumed to be an independent variable, and lexicon is used to calculate the weight of each word. although several studies have been conducted on sentiment analysis, none have used non-standard word correction. the use of non-standard word correction deals with non- standard words such as slang and word abbreviations. this research begins by digging up the required data, namely the keyword electronic wallet. the standard word dictionary normalizes non-standard words, preprocessing data with four stages: case folding, tokenizing, stop word, and stemming. the lexicon dictionary produces positive and negative labels, and nave bayes is used to classifying. the data used in this study were 3878 tweets, with a distribution of 70% training data and 30% test data. sentiment analysis obtained in this study shows that twitter users in indonesia are more likely to give negative comments to electronic wallets. the results of this study indicate that by using both methods and adding standard word corrections and testing using rapidminer, the accuracy rate for classifying positive and negative sentiments reaches 88.56%. further research can add levenshtein distance normalization to the classification results to better influence the accuracy value.","text mining, lexicon based, electronic wallet","Based on the results of the research that has been done, it can be concluded that the computational model classification mechanism in the sentiment analysis of e-wallet applications in Indonesia on Twitter social media shows that Twitter users in Indonesia are more likely to give negative comments on electronic wallet applications. By using the naïve bayes and lexicon methods and standard word repair, the accuracy rate is 88.56% for the accuracy of classifying positive and negative sentiment tweets on electronic wallets. This level of accuracy shows that sentiment analysis using the naïve bayes and lexicon methods and standard word repair is quite good because the resulting accuracy rate is 88.56%. 1008","ananda dimas sanjaya department of informatics science and informatics faculty universitas jenderal achmad yani west java, cimahi, indonesia anadadimass17@if.unjani.ac.id tacbir hendro pudjiantoro, ade kania ningsih, faiza renaldi department of informatics science and informatics faculty universitas jenderal achmad yani west java, cimahi, indonesia thp@if.unjani.ac.id, ade.kanianingsih@lecture.unjani.ac.id, faiza.renaldi@unjani.ac.id",

The software we build can send notifications to users when users enter or out of flood/landslide-prone areas in West Bandung Regency. In addition, the software we have built can calculate the shortest distance between users and locations prone to flooding/landslides so that users can be prepared when approaching the area. There are weaknesses in this study, where mobile devices can only use this software with the Android operating system. We suggest developing this software, so Android and iOS operating systems can use it.

Having a product with more value and competitive advantage compared to other products is sometimes not enough. Innovative strategies are needed so that the value message can be appropriately conveyed to potential customers. The strategies resulting from this research are functional strategies that can be used and applied in the eco- print business. The researcher hopes that by applying the strategies that have been analyzed previously, the company can create innovations in the eco-print business model so that eco-print can be more widely known by fashion product lovers and convey its values well to their users. The implementation of the research strategy is also expected to help eco-print business actors to be able to continue to work and introduce the uniqueness and beauty of eco-print products. So that in the future, eco-print products can be enjoyed by a wider audience. This research certainly has limitations; It did not study the business prototyping level. Research on prototyping deals with feedback from customers about eco-print products. This feedback can provide a broad and in-depth picture of products used for business continuity. Research at the prototyping level is recommended for further research. This research can provide better results and recommendations for businesses, help the progress of local Indonesian products, and introduce products to the broader community.","chyntia ika ratnapuri, dian kurnianingrum, nur azmi karim, and okky rizkia yustian entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 chyntia.ratnapuri@binus.ac.id, dian_k@binus.ac.id, nur.karim@binus.ac.id, okky.yustian@binus.ac.id",

Moreover, projects are performed by project management teams that consist of various individuals from different background. Therefore, team resilience is critical to the success of project management. It seems that resilient teams are more likely to be productive, agile and innovative during turbulent times. This study has a limitation where the data comes from a number of respondents during the peak time of the second wave of COVID-19. It did not reflect the team resilience during the first wave, where most industries were highly affected by the pandemic. Furthermore, this study only explores two independent variables, individual resilience and transformational leadership. Further research should aim toother industries. In addition, further research can be performed in the form of case studies to validate this study result.","diena dwidienawati and mohammad ichsan management department bbs up bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia diena.t@binus.edu mohammad hamsal doctoral of research in management program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia",

Alpha investors are investors who provide information about the level of “buy”, “sell”, and “hold” which is compared to the condition of the rate of return in period t. It is said to be qualified when the information is by the conditions that occur in the stock market. The results showed that the increase in disagreement among online investors led to an increase in the level of stock market volatility even though there was no information provided by alpha investors. However, alpha investors themselves do not have a conditional effect on the level of volatility when there is no agreement or disagreement between online investors. However, the size of the effect of the level of agreement between online investors on the level of volatility will depend on the quality of alpha investors. The impact given will be different depending on the quality of the information provided by the alpha investor, When a disagreement occurs between investors, it will cause an increase in volatility where the size of the impact will depend on the quality of the information provided by the alpha investor. When the information provided by alpha investors is not of good quality, it will cause a higher level of volatility, but if the information provided is of good quality, it will cause a decrease in the level of volatility when there is a disagreement between investors. But when there is an agreement between investors that will cause a decrease in the level of volatility. This condition will be different depending on the quality of the information provided by alpha investors. When the quality of the information provided causes a higher level of volatility than when there is a decrease in the quality of information.","putri fariska lecturer, departement of telecommunication and informatics business management faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia fariskaputri@telkomuniversity.ac.id mochamad malik akbar rohandi lecturer, departement of management faculty of economics and business universitas islam bandung bandung, indonesia moch.malik@gmail.com ajeng luthfiyatul farida lecturer, departement of accounting faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia ajengluthfiyatul@telkomuniversity.ac.id","references of individual investors: Evidence from Chinese equity markets.

In addition, there are no videos uploaded to the website. We recommend that in making website materials and managing websites, it is also advisable to involve local tourism actors so that they can enrich website content. In addition, there is also a need for a Focus Discussion Group with stakeholders involved in the promotion of Natuna tourism to provide input on the website that is being developed.

141,Industrial Revolution 4.0: Innovation Of Mandarin  Language Students Learning Outcomes,"along with the rapid advances in technology and innovation today because of globalization of the 21st century and the industrial revolution 4.0, educational learning outcomes need to be maintained so as not to deviate to the point of failure. mandarin is a compulsory subject in three language schools (indonesian, english, mandarin). thus, learning mandarin at the three-language school also involves all forms of innovation and transformation that are currently taking place in the delivery of learning materials and learning assessments. learning outcomes from learning are students' ability to communicate. this paper intends to analyze the latest technological advances and innovations in the chinese language teaching process along with student test scores, data collection methods based on student activity in collecting assignments in google classroom (gcr) and students' final grades. the respondents of this study were 26 junior high school students at the pahoa three language school, tangerang. the exam questions include completing the dialogue (60%), answering questions after hearing the contents of the text (30%) and answering questions from reading (10%). the learning process that lasted for 4 months was evaluated 5 times with assignment at gcr. the conclusion of this study is that the intensity of task collection has a close relationship with test results. this research is expected to be a reference for further research by utilizing technology and innovation in learning and assignments, especially in foreign language learning.","： mandarin, speaking, assessment","Based on the research above, we can conclude that the use of GCR-based learning applications also has a significant influence on student activity in participating in learning. In learning using the GCR media, a more practical collection does not guarantee that all students will collect it on time, but it has a close relationship with student test results, where students who do not submit assignments in the GCR tend to have lower scores. Therefore, the application of using GCR learning media needs to be carried out as much as possible Acknowledge The authors gratefully acknowledge that the present research is supported by Ministry of Education Taiwan. The support is under the research grant Taiwan Studies Project of Year 2022.","mei rianto chandra, yi ying, kelly rosalin, jureynolds, theresia chinese department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11480 mei.rianto@binus.ac.id; yi_ying@binus.edu; krosalin@binus.edu; jureynolds@binus.edu; theresia@binus.edu",
142,"The Role Of Cross Culture Knowledge At Work  Yi Ying, Mei Rianto Chandra, Jureynolds, Putri Mustika Susilo, Juniana","an understanding of cross-culture provides an overview of communication between different cultures. there are often inhibiting factors in the process of learning and understanding intercultural communication. barriers to intercultural communication may occur because of cultural differences between communicators and communicants. provision of cross-cultural knowledge to students needs to be done before students enter the workforce. so that they can adapt according to the field of work they are engaged in. this study discusses the role of cross-cultural knowledge in the field of work. the respondents are 99 alumni from three universities in indonesia who work in various fields. the fields of work studied are admin, manager, trainer, translator. this research was conducted using a quantitative method, the results of the analysis of anova testing (post-hoc analysis) using the bonferroni method. the results of the test of the significance of the difference in the mean of the four groups of verbal ability rating scores obtained from the four sample clusters, namely the rating scores of admin, manager, trainer, and translator, showed significant test results. this is indicated by the value of f = 3.149 at = 0.05 and = 0.01 which is indicated by the value of -p = 0.29. the results of the research show that the order of work that requires cross-cultural knowledge is translator, manager, admin and trainer. this research is expected to be a reference for higher education providers to prepare human resources who have cross-cultural knowledge. in addition, it is hoped that further research can provide a model of cross-cultural knowledge to management in higher education.","alumni, work","The results showed that the sequence of jobs that required cross-cultural knowledge were translator, manager, admin and trainer. Managers and translators are required to have cultural knowledge. Cultural ability in this case is to understand how to work, work habits, work rules and work ethics in foreign companies. It also understands how to get along with strangers. The work of managers and translators requires them to communicate more actively and intensely with their colleagues or partners or customers. Thus, cross-cultural skills are needed so that communication and work run smoothly and so that unwanted conflicts do not occur due to miss communication. Meanwhile, administrators usually work behind a desk, so they rarely work in the field or interact with outsiders from different cultures. However, administrators also need cultural knowledge in order to be able to adapt to the work environment and co-workers of different cultures, especially those who are foreign nationals. Trainers rarely interact with foreigners because their main task is to deliver teaching materials or materials. So it doesn't really need cultural skills to communicate with foreigners. However, the trainer also needs to equip himself with cross-cultural knowledge so that he can convey it to his students so that they also understand how to communicate with people who are different from their culture. 1374","chinese department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 yi_ying@binus.edu; mei.rianto@binus.ac.id; jureynolds@binus.edu; putri.susilo@binus.edu; juniana@binus.ac.id;","References

Aspects of Portal design, customer service quality, and security have a significant positive influence on the quality of electronic services in the context of the online Mutual Fund portal. While the fulfillment aspect does not affect the quality of electronic services. Furthermore, the aspect of electronic service quality has been shown to have a significant effect on customer satisfaction and brand image but not on customer confidence in the online Mutual Fund portal provider company. In addition, Brand Image does not affect the satisfaction, trust, and loyalty of online Mutual Fund customers. Meanwhile, customer satisfaction has a significant positive effect on customer loyalty and encourages customers to have more confidence in the credibility, competence and expertise of online Mutual Fund portal service providers. In this study, it was also found that customer trust had a significant positive effect on customer loyalty for companies providing online Mutual Fund portals. Meanwhile, based on the results of further testing using PLS Multi Group Analysis (MGA) it was found that there was a moderating effect that caused 2 significant differences that affected customer satisfaction between the investment manager customer respondent group and the selling agent. In this case, E-Service Quality has a more significant effect on customer satisfaction of the online Mutual Fund portal of the Mutual Fund Selling Agent compared to the customer of the online Mutual Fund portal of the investment manager. On the other hand, the brand image (reputation and track record) of investment manager companies has a more significant impact on customer satisfaction. 6.

148,The Entrepreneurial Transformation Assessment: Case  Study In A Private University In Indonesia,"the model of entrepreneurial universities is believed to be the main driving force for independence and innovation and appropriate response to environmental turbulence and rapid market changes. in addition to teaching and research, the accomplishment of becoming entrepreneurial is seldom immediate and requires a transformation process. this study aimed to assess the transformation process of a private university in indonesia in becoming entrepreneurial. its analytical framework was based on an entrepreneurial university model with six variables: actors, university governance, entrepreneurial activity, entrepreneurial output, support measures needed, and challenges. using a descriptive-analytic method, the results obtained from the questionnaire administered to 541 respondents, belonging to various groups from within and outside the university indicated that university “a” is currently treading an entrepreneurial path. the assessment results for the perceived value from entrepreneurial indicators, at an average score above 4, implied a positive perception of entrepreneurial implementation. subsequently, mapping the results into a transformation model positioned the university close to the entrepreneurial paradigm.","assessment, private university","Higher education institutions are not enough to focus only on teaching and research, without realizing what society needs from the world of education. Therefore, they play a significant role in supporting economic development, both at regional and national levels. In addition, universities are expected to produce graduates who will adapt to future needs. Becoming an entrepreneurial university is a direction that universities may choose as an adaptive response to demands in today's rapidly paced changing environment. Several universities have adopted entrepreneurial behavioral developments in mainstream education. The ability to respond to the demands of change through innovation and survive traditional patterns, whether through entrepreneurialism or other means, is necessary. The assessment carried out involving all groups starting from the university leaders, faculties, staff, students, alumni, and external resources showed that University “A” is on the path of transformation to become entrepreneurial. The positioning of the university in the transformation model was closer to the entrepreneurial paradigm, which means that it is closer to becoming an ideal entrepreneurial university. The achievements until 2021 as mentioned by respondents indicated that although teaching and research remained the main focus for the University “A”, prioritizing quality and adapting to changing times with the awareness that technology plays an important role in today's digital era also received equal importance. The results of this empirical research indicate that universities do not have to openly declare themselves as entrepreneurial universities, or as transitioning into an entrepreneurial university. Instead, the behavior they implement demonstrates that adaptability and innovation are pivotal in meeting the increasing demands of dynamic changes and encouraging the community to contribute to realizing economic development. From the results of this case study, it can be inferred that entrepreneurial universities tend to excel in internal and external achievements. This raises the hypothesis that the resulting performance is a product of the ongoing entrepreneurial transformation, which can be explored through further research.","selly novela management program binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia enovela@binus.edu",
149,Literature Review On Acceptance Of Technology For  Reducing Distracted Driving,"rapid technological development drives the development of technology for reducing distracted driving. acceptance to such technologies is complex and relatively unknown, as it relies on various constructs and different characteristics of the users. studies on technology acceptance can contribute to product development and policymaking to minimize driver distraction. this work presents a review of empirical research on technology acceptance for distracted-driving reduction technology, referred from 10 published studies within the past 10 years. models that are evaluated include behavioral science theory such as the technology acceptance model (tam) and other proposed variables which influence the acceptance and usage of the technologies. similarities and differences between studies with potential limitations and gaps are analyzed in this work. the results indicate that tam is the most common model, proven to be a robust and useful tool. additional factors added are proven to be insightful to complement the existing constructs in tam. this work concluded less distraction is proven to improve driving performance, but at the cost of user acceptance. discrepancy in term of studied location is highlighted in this work. majority of the empirical studies are conducted in u.s. and european populations. asian regions, despite largely populated with vehicle users, are severely underrepresented.","distracted driving, distraction, tam","could be drawn that the development of technology for reducing distracted driving could go in any direction; stationary in- vehicle technology and nomadic technology. These findings showed that while initial constructs of TAM are proven to be useful, more detailed research on other contributing factors such as additional constructs and interface design attributes is needed. Closer look upon the specific society the technology is being deployed, as results may vary depending on the socio-demographic condition. There is also room for further improvements identified through this review. The studies presented are mostly done in developed western countries. While there are different levels of knowledge and familiarity, these countries generally have high awareness for road safety and in-vehicle technology. This indicates discrepancy, with lack of studies in Asia-Africa regions and other developing countries. Social-demographic variables would also impact results in different countries, as demonstrated by Roberts et al. (2012). Aside from the choice of country, it will be interesting to see the study in populations that are generally more unfamiliar with in-vehicle technology and more resistant to be introduced to in-vehicle technology. Location (intersection, tight turns etc.) are found to have significant difference on objective data (Kujala et al. 2015), acceptance of such technologies might differ when tested on countries with different driving terrain and situational conditions. Most of the studies conducted were cross-sectional. Safety features in IVIS and smartphone might increase the interaction between users and the technology due to false sense of security. There would be a need for longitudinal study in different populations across the world to see whether the benefits of technology for reducing distraction outweigh its negative effects in prolonged usage. The glance studies deployed while useful is still limited by the reliability of the equipment used outside of laboratory setting. Subsequently, Widyanti et al. (2017) concluded that eye blink rate is appropriate for assessing visually demanding task rather than mentally demanding task, which both are the nature of driving. When more advanced technological breakthrough regarding glance tracking got introduced, this technology and appropriate real-world scenarios could be leveraged to conduct more accurate analyses and for other studies in different countries. Indonesia is one of the developing countries with surprisingly high acceptance of distracted driving reducing technology, despite the general population having lower knowledge and interest in such technologies. Simultaneously, Indonesia also has high prevalence of mobile phone and generally exhibit unsafe driving behavior (Widyanti et al., 2020). As distraction is related to mental workload, objective studies measuring mental workload has been performed in Indonesia (Widyanti et al., 2017; Widyanti, et al., 2017) and another assessed acceptance for a variety of technology such as Bluetooth audio systems, cellphone blocking application, and phone mirroring. In the future, multiple assessment methods should be combined (objective and subjective studies). In addition, further study should consider broader range of technology and verify whether the acceptance level was connected to built-in features available in recent car models circulating in Indonesia. Consideration is to be made on performing longitudinal studies to observe drivers’ behavior in longer periods of time and measure objective data regarding driving performance.","kefira arviadita sutantio and ari widyanti department of industrial engineering faculty of technological industry institut teknologi bandung bandung, indonesia kefirasutantio@students.itb.ac.id, widyanti@ti.itb.ac.id",
150,Impact Of Electric Trucks And Setup Cost Reduction  Investment On A Two-Tier Supply Chain,"this research develops a joint optimization model for a two-tier supply chain by involving a manufacturer and a retailer. we investigate the impact of investment in setup cost reduction and electric-powered equipment such as electric forklifts and trucks on the joint total cost. co2 emissions are produced by both parties and transportation activities involving a logistics provider. the products at the manufacturer’s warehouse are collected by a logistic provider and delivered to the retailer’s warehouse by using the electric truck. we consider the lead-time that depends on the production time, transportation time, material handling time, and in-transit time. the goal is to minimize the joint total cost, which is to obtain the decision variables, such as the lot size, factor of safety, and the number of batches. a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. the result shows that the proposed model compared with wangsa et al. (2020) can significantly affect cost-saving, increase service level, short lead-time, and reduce carbon emissions levels by 24.42%; 0.36%; 41.03%; and 29.41%, respectively.",electric vehicles,"This study develops a sustainable integrated inventory model for a two-tier supply chain by involving electric trucks. We consider a probabilistic demand, stochastic lead-time, carbon emission, service level, and setup cost reduction. Stochastic lead-time includes the production time, transportation time, loading-unloading time, and in-transit time. The carbon emission can be reduced especially transportation emissions by considering electric trucks. The emissions will affect the lot size and lot production. From computation analysis, we obtain a total cost savings of 25%, a significant total emission reduction of about 30%, a lead-time reduction of 41%, and an increase in service level of 0.36%. The proposed model can guide managers to determine the optimum lot size, safety factor, number of batches, customer service level, carbon emissions, and lead-time. Further study could be by investigating the green technology investment and considering the drone for the last mile system. The production and truck capacities constraint would be considered in further research. Furthermore, the other possibility is considering rework in the manufacturing production process.","ivan darma wangsa, iwan vanany, and nurhadi siswanto department of industrial and systems engineering, institut teknologi sepuluh nopember, surabaya, indonesia, kampus its, sukolilo, 60111, indonesia ivan.darma.wangsa.idw@gmail.com, vanany@ie.its.ac.id, siswanto@ie.its.ac.id",
151,The Influence Of Celebrity Endorsers To Invesment Intention  In Gen Z During Pandemic,"the covid-19 virus pandemic that attacked indonesia had a very bad impact on the economy in indonesia, especially in the fields of trade, tourism and investment. however, the economic situation in indonesia has had a good impact on raising the intention to invest in indonesia's generation z, which is defined as those born between 1995 and 2010. the internal elements that influence generation z's investing intention will be explained using the theory of planned behavior (tpb) approach in this study. three crucial components that are accurate in predicting intention to behave are attitudes toward conduct, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. to improve the prediction potential of tpb theory, constructs to gauge investment intentions, such as the influence of celebrity endorsers, must be added. as a result, the research employs quantitative approaches. sampling was done using a purposive sample technique. in totals, there were 150 respondents who participated. data was collected using an online questionnaire, google form. the analysis used is spss 26 software as a tool to analyze the data. also, the result of data processing showed that, celebrity endorser variable affects investment intentions. celebrity endorsers have an influence on attitude toward behavior. subjective norms affect investment intentions. thus, it can be concluded that celebrity endorsers and subjective norms affect generation z's intention to invest during the covid-19 pandemic.",celebrity endorser,"6.1 Conclusion The celebrity endorsement variable has an impact on investment intentions, according to the findings of the debate. Celebrity endorsers have an impact on behavior attitudes. Investment intentions are unaffected by one's attitude toward behavior. Investment intentions are influenced by subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control has little effect on investment intentions. As a result, celebrity endorsers and subjective norms have an impact on Generation Z's willingness to invest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Internal and external factors can influence Generation Z's investment aspirations, according to this study. Celebrity endorsers can be an attractive promotional tool for today's generation Z, because celebrity can influence the attitude of generation Z so that the intention arises to invest in the capital market. The figure of a celebrity endorser also has an important role, the more known the figure, the more it can influence the investment intention of Generation Z. Subjective norms also show that the investment intention of Generation Z grows based on a sense of trust or confidence from their environment. This shows that an environment that supports investment in the capital market will have a greater intention to invest in the capital market compared to people who are in an environment that is less amenable to investing in the capital market. Subjective norms also show that Generation Z's investment intentions grow based on a sense of trust or confidence from their environment. This shows that an environment that supports investment in the capital market will have a greater intention to invest in the capital market compared to people who are in an environment that is less amenable to investing in the capital market.

152,The Impact Of Social Motives On Digital Ambidexterity  Among White-Collared Workers In Indonesia,"indonesia has seen an increase in social media usage over the past years. it increases even more during the covid- 19 pandemic, which includes white-collared workers seeking to learn practical skills to be implemented in the workplace. this study aims to examine the relationship between social motives and digital ambidexterity, in which social motives become the precedent of digital ambidexterity. this research uses the quantitative method of study in which we gather questionnaire answers from 238 white-collared workers in indonesia. this questionnaire is employed with a five-point likert scale ranging from 1 (very unimportant) to 5 (very important) for questions regarding social motives and social media learning. our research predicted a significant relationship between social motives and digital ambidexterity. it is not the only variable that influences digital ambidexterity the most. the research provides a framework for the use of managers to promote social media learning by identifying employees' social motives. we argue that this would promote efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace. there have been studies that link social motives to social media learning. however, most studies focused on individual motivations outside of the workplace, which intrigued the authors to examine the relationship between social motives and social media learning as a path towards digital ambidexterity.",social motives,"This study examines the role of social motives in influencing digital ambidexterity in white-collared workers in Indonesia. The respondents were dominated by workers aged 21 to 30, making them a part of two generational cohorts with the most social media users in Indonesia. The continuous jump in social media usage in Indonesia opens the possibility of learning through social media, resulting in digital ambidexterity. Studies show the link between ambidexterity to innovation and performance. However, it seldom found what actually pushes digital ambidexterity. Thus, we gathered data from 238 samples of white-collared workers in Indonesia across all productive ages. The research findings prove a significantly positive relationship between social motives and digital ambidexterity. It means indicating that when workers are motivated through their primary social motives, they would be able to participate in a program that fosters their digital ambidexterity. However, akin to many other studies before this, this study contains its own limitations. First, there was only a total of 238 samples taken from all over Indonesia due to the time constraints that limited the act of finding participants. This may incite concerns about whether these findings can represent the entire population. Second, this study's results indicated that more than only social motives influence digital ambidexterity in white-collared workers. Therefore, it is highly suggested that future studies observe the factors determining digital ambidexterity in white-collared workers. Third, we also employed simple regression analysis to achieve results. We encourage future studies to examine the relationship between each social motive and digital ambidexterity.","maria grace herlina* senior lecturer, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 *corresponding author: herlina01@binus.edu nyiayu olivia miranda bakrie management study program binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 nyiayu.bakrie001@binus.ac.id",
153,Cloud-Based Statistical Process Control Mobile Application  Development For Smart Manufacturing,"product quality is critical to manufacturing sectors because defective parts and production scraps affect business profitability and sustainability. in alignment with the lean six sigma manufacturing approach, reducing process variability using statistical process control (spc) is the primary strategy for controlling product quality. motivated by the increased prevalence of mobile devices and their influences on the smart manufacturing environment in the industry 4.0 era, this study presents the development of the procmon app, a mobile-cloud application designed for factory spc monitoring. the system consists of mobile devices, internet connectivity, and cloud services. the procmon app adopts a three-layer client-server architecture comprising the presentation, business, and data layers. the factory spc monitoring is realized via automated control chart plotting, process capability indices, and nelson rules. a short message service alert is sent if out-of-control processes are detected. the procmon app is developed using two open-source software platforms: mit app inventor 2 and google workspace. this research demonstrated that mit app inventor 2 and google workspace offer a low-cost and less complex development approach for mobile cloud applications in manufacturing, benefiting nonprofessional programmers and stakeholders with a minimal budget. after completing app development, a system test was conducted using simulated data from a machining part fabrication case study for the app functional validation, and the acceptance test conducted by a focus group concluded that the procmon app meets the requirements for a low-cost, flexible, available 24/7, efficient, and easy-to-use application for spc.",cloud services,"This research demonstrated the successful development of the ProcMon app, a mobile-cloud app for online SPC monitoring, by combining the use of MIT App Inventor 2 and Google Workspace platforms. The ProcMon app features easy-to-use process monitoring capabilities, such as a control chart, PCI, and Nelson rules. Real-time SMS alerts is sent if a process is out of control. The developed system is a mobile-cloud multilayer architecture app that can operate across heterogeneous computing platforms. It uses Android mobile devices, Google cloud service, and Internet connectivity to provide factory personnel with an on-the-go process monitoring service. The acceptance test concluded that the app meets the requirements of low cost, flexible, available 24/7, efficient, and easy-to-use SPC app. In addition, this research also demonstrated two advantages of combining MIT App Inventor 2 and the Google Workspace platform in developing mobile–cloud applications. First, this approach incurs minimum financial costs due to the free or minimal cost of the open-source and web-based development platforms, eliminating the need for hefty setup investments and maintenance costs of hardware setup and software licensing. Second, this approach lowers the technical barrier for developing a mobile–cloud app for nonprofessional programmers. App Inventor’s “what you see is what you get” editor and block-based programming language approach significantly reduce the complexity of coding work for app development. Google Workspace provides readily available cloud-based storage access and open-source productivity and collaboration tools that are user- friendly and do not require complicated configuration and setup efforts during the application development. As a research contribution, this study effectively illustrates the construction of a mobile-cloud app for SPC monitoring by using these two open-source software platforms which will considerably help prototyping or proof-of-concept for mobile-cloud app or smart manufacturing projects in future works.","lim chong hon1, chin jeng feng2 1,2school of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering universiti sains malaysia. pulau pinang, malaysia 1chonghon_lim@yahoo.com.sg, 2chinjengfeng@usm.my (corresponding author)",

Through this literature review, seventeen attributes are found that are often used by distribution companies to measure customer satisfaction. Attributes that affect customer satisfaction of distribution companies lead to fast and responsive customer complaints where customers are satisfied because their complaints are accommodated and processed, customers are also more satisfied if employees have sufficient knowledge and skills that they can help and inform related services provided, and because employees are representatives of the company, employees must be friendly, attentive and responsive to customer needs. 5.66% 9.43% 18.87% 11.32% 7.55% 3.77% 9.43% 3.77% 5.66% 7.55% 5.66% 1.89% 1.89% 1.89% 1.89% 1.89% 1.89% Employee Friendliness Employee consideration, sensitivity, and care for customers Fast handling customer complaints Have a clear and accurate information and easy to get it Quality and quantity of product Employees have fast and responsive in providing services Employee have knowledge and skills Availability of service coverage/outlet Quickly service & response Timeliness of the service and delivery High service accuracy Availability of product Ease the payment system Employee Appearing Professional 1498","distribution companies masda megawati marpaung postgraduate student of magister management program faculty of business and economic universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia masdamegawati@gmail.com lien herliani kusumah senior lecturer in magister of industrial engineering program faculty of engineering universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia lien.herliani@mercubuana.ac.id",
155,Reliability Management In A South African Railway  Company,"this paper investigates the reliability management of overhead track equipment in a south african railway company. the organization has been experiencing unsatisfactory operational efficiency due to infrastructure failures such as pantograph hook-ups, derailments, and washaways, which affect performance. the unsatisfactory operational efficiency affects the organization's revenue generation, economy, and customer confidence. studies suggest that the overhead track equipment is the least reliable subsystem of the electric traction system, and its failures contribute significantly to train operations' poor performance. in the south african railway environment, studies have been conducted to evaluate the reliability of the overall railway infrastructure, traction substation and perway; however, there has been little research on the reliability of the overhead track equipment. this study addresses the shortcoming by assessing the reliability management of the overhead track equipment in south africa. the convergent mixed- methods design was selected for the study, and a sample of the maintenance depots was selected to collect failure data, inspection and audit reports, and primary data were collected using a questionnaire. the analysis of the data sources showed that the maintenance strategies employed by some maintenance depots are ineffective, maintenance management tools such as rcm and fmeca can be adopted to improve the reliability of the equipment, and factors that affect the reliability of the overhead track equipment are operational, maintenance budget, and human factors.","failures, reliability","The evaluated failure data from the sample depots suggests that overall, the OHTE maintenance strategies employed were poor due to the trend of failures increasing during the period under study. However, there are depots that decreased the failure rate over the study period, and these were less than half of the sample. There are also depots that decreased the failure rate inter-period, suggesting improving maintenance strategies at those depots. All DC depots contributed significantly to the unreliability of the Company. AC depots appear to have better maintenance strategies than DC depots. The maintenance depots conduct failure analysis on incidents that impacted the train service, and they can improve by conducting failure analysis for all failures to identify failure modes and maintenance interventions that can minimize the risk of failures. The failures that are not analyzed are likely to lead to failures that impact the train operations. The organization should employ comprehensive failure analysis techniques such as FMECA to identify the correct root causes, failure modes and impact of failures. It is proposed that the organization implement the RCM due to the declining maintenance budget and the risk failures pose to the train operations. Maintenance depots with similar failure distributions should be evaluated to implement common maintenance interventions. Various factors affect the reliability of OHTE, including theft and vandalism, reduced maintenance budget, human factors, and operational factors. Theft and vandalism are the key drivers of failures and operational and human factors. The excessive theft and vandalism incident results in the maintenance teams being unable to conduct the planned maintenance, and the teams are fatigued and work under pressure to repair the affected equipment; this results in unintentional faults being generated during the repairs. The Company should strive to curb the prevalence of theft and vandalism incidents; this is the first step to improving its operational efficiency. The analysis showed that depots with 1509","khimane motupa, jan-harm pretorius and bheki makhanya postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and built environment university johannesburg johannesburg, south africa khimane.m@gmail.com, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za, bsm3174@yahoo.com","References

156,Model For Data Training Judge'S Decisions In Corruption  Cases In Indonesia,"data is one of the supporting elements for decision-making in all scientific fields, including in legal dogmatics. as a practical science, legal dogmatics is responsible for responding to legal problems in societies, particularly through court decisions. in the indonesian legal tradition, which is heavily influenced by the civil law system, judges in charge of deciding cases do not always use references in the form of precedents drawn from similar case decisions. situations like this often attract criticism as they are likely to cause inconsistencies in court decision-making and will ultimately reduce public confidence in the courts. this paper offers a way to overcome this tendency and aims to model judgment decisions from cases that are related to cases through data mining with the decision tree method. the methods used are decision tree id3, with data derived from decisions on corruption cases decided by the corruption court in indonesia over the past ten years. this data-training model has shown variables that can be used as data-training that really needs consistency in decision making in corruption cases in indonesia. considering that the judges' decisions are the result of factual as well as normative reasoning, there are many elements that must be anticipated. the judge's inconsistency in interpreting the facts results in the judge's interpretation of the elements of the crime. this disparity is the source of the weakness of the model that is currently presented in this study. one way to overcome this is to increase the data variance. if the researcher only uses duplicate data from the previous training data, the end result will not be very different. 1512",,"This research shows that the judge's decision is a very complex document, but it is still open for analysis using the data-training model. The difficulties in transforming all the data to be analysed by rapid miners are due to the variations in each of these facts, both concerning the subject of the perpetrator and the actions that correspond to the object of the norm. Such diverse norm conditions also give rise to multiple interpretations, thus affecting the punishment. The aggravating and mitigating factors are also not all explicitly stated in the decisions. All these variations raise weaknesses that every compiler of the data-training model must anticipate. The authors note that this study requires more training data with many variations. With the limited variations, there seems to be leaps in the judge's way of thinking compared to the propositions displayed by the machine.

160,The Influence Of Intellectual Capital And Company Size On  Financial Performance (Study On Banking Subsector,"the existence of technology and information that is increasingly sophisticated results in the advancement of economic growth, in this case the banking subsector is a subsector that has an important role in maintaining the stability of a country's economy, for that reason the importance of improving financial work in banking. this study has two variables that affect financial performance, namely intellectual capital and company size, this study aims to determine the influence of intellectual capital and company size the financial performance of banking subsector companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange. the object of this study is a banking subsector company listed on the indonesia stock exchange. in period this study is 2017-2020. this study, financial performance was proxied with return on assets (roa), while intellectual capital was proxied with the formula variable added intellectual coefficient and the size of the company was proxied with formula ln total assets. the total population in this study was 33 companies. have 132 samples, the analysis method used in this study is the panel data regression analysis method. the results of this study show that simultaneously, intellectual capital and company size affect financial performance, partially intellectual capital affects on financial performance and company size have no effect on financial performance. as a result of this study, researchers hope that this researcher will become a reference in the company. in addition, researchers hope that this study can be described again in a broader direction.",economic growth,"This research proves that intellectual capital and company size have a simultaneous effect on financial performance. However, partially intellectual capital has a positive effect on financial performance, in this case it shows that intellectual capital can play a role in improving financial performance, meaning that the higher the intellectual capital, the better the company's financial performance. This, the company is able to use and maximize existing resources such as the use of creativity and innovation of employees in the company so as to create added value for the company. Firm size has no negative effect on financial performance, in this case because the increase in a company is not always with total assets for which there are many other indicators that improve the financial performance of a company.","companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange in 2017- 2020) leny suzan faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia lenysuzan@telkomuniversity.ac.id camelia aini faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia cameliaaini@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id",
161,The Functionalities And Technologies Trends In  Developing Electronic Travel Aids For The Blind Or,"in all parts of the community, basic autonomous navigation is essential. the capability to navigate complicated environments allows people to achieve a wide range of physical and mental objectives. with minimal non-visual infrastructure, indoor navigation is a complicated cognitive and perceptual activity, unlike global positioning system (gps) infrastructure for outdoor navigation. blind or visually impaired people (bvip) require sophisticated technologies with inbuilt functionalities for obstacle detection and recognition and the identification of desired destinations like rooms, stairs, and elevators to better orient themselves and navigate in unfamiliar indoor environments. electronic travel aids (etas) have developed and offered exceptional navigation support for the bvip. etas increase opportunities for autonomous navigation by providing information regarding the surroundings in the indoor or outdoor environment, the user’s present position, and navigational instructions about the route to a targeted destination. however, less focus has been found in the literature on integrating several functions in etas to have a more comprehensive system that supports indoor navigation activity of bvip to facilitate the mobility of bvip. this study provides a thorough review of previously developed etas using two main criteria: the used technologies and the fulfilled functions. based on the review findings, this study suggests future research path of technological instrumentation for the bvip’ eta solutions in indoor navigation.","indoor positioning, obstacle avoidance",,"visually impaired people: a review heba quteineh and in-ju kim faculty of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, uae hquteineh@sharjah.ac.ae, ikim@sharjah.ac.ae",
162,Implementation Of Risk Management In South African  Manufacturing Firms,"the manufacturing sector has become one of the competitive industries. the demands of a competitive business environment require business firms to be able to respond well to uncertainties. the study aimed to identify the risks and the risk management strategies in the south african manufacturing environment. the study used survey questionnaire to collect quantitative and qualitative data required to answer the research questions. the collected data was analysed through grouping of themes, proportional analysis and descriptive statistics. the research results indicated that risks experienced in manufacturing firms are strategic risks, operational risks, financial risks and hazardous risks. the study found that the risk management strategies employed by the majority of the firms are precautionary risk management strategies and risk informed strategies, where with precautionary risk strategy, mitigation measures are taken even though the causes and the effects of the suspected risks are not fully proven and with risk informed strategies the organization’s risk appetite, risk culture and risk governance are taken into consideration when addressing risks. the research further found that manufacturing firms are more familiar with risk management tools like fmea, risk matrix approach and brainstorming.","risk, risk management, manufacturing",,"esinalo monakali, bheki b.s makhanya and hannelie nel postgraduate school of engineering management, university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa esinalo.monakali@gmail.com, bheki.makhanya@transnet.net, hannelien@uj.ac.za","References

164,Digital Disruption: Bridge To Organizational Resilience  Rini Setiawati,"this study reviews the literature on digital transformation involving millennials reshaping the concept of digital technology adoption to build and improve skills and implications for organizational resilience. we searched an online database with an extensive repository of academic studies written in english and fully accessible to the authors. the articles were reviewed by taylor & francis, emerald, igi-global, and springer. this study used extracts from 21 journals, and the results were reviewed and examined to answer this research question. the identified articles were screened using the selected eligibility criteria. the results of all studies state that they are consistent in contributing to the organization's sustainable competitive advantage. when digital change is so fast, the only way to balance and maintain the organization's lifelong sustainability is to engage in lifelong learning that synergizes with technological elements in its interactions.","ambidexterity, disruption","Organizational practices toward digital systems have played an essential role in the needs of the business world. They have influenced the rules of business competition and business models in global industries, which are the core competitive factors in sustainable development. The organization sees Ambidexterity as an asset that is prepared to compete in the future, which is to have a unique signature process that is not easily imitated and produces organizational expertise and a current organizational resilience. It is necessary to have elements of integration that can ensure the level of adjustment and alignment in the context of digital transformation in collaboration with a unique set of millennial characteristics. Therefore, companies need to provide flexible space that can balance organizational dynamics through the involvement of millennials in their business units because they consider digital elements part of their personality. A personality can direct a business by thinking, acting, learning, understanding, and operating as the foundation for creating and developing long-term business profits. This means the demographic bonus owned by Indonesia will provide opportunities through the role of the millennial generation. On the other hand, the demographic bonus will threaten the organization if it does not have digital adaptive abilities. Thus, this is what strengthens organizational resilience and forms the influencing power in the eyes of global competition.","business management program, management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 rini.setiawati001@binus.ac.id friska mastarida business management program, management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 friska.mastarida@binus.ac.id hasri nirmala management program, accounting department dharma persada university, jakarta, indonesia 13450 hasri_nirmala@fe.unsada.ac.id",
165,Personal Protective Equipment For Health Workers From  Virus Transmission: The Effect Of Temperature Of Working,"the use of personal protective equipment (ppe) can prevent the transmission of covid-19. however, it also has the potential to cause excessive physiological responses. this study aims to investigate the effect of the physical work environment (temperature) on physiological responses related to activities using level iii ppe for handling covid- 19 with laboratory experiments. twelve participants (age 23.7 ± 2.4 years, bmi 24.3 ± 3.3 kg/m2) wore level iii ppe and carried out simulated activities in three different working temperatures (20 ᵒc, 25 ᵒc and 30 ᵒc with relative humidity 50 ± 10 %). the experimental activities consisted of walking on a treadmill (speed of 2.9 km/hour), filling out logic-base puzzles, walking on a treadmill, filling out logic-base puzzles, walking on a treadmill, and bedding. each activity was carried out for 9 minutes and the transfer time was 1 minute. at the end of each activity, physiological responses were measured including heart rate, oxygen consumption, and blood pressure. the results of this study show that working temperature had a significant effect on heart rate (p=0.002) and systolic blood pressure (p=0.043) but had no significant effect on oxygen consumption (p=0.411). a post-hoc analysis demonstrates that the working temperature of 30 ᵒc had effects that were different from the other two conditions. it is concluded that wearing a ppe at a relatively high working temperature can result in undue physiological strains. findings of this study can be used as a basis for work and ppe redesigns.",covid-19,"This study was conducted to evaluate the physiological response experienced by health workers when doing work dealing with COVID-19 patients using level III PPE in places with different working environment conditions, namely at temperatures of 20 ᵒC, 25 ᵒC and 30 ᵒC with RH (50 ± 10) %. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory to obtain controlled research variables. Respondents were taken from S1 and S2 ITB students with age range of (23.7 ± 2.4) years and BMI of (24.3 ± 3.3) kg/m2. The experimental protocol is designed to describe the activities that health workers usually do at work, namely physical activity, activities that require concentration and dexterity of the hands. Analysis of variance on experimental results showed that there was an influence of simulated working environment temperature (20 ᵒC, 25 ᵒC and 30 ᵒC) on heart rate and systolic blood pressure and there was no effect on oxygen consumption and diastolic blood pressure. Post hoc analysis of the physiological response at a working environment temperature of 30 ᵒC is different from other working environments (temperatures of 20 ᵒC and 25 ᵒC). Based on the analysis of the experimental results, it can be concluded that wearing PPE at a relatively high working temperature can result in undue physiological tension. The findings of this study can be used as the basis for the work and redesign of PPE.","environment on physiological responses totong totong, herman rahadian soetisna, hardianto iridiastadi faculty of industrial technology institut teknologi bandung bandung, indonesia totongtaqy@gmail.com, hermanrs@ti.itb.ac.id, hiridias@vt.edu",
166,International Labour Law Perspectives On The Metaverse   Muhammad Reza Syariffudin Zaki,"the abrupt transition to remote work caused by the covid-19 pandemic brought with it increased reliance on artificial intelligence as virtually all facets of the employment lifecycle shifted from in-person to remote. the pandemic also opened the door for new ai to gain traction as employers sought ways to enhance the productivity and experience of the virtual workforce. therefore, a new phenomenon emerged called metaverse. metaverse is a post-reality universe, an immutable and persistent multiuser environment that combines physical reality with digital virtuality. it is based on the convergence of technologies enabling multisensory interactions with virtual environments, digital objects and people such as virtual reality (vr) and augmented reality (ar). therefore, metaverse is an interconnected network of social. business and employee interactions are also new things that can be developed in the metaverse therefore this research is entitled “international labour law perspectives on the metaverse”, by using a descriptive juridical research method through a statutory approach and a conceptual framework. the research question is whether private international law already protects the workforce or does working in the metaverse require a whole new rulebook? this research will look at how to regulate the metaverse in international labour law.","metaverse, covid-19",,"lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university, indonesia jakarta, indonesia 11480 muhammad.zaki@binus.ac.id paulus aluk fadjar dwi santo lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university, indonesia jakarta, indonesia 11480 paulus_afds@binus.edu hendra undergraduate business law department, faculty of humanities bina nusantara university, indonesia jakarta, indonesia 11480 hendra012@binus.ac.id","References

167,Identifying The Integration Of Confucianism Into Chinese  Corporate Culture: A Referential Review,"a corporate culture without core values to support it will only be a mere formality and suffer from lack of intrinsic vitality. this condition will make companies more vulnerable to market volatility and drowned in conflicts of interest, which will put the company at disadvantage. chinese companies that are still growing need to explore and set their own core values that are crucial to the company’s survival. adhering to the moral and ethical principles established by the traditional chinese culture, and at the same time, adapting with contemporary chinese culture become the main challenge for the companies in developing their corporate culture. confucianism, created by confucius, is the core of traditional chinese culture and plays an important role in the formation and development of chinese society. it is important to refer to confucianism as the foundation when building a chinese corporate culture. this paper tries to answer two research questions: 1) which elements of confucianism play a role in chinese companies; 2) what impact does confucianism have on chinese companies? this study concludes that a corporate culture that is well integrated with the traditional chinese culture, like confucianism, is likely to make the company stronger.","confucianism, corporate culture, core values","Basically, companies need to give full trust to the internal employees. The appointed leaders should provide good example, create fun work environment for the employees, and avoid command management to make all the employees excited to develop their potential, showcase their talent, work hard to surpass their own limit, and do their best for the company. Furthermore, the leaders should also be able to promote others, let the employees manage themselves, and train the employees to consciously develop their behavior and habit to stay in healthy market competition corridor and protect the social and public interest. 7.

168,Share Ownership Structure And Its Implication Towards  Directors Independency In Conflict Of Interest Transaction,"the board of directors is an essential part in running a company, especially because of its authority over the control and management of company activities, which involves a lot of information. directors drive the company towards its goals and visions, by moving it to accomplish its missions. one of the manifestation of its importance can be seen in the aspect of disclosure. as the one who manages important information, disclosure is undeniably critical, either for the shareholders, government, or the people. the directors’ ability to disclose important information is one of the benchmarks for the independence of the directors. this independence is influenced by shareholders, whose composition is defined through a share ownership structure. the share ownership structure itself can be classified according to the legal system in that country, which makes the different share ownership structure could be identified through a country’s legal system. whereas directors’ independency can be identified through a conflict of interest transaction, where the directors play a significant role in preventing potential losses, namely through disclosure. this paper aims to show the relationship between share ownership structure and the independence of directors from the perspective of conflict of interest transactions in indonesia and australia to show which share ownership structure is better to be implemented. the results found are that a dispersed share ownership structure that exists in common law countries implies better directors’ independency, and that directors in australia show better disclosure accompanied by greater responsibility based on conflict of interest regulations.","disclosure, directors",,"in indonesia and australia agus riyanto lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia agusriyanto@msn.com, agus.riyanto@binus.ac.id miranda carolina business law department, faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia miranda.carolina@binus.ac.id abdul rasyid lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia arasyid@binus.edu cc",

170,Design And Test Of Learning Effectiveness Using The  “Ledu” Comic Media Application Prototype In Improving,"in this era of globalization, technology is very much needed, especially in the world of education. to improve the quality of learning, many tools can be used to support the quality of learning, one of which is using media as a teaching aid. this study aims to analyse the effect of comic media mobile application on chinese grammatical competence among chinese learners. this study uses a quantitative descriptive approach, and purposive sampling determined the sample. the research instrument used was the test (pre-test and post-test) and the questionnaire. the data analysis method used to test the hypothesis is the pre-test-post-test using the t-test (paired sample test) and the normality test. after the pre-test, the research subjects were asked to try the comic media application “ledu” for two weeks. through the post-test results, the average value of the research subjects increased from 74 to 87.23. the t-test on the correlation between the pre-test and post-test scores shows a correlation between the two variables, and the t-test data shows the value of sig. (2-tailed) is 0.000<0.005, indicating that the “ledu” comic media application prototype significantly affects learning chinese grammatical competence. the questionnaire data also shows that the respondents responded positively to 3 aspects, user interest, content quality, and application usability.","chinese, comic media, ledu","Based on the results of the previous research and discussion, the researchers concluded that there was a significant influence in the use of comic learning media applications on the study of Chinese language learning. This is also evidenced s of the calculation of the paired samples test, that the value of Sig. (2-tailed) is 0.000 < 0.005, which proves a significant influence on using the LeDu comic learning media application. In addition, it can also be seen that the average value of the pre-test is smaller than the average value of the post-test, namely 74 < 87.23, which means that there is a significant increase in the value of the research subject. Based on the results of research data processing, the LeDu comic media application can be used as an alternative to improve Mandarin grammar skills for learning Chinese. The LeDu funny media application can also be an alternative for Chinese language learners in previewing material. This mobile app will help make it easier for the teacher to explain the material’s content. Still, it can also help students better understand the material’s content before getting an explanation from the teacher so that if there are difficulties in the material, they can be asked to the class lecturer when teaching and learning activities are carried out. The LeDu comic media application can also be an alternative for students to review lessons. Suggestions for developing the LeDu application and future research are to be able to conduct research on comic learning media with different designs. Presumably, it can improve learning outcomes for elementary-level Chinese learners or those who do not have Chinese language skills.

171,Design Of The “Xingsong” Song-Based Learning Application  Prototype And Its Implementation In Chinese Language,"researchers sparked the idea of designing a song-based learning application concept to get responses in the form of input from research samples to develop better learning applications in the future. learning media in the form of songs have been used in classroom learning. digital transformation in education into music technology as an innovative learning media. the research was conducted using a qualitative-descriptive method that begins with depth interviews, distributing questionnaires, and then using the data obtained from the user experience. based on the results of the initial user survey, it is known that there are four classifications of learning difficulties in mandarin, including problems in remembering han characters, grammatical errors, difficulties in pronouncing han characters, and challenges in hearing recorded mandarin conversations. based on the needs survey, the initial design of the song- based application prototype, xingsong, features a song list and music player, vocabulary list, practice, and quiz (including pinyin writing, fill in the blanks, and reading), speech recognition, and downloadable pdf writing practice. the xingsong application received a positive response from respondents as an innovation in chinese learning applications. based on testing the xingsong application prototype, researchers received input on application development regarding design aesthetics and content that can adapt to each user’s chinese language skills.","chinese language, xingsong, song-based, learning media","The initial survey showed that the general difficulties in learning basic Chinese could be classified into four: difficulty remembering Han characters, grammatical errors, problems pronouncing Han characters, and difficulty hearing recorded Mandarin conversations. Based on these problems, the researchers made a prototype design for the XingSong application, hoping to overcome these problems with a song-based language learning approach. The features presented in this application prototype include a song list and music player, vocabulary list, practice, and quiz (including Pinyin Writing, fill in the blanks, and reading), speech recognition, and downloadable PDF writing practice. Based on the survey results of testing the XingSong application prototype, it can be concluded that this application prototype is an innovation for Chinese learning applications, especially in song-based Chinese learning. The XingSong application prototype received a positive response from respondents. Despite receiving a positive response, this application prototype still has many shortcomings in design aesthetics and content leveling. In the XingSong application prototype, there is no fix for every user’s answer error, and there is still no feature for the user’s Mandarin level division to select songs. While in the design section, this XingSong application still needs many improvements in choosing the background color, the layout of the features in the application, and the design of each song lyrics video displayed. Some of these inputs will be carried out in the application development stage. They will be supported by experimental-based trials to test the effectiveness of the XingSong application in learning Chinese.

172,"Industry 4.0 And Last Mile Logistics, New  Challenges And Approaches: A Bibliometric Review","discussions about the relationship between the fourth industrial revolution, also called industry 4.0, and last mile logistics are an issue that has grown over time due to the development of new technologies that take on new industries and the lack of processes and innovation to accompany the evolution of industry 4.0 and cover optimization needs in the last mile of the logistics chain. this article's main objective is to research the new challenges and approaches that arise in this fourth industrial revolution to face and optimize the last mile of the logistics chain. to fulfill this purpose, a systematic literature review was carried out, as well as a bibliometric analysis. 100 articles were reviewed in detail, the origin of these articles is 100% scopus to ensure quality content in the research. the results show a constant development of the technologies that make up industry 4.0 in organizations worldwide, which leads to large-scale growth, thus resulting in the need for process optimization for last-mile logistics.","industry 4.0, new industry","The present research study has focused on a topic that has not been fully explored and related because it is in a constant transition of research and technological innovation that allows it to be adapted to the needs of the subject under study. The context of the Last Mile has demanded the need to implement new technological tools of Industry 4.0, tools such as Machine Learning, IoT and Big Data have facilitated and provided the optimization of various processes involved in the last mile, in addition they have served as a starting point for the exploration and implementation of new solutions. However, there are limitations and disadvantages that directly and indirectly affect the traditional development of last mile logistics, so it is important to focus future research on the adaptation and role that Industry 4.0 tools take. It is important to make impetus on the comprehensive analysis conducted of the role of Industry 4.0 in the large number of studies of last mile logistics through a systematic literature review approach. Currently, large companies are looking for Industry 4.0 coupling as part of the digital transformation process to obtain current optimization methods that easily adapt to future changes. The reading indicates that the development of new platforms, methods and means to be used in the development of last mile logistics are directly related to the digitization and virtualization used by its tools, since these provide flexibility and a quick adaptation level that serve as an answer to the needs of the companies. Finally, after performing the bibliometric and statistical analysis, it is evident that the research of Industry 4.0 tools for the benefit of last mile logistics is constantly growing and is still a niche with great potential for exploitation. It is now where companies are responsible for implementing the tools provided by Industry 4.0, adapting them to their digital transformation process and developing research for the benefit of optimizing their processes in the last mile of their logistics. The suggested review is designed to explain the link between Industry 4.0 and Last Mile Logistics and the implication of its tools for the development of new methods that can be implemented in the future.","diego jair jacay-aldui, gerson paúl candela-pomé, facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú, 20141906@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20151702@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, martin fidel collao-díaz, juan carlos quiroz- flores, research professors facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú mcollao@ulima.edu.pe, jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",

175,Comparative Analysis Of Chinese And Indonesian Stateowned Enterprise Reform,"numerous research has pointed to the significant roles of state-owned enterprises (soes) in driving economic growth in asia, particularly in the 1980s. such enterprises have immensely benefited from both state support and legal and natural monopolies, often at the expense of crowding out private sector growth and investment. the 1997-1998 asian financial crisis, however, have exposed many countries to the fact that it can no longer rely solely on soes. there has been pressure to reform its soes, to improve its competitiveness or even privatize. soe reform in china and indonesia provide interesting case studies, considering their dominance in key sectors, and extent and scope of state influence. soes in both countries remain obliged, to this day, to deliver political and social objectives while expected to generate profits. this paper, therefore, aims at performing a comparative analysis of soe reform in both countries during the period of 2010-2020, with a view of examining governance and financial management changes as consequences and products of reform. questions to be answered in this paper include: 1) what considerations for reform are; 2) how soe governance change as consequence of reform; and 3) extent of financial management and operational changes that soes experience.","indonesia, china, reform","The research began with attempting to draw a correlation between changes in leadership, changes in economic setting to the need and immediacy of reform. While in 2010-2020 both Indonesia and China underwent political leadership changes, reform history has begun prior to their election and there had been little correlation with the motivation for reform. The changes in political economic settings, however, had altered the direction and the manner of the reforms. President Xi Jinping had instructed SOEs to be the center of innovation while Indonesian SOEs are expected by President Joko Widodo to propel growth in the infrastructure sector. In China state influence has been diluted, as a supervisory commission is created to monitor performance, and alignment to party policies are ensured through selection of top individuals. In Indonesia this is not the case. The Chinese SOE reform strategy has conceivably contributed to better SOE performance – domestically and internationally, while Indonesia needs to introduce some measurement of performance.

179,Analysis Of Non-Financial Factors On Timeliness Of Financial  Statement Submission (Study Of Consumer Cyclical,"financial statements contain company information from a financial perspective that can be used as a basis for decision- making. one of the characteristics is that quality financial reports must have been timely so that the information contained can be useful. timely submission of financial reports is one of the company's responsibilities to the public, investors, and other related parties. the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the audit committee, public ownership, independent commissioners, the operational complexity, and the age of the company on the timeliness of submitting financial statements, both simultaneously and partially. the population of this study is the consumer cyclical sector companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange for the 2016-2020 period. purposive sampling was utilized as the sampling method in this study. 55 companies composed the study's sample. using spss version 25, descriptive analysis, and logistic regression analysis are the data analysis techniques used. according to the study's findings, the audit committee, public ownership, independent commissioners, the operational complexity, and the company age all have an impact on the timeliness of submitting financial statements. partially, he the audit committee, public ownership, and independent commissioners all have a significant negative effect on the timeliness of submitting financial statements. then, the operational complexity and the company age have no significant effect on the timeliness of financial statement submission.",age,"The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the audit committee, public ownership, independent commissioners, the operational complexity, and company age on the timeliness of submitting financial statements, both simultaneously and partially in consumer cyclical sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. The sample in this study was 55 companies with 5 years research period and total of 255 observation units processed. Due to the presence of 20 units which were outlier data so that they were removed during the test. Based on the findings of the research, five independent variables in this study have an impact on the timely submission of financial reports simultaneously. Partially, Audit committee, Public Ownership, and Independent Commissioners have a significant negative effect on the timeliness of submitting financial statements. While the Operational Complexity and Company Age have no significant impact on the timeliness of submitting financial statements. The novelty of this study is believed by the author to contribute to advancing the current literature on financial studies and company performance and can be useful for business practitioners to apply. Companies are expected to pay more attention to applicable regulations for business activities to run smoothly and receive positive responses from all parties involved. There is still 69.7% of variables that can explain the timely submission of financial statements, it is suggested that future research consider other variables that are not included in this study. Author suggests using qualitative data such as interviews with management regarding the submission of financial statement and other variables not in this study. This research has limitations and is expected to be an idea for further research. The independent variable in this study focuses on the company's internal parties as managers and the external parties are only public ownership. It is hoped that external parties and other internal parties can be included in future research.","companies listed on indonesia stock exchange 2016-2020) novita aulia regine perdana, muhamad muslih, wahdan arum inawati department of accounting faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia novitaauliaegi@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, muhamadmuslih@telkomuniversity.ac.id, wahdanaruminawati@telkomuniversity.ac.id,",

181,Estimating Project Costs And Time Under Uncertainties: A  Stochastic Model For Inflation And Supply Changes During,"rising inflation rates have influenced the profitability of many ongoing projects in many economies in 2022. in addition, supply shortages due to the covid19 pandemic have delayed many projects. accurate estimation of project time and costs for a project bid in such uncertainties minimizes the risks of financial losses incurred in an awarded project. conversely, the failure to anticipate the changes in prices and supplies in estimation models decreases the profitability and continuance of awarded projects, leading to some ripple effects in society. this paper examines the stochastic model to include inflation and supply shortage in estimation models. it suggests a solution for project estimators to estimate project costs and time more accurately, given the risks of rising inflation and supply shortage.","risk, estimation, stochastic","Budget or cost-effectiveness is crucial in projects with budget constraints. It refers to achieving the project objectives at minimal costs (Visconti, 2012). However, when the annual project costs and inflation increase, the budget is insufficient to complete the project within the life cycle. Specifically, suppose the project customer has planned an annual payment of $20,000 for a project contractor. In that case, a reserve fund of $100,000 for the project is insufficient due to changes in yearly cost flows and inflation rate. The simulation results in this paper indicate that three-estimate costs (min, most likely, max costs) and stochastic inflation rates, assumed to have a normal distribution (i.e., mean of 3% with 0.003 standard deviation) increase the total project cost by 33%. This result is close to the allowable contingency of 35% as suggested by Project Management Institute. This finding is helpful for a contract estimator in hedging against inflation and cost changes. Alternatively, the project owner should add more cash to the future annual payments to adjust for increasing inflation rate instead of planning a fixed annual payment for the contractor. The cost estimator should also consider the pessimistic scenario of maximum annual costs due to any uncertainty of input prices.","and after the covid19 pandemic tung nhu nguyen lecturer, school of business international university – vietnam national university ho chi minh city ho chi minh city, vietnam nntung@hcmiu.edu.vn",

185,Legal Construction And Responsibility Of Teleconsultation  Based Health Services,"telemedicine development. such developments are new in indonesia, so that opening up opportunities for potential unprepared legal regulations that cause problems in terms of the construction of the underlying agreement and liability to patients as consumers of digital platforms and doctor who are binding to providing these services. this paper answers questions about these two things. the results of the study show that the triangular agreement between patients, doctors, and digital platform providers is a teleconsultation agreement, which is a form of mix agreement between a standard of therapeutic agreement, a standard of use application agreement and partnership of health sevice provider agreement that utilizes digital technology. in this case, there is the main agreement and an accompanying agreement. the main agreement is a therapeutic agreement between a doctor and a patient and the accompanying agreement is a standard agreement that binds all three parties. in the event of a violation of the patient's rights, both the doctor and the platform provider can be held responsible together, which is known as joint liability.","liability, teleconsultation, mix agreement","1) The conclusion that can be drawn is that the agreement that occurs in teleconsultation is unique because there are three different parties related to each other and each party has an interrelated agreement. The author constructs an electronic consultation agreement, this can be supported by arguments: 1. There are three parties to teleconsultation, namely: doctors, patients, and platforms. 2. There are three agreements, standardized therapeutic agreements, standard application use agreements and health service provider partnership agreements 3. The first agreement is a standard agreement on the use of an application that has fulfilled the conditions for a valid agreement in accordance with Article 1320 of the Civil Code in this case between doctors, patients and the platform. This agreement is written in electronic form which will emphasize that the platform will be a liaison between doctors and patients. 4. The second agreement is a standardized therapeutic agreement as the basis for the relationship between the doctor and the patient, even though the two are not face-to-face or face-to-face, because basically when a patient sees a doctor to be diagnosed, a therapeutic agreement has occurred even though in this case both parties, namely the doctor and the patient brought together or connected by a platform with interactions defined by the platform. 5. Health service provider partnership agreement. This agreement applies between the doctor and the partnering platform. Doctors will provide health services by using an application facilitated by the platform. 6. From the agreement that occurs, it can be seen that the therapeutic agreement is the main agreement because the patient's intention from the beginning to take treatment and the standard agreement here binds the parties to each other. Like the main agreement when the patient and doctor cancel the therapeutic agreement, the additional agreement, namely the standard agreement, will also be canceled. However, patients who make 1808","tio ariesta business law program, faculty of humanities bina nusantara university dki jakarta, 11480, indonesia tioariesta13@gmail.com shidarta associate professor, business law progrem, law department bina nusantara university dki jakarta, 11480, indonesia shidarta@binus.edu","References

189,Declaration Of Directors As An Alternative To Substitute For  Gmis In Conflict-Of-Interest Transactions: Comparative,"in indonesia, the gmis is used as an instrument to determine the implementation of conflict-of-interest transactions attended by independent shareholders. however, in practice, it is found that there are many weaknesses in the implementation of the gmis, so it becomes questionable whether the gmis has protected the independent shareholders by the provisions in article 11 paragraph (1) pojk no. 42/pojk.04/2020 and has prevented the occurrence of violations of conflict-of-interest transactions. thus, research is carried out using a normative juridical method through legal comparisons with the united kingdom as a country that uses the board of directors declaration instrument which does not involve shareholders in its approval, but from directors who do not have a conflict-of- interest. the board of directors' statement is considered to have advantages that the gmis does not have in terms of character, procedures, and approvals. this paper aims to determine whether the instrument of the gmis has protected the independent shareholders and to find out whether the declaration of the board of directors can be used as an alternative to the gmis in indonesia. the results found from this research can be used as a reflection for each stakeholder on the conflict-of-interest transaction regarding the instruments used before the conflict-of-interest transaction is carried out.",gmis,,"study agus riyanto lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 agusriyanto@msn.com, agus.riyanto@binus.ac.id naurah impies aurellia student, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 naurah.aurellia@binus.ac.id abdul rasyid lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 arasyid@binus.edu",
190,Regulation Of Conflict Of Interest Transaction And  Implications For The Position Of Independent Shareholders In,"in the indonesian capital market, normatively, the position of independent shareholder in conflict-of-interest transaction is as strong party that approves or disapproves the conflict of interest transaction. however, the substance of the regulation regarding to conflict of interest transaction from 1991 to 2020 has not protected independent shareholders. where, the approval of independent shareholders is not always identical to their strong position, which in practice the director, commissioner, or major shareholder overrides the provisions of the conflict of interest transaction, namely without prior approval from independent shareholders. apart from that, there are six other factors that indicate that independent shareholder in conflict-of-interest transaction have a weak position. the weakness arises usually because the independent shareholders only learn about the loss of the transaction after the conflict-of-interest transaction has been carried out. these weakness include: 1) the concentrated shareholdings system that adopted by indonesia; 2) the difficulty of bapepam (now financial service authority) fsa)) to monitor the public company before conducting a conflict of interest; 3) the occurrence of nominee practices in conflict of interest transaction; 4) no matter how many independent shareholders are present, they are unable to affect the continuity of general meeting of shareholder (gms) and voting keep been carried out; 5) not fulfilling the applicable conflict of interest procedures and regulations, especially the approval of independent shareholders in the gms; and 6) law enforcement against public companies who violate the provisions of conflict of interest transaction so far does not provide a deterrent effect. thus, it is urgent for capital market regulators to be able to make a clear and specific arrangement for independent shareholders to be protected from all transaction decisions containing conflict of interest that are dominated by subjective elements of the board of directors to the detriment of independent shareholders and the company.",,"It can be concluded that, the history of the regulation of conflict-of-interest transactions was actually made to protect independent shareholders, but along with the development of changes in these regulations in practice, many of them are overridden by the interests of the Board of Directors, Commissioners and Major shareholders. As the Board of Directors and its staff are an extension of the majority shareholders. To straighten out the purpose of regulating conflict of interest transactions to protect independent shareholders, two things are needed: 1. It is urgent for Capital Market regulators to make more specific laws and regulations regarding conflict-of- interest transactions, learning from conflict-of-interest transaction cases that have occurred since 1991 until 2020. Namely by not to favor of majority shareholders whose votes can dominate company decisions through the GMS. 2. Realizing transaction transparency, transaction fairness and changing the repressive law enforcement system for violators of Capital Market regulations, especially conflict of interest transactions, to preventive as an effort to fulfil the rights and protect independent shareholders from their weak position.","the indonesian capital market agus riyanto lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia agus.riyanto@binus.ac.id anggun dwi marcella business law department, faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia anggun.marcella@binus.ac.id abdul rasyid lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia arasyid@binus.edu",
191,Ranking University’S Academic Departments Based On  Research Performance: A Comparative Study Of Mcdm,"in today’s modern world, universities are competing to improve their competitiveness worldwide. it is usually indicated by ranking systems. several ranking systems also vary depending on the evaluated aspects. in indonesia, a university ranking system is often associated with the accreditation ensuring the quality of education. a rapid quality education improvement is appropriately implemented in public universities. however, this will bring more challenges for private universities as they are usually possessing limited resources. accordingly, an effective decision-making system should be proposed, especially to assist private university achieving their goals. this study aims to evaluate academic departments in terms of research output in a university using the multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) methods. to develop the model, a case study in an indonesian private university with 16 undergraduate programs was demonstrated. the anp method is selected to construct a hierarchical structure and to obtain the weights of the criteria. then, a comparative study is conducted applying fuzzy topsis, fuzzy saw, and fuzzy edas to rank the departments. in this study, six criteria were identified, while the greatest weight was the citation criterion. besides, these three methods also presented consistent ranks for the best and the worst performing departments. practically, the results can later be adopted by the decision-makers (dms) in the university to determine the priority-based strategies to accelerate improvements for the quality of education subject to limited resources.","education, mcdm","This study has developed a decision-making model to evaluate a university performance at the department level. In addition, this research has compared several MCDM methods which are relevant and practically applicable to solve this case. In this study, the ANP method was selected to weight the identified criteria since it is able to consider the interdependent relationships between criteria and sub-criteria. The obtained weights indicated that the citation criterion was the most influencing criterion among the others. Subsequently, the three methods selected to rank the departments – F-TOPSIS, F-SAW, and F-EDAS – have determined the departments’ ranking aggregated with geomean values. As each method has its respective principle, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the stability of the decision- making result. Based on the sensitivity results, the F-SAW method shows a stable rank when uncertainty occurs. Also, all methods indicate consistent ranking especially for both departments at the top and lower positions. This study focuses on research output criteria to evaluate the performance. However, it is encouraged to include other aspects such as teaching and learning aspects and university’s impacts to obtain the thorough performance.","methods v. reza bayu kurniawan, dyah ari susanti, kusmendar, edi susanto, and fatah nur hasyim department of industrial engineering universitas sarjanawiyata tamansiswa indonesia reza.kurniawan@ustjogja.ac.id, dyah.as@ustjogja.ac.id, kusmendar@ustjogja.ac.id, edisusan019@gmail.com, pedotfatah@gmail.com",

193,Percentage Of Free Float Value And Its Implications  Towards Issuers' Obligations In Capital Market,"the capital market can be said to be developed and developing if the involvement of the public is greater than the share ownership of the founders. public share ownership is a reflection of democratization that business entities are no longer owned by a few people but have opened up opportunities to be distributed equally according to their share ownership. the way in that direction was opened by requiring every public company to sell its shares in a certain amount, known as free float. unfortunately, free float regulations in indonesia are not ideal compared to other countries, this can be said considering the weak legal force of the surat keputusan direksi pt bursa efek indonesia no. kep-00101/bei/12-2021 article v. this paper aims to find the latest views in the literature regarding the percentage ratio of free floats that can realize the sustainability of the capital market in indonesia by using a comparative juridical normative method of regulations and legal decisions in indonesia, germany, netherlands, united kingdom and australia. the results of this paper indicate that the regulation of free float in indonesia is not ideal when compared to other countries to be able to support the sustainability of the capital market in indonesia. this is due to the very small percentage of shares required to free float in indonesia, the absence of strict sanctions, and the phrase ""dapat (can)"" which has weak legal force. if this arrangement is not revised, it can cause a massive failure of public companies to meet the minimum free float percentage obligation, resulting in low market appreciation for shares and low price returns and stock liquidity.","sustainability, capital market, percentage ratio, free float. 1866",,"agus riyanto lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia agusriyanto@msn.com, agus.riyanto@binus.ac.id rahma christabel abilah business law department, faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia rahma.abilah@binus.ac.id abdul rasyid lecturer, business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia arasyid@binus.edu",

Therefore, it is vital to analyze the risks in the warehouse so that business processes can run well. The carried out risk identification includes occupational safety and health risks with a risk matrix assessment that produces 40 risks. Although the residual risk generated has been reduced from 40 to 19 risks, the risk remains the organization's responsibility. Occupational safety and health in this organization or company also include company policies as stated in the company's QHSE policy.

195,The Behavioural Intention In E-Sports Spectators: Sor  Model Implementation,"e-sports have grown all over the world, as well as events and their audience. based on many previous studies, many factors influence the motivation of viewers on their behavior in watching e-sports; several factors have been shown to affect the motivation to watch, such as entertaining features, competitive nature, game knowledge, and skill appreciation. thus, the researchers decided to conduct further research on the topic of e-sports with the sor model. the research method used is quantitative with a purposive sampling method. the size of the population selected and used in this study is quite large, especially for e-sports lovers in indonesia. researchers distributed online questionnaires through google forms and distributed through social media and acquired 221 respondents. the data that were obtained were analyzed using the smartpls application to test the validity and reliability, descriptive statistics, and structural models (inner model). this study applies the sor model as well as motivational factors from previous studies as a stimulus. the research findings show that the stimulation of motivation is positively related to organisms and response. this study has implications for creating interest and becoming suggestions for companies that provide e-sports events, for the community, for fans, and for further research.","competitive nature, game knowledge, skill appreciation","E-sports can be said to have become an interesting topic to discuss, which is not just a game but also a form of entertainment and watching activities become something that is inherent in the world. In this study, the SOR model and quantitative methods were used to analyze several variables that could affect the intensity of watching E-sports. Based on the analysis that has been done, it can be concluded that there is only 1 variable that affects the intention to watch E-sport events, namely Entertaining Features. The Entertaining Features variable affects the intention to watch E-sports events directly by being influenced by the Flow Experience and Subjective Well- Being variables. Entertainment or entertainment can be said to be a common intake for human life, where this can reduce stress, especially the respondents feel a pleasant experience and get new insights, especially in the world of E-sports. The Game Knowledge variable is positively correlated with Subjective well-being. So, there are only 5 hypotheses that can be accepted. The results also show that flow experience and subjective well-being in e-sports have a very important contribution to behavioral intention in watching esports. An interesting result in this study is that game knowledge is positively correlated with subjective well-being but not with stream experience. These results indicate that a positive correlation between flow experience and subjective well-being shows that the audience's behavioral intention requires an experience in which there is a sense of interest and curiosity, as well as the behavior of the e-sports audience itself. 6. Implication & Future Research 6.1 Implication This study was conducted to determine the variables that significantly influence the intention to watch E-sports through Flow Experience and Subjective Well-Being, which act as mediating variables using the SOR model. Based on the analysis that has been carried out, this study reaches the conclusion which shows that only the Entertaining Features variable has a significant effect on the intention to watch E-sports. This shows that the scope of society in Indonesia has the intention to watch, which is influenced by the entertainment aspect. Our study has implications for the field of research by filling gaps that have not been found in previous research related to the topic of e-sports, where there is very little research, especially in Indonesia. The next implication is in the business sector, where with this research, e-sport event providers can better understand the needs and desires of their audience regarding the content they present and can see from the existing demographics that the audience of E- Sport events is quite diverse, especially in the range age and occupation so that the content provided must be suitable for all ages and label if there is content that is not suitable for children and is no exception for the audience of the E-sport event itself. With this research, e-sports organizers can focus more on the entertainment provided because it is the most significant stimulant to the experience gained and subjective well-being, where subject and flow are very important in behavioral intention to watch e-sports. So, it is hoped that this research can help organizers in making decisions. 6.2 Future Research The research and writing of the results of this study also have the intention of being material for consideration and learning from further studies. The limitations of this study are such as the limitations of space and time. The author has limitations by only being able to conduct research in Indonesia. However, as is well known, the popularity of e-sports does not only exist in Indonesia but in all parts of the world so that further research can be carried out in various other places and even in more specific locations and taking into account the conditions and situations of e-sports, which will of course always evolve over time.

An  Empirical Evidence From Financial Companies In Indonesia,"intellectual capital (ic) has been widely studied in various countries, especially indonesia. however, there are still inconsistencies in research results. some researchers find evidence that ic has an effect on financial performance. some other researchers found results that ic had no effect on the company's financial performance. therefore, the researchers tried to conduct research on the effect of ic on the company's financial performance. this study uses a case study on the financial sector listed on the indonesia stock exchange (idx) for the period 2012-2021. the financial sector was chosen because it is considered to have the most intensive ic. in addition, this study also attempts to prove that each sub-sector has a different ic contribution to the company's financial performance. ic is measured using value added intellectual capital (vaic) while financial performance is measured using return on assets (roa), return on equity (roe) and market to book value (m/b). the control variables used in this study are size and leverage. this study uses panel regression analysis with the help of e-views. the results of the study are able to prove that ic has an effect on the company's financial performance as measured by roa and roe. meanwhile, ic has no effect on the company's financial performance as measured by using m/b. in addition, this study proves that each sub-sector has a different ic contribution to the company's financial performance. 1888",,"Based on the results of hypothesis testing, intellectual capital has a positive and significant effect on the company's financial performance as measured by using ROA and ROE. This is because the company has been able to realize the importance of investing in intellectual capital to increase the company's competitiveness. Companies in the financial sector have been able to optimize their intellectual capital so they can improve their company's financial performance. Meanwhile, intellectual capital has no effect on the company's financial performance as measured by M/B. This means that the investment market in Indonesia has not given trust to companies that invest in intellectual capital assets (intangible assets). This is because investors do not understand and consider the intellectual capital owned by the company as one of the considerations for making investment decisions. Based on the results of hypothesis testing, each sub-sector has a different effect on intellectual capital on the company's financial performance. This is because each sub-sector has different assets and capabilities, therefore each sub-sector will have a different strategy in determining the contribution of its assets and capabilities to compete effectively. Some companies will rely on intellectual capital, while others will rely more on financial or physical assets to build on their success. 1896","shiwi angelica cindiyasari department of accounting faculty of economic and business universitas teknokrat indonesia lampung, indonesia shiwi.angelica@teknokrat.ac.id eddy junarsin department of management faculty of economics and business universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta, indonesia john.junarsin@ugm.ac.id dhiona ayu nani department of accounting faculty of economic and business universitas teknokrat indonesia lampung, indonesia dhiona.a@teknokrat.ac.id elvina septiani department of accounting faculty of economic and business universitas teknokrat indonesia lampung, indonesia elvinaseptianii10@gmail.com","References

The independent and dependent variables have been identified, and the decision tree diagram has been constructed. Management commitment is the highest priority variable as management commitment to safety is a distinct and crucial component in an effective OSH management. The employee's attitude is the second highest prioritized data, while positive attitudes will support to strengthen the importance of safety procedures and equipment. Many successful companies have built strong safety cultures that have led to excellent and efficient work units. Research has shown that one way to build that kind of culture is to get the management and workers actively engaged and involved in safety related discussions, forums, employee suggestions etc. Recognition, fear, and self-awareness are the least prioritized variable in this study, but still, they are vital to an organizations OSH management system.",kanesan muthusamy faculty of engineering technology and built environment ucsi university kuala lumpur. malaysia kanesan@ucsiuniversity.edu.my liew meena faculty of engineering technology and built environment ucsi university kuala lumpur. malaysia 1001643275@ucsiuniversity.edu.my elango nataran faculty of engineering technology and built environment ucsi university kuala lumpur. malaysia elango@ucsiuniversity.edu.my victor nagesparan faculty of engineering technology and built environment ucsi university kuala lumpur. malaysia nagesparan@ ucsiuniversity.edu.my,
198,Innovation And Technology Readiness Level Of Mobile  Charging Station Swap Battery: A Conceptual Study,"electric vehicles can reduce pollution and lower the use of fossil fuel. however, currently, in indonesia, the supporting infrastructure for electric motorcycles is still very limited. the lack of infrastructure charging station for electric motorcycles causes some problems for the community to access power. this research develops an idea of mobile charging station swap battery technology (mcssb). apart from preparing infrastructure battery swap for the community, mcssb can be used as commercialization equipment for entrepreneurs. this study aims to determine the technology readiness level (trl) of mcssb. the results of the development of technological innovations are at the feasibility study stage. it means that attention should be paid to the aspects for technological feasibility, such as operational aspects, market aspects, environmental aspects, and organizational aspects. the trl calculation is at level 5, which means that the code validation and components are in a simulation environment.","swap battery, innovation","The increasing use of 2-wheeled electric vehicles is not matched by the existing infrastructure. The limited infrastructure for charging station swap batteries makes people anxious and worried. Therefore, the Mobile charging station swap battery for 2-wheeled electric vehicles is a new technology idea. MCSSB can be moved, flexible, and not bound by time. An analysis of the development of technological innovation and a rapid analysis of the level of technological readiness is carried out. The results obtained from the development of technological innovations at the feasibility study stage, in the cycle of development of a prototype, patenting and approval, production, marketing, and adoption stages cannot be implemented, because MCSSB technology is still about the concept. The level of technology readiness is at level 5, which indicates code validation, and components in a simulation environment. The three important components in the MCSSB have been identified, the technology regarding swap batteries, electric three- wheeled vehicles, and billboards in the form of video Tron has been proven. So that the concept of MCSSB Lives to make a single unit of a product. In the future, it is hoped that the feasibility study will discuss the analysis of techno- economic costs.

199,Quality Control Analysis Using The Grey Failure Mode And  Effect Analysis Method On A Electric Batik Stove (Case,"if less effective quality control is applied in the company repeatedly, the number of failed products will increase. the company can identify failures based on severity, occurrence, and detection criteria using the failure mode and effect analysis (fmea) method. the result of multiplying the three criteria becomes the risk priority number (rpn). however fmea has a weakness that has attracted many criticisms, namely the potential for the same rpn results but not considering different failure risks. thus, the fmea method is integrated with grey theory to become a grey failure mode and effect analysis (gfmea) method that can improve rpn priority determination. determination of the weight of importance between criteria in the gfmea method is strengthened by the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fahp) method so that the level of accuracy in determining the rpn will be better. this study aims to identify failures for each component in cv. abc, electric batik stove company, and determine the priority of the causes of loss in the production process of electric batik stove products based on analysis using gfmea method. however, there was no detail on the type of failure. so it was difficult to optimally determine the causal factors, root causes, and risk of loss. the analysis found nineteen failures can potentially cause failure in the company’s electric batik stove production process. after that, three potential failures with critical values must be prioritized, including broken bowl heaters, uneven coloring, and slanted body folds with a grey rpn result of 0,50001; 0,50512; and 0,51156.","quality control, failure, production process, grpn","In the FMEA method, to consider the most important failures are used from the largest to the smallest RPN. However, the calculation of RPN with traditional FMEA has a weakness that is widely criticized because it has the potential to have the same RPN result, but different failure factors are not considered. Thus, to improve reliability and accuracy in determining the value of the RPN, the GFMEA method is used to assist decision making with limited and uncertain information with assessments in the form of relationship analysis and modeling. Determination of the weight of importance between criteria in the GFMEA method is strengthened by the FAHP method so that the level of accuracy in determining the RPN will be better. In this study, based on the results of observations and interviews at the company, it was found 19 types of failures that have the potential to cause failure in the production process of electric batik stoves at CV. ABC. After that, there are 3 potential failures with critical values and must be prioritized. The determination is based on the calculation of the value of the GRPN. Priority 3 potential failures, including broken bowl heater, uneven coloring, slanted body folds with a GRPN result of 0.50001; 0.50512; and 0.51156. Proposed corrective actions are given for priority failures so that failures that occur in the electric batik stove production process can be minimized, including ensuring suppliers provide raw materials according to standards, checking tools before production takes place, and making routine machine maintenance schedules.","study: cv. abc) isnaini khasanah and ira setyaningsih industrial engineering department uin sunan kalijaga yogyakarta yogyakarta, indonesia isnaini.khasanahh@gmail.com, ira.setyaningsih@uin-suka.ac.id",

203,Composition In Bankruptcy That Comes From Suspension Of  Debt Payment Obligations In The Verdict Of Indonesian,"composition in bankruptcy is permitted by article 144 of law no. 37 of 2004 regarding bankruptcy and suspension of debt payment obligations which gives the debtor the right to offer composition to all creditors. however, in case that the bankruptcy comes from the failure of suspension of debt payment obligations because the composition plan offered by the debtor was rejected by its creditors, the commercial court and the supreme court do not share the same view regarding whether it is permissible to make a composition in bankruptcy. in the bankruptcy case of pt hanson international tbk., the commercial court using an extensive interpretation method held the view that composition in bankruptcy that comes from suspension of debt payment obligations is permissible, while the supreme court using a restrictive interpretation method held the opposite view. therefore, in this study, the authors conducted a study of these disparities by using the grammatical interpretation method of article 144 of the bankruptcy and suspension of debt payment obligations act.",,"PT Hanson International Tbk., is a bankrupt debtor. After concluding that PT Hanson International Tbk., is the bankrupt debtor within the meaning of Article 1 (4) of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act, a syllogism was made on Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act in the case of PT Hanson International Tbk., as follows: (Table 4). Table 4 Syllogism of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act in the Composition in the Bankruptcy of PT Hanson International Tbk. Major Premise Bankrupt debtor is entitled to offer composition to all creditors. Minor Premise PT Hanson International Tbk., is a bankrupt debtor. Conclusion PT Hanson International Tbk., is entitled to offer composition to all creditors. From the syllogism of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act in the bankruptcy case of PT Hanson International Tbk., which uses a grammatical interpretation, it can be concluded that PT Hanson International Tbk., which is a debtor in bankruptcy that comes from PKPU, has the right to offer composition to all creditors. This means that an overview can be drawn that debtors in bankruptcy that comes from PKPU have the right to offer composition to all creditors. Indeed, the bankrupt debtor that comes from PKPU was declared bankrupt based on the court decision. Therefore, Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act provides an opportunity for bankrupt debtor, both directly from the granting of the petition for bankruptcy or from the failure of the PKPU process to offer composition to all creditors. After concluding regarding the policies contained in Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act above regarding composition in case of bankruptcy that comes from the failure of PKPU due to rejection of debtor's composition plan by creditors, it is necessary to determine which method of the extensive interpretation method held by Central Jakarta Commercial Court and the retrictive interpretation method of held by by the Supreme Court in the bankruptcy of PT Hanson International Tbk., is in accordance with Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act. Based on the above analysis, it can be concluded that the extensive interpretation method held by Central Jakarta Commercial Court is in accordance with the grammatical interpretation method of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy Law and the PKPU. The extensive interpretation method proposed by the Commercial Court of the Central District Court of Jakarta and the grammatical interpretation method of Article 144 of the Bankruptcy and Suspension of Debt Payment Obligations Act both allow composition in case of bankruptcy that comes from the failure of PKPU process because the debtor's composition plan was rejected by its creditors. Furthermore, based on an analysis of the arguments made by the Supreme Court regarding the reason for the Supreme Court's opinion that it is not permissible to have a composition in bankruptcy that comes from the failure of PKPU 1955","supreme court no.667/pdt.sus-pailit/2021 kezia cessy ananda priscilla student of business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia kezia.priscilla@binus.ac.id shidarta lecturer-specialist of business law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia shidarta@binus.edu","References

205,Determinants Of Debt Policy: Building Construction Firms  Listed In Indonesia,"the purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of non-debt tax shield (ndts), firm growth, liquidity, and profit volatility whether simultaneously and/or partially towards debt policy in building construction firms listed on indonesian stock exchange period 2016-2020. this study uses panel data regression with fixed effect model to estimate 60 samples from 12 companies selected through purposive sampling. the results show that ndts, firm growth, liquidity, and profit volatility simultaneously have a significant effect on debt policy. partially, firm growth and profit volatility have a positive significant effect on debt policy, while ndts and liquidity have no significant effect. these findings suggest that indonesian building construction firms do not consider liquidity and non-debt tax shield as a consideration of increasing or decreasing debt. moreover, indonesian building construction firms with strong firm growth and high profit volatility actually have a low proportion of debt.","debt policy, profit volatility, firm growth, liquidity","Based on this research, we can conclude the following: (a) Non-debt tax shield, Firm growth, Liquidity, and Profit volatility simultaneously affect the debt policy of building construction firms listed in Indonesia for 2016-2020 period. (b) Non-debt tax shield and liquidity has no significant effect on the debt policy of building construction firms listed in Indonesia for 2016-2020 period. (c) Firm growth has a negative significant effect on the debt policy of building construction firms listed in Indonesia for 2016-2020 period. This indicates that the more the firm expanding, the debt decreasing (d) Profit volatility has a negative significant effect on the debt policy, the result indicates that a firms with volatile profit are considered risky by creditors, making it more difficult to receive external capital especially debt. 1974","nur’ain maghfira tangkudung student faculty of economic and business telkom university-bandung, indonesia firatangkudung@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id brady rikumahu lecturer faculty of economic and business telkom university-bandung, indonesia bradyrikumahu@telkomuniversity.ac.id","References

206,Improving The Effectiveness Of Rolling Stock Maintenance:  A Systematic Literature Review,"urban transportation currently has a very important or crucial role because it is one of the factors that strongly support the ongoing economy. one of the transportation modes that is currently had a very high demand in greater jakarta is kereta rel listrik (krl). krl need to provide not only availability and facility, but also focus on reliability and safety. had a good operational strategy, especially in the maintenance of rolling stock should be done. reliability centered maintenance (rcm) is one of approach to optimize the rolling stock maintenance practices given that several critical components have been operating for certain number of periods. the maintenance concept that focuses on reliability brings a good on determining treatment decisions or maintenance strategies. it is also minimized the technical problem in operation by knowing its failure mode. purpose of this research is to provide an overview of the reliability concepts for rolling stock maintenance from several research journals. this paper contains of several up-to- date literature for improving the effectiveness of rolling stock maintenance from each case of journals and papers. future maintenance work is based on establishing reliability-based systems. to provide high reliability rolling stock, it is important to introduce reliability analysis methods and to make use of new management indices that consider the impact of faults on transport and cost performance.","fmea, railway","Improving rolling stock reliability. Previous fault-prevention management focused mainly on the number of faults using parameters such as the number of faults per million-operation km. However, indices based only on the simple number of cases do not quantify the effects of differences such as traffic density and track section conditions. For example, a 10-minute stoppage due to a fault is counted in the same manner as a complete stoppage in operations. Clearly, this is not an accurate index of faults. Future maintenance work is based on establishing reliability-based systems. To provide high reliability rolling stock, it is important to introduce reliability analysis methods and to make use of new management indices that consider the impact of faults on transport and cost performance. The basic considerations for introducing reliability methods are listed: Awareness of impact on customers • Individual management of equipment with large impact on train diagrams when fault develops • Achievement of effective repair of faults Awareness of cost performance • Company-wide awareness of cost-effective fault prevention • Ranking maintenance method by railway line and elapsed time 1983","sonny aditya luqman hakim postgraduate student of magister management program faculty of business and economic universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia sonnyaditya45@gmail.com lien herliani kusumah senior lecturer in magister of industrial engineering program faculty of engineering universitas mercu buana, jakarta, indonesia lien.herliani@mercubuana.ac.id","References

212,"The Effect Of Co-Creation Attitude, Entrepreneurship Selfidentity On Entrepreneurship Intention Based On Service-","this article reviews and tests the relation between co-creation attitude, entrepreneurship self-identity, and entrepreneurship intention. furthermore, this research also explores the antecedent of the co-creation attitude which are consist of an interaction attitude, a responsive attitude, and knowledge sharing. the research model that is being constructed is leading to the service-dominant logic (sdl) theory. this study uses a quantitative approach, an online questionnaire is used to collect the data. the sample of this research consists of 100 respondents, purposive sampling is used to take the sample. respondents are college students who took the entrepreneurship subject. data analysis and hypothesis testing are using structural equation modelling (sem) software namely smart pls. the findings of this research are that interaction attitude, a responsive attitude, and entrepreneurship self-identity are positively related to a co-creation attitude. nevertheless, knowledge sharing has no effect on the co-creation attitude. another finding from this study is that the co-creation attitude influences entrepreneurship intention. however, entrepreneurship self-identity has no effect on entrepreneurship intention.",2022,"drawn from the hypothesis testing data are displayed in Table 3: Table 3. Summary of Hypotheses Testing Hypothesized P Value Conclusion H1 : Interaction Attitude  Co-Creation Attitude 0.037 Supported H2 : Knowledge Sharing  Co-Creation Attitude 0.276 Not Supported H3 : Responsive Attitude  Co-Creation Attitude 0.000 Supported H4 : Entrepreneurship Self-Identity  Co-Creation Attitude 0.000 Supported H5 : Co-Creation Attitude  Entrepreneurship Intention 0.000 Supported H6 : Entrepreneurship Self-Identity  Entrepreneurship Intention 0.072 Not Supported The service dominant logic theory method serves as the foundation for the models in this study. The co-creation attitude proposed by the service dominant logic theory consists of interaction attitude, knowledge sharing attitude, and responsive attitude. As a result, this study examines how co-creation attitude affects entrepreneurial intention. This study will also attempt to determine how one's self-identity as an entrepreneur affects one's intention to pursue entrepreneurship. The study's initial conclusion is that co-creation attitude is influenced by interaction attitude. The behavior of persons who like interacting with others is the topic of interaction attitude. People with strong interaction attitudes enjoy interacting with others, especially those who share their objectives. Through these connections, people will pick up ideas, viewpoints, and views that can encourage acting creativity. When seen in the context of entrepreneurship, those who want to start their own business would typically engage with other business owners to gain new ideas, which will impact how they behave when it comes to innovation. Additionally, this study's findings indicate that responsive attitude influences co-creation attitude. Being adaptable to changes or acting fast in response to them is referred to as having a responsive attitude towards customer recommendations and criticisms. When people behave in a responsive way, they will adjust to changes and use those changes as an incentive to act creatively and foster the co-creative attitudes that already exist inside them (Ahn et al., 2020). This study also demonstrates the impact of entrepreneurial self-identity on co-creation mindset. This indicates that persons with strong entrepreneurial self-identities will have confidence, self-assurance, and optimism, and this might encourage people to interact with other entrepreneurs in a positive manner (Musona et al., 2021). The findings also demonstrate a relationship between co-creation attitude and entrepreneurship intention. People with a strong sense of co-creation will like interacting with the entrepreneurial community in order to gain fascinating experiences that will fuel their ambition to start their own business (Zadeh et 2038","dominant logic approach mario istar lecturer, business entrepreneurship center bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia mario.istar@binus.ac.id stefanus rumangkit* lecturer, business entrepreneurship center bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia stefanus.rumangkit@binus.ac.id abdullah bilman lecturer, business entrepreneurship center bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia abdullah.bilman@binus.ac.id","References

214,Legal Responsibilities Of Peer-To-Peer Lending Company To  Lender,"financial technology makes it easier for people to access financial products and services. one type of financial technology that is an alternative to meet the financing needs of the community is peer to peer lending (p2p lending). p2p lending is a platform that brings together lenders and borrowers. funds that lenders lend to borrowers through the p2p platform may face various risks, such as the borrower being unable to repay the loan. this study aims to analyze the mechanism of p2p lending companies in verifying the ability and eligibility of borrowers based on applicable regulations and how the legal responsibility of p2p lending companies to lenders if the borrower is unable to pay the loan. the research method used in this research is juridical-normative. an important finding in this study is that p2p lending companies carry out credit scoring and risk assessments when providing loans to borrowers. however, the legal responsibility of p2p lending companies to lenders is only limited to conducting credit analysis of borrowers to reduce the risk of default. however, to protect against the risk of default by borrowers, p2p lending companies protect them with insurance or protection funds. therefore, financial services authority (fsa) needs to educate p2p lending, borrowers, and other users regarding the process and responsibility for funds provided by lenders.","fintech, p2p lending, lender",,"fauzan ahmad r and abdul rasyid a business law program, law department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 a) corresponding author: arasyid@binus.edu",
215,Systematic Literature Review:  Aspects Of Leadership In Total Quality Management,"in the framework of total quality management, this study discusses how the concept of leadership has developed (tqm) through a systematic literature review and tries to explore areas that still have opportunities for further research. in this paper, the literature analysis carried out examines papers that are only sourced from the scopus database, this has the impact of limitations and may not cover all papers and research related to total quality leadership and management (tqm). this systematic review of the literature was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma). initial search returns 1.949 documents and after applying the screening process, 28 documents successfully passed all the inclusion criteria set. the following parts will go over the study's findings in greater depth: total quality management (tqm), leadership, performance (impact). the results of the synthesis of the merger and synthesis of 28 papers, found a research gap, namely the need to build a robust (robust) tqm model, which helps organizations achieve business excellence, improve quality, be competitive and become a force to achieve higher productivity, profitability, and sustainable business performance.","leadership style, performance, prisma","Total quality management (TQM) is a management philosophy that places a strong emphasis on both organizational and individual values (Krajcsák, 2019). Varied sectors and nations have different approaches to TQM (Amin et al., 2017). Teachers of TQM such as Deming, Crosby, and Juran agree that leadership is critical in quality management (Bouranta, 2020). Leaders take a fundamental role in quality improvement efforts (Rodriguez et al., 2018). The most crucial factor in achieving TQM is leadership (Vimal Kumar & Sharma, 2018). TQM is an important aspect of management (Sfakianaki et al., 2018). Successful TQM must be initiated and maintained by top management (Rodriguez et al., 2018). One thing that is the main highlight in this paper is as stated in RQ5. Research gap areas (opportunities)? Ilieş et al., (2017), state that another research direction in the future is to continue to analyze the components of the TQM system, to approach the integration of the TQM system with other systems, such as environmental management. Building a strong TQM model will help organizations achieve business advantage, quality improvement, and competitiveness (Psomas & Antony, 2017). TQM is part of standard quality management; however, the definition varies from one researcher to the next (Amin et al., 2017). TQM has a significant impact on all facets of long-term sustainability (Tasleem et al., 2019). TQM refers to a company's ability to boost productivity, profitability, and long-term performance (V. Kumar et al., 2020). As a result of combining and synthesizing 28 selected papers for review, it was found that the research gap in this review is to build robust (robust) TQM models. In this paper, the source of the search for papers reviewed only comes from Scopus, of course, this has a limited impact and may not comprehensively cover all papers and research related to Total Quality Management (TQM).

216,Legal Protection For Sharia Capital Market Retail  Investor,"the islamic capital market is a securities trading system whose instruments and transaction mechanisms do not conflict with sharia principles. thus, the islamic capital market has the obligation to comply with applicable laws as well as islamic law. one of the principles in the islamic capital market is the prohibition of gharar or uncertainty. however, the capital market is inherently uncertain in the form of investment risk. knowing this, this thesis aims to find out how legal protection guarantees a sharia compliant transaction for retail investors in the islamic capital market. the reasearch was conducted using a normative jurdicial method which was then carried out a qualitative analysis od the data found. the results of this study indicate that the provisions governing the transaction mechanism in the islamic capital market have provided protection that ensures the implementation of investment of investment activities does not conflict with sharia prinsiples. protection is provided through an online-based trading system that automatically rejects transactions that contain elements that are contrary to sharia principles. however, the transactions carried out in the islamic capital market are still too small when compared to transactions in the conventional capital market. so that legal protection for transactions in the islamic capital market cannot affect the stability of the market as a whole. yet, this does not mean that there are no protection at all. the indonesia stock exchange as a facilitator who has a function as a capital market regulator, has imposed restrictions on trading volume with provisions for trading halts and price limits. however, due to the dynamic nature of the capital market, it is necessary to review and update repeatedly in order to produce effective provisions for stabilizing the capital market.","legal protection, retail investor, sharia principle",,"herdidmas kurnia and abdul rasyid a business law program, law department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 a) corresponding author: arasyid@binus.edu",
217,Legal Protection And Fulfillment Of The Rights Of Persons  With Visual Impairments In Banking Services In Indonesia,"as part of citizens, the fulfilment and protection of the rights of people with visual impairments must be considered by the state, including services in banking financial services institutions. the implementation and protection of rights for blind customers with disabilities in indonesia are regulated based on law number 8 of 2016 concerning persons with disabilities. this study aims to analyze whether law number 8 of 2016 concerning persons with disabilities has guaranteed legal protection for persons with disabilities who are blind in accessing services in banking institutions. in addition, what efforts should be undertaken to fulfil the rights of persons with disabilities who are blind to banking services. this research uses normative legal research methods. based on the research that has been done, it was found that law number 8 of 2016 has not provided protection and fulfilment of the rights of the visually impaired in banking services. in addition, banking institutions in indonesia have generally not provided friendly banking facilities for people with visual impairments. therefore, the government, in this case, the financial services authority, should make more specific and detailed regulations regarding accessibility for people with visual impairments in banking services.","legal protection, banking, customer, disability",,"hidayatullah harye and abdul rasyid a business law program, law department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 a) corresponding author: arasyid@binus.edu",
218,Legal Protection Of Customer’S Personal Data In Internet  Banking Services,"this study aims to determine the legal protection of customer personal data in internet banking services and what customers can take legal remedies if their data is not protected. customer data in this service needs to be considered because it involves a person's privacy data and must be provided to the bank to carry out transactions. the research method used is normative legal research by examining legal principles and systematic law with qualitative data followed by a conceptual approach and legislation. the result of this research is that there are two forms of the legal protection of customer data in internet banking services, namely preventive legal protection with a self-regulation approach from the internal legal rules of bank administrators and a government regulation approach in law number 10 of 1998 concerning banking and law number 8 of 1999 concerning consumer protection. second, repressive legal protection is the responsibility of the bank in the form of handling customer complaints to compensation for losses to customers as regulated in bank regulation no. 10/10/pbi/2008 concerning settlement of customer complaints, bank indonesia regulation no. 10/1/pbi/2008 concerning banking mediation, and law number 19 of 2016 concerning electronic information and transactions has regulated the protection of personal data of customers who use internet banking. efforts that customers can make if personal data in internet banking services are not protected can make customer complaints and mediation. if there is no agreement, the customer can take legal remedies consisting of civil legal remedies, criminal legal remedies, and administrative, legal remedies.","legal protection, personal data, internet banking, customer","Based on the research conducted by the author, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. There are two forms of legal protection for customer data in internet banking services, namely preventive legal protection and repressive legal protection. Preventive legal protection is an effort made by the government to protect consumers or customers in general with a self-regulation approach from the internal law of the Internet Banking service provider itself and the government regulation approach in Article 29 paragraph (4) and Article 40 paragraph (1) and (2) Law Number 10 of 1998 concerning Amendments to Law Number 7 of 1992 concerning Banking and Article 4 of Law Number 8 of 1999 concerning Consumer Protection. Repressive legal protection is an effort taken if a problem occurs that has the potential to harm customers. The problem occurred because of the leakage of unprotected customer data. So the efforts that customers can make if a data leak causes losses are the responsibility of the digital banking service provider, namely the bank itself. The accountability of the bank can be in the form of handling customer complaints to compensation for losses to customers as regulated in Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI) Number 7/7/PBI/2005 in conjunction with Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 10/10/PBI/2008 concerning Settlement of Customer Complaints, Bank Indonesia Regulation No. 2076","vivian and abdul rasyid a business law program, law department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 a) corresponding author: arasyid@binus.edu","References

220,Reveal Six Sigma Implementations In Indonesia  Manufacturing Industries,"six sigma as a proven improvement methodology has been widely used among organizations in various industries. it focuses on improving production processes, reducing variation, and eliminating waste leading to higher efficiency and profitability. six sigma has been applied in indonesian manufacturing industries and continues to grow. this paper discussed six sigma implementations in indonesian manufacturing industries that identifies sigma levels from various manufacturing sectors and summarizes current evidence that contributes to revealing the current sigma level. this study reviews six sigma project cases from one of six sigma consulting firms in indonesia. six sigma project cases were collected from 2019-2022, the total project cases during that period included 120 six sigma project, and 58 projects that meet the criteria has been selected for this study. the results show that from 58 selected projects, the average sigma value of the observed industries was 3.7 before improvement and 4.1 after improvement. however, the highest sigma level before improvement was 4.8 which came from fast moving consumer goods (fmcg) sector and the highest sigma level after improvement was 5.4 which came from the packaging sector.","six sigma, improvement, manufacturing, industry","and Future Research This study reveals sigma value for various manufacturing sector based on an improvement project case study in Indonesia, in total 16 manufacturing sector has been studied. The average sigma value for all sectors in this study was 3.7 before improvement and 4.1 after improvement, there is increment 10%. This shows that six sigma initiatives bring better process performance. Increased sigma value will reduce the defect hence cost of poor quality (COPQ) will be reduced. Reducing the COPQ can be a gold mine for companies. Systematic application of the six sigma DMAIC methodology in manufacturing will help companies bring down the cost of quality and increase profit (Murumkar et al. 2018). The highest sigma value obtained in this study was 5.4, still below 6 sigma, this still needs radical improvement to achieve a better result. After a deep investigation of the case study, it appears that utilization of six sigma tools not yet maximized. Most of the the tools being employed in the project is the simple tools. Utilization of advance tools is still required for example the application of design of experiment (DOE) for quality improvement, since none of the project case study employs this powerful tool.","selamat w. hia graduate student, management and technology institut teknologi sepuluh november surabaya, indonesia selamat.walmanto@gmail.com fabri tobal h. situmeang industrial engineering department telkom university bandung, indonesia 03.fabrisitumeang@gmail.com",
221,"The Effect Of Capital Intensity, Company Age, And  Company Size On Tax Avoidance","taxes are mandatory contributions to the state by individuals or entities of a coercive nature. the company is one of the taxpayers who must carry out their obligations in carrying out tax payments. but from the company side, tax is a burden that will reduce net profit so that the company will look for ways to reduce the tax burden, one of which is through tax avoidance. this study aims to examine and obtain empirical evidence about the effect of capital intensity, company age, and company size on tax avoidance at mining sector companies listed in indonesian stock exchange in the period of 2016-2021. the number of samples was determined using purposive sampling technique with a total of 66 samples. tax avoidance in this study was measured using the effective tax rate (etr) value. data were analyzed using panel data regression analysis. the results of this study indicate that capital intensity and company size have a positive effect on tax avoidance, while company age has no effect on tax avoidance.","capital intensity, company age, company size, tax avoidance","The test result found that the capital intensity and company size positively affected Tax Avoidance. In contrast, company age did not affect Tax Avoidance. This study concludes that the higher the capital intensity and the company age, the higher the Tax Avoidance carried out by the company so that it can help the company to get a good reputation from stakeholders. This study concludes that the higher the capital intensity and company age, the higher the tax avoidance carried out by the company so that it can have an impact on the State Budget. This study aims to determine the influence of independent variables consisting of capital intensity, company age and company size on a dependent variable, namely tax avoidance on mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2021 period, which consists of 13 companies with a research period of 6 years. The number of this study was 78 samples, but in this study, there was outlier data with the results of the outlier data being 66 samples. The study was conducted on companies registered in one sector of manufacturing companies, namely companies in the mining sector so that it does not describe tax avoidance measures on all manufacturing companies. This study calculates tax avoidance using the Effective Tax Rate (ETR) proxy so there are many other proxies that have not been used in calculating tax avoidance. This research has limitations in conducting this research with relatively short time constraints. 2099","defita marha safitri1 and kurnia2 faculty of economics and business telkom university, bandung, west java, indonesia 1defitamarha@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, 2akkurnia@telkomuniversity.ac.id","References

The United States and China have used AI in systems and court proceedings, which Indonesia has not done. Therefore, Indonesia needs to initiate the use of AI in courts. Regarding regulatory developments, the stages of development in China, the United States, and Indonesia have similarities, namely the development plans and guidelines that contain the principles of AI. Regarding regulatory development, China and Indonesia have first compiled ethics for using AI, which in the United States is still being discussed. Of the three countries studied, neither China, the United States, nor Indonesia has specifically regulated AI at this time. However, the components related to the use of AI in the form of personal data protection and cybersecurity have been owned by each country. Although in Indonesia, data protection regulations have not been expressly regulated. In terms of statutes, China has first regulated the issue of algorithms that have an essential role in the development of AI. Looking at the use of AI in the future, the development of AI settings will continue to evolve to ensure protection for users. Based on paragraph above, there are several proposed improvements should be done such as Indonesia needs to start the AI development in courts such as in court administration process to improve the efficiency in courts. Referring to AI regulations, Indonesia government should formulate AI ethical guidelines as a guide in the use of AI and need to immediately regulate the protection of personal data in more specific regulations therefore, the Personal Data Protection Law needs to be passed immediately by the Government.","precia jacey, siti yuniarti business law program, law department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta,11480, indonesia yuniarti@binus.ac.id",
224,Joint Optimization Of Item Location Assignment And Task  Scheduling For Tier-To-Tier Shuttle-Based Storage And,"the application of the automated storage and retrieval system (as/rs) in the warehouse has been improved significantly over the last few decades. in the recent years, a new type of as/rs, shuttle based storage and retrieval system (sbs/rs) has taken many industries interest by storm due to its flexibility and throughput performances. this paper studies the mathematical optimization of item location assignment and task scheduling in sbs/rs mainly with tier-to-tier system which allows the shuttle to transport between tiers using a lift system. since this system is mostly applied in giant e-commerce industries, considering order data set and multiple stock keeping unit (sku) in the mathematical model formulation will give a significant benefit in the real-life scenario. this paper also proposed a modified genetic algorithm to solved both item location assignment and task scheduling with a good computational time result for large size instances within a reasonable amount of time.",,"In this paper, mathematical optimization of item location assignment and task scheduling for tier-to-tier SBS/RS is studied for minimizing the total time. Many originality considerations are proposed such as the task clustering assumption and rack status update. As for cost, not only travel time cost that is considered, but also the penalty time due to the lateness of task operation. The author believes that the proposed mathematical model could benefit the SBS/RS research in the future. Furthermore, this paper also introduced an algorithm that capable of showing good results in comparison to the proposed mathematical model. Some important points regarding this proposed model that can be improved in the future are: • Multiple of shuttles and multiples of lifting system • Each order might contain a different number of task (multiple k) • Dual command cycle system for both shuttle and lift system","retrieval system (sbs/rs) billy sagara graduate school of science and technology sophia university tokyo, japan sagarabilly@gmail.com takashi irohara faculty of science and technology sophia university tokyo, japan irohara@sophia.ac.jp",
225,Predicting Patient Arrival Rates In A Multi-Specialty,"although the medical interventions provided by outpatient departments (opds) are scheduled, the process of patient arrival is often unpredictable. this can lead to a variety of issues such as overcrowding, long waiting times, and patient dissatisfaction. therefore, predicting the patient arrival rate is necessary to allow healthcare managers to be more proactive and make more efficient and realistic decisions. in this context, this real-life study aims to predict the hourly rate of patient arrival in a multi-specialty outpatient department using machine learning (ml) algorithms. the considered opd regroups three specialties: pulmonology, allergology, and cardiology. one-year patient arrival data for all specialties were extracted and preprocessed. thereafter, the exhaustive feature selection was applied to identify the best subset of features. next, seven ml algorithms were investigated and assessed to determine the best predictive model. the conducted experimental study revealed that support vector regression shows the best performance for the prediction of pulmonary patient admissions, while random forest was identified as the best predictive model for the other specialties.","prediction, machine learning",,"hana ben mbarek, safa bhar layeb, najla omrane aissaoui, amel jaoua lr-oasis, national engineering school of tunis, university of tunis el manar, tunis, tunisia hana.benmbarek@enit.utm.tn, safa.layeb@enit.utm.tn, najla.aissaoui@enicarthage.rnu.tn, amel.jaoua@enit.utm.tn atidel b. hadj-alouane department of industrial engineering and engineering management, college of engineering, university of sharjah, sharjah, uae aalouane@sharjah.ac.ae","References

226,The Portrait Of Entrepreneurial Orientation Among   Women Entrepreneurs In Greater Jakarta:,"entrepreneurship is essential to indonesia's economic progress. 99.9% of all indonesian firms are micro, small, and medium-sized (msmes). sixty percent of indonesia's registered micro, small, and medium–sized businesses were held by women (msmes). however, it is difficult for more than 70 percent of female entrepreneurs to expand owing to a lack of funding and market access. most female entrepreneurs operate in the informal and conventional female industries. there are still prevalent gender inequalities in essential company management abilities. women frequently lack the vocational and technical abilities and job experience necessary to operate enterprises. by sending questionnaires with closed-ended questions on a 5-point likert scale, the research was able to acquire primary data from 230 women entrepreneurs in greater jakarta. this study contributes significantly to the existing literature on entrepreneurship by comparing the entrepreneurial orientation of female entrepreneurs along three dimensions: innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking. in addition, the rasch model was applied in this study. according to the study's findings, the entrepreneurial orientation of female entrepreneurs varies insignificantly with their level of education. this study's findings may be translated into actionable measures for identifying women business owners who are focused on growth. the report also proposes development approaches for encouraging the growth of women entrepreneurs.",,"In Indonesia, more than 99.9 percent of all businesses were comprised of MSMEs. 60% of micro, small, and medium- sized firms (MSMEs) in Indonesia are held by women. The statistics suggests that Indonesia has a large number of female entrepreneurs. However, more than 70 percent of female entrepreneurs find it difficult to expand due to a lack of capital and market access. Most female entrepreneurs are engaged in informal and traditional sectors. There are still persistent gender disparities in fundamental business management skills. It highlighted the need of studying the entrepreneurial orientation of female entrepreneurs. This study's major purpose was to determine whether women entrepreneurs had distinct levels of entrepreneurial orientation based on innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness. The Rasch Model was used to assess the data obtained from 230 female entrepreneurs using closed-ended questionnaires. Surprisingly, the innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking elements of the entrepreneurial orientation of female entrepreneurs do not vary considerably with their educational degree. The major conclusion of this study, however, is that we cannot target growth-oriented female entrepreneurs based on their degree of schooling. In addition, the study indicated that regardless of their educational background, Indonesian women entrepreneurs exhibit a high degree of proactiveness and risk-taking, but a low level of innovativeness. Both non-bachelor and bachelor entrepreneurs have significant potential for business success, according to the conclusions of this study. The findings of this study provide fresh insight on women's entrepreneurial development, notably in Indonesia. It shall evaluate women entrepreneurs entirely based on their entrepreneurial orientation, with an emphasis on inventiveness, risk-taking, and initiative. In addition, there must be a focus on boosting the degree of 2149","a rasch model approach banu rinaldi* senior lecturer, business creation program, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 *corresponding author: banu.rinaldi@binus.ac.id maria grace herlina senior lecturer, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 herlina01@binus.edu","References

228,Implementation Of China'S Cultural Policy Through Tv  Drama As Public Diplomacy Practice,"since the work report made on behalf of the 16th cpc central committee to the 17th cpc central committee, china has emphasized culture as part of the country's soft power. recently, with the cultural industry being introduced as a pillar industrial sector in the 12th five-year plan, china has developed cultural policies to manage its cultural industry, such as film and drama. after the establishment of the ""going global"" strategy, chinese entertainment media are now more accessible and receiving much attention from foreign audiences. with the emergence of chinese dramas on several international streaming platforms and the latest digital cultural industry policy issued in 2020, this article offers an analysis of the implementation of the chinese cultural policy through a tv drama ""word of honour"" as a public diplomacy practice.","public diplomacy, cultural policy, cultural industry","With soft power emerging as a core concept in Chinese cultural development policy, the Chinese Government executes a cultural policy to expand their cultural soft power. The Chinese Government had prioritized cultural industries as a pillar industrial sector and thus started to develop a cultural industry policy. With the current development of technology and digitization, the Government issued a digital cultural industry policy to create new forms of employment and jobs and form industrial chains that adapt to new technologies, new forms of business, and new consumption development industrial chains. China's decision-making process is state-centric due to its nature as an authoritarian country. Thus, the Central Government has control over the policy, while the non-state actors could only follow the direction given by the Government. The content of the High-Quality Development of Digital Cultural Industry Policy implied the messages China wanted to tell. It emphasized China as an advanced country with a rich culture. Its plan for international cooperation also implied that China was a cooperative partner and not a threat. The international cooperation could be seen through the distribution of the ""Word of Honor,"" aired on several countries broadcasting platforms. Moreover, it is also broadcasted on international streaming platforms such as YouTube and Netflix, which aligns with the ""going global"" strategy. Thus, it could be concluded that the international broadcasting of the drama ""Word of Honor"" is part of an implementation of cultural policy that worked as public diplomacy and helped China expand its cultural soft power.","nadhira alia putri international relation department, faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia nadhira.putri@binus.ac.id rangga aditya elias head department of international relations, faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia raaditya@binus.edu",

233,"The Influence Of Tax Minimization, Firm Size, Exchange  Rate, And Multinationalism On Indication To Performs","transfer pricing means the price that arises because of the existence of transfer goods, services, and other intangible assets between the companies that have a special relationship or related parties. if the purpose of transferring prices is to meet production needs between companies within the same group, then transfer pricing is carried out neutrally. however, if the goal is to avoid taxes, then the practice is called abuse of transfer pricing. this practice is legal based on regulations but must be following the arm’s length principle. this study intends to discover how the simultaneous and partial influence of tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, and multinationalism on the indication to perform transfer pricing. in this research quantitative methods are used with purposive sampling as a sampling technique. manufacturing companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange for the year 2016 until 2020 are the population of the study. based on the sample criteria, the sample companies studied amounted to 14 companies with a period of 5 years. logistic regression analysis is the analytical technique used in the study through the assistance ibm spss statistics 25 application. according to the results, variables of tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, and multinationalism simultaneously have a significant influence on the indication to perform transfer pricing. based on the partial test, multinationalism has a significant positive influence on the indication to perform transfer pricing whereas tax minimization, firm size, and exchange rate do not influence the indication to perform transfer pricing.","tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, multinationalism","This study intends to find out how the influence of tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, and multinationalism on the indication to perform transfer pricing. The population in this study are manufacturing sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from the year 2016 until 2020. According to sample criteria, there are 14 companies with a period of 5 years, then 70 samples of companies are obtained. The study reveals that the independent variables namely tax minimization, firm size, exchange rate, and multinationalism significantly influence the indication to perform transfer pricing. Additionally, the result of the study showed that tax minimization does not influence the indication to perform transfer pricing. This proved that to minimize the burden of the tax, companies could do other tax planning in a way that legal and permissible. Additionally, firm size does not influence the indication to perform transfer pricing. This is proved that the larger the company, the more transactions that occur and disclose in the financial statement. So that the company tends to be careful in executing transfer pricing to maximize profit. Furthermore, the exchange rate does not influence the indication to perform transfer pricing. Changes in exchange rates are like something that has two sides. Exchange rate movements that continue to fluctuate from the transactions could provide profits, otherwise, the exchange rate can provide losses. The existence of this makes the company have the assumption that changes in the exchange rate do not provide potential profit, so the company did not perform transfer pricing. Meanwhile, the multinationalism variable significantly and positively influences the indication to perform transfer pricing. The higher the level of multinationalism of a company, the more it indicates the company performs transfer pricing. This is done to achieve maximum profit and prosper the business group. Companies that establish affiliates abroad will have the opportunity to expand market share and consumer networks. Furthermore, the companies could take an advantage of different tax regulations. According to the results, the multinationalism variable significantly and positively influences the indication to perform transfer pricing. For companies that have subsidiaries abroad, when transacting with their subsidiaries, the price or profits being transacted must be following the arm’s length principle, for investors who invested in multinational companies are expected to understand how companies perform transfer pricing to maximize their profits. Meanwhile, the tax authorities are expected to supervise more multinational companies that perform transfer pricing, whether the transactions are following the provisions regarding transfer pricing so that tax revenues of the state are not eroded. In this study, only 18,5% of the combination of independent variables were able to describe the variation of dependent variables. Furthermore, subsequent researchers expected to add other independent variables such as corporate governance, audit committee, and tax haven. In addition, further researchers are also advised to be able to expand research objects such as the mining sector, agriculture, and other sectors.","transfer pricing: evidence from manufacturing companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange (idx) erika megadiana and kurnia faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, west java, indonesia erikamegadiana@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, akukurnia@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

237,"Environmental, Social, And Governance (Esg) As  Determinant For Competitive Advantage: A Bibliometric",the study in the area of esg has not been able to draw an ultimate conclusion that define the phenomenon. the purpose of this research is to give a more complete and accurate analysis of the development trend of esg and competitive advantage from the earliest esg publication in scopus in 2010 to 2022. the purpose of the study is to establish bibliometric analysis as an extensive review esg and competitive advantage literature. the method used in this study consists of five steps: defining search,"bibliometric, analysis","This study employs bibliometric analysis to review all literatures from the Scopus database in ESG and competitive advantage. The literature has increasingly raised each year which was marked by the number of publications in recent years. According to the result, at the initial result stage, obtained as much as 40 datasets from Scopus database. The result of this study shows the trends of ESG and competitive advantage research, publication outlets (peer-reviewed journals), contributing authors, and productive countries. The analysis of keywords with less frequent occurrence indicates the potential topics for future study as contribution of this study. Thus, this study also intended to notice research development and predict potential advancement in future research through bibliometric analysis because there has been a significant increase in ESG performance research. The Vos viewer application had been successfully demonstrated in mapping and visualizing the bibliometric data. The limitation of this study is datasets only taken from Scopus database especially peer-reviewed journals as resources. Thus, we recommend that further research should use various electronic databases such as Web of Science (WoS), Springer, IEEE Xplore et cetera in order to get better scientific contributions. 2263","analysis tjatur widyantoro binus business school doctor of research in management bina nusantara university jakarta selatan, dki jakarta, indonesia tjatur.widyantoro@binus.ac.id muhtosim arief bina nusantara university jakarta selatan, dki jakarta, indonesia marief@binus.edu mohammad hamsal bina nusantara university jakarta selatan, dki jakarta, indonesia mhamsal@binus.edu asnan furinto bina nusantara university jakarta selatan, dki jakarta, indonesia afurinto@binus.edu sri bramantoro abdinagoro bina nusantara university jakarta selatan, dki jakarta, indonesia sabdinagoro@binus.edu","References

238,The Effect Of Telework On Employee'S Work-Life Balance In  Japan During The Covid-19 Pandemic,"japan is known for its conventional business management style. the influence of culture on business management style requires all workers to do face-to-face. in addition, japan is also known for its employees who have long working hours. however, due to the covid-19 pandemic, suppressing the positive number of covid-19, a telework system was implemented, which caused many employees in japan to stay at home more. so, this research aims to know the impact of telework on the work-life balance of employees at the japanese company during pandemic covid-19. the method used in this research is descriptive quantitative. source data collect by distributing questionnaires to employees in japan. the collected data is tested statistically and associated with the work culture in japan. through this research, it can be concluded that telework has a significant and positive impact on work-life balance but with a weak correlation. telework has a positive impact because it can help overcome problems such as long working hours, and reduce stress levels and work pressure, so employees' work-life balance in japan can be improved. then, the factors that cause a weak correlation are the difficulty of managing time due to distractions such as family, motivation, and forgetting the time due to the absence of boundaries between the time of work and place of residence.","telework, work-life balance","Research shows that the relationship between telework and work-life balance among employees in Japan during the Covid-19 pandemic has a significant and positive relationship, although the correlation is weak. Every increase in the implementation of telework will increase the level of work-life balance for employees in Japan. The weak correlation between telework and work-life balance is caused by factors that cause distraction, namely family, motivation, and forgetting time due to the absence of boundaries between work and place of residence. However, telework indeed has a significant and positive effect. This is because telework can help reduce travel hours, reduce long working hours, reduce stress levels, work pressure, and make time more productive and effective so that the effect on the work-life balance of employees working in Japan also increases.","elvina auryn japanese department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university west jakarta, dki jakarta, indonesia elvina.auryn@binus.ac.id elisa carolina marion japanese department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university west jakarta, dki jakarta, indonesia emarion@binus.edu",
239,Mapping Maritime Logistics Collaborations In Fishing  Industry: A Review Of Literature,"fishing is one of the important primary industries and can contribute to economic development in many countries. as one of the countries with the largest islands and waters in the world, indonesia has a large fishery production potential. in the fishing industry, many stakeholders are involved, from the capture process to distribution to customers. the many entities involved make division necessary so that stakeholders can carry out their duties and responsibilities properly and the process of distributing fishery products is efficient. in addition, inequality in the fishing industry, the benefits of each stakeholder, and the quality of cargo on cruise ships also underlies the need for collaboration. therefore, the authors try to analyze the variables that affect collaboration from various aspects of the problems that exist in each stakeholder based on a survey and analysis of the literature. the author makes several collaboration schemes from fishermen, the performance of shipping companies, expeditions, terminals, and regulators that can be applied in industrial fisheries. the collaboration scheme formulated by the author from various stakeholders in the fishing industry can make the process from fishermen to consumers more efficient because no stakeholders take advantage of opportunities in fishery distribution. collaboration with other stakeholder regulatory schemes can also protect marine ecosystems, qualified facilities and market certainty and positively impact various stakeholders, waste management and good regulatory implementation. indonesia's fishery export potential in 2030 will reach 1.7 million tonnes. this export potential can be achieved if there is collaboration from various stakeholders.","fishing cold chain, collaboration, maritime logistics","The maritime logistics collaboration system is important in distributing fishery products from fishermen to consumers. In maritime logistics collaboration, all related stakeholders influence each other. Therefore, all stakeholders must be able to adjust their respective fisheries distribution. So that the quality of the cargo sent is maintained and of high value. In this study, the authors analyze the factors of various stakeholder issues in the fishing industry. The author makes several collaboration schemes from fishermen, cruise ship performance, forwarders, terminals, and regulators that can be applied in the fishing industry. The collaboration scheme formulated by the authors from various stakeholders in the fishing industry can make the process from fishermen to consumers more efficient because no stakeholders take advantage of opportunities in fisheries distribution. Fishermen as one of the main players in the fishing industry get welfare, because they get market certainty, facilities and regulations that support fishermen. Regulatory collaboration with other stakeholders can also maintain the sustainability of the sea, and better waste processing in the fishing industry. The potential growth in Indonesia's fishery product exports in 2030 reaching 1.7 million tons is also inseparable from the support and collaboration of various relevant stakeholders. The projected growth in exports of Indonesian fishery products can be realized if the relevant stakeholders work together.","dothy doctoral program of technology management institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia dothy.207032@mhs.its.ac.id, dothy@pelindo.co.id saut gurning department of marine engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia sautg@its.ac.id imam baihaqi department of business management institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia ibaihaqi@mb.its.ac.id jeri agerista sembiring department of marine engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, indonesia jeriagerista@gmail.com",
240,"Analysis Of Onomatopeia Translation Result On ""Komi  Can’T Communicate"" Comic Using Machine Translation","machine translations are commonly used for translation, but the result may not be correct, and the user might not know if the mistranslation happened. the research aims to identify the translation result of japanese onomatopoeia that was translated using google translate to indonesian, the difference between the google translate result and the indonesian translated version, and the cause of mistranslation. the qualitative method through library research was applied. the data source was from the comic entitled komi can’t communicate by tomohito oda. translation results would be analyzed using the descriptive analysis method. it can be concluded that the research found that google translates onomatopoeia translation had differences from the indonesian version from the difference in word usage to mistranslation due to language ambiguity and missing data. the author also finds the possibility of the lack of japanese onomatopoeic data on google translate or the lack of data for translating japanese onomatopoeic to indonesian, which causes translation errors. in addition, the authors also found that the translation technique used by google translate in translating onomatopoeia mainly uses the word-for-word translation method so that it produces one word from each translation process. however, there is also translation using the free translation method, which uses two words to translate one onomatopoeia so that the translation results can be better understood in the target language.","machine translation, onomatopoeia, google translate","After conducting the data analysis process in chapter 4, the author found that the results of the onomatopoeic translations contained in the comic ""Komi Difficult to Communicate"" by google translate can be divided into four categories, namely: a. The result of the translation that says the same and has the same meaning The result of this translation is the result of an onomatopoeic translation that uses words of the same level and meaning as those produced by the Indonesian version of the comic so that the resulting translation can be said to be equivalent to the translation found in the Indonesian version of the comic. b. The result of a translation that has the same meaning but uses different words The result of this translation is the result of an onomatopoeic translation that uses words that are different in level from the Indonesian version but still have the same meaning so that the translation process is successful and can be understood by the reader. In this category, many translations produced by Google Translate, compared to Indonesian, are not functionally the same as onomatopoeia, thus showing the lack of Google Translate in understanding words that are sounds or onomatopoeic as well as human translators even though the translation results have the same meaning. c. The results of the translation used are different, and the meaning shifts. The result of this translation is the result of an onomatopoeic translation that uses words that are different in level from the Indonesian version, and the meaning has shifted so that the results of the google translate translation in this category are difficult for readers to understand. Translation errors in this category can occur in the language transfer process. d. The translation results used are different, and the meaning is not close at all The result of this translation is the result of an onomatopoeic translation that uses words that are different in level from the Indonesian version, and the meaning is not close at all. In this section, some results show onomatopoeia that may not be in the google translate data, so there are ways of translating, such as changing the onomatopoeia directly to Indonesian by using the Japanese reading method, translating it from English to Indonesian, and performing automatic corrections on the onomatopoeia into words that approaching and in the google translate data and then translated into Indonesian. By comparing the results of the google translate translation and the Indonesian version of the comic, the author finds that many errors in the onomatopoeic translation by google translate occur due to language problems that have ambiguous nature. This causes many errors at the analysis stage of the onomatopoeia before being translated into Indonesian. In addition, the author also finds the possibility of the lack of Japanese onomatopoeic data on google translate or the lack of data for translating Japanese onomatopoeic to Indonesian, which causes translation errors. In addition, the author also finds that the translation techniques used by Google Translate in translating onomatopoeia mostly use the word-for-word translation method so that it produces one word from each translation process. However, there is also translation using the free translation method, which uses two words to translate one onomatopoeia so that the translation results can be better understood in the target language. The author realizes that this research is still far from perfect due to a lack of knowledge, time constraints, and data studied by the author, especially in selecting the data to be analyzed and looking for reliable sources to find the meaning of the onomatopoeia in both Japanese and Indonesian, which caused the writer to reduce the data. Therefore, for future research, the author suggests taking more data to add variety, looking for reliable sources, and having many data to clarify the meaning of onomatopoeia. With this research, it is hoped that it can help the general public, those who use machine translation services, and subsequent research to understand translation using machine translation. 2297","richard reenald japanese literature department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia richard.reenald@gmail.com elisa carolina marion japanese literature department faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia emarion@binus.edu","References

241,Analysis Of Japanese-Indonesian Translation Using Machine  Translation,"translating japanese to indonesian using the google translation engine is an easy thing. however, the results of the google translate translation must go along as possible with reasonable accuracy. this study aims to determine the accuracy of google translate translation in translating japanese articles into indonesian. the research uses combined research methods through literature studies from various literature sources. the theories used in this study are machali's assessment theory (2009), hartono's translation theory (2017), bassnett-mcguire's addition and subtraction theory (1991), and the bleu algorithm (2002). the data is taken from a speech of the ambassador of japan to indonesia, taken from an official article on the embassy's website. the research found the correct semantic assessment value, incorrect semantic assessment value, type of semantic error, and the value of the bleu algorithm assessment. google translate can provide a correct result in terms of semantics or meaning. the average correct semantic value indicates this is around 88.03%. the assessment of the bleu algorithm for google translate text gets an assessment result of 37.11. this average value includes a low value, which shows a significant difference in structure between the google translate text and the translator text. in other words, the results of google translate are suitable for conveying the meaning of the results of the translation. however, it is essential to improve the sentence structure of the results of google translations.","japanese, indonesian, bleu algorithm","The conclusions of this study indicate the accuracy of google translate in the translation results from Japanese into Indonesian for article data. The analysis carried out shows that google translate can provide a correct translation result in terms of semantics or meaning. This is indicated by the average correct semantic value is around 88.03%. Then the occurrence of shifting or incorrect translation results is about 11.94% of the total. Then the results of the semantic assessment above are different from the results obtained from the BLEU assessment for google translate text, where the average BLEU algorithm assessment produces a value of around 37.11 out of 100. This BLEU algorithm average value is a low value, which means it shows a difference the structure is quite far between the google translate text and the translator text.

This study is aimed to serve as a knowledge resource. The authors propose that future researchers substitute the variables analyzed above with other variables that affect dividend policy, as well as replace or add to the research sample. Companies should pay more attention to company profitability, liquidity, managerial ownership, and company growth in creating added value to increase company value. For investors, the results of this study can be used as information and an illustration of what factors can affect dividend policy. So that investors can consider it in making decisions to invest.","farida titik kristanti, wahdan arum inawati, fitriani nabila yasmin faculty of economics and business telkom university dayeuhkolot, 40257, kabupaten bandung, indonesia faridatk@telkomuniversity.ac.id wahdanaruminawati@telkomuniversity.ac.id nabilayasmin1603@gmail.com",
243,How Emotional Intelligence Influences Organizational  Culture Thus Impact To The Job Satisfaction Of Millennials,"this study was conducted due to the emergence of problems related to the low job satisfaction of marketing division employees who are included in the millennial category which is considered quite less optimum. since millennial generation is very plentiful with emotional differences, thus emotional intelligence is suspected to playing a role in shaping their job satisfaction. the data processing method used in this study is partial least square. the results showed that emotional intelligence affects the organizational culture of millennial generation employees, organizational culture has an effect on job satisfaction of millennial generation employees, emotional intelligence affects the job satisfaction of millennial generation employees, and organizational culture mediates the influence of emotional intelligence on job satisfaction of millennial generation employees. thereby, the main conclusion is that emotional intelligence influences organizational culture thus affects job satisfaction for millennial generation employees in automotive industry in east java. this means that companies are encouraged to educate all employees about the importance of companionship and appreciation among fellow employees, especially employees of the marketing division born in the millennial era who may tend to be more ignorant or mediocre to the environment so that later it can increase employee job satisfaction.","job satisfaction, fickle","After testing using the Partial Least Square method, this study found several conclusions that can be described as follows: 1). it was found that emotional intelligence has an effect on the organizational culture of millennial generation employees which means that if the millennial generation employees have the ability and intelligence to regulate their emotions, it will most likely encourage a good organizational culture in a company; 2). Furthermore, it was also found that organizational culture had an effect on job satisfaction of millennial generation employees which shows that when an employee already feels a positive culture, they will be satisfied when working in a company, because it is very difficult to be able to form a conducive environment in a company; 3). The results show that emotional intelligence directly affects job satisfaction of millennial generation employees. This means that the millennial generation employees are very concerned about the emotional intelligence abilities of other employees. Good emotional intelligence will make other employees feel comfortable working and of course with this situation, one of the factors of job satisfaction is formed; 4). The indication that emotional intelligence indirectly affects job satisfaction through organizational culture of millennial generation employees. This shows that emotional intelligence will have the ability to change employee job satisfaction only if they are able to improve the company's organizational culture. So that the employees of the millennials can be concluded that they really hope for emotional intelligence in forming a culture that can provide increased job satisfaction. Meanwhile, recommendations for further research are as follows: 1) Increasing the respondents’ number to get more accurate results; 2) Expanding the scope of observations since this study only focus on millennial generation employees in automotive industry in East Java. Moreover, the practical implications that can be described are as follows: 1. That referring to the emotional intelligence variable, it was found that the highest factor loading value on the emotional intelligence variable is indicator number 3 with the contents of the statement ""I feel that my co-workers have feelings of empathy"" which means that this indicator is the indicator that most strongly reflects the variable emotional intelligence, so that in order to increase emotional intelligence variables, companies are advised to educate all employees about the importance of brotherhood and empathy among employees, especially marketing division employees who were born in the millennial era who may tend to be more indifferent or indifferent to the environment so that later they can improve their jobs. employee satisfaction; 2. Referring to the organizational culture variable, it was found that the highest factor loading value in the organizational culture variable is indicator number 2 with the contents of the statement ""I feel that the distribution of resources to work is balanced"" which means that this indicator is the most strongly reflects the variable of organizational culture, so that in order to improve organizational culture variables, companies are advised to re-evaluate the distribution system of resources in the company such as the distribution of equipment, the needs of other employees such as tools or equipment that can help the work of other employees so that later it can increase employee job satisfaction.","employee in selected automotive industry in east java tinjung desy nursanti1, vannesa natasha prissilia lendeng2(*) (1,2) management department, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 tinjungdesy2600@binus.ac.id, vannesalendeng@binus.ac.id",

Users who are still pessimistic about electric cars and do not want to switch to EVs will say that their wishes are out of reach. 6. Conclusion The conclusion in this writing is the primary attitude most influential in the transition from conventional to electric vehicles. The primary purpose is to consider users' reactions to new electric vehicle products. Some studies describe the characteristics of early adopters, but subsequent studies determine general characteristics, for example, addition to socioeconomic conditions and high incomes. This is also because electric vehicles at the embryonic stage are still expensive compared to conventional vehicles, which are not too expensive. Such fears belong to a wider range of anxiety. This anxiety was discussed, and attempts were made to evaluate it numerically, suggesting that although similar situations can occur several times per year, it is still one of the main obstacles to the use of EVs precisely because of the theory of reactions to innovations, which does not allow a person to abandon the certainty of the present","ardhy lazuardy1,2, rahmat nurcahyo1* industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, indonesia ardhy.lazuardy@ui.ac.id, *corresponding autor: rahmat.eng@ui.ac.id 2 industrial engineering department, faculty of industrial technology gunadarma university depok, indonesia ardhy_lz@staff.gunadarma.ac.id",

The findings were gathered based on the interviews with four owners and nine employees from four Indonesian restaurants. According to the findings and analysis, culture has a significant influence on the leadership styles of Indonesian restaurant owners by affecting the way the owners manage and lead their businesses. Indonesian culture has a greater influence on the working culture of Indonesian restaurants in New Zealand. All the interviewees were born and raised in Indonesia. That is shown in how big the influence of Indonesian culture is. The interviewees applied New Zealand culture to adjust with the market and environment. It was also found that the management and leadership affect the business and employee performance. These two aspects are related to each other. All four applied a different leadership style but all the restaurants share the same goal to introducing Indonesian food to the New Zealand local market. Out of the three leadership styles, servant leadership, was found to be the least popular for Indonesian restaurant owners to apply. Most of the owners applied transformational and transactional leadership styles. The leadership and the way of managing the business is found to affect the business performance. For the managerial implications, these research findings can be beneficial for other Indonesian business players in New Zealand. The culture, specifically Indonesian and New Zealand cultures, affect the working culture and leadership of the owner, which leads to the business performance. It will help people to achieve good business performance by analyzing their leadership styles and learn from it. The limitations during the research include: a limited number of restaurant owners were interviewed because some of them were not available or unwilling to be interviewed. The locations of the restaurants were in different cities, so the researchers needed air travel to have face-to-face interviews, and there was a limitation to find more restaurants that had been running for more than a year, because there are not many Indonesian restaurants in New Zealand and some of the Indonesian restaurants had closed their businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, for future research, it is recommended to find more respondents to obtain more robust findings and a deeper analysis. Besides that, it will be beneficial to focus more on the employee retention and employee well-being in analyzing the performance. Then it is suggested to apply a mixed method for the analysis, using both qualitative and quantitative methods.","indonesian food and beverage businesses in new zealand ginta jasmine harahap and nurianna thoha international business program, management department, binus business school international undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta 11480, indonesia. nurianna@binus.edu",

Multiple attempts have been tried to bring unity to East Asia, yet it remains futile, and some event even brings regress to the integration process. Nevertheless, East Asia is highly functioning as a region in economic terms; with the development of industry 4.0, creating a digital economy through digitalization and ICT development has created a new space for East Asia countries to face. For a long, Japan and China have competed in the economic sector. However, with the arrival of the digital economy, China has won in its digital economy development. The concurrent China policy, and their expansion of digital infrastructure throughout the world, will bring East Asia to the creation of RTA. RCEP could be perceived as one result of this. With the existence of RCEP, digital economy development in East Asia is reassuring for the region's prospects. China leads in the digital economy, which has created circumstances for RCEP to be ratified by Asia-Pacific countries. The imperfect competition and scale economies of China have to bring cost reduction and trade suppression for e- commerce and digital market goods, which RCEP covers in their agreements. Digital Silk Road -their master plan to enhance digital connectivity- creates development in e-commerce implementation in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. Due to the high production of digital goods and the close geographic position of China, Japan, and South Korea, the three countries have intensified their trade relations. With China's focus on digital development, East Asian countries are experiencing a spillover effect where most of them are manufacturing electronic computing components and adopting them as their main exports. Lastly, due to their trade intensity, the reduction towards removal of custom duties on trade inside RCEP members has occurred this year.","albertus xaverianus research associate, centre for business and diplomatic studies (cbds) bina nusantara university palmerah, jakarta, indonesia albertus.xaverianus@binus.ac.id rangga aditya elias head department, international relations department faculty of humanity bina nusantara university palmerah, jakarta, indonesia raaditya@binus.edu",

MPI results show that the average TFPCH value of PT Angkasa Pura I is not too high. This means that PT Angkasa Pura I is not productive in managing its inputs and outputs, this happens because of the use of less-than-optimal technology in managing operational activities at airports managed by PT Angkasa Pura I. However, PT Angkasa Pura I has been quite efficient in managing its inputs and outputs because the average value of EFFCH is standard. 2. MPI results show that the average TFPCH value produced by PT Angkasa Pura II is high. This means that PT Angkasa Pura II is productive in managing its inputs and outputs. This productivity occurs because PT Angkasa Pura II is efficient in managing its inputs and outputs and is supported using optimal technology in managing its inputs and outputs. 3. Based on the comparison between the productivity of PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero), there are differences in the level of productivity. Which can be said that PT Angkasa Pura II is more productive than PT Angkasa Pura I in managing its inputs and outputs because the results of measuring the level of productivity show that PT Angkasa Pura I is not productive, and PT Angkasa Pura II is productive in managing its inputs and outputs. Even though, the result of different test TFPCH mean show that the difference between PT Angkasa Pura I (Persero) and PT Angkasa Pura II (Persero) is not significant.","fajra octrina lecturer, school of economics and business faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia fajraoctrina@telkomuniversity.ac.id nur laely student, school of economics and business faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia nurlaely@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id",
250,The Blockchain Technology Architectures To Improve The  Value Creation Of Crop Agriculture Supply Chain In,"businesses are adapting to build supply chain resilience to ensure long-term sustainability in response to globalization, rising climate, health, and poverty issues. the recent global health crisis has forced us to contribute to the sustainable development goals in the supply chain, especially agriculture supply chain management (ascm), which is responsible for food production and distribution. farmers have a function as producers but are frequently disadvantaged, and stakeholders often lack coordination. there is a paucity of knowledge regarding data transmitted between players and goods from the upstream to the downstream. the ascm can consider employing blockchain technology (bt) to address these concerns. the ascm anticipates that blockchain technology will enhance its operation and sustainability by maximizing value creation in each supply chain phase. this study aims to investigate the current state of indonesia's ascm, provide insight into the usage of blockchain, and propose a blockchain architectural model to enhance the value creation of ascm in indonesia. the researcher evaluates and assesses 15 publications, compares them to current situations, and recommends an improvement analysis for the future’s system. the final analysis reveals the proposed architectural model in ascm using blockchain technology with ethereum, and interplanetary file system that enables traceability, transparency, and great coordination among stakeholders. the possible created values mentioned are business process improvements; improving customer experience; data security; learning – developing of new capabilities; coordination; and tokenization.","architecture model, literature review",,"indonesia: a literature-based overview umi lutfiyah and annie purwani department of industrial engineering faculty of industrial technology universitas ahmad dahlan yogyakarta, indonesia umi1800019235@webmail.uad.ac.id, annie.purwani@ie.uad.ac.id","References

These results indicate that this study has not been able to prove that the accountability of village fund management is influenced by the internal control system. This research is in line with research conducted by Ani (2020) which states that the internal control system has no effect on the financial management of village funds. 5. Conclusions Based on the results of research and discussion, the following conclusions can be drawn: 1. The competence of the village fund management official does not affect the accountability of village fund management in a negative direction. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis and agency theory, the village official as an agent has not been able to maximize its performance well. The relationship of related competencies in terms of characteristics, communication, knowledge, and skills has not been implemented effectively and efficiently, resulting in the ability of the village official or the competence of the village official to significantly influence the performance of village financial management. 2. Community participation affects the accountability of village fund management. The results of this study are sufficient to support the hypothesis and agency theory where the community as the principal is aware of the importance of participating in assisting the village government in decision making, voting rights and conveying aspirations and contributions related to the management of village funds so as to create accountability in order to improve village development. 3. The use of technology affects the accountability of village fund management in a positive direction. The results of this study support the hypothesis and agency theory where the application of good information technology is expected to minimize the occurrence of information asymmetry between the government and the community regarding the management of village funds so as to increase public trust as principals to the village government. 4. The internal control system has no effect on the accountability of village fund management. The Village Consultative Body here acts as the party given the mandate (agent) to carry out the process of audit, evaluation, monitoring and other supervisory activities on the implementation of organizational tasks and functions in order to provide adequate confidence to realize good governance so that it can improve financial accountability through evaluation and improvement. The results of this study do not support agency theory where The Village Consultative Body as an agent has not been able to maximize its performance properly.

The flow process in the manufacture of chocolate paste, starting from the raw material transit warehouse, central kitchen, filling section, metal detecting, and packing section. There is a problem with the packing machine, namely the empty outer packaging. This is caused by several factors, the size of the chocolate paste, the sensor of the packing machine, the angle of the sliding hopper, and the brush in the auto feeder. The modification has the potential to drastically reduce the total cost of the defect. The corporation may save 46.5 percent on costs. The whole cost before improvement was $47.628 per month, however after improvement, the total cost was only $22,148 per month. In conclusion, the aim of this project was successful to apply systematic technique line efficiency for identification, determining solution, planning improvement, implementing the improvement plan, and evaluating solutions at the packing section and filling section to suggest the appropriate solution to reduce the cases of empty outer package 5.2 Recommendation As a result, several projects and manufactured products in which was involved are considered state confidential information, and only a few specific projects were given permission to be discussed because they have a lower level of confidentiality.

254,Integrated Text Mining And Kansei Engineering  Methodology For Excellent Amusement Park Services,"the excellent service with full emotional (kansei) satisfaction for an amusement park is a must. today the customers expect not only for the amazing show itself, but also the friendliness of staff, the cleanliness of the area, and the benefit package for family as family is the targeted segment for any amusement park industries. in fulfilling the full satisfaction of customer, the amusement park service provider should always provide what the customer needs and close the gap between what expected and perceived by the customer. the challenge is that customer not always at the right time and moment revealing what their expectations and critics. one way to get what genuinely customer feels about the service is through the reviews gathered from social media. in addition, there will be abundant and various customer feedbacks unconstrainted by time or any pressures. hence, we proposed text mining and kansei engineering methodology taken an empirical study on an amusement park services in indonesia. it was found that the critical kansei was “safe” and the service attribute was “the amusement park rides for family”. adding new amusement park rides and providing its regular maintenance schedule might be considered as sufficient solutions, with regard to limited resources.","kansei engineering, amusement park, service excellence","Fulfilling customer emotional needs (Kansei) is quiet challenging. It is not only because of the translation process, but also how to ensure appropriate and representative Kansei. Both external and internal factors influencing customer Kansei should be considered and put in the service design and development, especially for tourism industry which is of interesting in today’s economy. Hence, text mining and Kansei Engineering methodology taken an empirical study on an amusement park service in Indonesia was proposed. This study might be enhanced especially in the relationship between Kansei and perceived service attributes. Due to Kansei dynamics, more appropriate methods are welcome to investigate, and might also include usability analysis for technology-enabled products/services (Prastawa et al., 2019). It is also supported by the complexity of product or service experiences. More complex product or service will lead the more complex Kansei. 6.

Additionally, after comparing the results of the main optimization scenario with alternative one, it can be concluded that the location distribution is optimal. Finally, due to the nature of the method and data used in this optimization, the model can be used to optimize immunization processes for different vaccines or for other medications, and it can be applied in other developing countries.","sebastian cuya facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú 20160433@aloe.ulima.edu.pe mariela lima facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú 20160776@aloe.ulima.edu.pe rosa patricia larios - francia facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú rlariosf@ulima.edu.pe",
256,Legal Protection For Online Loan Companies For Debitors  Risk Of Default: Case Study Of Pt. Mitrausaha Indonesia,"in indonesia, the development of fintech has emerged since 2006. in september 2015 fintech companies in indonesia only gained public trust since the establishment of the indonesian fintech association (afi). at that time, people had looked at one of the fintech-based loans, namely peer-to-peer lending (p2pl) because it had its own advantages compared to banks, this was because not many people could meet the collateral requirements in applying for loans. then, the otoritas jasa keuangan (ojk) issued a special regulation, namely the pojk no.77/pojk.01/2016 concerning information technology-based lending and borrowing services. the legal relationship between the parties in peer to peer lending arises because of an agreement that has been agreed upon by both parties that is binding and creates rights and obligations for each party. the peer to peer lending service system requires clear authorization from the lender to the provider to channel the funds to the debtor (loan recipient). however, it is possible that with all the conveniences obtained there will be no legal problems. considering that it is very risky because the parties do not directly carry out the agreement or transact. so that legal protection both preventively and repressively is needed for legal certainty for the parties in the event of default and/or default from both the loan recipient and the organizer. in this regard, this research further aims to find out and analyze how the concept of legal protection for the parties, especially the organizers, is related to the risk of default and/or default in peer to peer lending-based loan services.","default, agreement","As explained above, the agreement made by the parties based on Article 1320 of the Civil Code applies as law for the parties in accordance with the provisions of Article 1338 Paragraph (1) of the Civil Code. In this case, there is a legal relationship between the parties, namely the existence of rights and obligations, but it cannot be denied that things such as default by the debtor can occur. Default can be done intentionally or unintentionally. The occurrence of default results in other parties being harmed, especially for creditors and the organizers. The principle of legal protection is one of the very basic principles in contract law. The concept of legal protection is divided into 2 (two) namely preventive legal protection which is preventive in nature and repressive legal protection which has a deterrent effect. So the form of protection for creditors and providers is that the debtor bears the consequences of not carrying out obligations which can be in the form of cancellation of the agreement or fulfillment of the agreement accompanied by demands for compensation, or only demanding compensation. In addition, another form of protection is to give the debtor an opportunity due to overmacht (forced circumstances).","group (modalku) zafira mega permata faculty of humanity binus university jakarta, indonesia zafira.permata@binus.ac.id paulus aluk fadjar dwi santo, s.h., m.h., senior lecturer of business law binus & head of department faculty of humanity binus university jakarta, indonesia paulus_afds@binus.edu",
257,How Do Gender And Social-Interaction Environment Affect  Fraud Perception?,"the trend of women choosing a profession in the accounting field is increasing. based on data from the american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa) it turns out that 50 percent of accounting graduates are women. the increase affects the development of the number of women who pursue the accounting profession. in 1996 it was recorded that 25 percent of public accountant certificate holders in america were women. audit quality is needed so that auditing standards become audit guidelines. the phenomenon in the world of auditor practice is still showing various reductions in audit quality (reduced audit quality). there are 2 gender models, (1) equality and complementary contribution models, (2) sex role stereotypes and managerial stereotypes. the first model assumes that there are no differences between men and women as professionals in management and that of women, thereby describing equal access. the second model between men and women have different abilities so that they need differences in managing and different in assessing, recording, and combining to produce a synergy. the purpose of this study was to examine the effect of gender and social interaction on perceptions of fraud among government auditors. questionnaires were used for data collection. the research sample is auditors at the inspectorate of south kalimantan province. a sample of 100 auditor respondents was used to prove the hypothesis. the results of the study state that auditor gender diversity has a significant effect on the perception of fraud, where female auditors have a higher perception of fraud. this means that female auditors have higher ethical behavior so that there is a tendency for female auditors to have higher perceptions of fraud. social interaction also has a positive and significant effect on the perception of fraud. this means that the auditor in good association, in a religious environment will have a positive ethical view so that he will view fraud as something wrong and illegal. key words gender, social interactions, fraud. 1. introduction professionalism is an absolute requirement for people who work as auditors or kap employees. public accountants who have a high view of professionalism will make contributions that can be trusted by decision makers. to run that demands wider responsibilities, employees whose responsibilities are expanding, kap employees must have broad insights about the complexities of modern organizations (shorea dwarawati, 2005). currently, there is an increasing trend of women choosing a profession in the accounting field. based on research conducted by the accountant 2454",,"The social environment is related to the social environment, including all conditions, circumstances, and human interactions that surround it. However, humans will interact with the social environment that surrounds their lives. A person's social environment will include the type of interaction around the house in which one lives, the type of work one does, one's available income, and the laws and social rules that govern that person. The social environment involves individuals, both familiar and unfamiliar; group; organization; and community and includes all social institutions that influence individual behavior. This means that someone who is surrounded or is in a good social environment such as in a religious environment will have a positive view of ethics so that he will view fraud as wrong and illegal. The results of this study lead to a conclusion that women have a better perception of fraud than men. This is a follow- up to many studies that women have a better work ethic than men. The emotional nature that is greater than the rational nature makes women feel more emotional when they see injustice and things that have low ethics. The social interaction factor obtained has a positive influence on the perception of fraud. wider social interaction will view fraud as something that is not worth doing.

258,The Art And Science In Strategic Approach To Enhance  Innovativeness And Performance In Financing Industry,"the importance of innovativeness is one of the most discussed topics in several studies. but theres is still inconsistencies about the effect from innovativeness to performance. especially in the dynamic environment and under-performance condition like financing industry in indonesia, which has declined in growth from the past decade. this research seeks to analyze the most influential factors on performance and innovativeness in terms of the variable strategic approach and variable ways of gathering information at the manager level in the finance industry. study literature will be use to build some hypothesis at first stage, then quantitative research method will be implement at second stage for hypothesis testing. sample technique that use in this research is two stage stratified random sampling. data collection by questionnaire from 242 managers in financial industry will be analyzing with partial least square. after finalize data analysis, the result showed that the effect of innovativeness on manager performance was not significant. the novelty in this research is the explanation why the managers in financing industry are difficult relatively to enhance their innovativeness. the results expected can be used as recommendations for enhancing innovativeness and manager’s performance, especially for the performance improvement in the financing industry.","performance, innovativeness, strategic approach, strategic art, strategic science","Based on the hypothesis test above, there is several conclusions and recommendations. At the first hypothesis, innovativeness has a positive relation but insignificant effect on manager performance (H1a is rejected, H1b is accepted). Then strategic approach has a positive and significant effect on innovativeness (H2 is accepted). From this relationship, it can be interpreted that the strategic art approach has a positive and significant relationship to innovativeness (H2a is accepted). Conversely, the strategic science approach has a negative and significant effect on innovativeness (H2b is accepted). Then the strategic approach variable has a positive and significant relationship to manager performance (H3 is accepted). From hypothesis testing, it can be interpreted that the strategic art approach has a positive and significant relationship to managerial performance (H3a is accepted). Conversely, the strategic science approach has a negative and significant relationship to performance (H3b is accepted). Then the manager's way of gathering information also has a positive and significant effect on the strategic approach (H4 is accepted). Based on this, intuitive managers tend to be a strategic artist (H4a is accepted). And sensing managers tend to be strategic scientist (H4a is accepted). The research here still has several limitations, so further research is required. Further research that can be carried out, for example, to analyze whether there are differences between the functional manager at the head office, regional offices and branch offices, is indeed a factor that influences and becomes a differentiator. In this case, the difference between the branch manager and headquarters manager. Branch managers often designed as an operational manager. In different language, they act as executive manager to monitor day to day activities and act as transactional leaders. While headquarter manager often designed as a think-tank for their company. They are work as technocrats to create business policy, guideline and system operating procedures. Then operating procedures will be published to be implemented in the branch office. So this further research can be carried out using discriminant analysis techniques to prove this.","heru santosa hadiyanto senior lecturer, binus business school bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia hadiyanto.heru@yahoo.com",

263,Piercing The Corporate Veil: Effectiveness Of Alter Ego  And Instrumentality Legal Test,"limited liability is a principle where the shareholders are considered separated from the assets of the company, and their losses are only limited to the shares owned. limited liability can result in moral hazard and irresponsible domination. to prevent such a situation, many countries have adopted the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, which makes the veil that limits legal entities with their shareholders can be torn so that this doctrine allows shareholders in certain cases to be responsible for their personal assets. in determining the applicability of piercing the corporate veil, courts in the united states have developed some legal tests, namely, alter ego and instrumentality rules. however, this doctrine is not as easy and simple as it seems because its application is determined based on a case-by-case basis and the courts have great freedom to make judgments. thus, it become generally recognized that piercing the corporate veil is lost in a fog of metaphor. due to such a reality, one of the purposes of law as stated by gustav radbruch (justice) is not fulfilled, where it makes third parties rarely get compensation, and does not provide a deterrent so the actions against the law of the company organs will continue. therefore, this research will be conducted through a normative juridical research method using a statutory approach and a of comparative law approach. this paper will present comprehensive theories regarding piercing the corporate veil, as well as the case law from united states and indonesia.","alter ego, instrumentality, legal liability","Piercing the Corporate Veil Doctrine has been adopted in Indonesia through Law no. 40 of 2007, which stipulates that shareholders can be personally responsible if the shareholders take the actions that have been formulated in Article 3 paragraph (2). Meanwhile, the Board of Directors (Article 97 paragraph (3)) and the Board of Commissioners (Article 114 paragraph (3)) can also be held responsible if they are negligent or make mistakes in carrying out their duties. This doctrine is important so that shareholders, directors, and the board of commissioners do not abuse the limited liability principle of the company. Unfortunately, the Article a quo is in fact rarely used by judges so that this Article is only empty. As a result, the company's organs are rarely reached for accountability to their personal assets. Based on such facts, the author recommends that Indonesia: 1) Learning from the United States, it becomes urgent for Indonesia to apply the Alter Ego and Instrumentality legal test as an alternative for judges to uncover the corporate veil. These two legal tests are often seen as interchangeable because they have similar properties, so Indonesia is recommended to use three tests that are considered more complete, namely: The existence of perfect control of the company's organs over the company, control for inappropriate purposes, and causality between act of domination with the resulting loss. 2) Consideration is needed for the Indonesian government to revise all laws and regulations which regulate corporations so that they can incorporate the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil, alter ego, and instrumentality into related regulations. This is intended so that corporate organs that act beyond their authority (ultra vires) and use corporations to commit criminal acts can be held personally liable.","fellin student of business law, law department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 fellin@binus.ac.id paulus aluk fajar dwi santo lecturer, business law program, law department bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia11480 paulus_dwisanto@binus.ac.id",

This research presents an extension of the conducted work by Mechmech et al (2020) to the multi-item context. A framework for clearance partner selection. Indeed, a four-step decision-making framework is developed, which represents a useful tool for selecting clearance partners. In a second step, an extension of the mathematical model developed by Mechmech et al (2020) is proposed. The latter aims to select partners and allocate the unsold inventory for a single product, using the ε-constraint technique. The model of the present work aims to handle the multi-product multi-partner case, while explicitly considering three objective functions. The resolution is carried out with the lexicographic multi-objective optimization using the CPLEX software. Results show that the optimal solution is highly dependent on expert opinions and performance risk evaluations.

266,"Strategy To Achieve Soybean Price Stability: System  Dynamics Approach (Study In Central Java Province,","soybean price fluctuations become an important problem in indonesia every year. the demand for soybeans increases every year in line with population growth and the soybean processing industry. the current problem is that soybean demand is increasing, but domestic production cannot match it, local soybean production is still low and cannot meet demand. the problems that arise in the logistics of the central java soybean supply chain are interrelated. another logistical obstacle often faced by farmers in the long chain of the trade from farmers to consumers is the distribution and marketing of soybeans. in terms of distribution of market price competition, the price of imported soybeans is much cheaper than local soybeans. soybean dependence on imported products has consequences on local soybean prices that are not able to compete, resulting in price instability. this study will develop a dynamic system model that aims to support soybean price stability with several policy simulations (case study: in central java province). the relationship between variables that will be simulated with a dynamic system is about food needs (demand), total soybean availability (supply), and soybean prices (distribution) using a dynamic system framework. the result of the model scenario is the bulog intervention policy (re-functioning bulog's role as a soybean procurement agency). these policies can be used as supporting material for government and stakeholder decisions in developing strategies for 2534",,,"indonesia) isna nugraha industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas pembangunan nasional veteran jawa timur surabaya 60294, indonesia isna.nugraha.ti@upnjatim.ac.id bekti nugrahadi industrial engineering department, faculty of science, technology, and health universitas sahid surakarta surakarta, indonesia bekti.nugrahadi@usahidsolo.ac.id wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology research group industrial engineering and techno-economic industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id muhammad hisjam department of industrial engineering head of logistics and business system laboratory faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, indonesia hisjam@staff.uns.ac.id",
267,Dysergonomic Risk Management Model To Improve Welding  Productivity Using The Nordic Questionnaire And The Reba,"due to the nature of the activities performed, the welding position in the metal-mechanical processes exposes its workers to various risks that generate severe damage to their safety and health, affecting both the worker and the company due to the loss of man hours due to medical breaks that impact on lower productivity, as well as economic losses. dysergonomic risk deserves special attention due to the high frequency and severe consequences of musculoskeletal trauma that it can generate in its workers, and in this sense the objective of the research is to improve the productivity of the welding position through the prevention of dysergonomic risk by providing an occupational health management model for its application. by means of the nordic standardized questionnaire, the analysis of musculoskeletal symptoms was carried out, selecting as object of study the welding activities performed for the modification of excavator buckets, observing as risk factors the postural effort and the manual shuffling of parts, from which the reba (rapid entire body assessment) and the niosh (the national institute for occupational safety and health) methods were selected for the evaluation of the dysergonomic risk. in conclusion, an 11% increase in average productivity levels has been achieved.","ergonomics, productivity","The results of the research have shown that by means of the standardized Nordic questionnaire it was possible to establish that welding technicians were more exposed to Musculoskeletal Traumas and in this way two critical tasks were identified: the modification of excavator bucket and the manual loading of weights, achieving in the short term, through the application of the REBA method and the NIOSH method, an increase of 11% in the average productivity levels in welding work and a rate of less than 1% for worker absences. Based on the results obtained in this study, it can be affirmed that by reducing dysergonomic risks in the company, greater efficiency in productivity can be obtained, due to the fact that the operator has reduced the risk of seeing his health affected by the dysergonomic risk, improving the average time per job; which is congruent with the study of Gonzales et al. 2016 that presents the application of the REBA method in a tinplate packaging factory demonstrating after the evaluation and the proposed improvements the REBA score was reduced from an average of 11.5 points to 9.25 points with positive effects increasing productivity by 1.95%. There is evidence of similar works in other sectors, such as the research of Abdullaha et al. 2020, presenting automotive maintenance jobs exposed to uncomfortable and repetitive postures executed at different times of the workday, becoming habits of bad practices and in the absence of inspections or having standards of execution, favor the appearance of musculoskeletal traumas proposing as the best preventive action to regularly apply periods of active breaks with stretching exercises. It is very remarkable the research of Moradi et al. 2017 that shows that repetitive movements, weight loading, use of tools without ergonomic design, lack of rest breaks and standing for long periods of time are risk factors that frequently generate Work related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), so it suggests that workers should receive proper postural training during the performance of their tasks as well as in the use of appropriate and ergonomic means equipment and hand tools being mechanization and automation two techniques to minimize the risk those jobs.","and niosh methods: case of the metal-mechanic sector in lima, perú. andrea lara-lezcano and sebastian pizarro-vásquez facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú 20163218@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20163443@aloe.ulima.edu.pe carlos-augusto lizárraga-portugal and juan carlos quiroz-flores research profesor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú clizarra@ulima.edu.pe, jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",

The work contributes by studying the dimensions of digital marketing and the link with the student recruitment process followed by Peruvian private universities with a business or entrepreneurial focus. Finally, the study found that the social network, email marketing, SEO & SEM, content marketing, and customer relationship marketing dimensions of digital marketing have a positive and significant relationship with the student recruitment process. Highlighting the fact that the correlation between the main variables without any dimension distinction is even higher. In addition, this has been supported by three marketing managers who point out that digital marketing tools influence the student recruitment process by reducing department costs and time dedicated to following a lead, allowing to reach and attract a greater number of prospective students, and providing a greater capacity for segmentation and measurement of results in real-time. All of these are key factors in the success of any marketing strategy. Therefore, it was concluded that digital marketing and its dimensions are related to the student recruitment process.","sector in perú andres sotomayor-vidal and diego alonso mini-cuadros facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú 20174121@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20160901@aloe.ulima.edu.pe juan carlos quiroz-flores research professor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",

270,Environmental Impact Of Medical Waste Treatment  Ariana Daniela Bartet Solorzano And,"the significant increase in the generation of medical waste in recent years has raised many concerns worldwide. this work aims to determine the environmental impacts produced by the different technologies used for the recovery of medical waste as part of waste management (incineration and pyrolysis), thermal treatments considered effective for the decontamination and sterilization of infectious medical waste. the leopold matrix was applied to evaluate in quantitative terms the environmental impacts of each of the processes. for this purpose, the interactions of the physical, biological, and socioeconomic elements were established with each of the stages of the waste management treatment processes, which were evaluated using the results of a literature review. in the physical aspect, the negative impact of soil, air and water contamination was considered; in the biological aspect, the damage caused to flora and fauna; and in the socioeconomic aspect, the risk of spreading diseases; despite the generation of employment and contribution to the economy. the results showed that both waste management treatments are polluting; however, pyrolysis scored higher, reflecting that this treatment generates fewer negative impacts than incineration. this research is a starting point for further research into new methods of medical waste management that are environmentally friendly and efficient.","medical waste, leopold matrix","After the quantitative evaluation of the environmental impact caused by the management and final disposal of medical waste by incineration and pyrolysis using the Leopold matrix, it can be concluded that both methods are polluting and harmful to the environment because both obtained a negative value. In the case of incineration, a value of -523 was obtained and the pyrolysis method a value of -51. Although the accuracy of the analyses in this study is inevitably subjective, this research is a starting point for further research into new, more eco-friendly, and effective methods of medical waste management and disposal. Although treatment and disposal options such as incineration and pyrolysis have been effective in the management of medical waste (including COVID-19 waste), new and improved technologies have recently been introduced. Some of the most recent include irradiation (UV, Cobalt 60, electron beam), thermal (quartz infrared dry heat or plasma pyrolysis) and other inactivation mechanisms (including electrothermal inactivation and gasification) (Andeobu et al. 2022).","maría josé muñoz wu faculty of engineering and architecture university of lima lima, perú 20180192@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20181276@aloe.ulima.edu.pe rosa patricia larios-francia research professor faculty of engineering and architecture university of lima lima, perú rlariosf@ulima.edu.pe",

272,"Project Management Model Applying Agile, Design  Thinking And Lean Methodologies For The Improvement Of","the following article is based on the approach of a project management model that aims to solve business problems from an innovative perspective, based on consumers’ needs. this model is based on integrating design thinking, agile and lean methodologies. the case of a brokerage insurance peruvian company was analyzed, which perceived various drawbacks around the customer service area. this article recognizes the most appropriate improvement for the case studied, by following the steps of the adapted management model; starting with the traditional stages of design thinking to make a precise diagnosis of the situation and with this information, improvement proposals that solve what has been identified are established. subsequently, the most appropriate improvement is selected under objective criteria, and sprints that allow making good use of agile are organized to develop the specific execution using a sequence of steps according to the pdca cycle, a characteristic technique of lean where the goal is to ensure a constant reevaluation of processes. after the results obtained from the simulation of the studied process, an increase in attention span of 88% was obtained, which allows us to calculate a significant economic benefit in the company that would represent 29.25% of the revenues achieved in 2021. in conclusion, it’s possible to validate the proposed model, verifying its original properties of adaptability and replicability without limit of scenarios regarding the sector, area, or company size due to the great synergy existing between the three innovative methodologies unified for the development of the proposed model.","agile, design thinking, lean, pdca cycle","The present article managed to demonstrate the viability of a project management model based on the Design Thinking, Agile and Lean methodologies since the positive results were obtained in the case of application by following each of the steps established after the review of literature that allowed knowing the existing synergy between these innovation methodologies. From the investigation and resolution of the practical case using engineering tools, it is feasible to conclude that these are versatile and allow optimal and rapid results to be achieved in any type of proposal or business area. The theory proposed by the authors Rau et. al (2019) classifies various techniques and instruments according to their scope by research topic; This is consistent with what was developed in the present case since what is established is put into practice by using tools that are consistent with the objectives set under criteria justified by the problem detected. It is important to recognize that once the objectives set before the implementation of the management model have been achieved, all areas of the company must incorporate and maintain the philosophy of continuous improvement to see results with greater impact. This is demonstrated in the present study by finding new opportunities for improvement; Therefore, although it was possible to reduce times and increase customer satisfaction from the application of the management model for consumer service, it is detected that a greater impact would be obtained by reinforcing the company's sales force to take advantage of the positive economic effect obtained and thereby increase profitability.

276,Investigation Of Power Factor Improvement For Non-Linear  Furnace Inverter,"advanced technology is required to support the needs of metal manufacture in shaping many various products. an electrical furnace with inverter topology is one of example advanced technology application to melt and alloy metals and refractories. however, a furnace inverter is a non-linear load that creates voltage and current harmonics in the electrical network. harmonics generate distortions and voltage variations in the electrical grid and it makes the grid is out of balance. another effect of an electric furnace is a decrease in power factor, resulting in reduced electrical efficiency as well as transformer capacity. in this works, a model investigation and analysis are carried out to combine a active power factor correction and active hybrid filters to get the best outcomes for better furnace inverter performance to the electrical grid. the furnace inverter is modeled in equivalent power and control circuit to deliver the matched value in power factor with 1-3 percent difference to manufacturing data equipment. the results of the experiment show that the proposed model for the modified furnace has delivered the improving electrical power quality in the power factor by 13 percent to 17 percent. the other promising results are a reduction in power distortions, sag, and swell.","furnace inverter, power factor","Several conclusions from the results and analysis are: a. By making improvements, the simulation of the results of the furnace inverter also produces an improvement in power distortion caused by harmonics. b. The results of the simulation model of the furnace inverter have produced a good range of similarities between data factory and experiment in the value of 1% until 3%. c. The addition of active power factor correction and active hybrid filter in the simulation of the furnace inverter circuit resulted in the highest increase in power factor value for a capacity of 1 ton at a load of 400 kg with a active power factor correction from 0.693 to 0.865 or 17% correction. At a capacity of 3-ton with a load of 1200kg, a active power factor correction is successfully made from 0.693 to 0.854 with a 16% increment. 2642","anggita chandra pradita departement of electrical engineering faculty of engineering diponegoro university semarang, indonesia anggitachandra63@gmail.com mochammad facta departement of electrical engineering faculty of engineering diponegoro university semarang, indonesia mochfacta@gmail.com hermawan departement of electrical engineering faculty of engineering diponegoro university semarang, indonesia hermawan.60@gmail.com","References

279,Analysis Of The Effect Of Government Business Support  Services And Absorptive Capacity Moderation On The Smes,"small and medium enterprises (smes) are the backbone of indonesia's industry, so their development is very important for the government. one of the efforts of the west nusa tenggara regional government to help the smes is development through facilitating the stip entrepreneurial incubator, where stip aims to help the problems faced by smes, such as the provision of the latest facilities and machines, training for smes, as well as exposure and marketing assistance, to encourage the performance of smes. this is very important in the context of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, which has resulted in many smes experiencing productivity erosion that threatens their sustainability of smes. however, support from the government is not always enough for smes because there is a gap between what is provided by the government and what the business needs, and there is an absorptive capacity factor that is an important determinant in determining how successful the business incubation program is. therefore, an evaluation is needed to determine whether government assistance has been effective in improving the performance of smes, which is the purpose of this study with the structural equation modeling – partial least square (sem-pls) method. the results showed that there was a significant influence of government business support services and absorptive capacity moderation on sme performance, with proposals to improve the implementation of the absorptive capacity development framework in the entrepreneurial incubation program.",sme performance,"The results of the outer model evaluation show that the model was valid in a convergent and discriminant manner, as well as reliable. Meanwhile, the inner model show that the coefficient of determination was moderate, the prediction is relevant, and the suitability of the model was large. There was a positive and significant relationship between Government Business Support Services and SME Performance. The Absorptive Capacity exerts a positive and significant moderation influence between the relationship of Government Business Support Services to SME Performance.The structural model obtained from SEM-PLS as follows: 𝜂𝜂1 = 0.284𝜉𝜉1 + 0.639𝜉𝜉2 + 0.163𝜉𝜉1𝜉𝜉2 + 0.24. The SME performance will increase by 0.284 if the Government Business Support Services variable increases by one unit and other variables are considered constant, and will increase by 0.639 if the Absorptive Capacity variable increases by one unit and other variables are considered constant, and also will increase by 0.163 if the moderation effect of the interaction of the Absorptive Capacity variable with Government Business Support Services increases by one unit and other variables are considered constant. The proposed improvement obtained based on the results of the analysis was the implementation of an absorptive capacity development framework to increase the moderation effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between government business support services on the performance of SMEs.","performance using the structural equation modeling (case study: stip ntb entrepreneurial incubator) tiena g. amran, anik nur habybah, rane arthur indraputra industrial engineering department, faculty of industrial technology trisakti university jakarta, indonesia tiena@trisakti.ac.id; anik@trisakti.ac.id; rane063001800001@std.trisakti.ac.id",

281,Public-Private Partnership In The Provision Of Street  Lighting Equipment In Bandung City,"as of 2018, bandung city has approximately 28,000 street lighting equipment (sle). government constraints in providing funds to optimize sle lead to limited government ability to optimize sle. however, with the opening of the tap of the private sector's involvement policy in managing sle infrastructure, there is the potential to optimize sle. the problem in implementing the sle ppp project is determining a suitable ppp scheme for providing sle in bandung. the obstacles include investment development schemes, the sle database, and weak coordination between stakeholders. this research uses a qualitative approach. determining the object of the study is carried out utilizing purposeful samples. while data collection techniques by performing observation, interview, documentation tracing, and audiovisual. test reliability and validity using triangulation techniques. the resulting research concluded that the provision of sle in the city of bandung is to involve business entities in designing, building, financing, operating, and maintaining sle infrastructure assets which will later become investments of the bandung city government. alternatively, in other words, the ppp scheme suitable for the provision of sle bandung city is to use the design-build-operate-maintain (dbom) type using the available payment return mechanism.",bandung,"Based on the above research results, it was concluded that the provision of SLE in the City of Bandung is to involve business entities to design, build, finance, operate, and maintain SLE infrastructure assets, which will later become investments in the Bandung City Government. Alternatively, in other words, the PPP scheme that is suitable for the provision of SLE Bandung City is to use the DBOM (Design- Build-Operate-Maintain) type using the availability payment (AP) return on investment mechanism. SLE infrastructure is one of the essential infrastructures for developing an area. Good lighting by SLE will certainly increase economic flows in the area because economic activity is hardly limited by the time possible. After all, the road can be adequately illuminated, and good visibility on the environment and roads reduces the risk of crime and accidents. With the explanation above, the challenges that can arise in SLE infrastructure projects can be adequately managed so that the project can run efficiently, both from the time and resources needed. 2695","kurniadi department of entrepreneurship binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia kurniadi003@binus.ac.id syafei ibrahim, badruzzaman, and harris purnama department of public administration post graduate program iskandar muda university, banda aceh, indonesia syafeibrahim@yahoo.com, badruzzaman@yahoo.com, harrispurnama@yahoo.com wiedy yang essa development planning and research agency bandung city government, indonesia essadesember@gmail.com","References

The results of the types of waste and the factors that cause waste in the production process of Portland cement composite bagging are waiting time in the process and torn cement bags in the product. This can occur due to clogged tubes at the filling station and the method of opening the cement bag is less than optimal 2. Before the implementation of the sigma level value in the process of 3.573, it means that the activities of the cement bagging production process can be said to be quite good. After the implementation, the sigma level value obtained is 3.757 which means that the activities of the cement bagging production process have increased after implementation. This can be seen from the increase in the value of the sigma level of 0.184 compared to the value of the sigma level that occurred in January 2022. 3.

285,Factors Related To Active Learning: Perspective Of Learning  Technology Development,"the covid-19 pandemic has caused significant changes in every aspect of daily life. many educational institutions around the world have decided to cancel in-person classes and move all classes to online mode. despite the fact that in-person classroom learning is said to be more effective and preferable, online learning has played a significant role in limiting covid-19 transmission. with recent technological advancements, synchronous e-learning allows teachers to communicate and interact with students virtually. however, in several studies, the effectiveness of on-site and online learning has been studied and compared. according to the survey, about 65.9% of the sample group prefer to study on-site rather than study online regards to its limitation of interaction. it would be great if the development of learning technology, especially online learning platform, provide the appropriate functionality that supports active learning activities. thus, the purpose of present study was to investigate the key factors that contributed to active learning in the context of online learning. this study conducted systematic reviews of the prisma-p together with 96 users interview from both learners and teachers to extract the key factors that related to active learning in online learning platform. as a result, the factors that contribute to and support active learning are critical thinking, decision- making, problem-solving, effective questioning, idea demonstration, participatory, micro-interaction, self-reflection, and the positive teacher-student relationship. implications for future learning technology development were discussed.","active learning, factor","The objective of this study was to identify key factors related to active learning in the context of online learning to bridge the gap between on-site and online learning by applying these key factors from active learning to the route of development of online learning technology. This study conducted systematic reviews of the PRISMA-P together with real users interview from both learners and teachers to extract key factors that related to active learning in online learning platform. Nine effective factors are critical thinking, decision-making, problem-solving, effective questioning, idea demonstration, participatory, micro-interaction, self-reflection, and positive teacher-student relationship. These factors are fundamentally support active learning via online platforms that are student-centered and communicative (i.e. interaction among students or between students and teachers). As a result, these factors could be used as a guideline for the development of synchronous e-learning technology that naturally support active learning. However, there are some limitations in present study. First, all interview sessions were conducted online, this may limit the quality of communication between interviewee and interviewer. Second, the stimulus online learning platform were limited only on Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet as these platforms were mainly used in Thai university to provide classes during COVID-19 pandemic. Future work should consider to bring these finding factors to develop some designing tools for active learning technology development. Moreover, it should be worth considering in conducting usability evaluation of each learning technology for active learning activities in order to define the gap of user interface and match those need with factors providing from current study. 6.","nutnicha sornlump, arisara jiamsanguanwong* department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering chulalongkorn university bangkok, thailand *arisara.j@chula.ac.th waratta authayarat department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering burapha university chonburi, thailand",

293,Automatic Lobster Feeder Based On Web Integrated With  Internet Of Things,"freshwater lobsters have a high mortality rate due to poor water quality or cannibalism between lobsters. in the lobster cultivation process, the process of monitoring water quality and feeding is done manually so that it has problems in the monitoring and feeding process that is carried out at night because lobsters are nocturnal animals. this study uses freshwater crayfish with the type of red claw with a total of 20 lobster seeds in 2 ponds with an internet of things-based system and integrated web monitoring and without an iot system. this study aims to build a system that can increase the survival of freshwater crayfish using an iot-based system called smart lobster feeder. the analytical methods used include observation, literature study, and interview. the development method used is the waterfall method with 6 stages of the process, namely planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, and verification. this research uses the esp8266 microcontroller, esp32 cam, water salinity sensor, ph sensor, temperature sensor, ultrasonic, and website monitoring. the results in this study obtained a sensor error rate value of < 1.5%, uat results of 94%, automatic feeding according to the specified hour, and a survival rate of 100%. from the study results, it can be concluded that the iot system can increase the survival rate of freshwater crayfish, has a sensor error rate that is by established standards and is a feasible system to implement.","freshwater lobster, esp8266, esp32, iot","Based on the results of the analysis of the research conducted, the design and implementation of the Smart Lobster Feeder can Wednesdayse the effectiveness and efficiency of freshwater crayfish cultivation by helping field officers to feed automatically at night and during the day. This system also helps officers to monitor the water quality of the lobster pond to determine the schedule for draining the pond following the freshwater crayfish pond water quality standards. Smart Lobster Feeder works by displaying the data read on the sensor to the dashboard IoT monitoring that has been made, starting from the DS18B20 sensor, TDS sensor, pH sensor, an ultrasonic sensor. the dashboard that has been created will also display the state of the pool directly using the ESP32-CAM that has been set to view the condition of the pool in real time. The results of the system implementation carried out for 2 weeks also showed the Survival Rate of lobster ponds using the IoT system had a higher level of 15% when compared to the Survival Rate from lobster ponds without an IoT system. This shows that ponds with IoT systems have maintained water quality because draining is carried out if the existing parameters increase and the scheduled lobster feeding hours every 00:00 WIB and 12:00 WIB helps to prevent the occurrence of feed deposits in the lobster pond. Based on this research, the author has several suggestions such as using an ESP32 CAM which only has VGA resolution so that the results of the video displayed have poor quality. The suggestion from this is to use an IP Camera or IP CCTV that is connected to the internet to produce much better video quality.","muhammad ihsaan ramadhan, ngunandika yoga putra computer science department, binus online learning, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11480 mihsaan.r@gmail.com; ngunandikay@gmail.com suharjito computer science department, binus online learning, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11480 suharjito@binus.edu",

298,Mobile Application Implementation As Agriculture 4.0  Strategy For Sugarcane Yield Prediction,"information engineering strategies play a vital role in agriculture 4.0 to increase the product value, one of which is sugarcane commodities. sugarcane production estimation has traditionally been practiced by recording data on a paper note. the recorded data were subsequently transferred to a computer by a sugar factory plantation assistant. errors in calculating or inputting data into a computer can occur, storage space for paper documents is also limited, and farmers cannot independently calculate their production potential. therefore, our study aims to create an android-based sugarcane production application as an information engineering strategy to predict sugarcane yields by farmers and plantation assistants. this study used the waterfall method with the sdlc (software development life cycle) model. observations were performed by collecting data. interviews were conducted with plantation assistants to produce related information on how to calculate sugarcane estimation. the analysis was carried out by examining the relationship between observation and interview data as a tool for developing an application interface and algorithm system design. the application makes it easier for farmers to estimate production potential, allowing them to get data on sugarcane productivity during harvest. hence, the sugar factory could guarantee the quantity and quality of sugarcane raw materials.","agriculture 4.0, productivity, estimation","An application was developed to calculate sugarcane production estimation based on an android mobile system. The application development used the waterfall method with the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) model and interface design that supports the sublime editor program making it easier for users to access android-based applications. Observations, interviews, and literature studies were employed as a requirement gathering process. Interviews with plantation assistants were conducted to gather information on how to estimate sugarcane production. The application and interface were designed based on observation and interview data. Advancements in technology, particularly in the information sector, make it easier for everyone to have access to the same information. Farmers could be used the application to predict production potential and collect data on sugarcane productivity throughout harvest. Hence, the quantity and quality of sugarcane raw materials could be guaranteed by the sugar factory. The mobile application was convenient for plantation practitioners (farmers and plantation assistants) to carry out a fast and precise assessment process. Future works, this application can be added with features that fulfill complete information about sugarcane plantation management. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data can be used to improve the performance and ability of this application.","hangger gahara mawandha faculty of agricultural technology, institut pertanian stiper yogyakarta, indonesia 55282 hangger@instiperjogja.ac.id digdo sudigyo and teddy suparyanto bioinformatics and data science research center, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 digdo.sudigyo@binus.edu, teddysup@binus.ac.id bens pardamean computer science department, binus graduate program – master of computer science, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 bpardamean@binus.edu",
299,Learning Asian Languages Using Online Platforms During  Pandemic Times: Evidence From Indonesian Youth,"asian languages such as mandarin, japanese, and korean have become popular among indonesian youth, as more people are interested in acquiring the foreign languages. however, due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, face-to- face learning approach has been restricted. this leaves a window of opportunity for online platforms to fill the gap by providing the means to learn asian languages for the indonesian young generation who tend to consume pop culture products from china, japan, and korea. this article examines the experience of indonesian youth in learning the mentioned asian languages using online platforms during pandemic times. an online survey conducted in march 2022 with a sample of study consists of 310 research participants aged 16 to 30 years old, and 14 of them agreed to take part in the interview sessions. the findings suggest that the indonesian young population continue to show substantial interest in learning asian languages, especially korean (85%), followed by japanese (68%) and mandarin (51%). around 84% of participants were satisfied using online platforms to learn foreign languages. nevertheless, learning foreign languages online is not always smooth sailing, as internet connection often hinders learners to maximize their excellent experience with the process.","online learning, asian language, pandemic","Our study has demonstrated that the current pandemic does not deter Indonesian youth from continuing learning Asian languages. In fact, the physical distancing policies put in place by the government stimulate people to use online platforms as the approach offers flexibility and access to the learning materials at any time. This paper unpacks the experiences of Indonesian youth in learning Asian languages (Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean) via online platforms during pandemic times using online surveys and interviews. The findings suggest that most respondents in this study are very keen to learn Korean, compared to the other two Asian languages, and their main motivation was to gain new language skills and to prepare for their future career endeavors. About 84% of research participants were satisfied and very satisfied with learning Asian languages using online platforms. Yet, the process of learning foreign languages online is not always smooth sailing, as internet connection often hinders learners to maximize their excellent experience with the process. This paper contributes to the literature on Asian foreign languages and the interest of Indonesian youth in utilizing online platforms to learn them. On another note, technology advancement such as social media is useful in helping creating gender parity and social inclusion (Prihatini 2020). 2870","indira kastaty and ella s. prihatini international relations department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 indira.kastaty@binus.ac.id, ella.prihatini@binus.edu","References

300,Smart Mechanical Ventilation And Artificial Lighting  Implementation In The Restroom For Energy Efficiency,"the window is one of the most important aspects of a building. it aims to obtain good lighting and meet the requirements for indoor air quality. a restroom is a place where most surfaces are wet, and it causes the relative humidity to become high. as a result, lighting must be considered in this space. the men's toilet on the second floor of the bina nusantara university campus in malang is the subject of this research. interviews with building operators, cleaners and firsthand surveys of the location were also undertaken. the author used the results of interviews to help specify the ventilation system. the author utilizes a lux meter to measure the lighting layout. according to the findings, this toilet uses mechanical ventilation in the form of an exhaust fan. on the other hand, this area employs downlights that meet lighting standards in terms of brightness and color temperature selection in the artificial lighting system. in the current situation, there is a shortage of energy efficiency. as a result, this study offers a method for preserving electrical energy. this study uses an arduino mega and several sensors to help automate the operation of these electrical devices.","arduino, energy-saving","On the 2nd floor of the Bina Nusantara Malang campus, the lighting system for men's bathrooms has been installed according to standards. It may be seen from the lux meter measurement, which gives a value of 120-150 lux. This amount is based on the average value of 100-200 lux for public restrooms. Because natural ventilation is not available, this room has adopted mechanical ventilation by installing an exhaust fan type inline direct fan with a size of 450 CMH in the ventilation system. This instrument can assist with the development of good IAQ in the toilet for the long- term health of its users. By placing a PIR sensor at the entrance, this room has automated the lighting for energy savings. Even though there are still faults in the task, the presence of this technology is quite helpful. As a result, an ultrasonic sensor must be added to aid the PIR sensor's performance in controlling the lights, particularly in the cubicle area's automation. This sensor is used to determine how far an object is nearby. This sensor reading uses the toilet seat as a","andi pramono and tiara ika widia primadani interior design department, school of design, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 andi.pramono@binus.ac.id, tiara.primadani@binus.ac.id m. aldiki febriantono computer science department, school of computer science, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 m.aldiki@binus.ac.id","References

302,Indonesian Female Ambassadors And Twiplomacy  Yosi Widuri And Ella S. Prihatini,"countries in the world have been trying to encourage digital diplomacy, using social media such as twitter. the use of twitter as a diplomatic tool is known as twiplomacy. twitter has been widely used by governments in many countries as well as diplomatic officials to gather information and enhance the country's international image. thus, the indonesian government encourages diplomatic officials to actively contribute to the utilization of twitter. our paper focuses on the role of indonesian female ambassadors in utilizing twitter as a diplomatic medium. where, this paper uses a data collection consists of the twitter accounts of indonesian female ambassadors as of 12 february 2021, using descriptive analysis of the extent to which indonesian female ambassadors can actively contribute to the use of twitter. our data shows that, although indonesian female ambassadors have not yet fully used twitter, some of them have begun to realize the importance of optimizing twiplomacy. for the level of engagement, we found that there were differences and similarities for each ambassador's account, where the difference was seen in the contrast of engagement as measured by the number of tweets and retweets, while there were similarities in the use of the same words related to hashtags. we also found that some of the new ambassadors' accounts on twitter had more followers and some of them had quite a contrasting number of followers.","twitter, digital diplomacy, ambassadors","Technological developments have affected aspects of people's lives, so that governments in various countries are trying to promote technology in various fields, one of which is in the field of diplomacy. Modern diplomacy practices have brought opportunities for ambassadors, especially female ambassadors to be able to take advantage of digital technology, such as social media as a diplomatic tool. In this case, Indonesian female ambassadors can play their role by utilizing social media such as Twitter as a complementary tool for diplomacy to represent Indonesia abroad as well as being able to gather information and interact with public audiences, considering that Indonesia is a country with the fifth rank as the most Twitter users in the world. In this study, we found that almost 60 percent of Indonesian female ambassadors have a Twitter account, and they serve in European and American countries. 2896","international relations department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 yosi.widuri@binus.ac.id, ella.prihatini@binus.edu","References

303,Social Construct Of Online Gender-Based Violence In  Mainstream And Special Media In The Era Of The Covid-19,"online gender-based violence is still in the spotlight in gender research and feminism in indonesia. the reason is that reporting on this issue has not received more attention in the media. in addition, victims of cases of gender-based violence, including on online platforms, are often cornered in media coverage by the framing that is built. for this reason, this study wants to uncover how the social constructs carried out by mainstream mass media and special media about women write about this issue and how these two different media segments frame online gender-based violence in their news content. the mass media selected in this study are kompas.com and konde.co. the theories used in this research are postmodern feminism and social construction by berger and luckmann. the method used is robert n. entman framing analysis. the results show that kompas.com is structured in building its narrative on the issue of violence against women, including online gender-based violence. meanwhile, konde.co is a more specific medium in building the narrative using the storytelling method.","social construction, framing, 2014) until now","Kompas.com and Konde.co as actors who spread messages in masse are seen as trying to oppose discrimination against women. Whereas in two media, there are also women as part of the organizational structure who want to fight for gender equality and the protection of their people. It is in line with (Lykke, 2016) research where women refuse to be victimized themselves. Even though Kompas.com is independent media, regardless of the patriarchal culture, in this case, it can be seen in the analysis in the first article entitled ""Cases of Violence against Women via the Internet Increase 3 Times During the Pandemic"" still cornering the position of women who seem to be an uneducated group. There are still dictions from the article that was in favor of women. Meanwhile, in Konde.co, as a special media for women, the ideology of postmodern feminism is very visible from the freedom of writing. Shamelessly, straightforwardly and write down the problems that are built. In more detail, Konde.co is not shy about pointing out who is to blame in an issue related to women. This research shows that the two media, both Kompas.com and Konde.co, have taken sides with women and children who are often victims of online gender-based violence. The narrative that is built, it shows that the level of this violent crime has claimed many victims. Although the number of violence during the Covid-19 period has decreased, it is not shown progress because many partners of institutions from The National Commission on Violence Against Women do not report the number of cases they received (Komnas Perempuan, 2020). We are aware that this research still needs further development and observation, so it is hoped that further research will look at other mainstream media and specifically in reporting on online gender-based violence, especially the media with the highest viewers.

305,Toward Optimum Transformer Model For Sequence-Tosequence Data Transformation Under Low-Resource,"accurate language translator applications running on low-resource computing devices such as smartphone is very instrumental to support tourism industry. the main challenge to achieve such objective is how to optimize performance of machine translation model targeted to limited resource of computing devices. vanilla transformer model has been well known as one of state-of-the- art neural machine translation model. however, the drawback of this model is its large number of parameter models which might not be suitable for low-resource computing devices. this paper presents study findings in efforts to optimize 2 encoder-decoder stack depth of vanilla transformer by exploring several activation functions using fine-tuning approach. the pre-trained transformer model is fine-tuned using parallel corpus bahasa indonesia-sundanese language to address machine translation task. the experiment results found that sigmoid gives the highest model performance (0.993 average training accuracy and 0.987 average testing similarity) and gelu gives the lowest model performance (0.987 average training accuracy and 0.980 average testing similarity) of the tested vanilla transformer models.",transformer model,"The experiment results found that Sigmoid activation function used in the feed-forward layers gives the highest vanilla transformer model performance (0.993 average training accuracy and 0.987 average testing similarity) and GeLU gives the lowest model performance (0.987 average training accuracy and 0.980 average testing similarity) of the tested vanilla transformer models. This experiment findings validate the choice of Vashmani et al., (Vaswani et al., 2017) to use Sigmoid for feed-forward layers as the best activation functions among the tested activation functions. However, this experiment findings disagree with previous study reported by (Glorot et al., 2011) which concludes that ReLU achieves better performance than Sigmoid and Tanh activation function. This analysis results can be used further as a basis for future works in developing a variant of transformer model which is suitable for low-resource computing environment.

308,Factors That Drive The Adoption Of Telemedicine In Older  People,"due to the geographical characteristics of chile, which make it difficult for people to access health services, in addition to the consequences of the global pandemic covid-19, telemedicine has emerged as a solution to the gaps in access to medical services. this technology requires specific knowledge and skills for using the platforms, which can bring problems for older people. this study seeks to explain the factors that can drive the adoption of telemedicine in the chilean context, looking to establish a model for the adoption of telemedicine in older people. this proposal is developed with a combination of pls-sem and fsqca to test the relevance of the proposed determinants in adopting this technology and to analyse whether these factors are necessary or sufficient for this behaviour to occur. after the analysis, it was possible to observe through pls-sem analysis that effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, and price affect the intention to use telemedicine. on the other hand, the fsqca analysis highlighted the importance of performance expectancy when adopting telemedicine, with its presence being a necessary condition. subsequently, the sufficiency analysis supports what was found in the necessary condition analysis. with these results, the study seeks to contribute to the literature on the relationship between the elderly and information technologies through these methodologies and empirical conclusions.","telemedicine, utaut, pls-sem, qca","The objective of the present study was to explain the adoption of telemedicine services in older people in Chile through a model of acceptance of information technologies, combining methodologies that have not been used in the research of this thematic area. Through the proposed model and thanks to PLS-SEM, it was determined that the factors that may affect older people to create the behaviour of Intention to Use telemedicine are Effort Expectancy when using telemedicine, Performance Expectancy, Social Influence, and the subjective value of the price of the service of these platforms. On the other hand, according to the analysis of necessary conditions through fsQCA, the importance of Performance Expectancy at the time of adopting telemedicine is highlighted; this means that according to the reality of the sample, we must ensure that the person has the belief that using telemedicine will improve their quality of life in general, resulting in the Intention to Use these platforms in most cases. Finally, according to the results of the sufficient conditions, no exogenous variable is enough by themselves to create the intention of use in older people. Still, all are sufficient in some solutions to reach this result, except for the Effort Expectancy. One of the contributions of this study is methodological; the fact of being able to investigate older people and telemedicine using a combination of methodologies that can be considered relatively new in the literature of this age group and its interaction with new information technologies can motivate researchers to do more studies of this type in the future. The present investigation delivers an example of the combination of methodologies for its possible replicability. This research provides an example of applying the combination of PLS-SEM and fsQCA, in which the importance of Effort Expectancy, Performance Expectancy, Social Influence and Price in the Intention to Use Telemedicine in older people is highlighted in general.","valentina mancilla fernández faculty of economy and management universidad católica del norte antofagasta, chile valentina.mancilla@ce.ucn.cl patricio ramírez-correa director of the school of engineering universidad católica del norte coquimbo, chile patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl francisco javier rondán-cataluña professor of marketing business administration and marketing department universidad de sevilla seville, spain rondan@us.es",
309,Analysis Of Determining The Optimal Route For 3 Kg Lpg  Gas Distribution Using The Saving Matrix And Nearest,"pt. rariza putra is a company engaged in the distribution of liquefied petroleum gas (lpg) 3 kg. the distribution route starts from the oil fuel filling station (spbe) to each customer venue. in the distribution method, the company determines the route only by decisions made by the driver, because the company does not have a fixed distribution route. it means that the resulting route is not an optimal route. with the existing problems, the company needs a problem-solving method that would provide a solution to calculate the shorter route to reduce transportation and fuel costs. this research was conducted on the vehicle routing problem (vrp) with the capacitated vehicle routing problem (cvrp) approach, which determines the route by taking into account the capacity of the vehicle, and also vehicle routing problem with multiple trips (vrpmt), which determines the route for each vehicle to make more than one delivery, and vehicle routing problem with split delivery (vrpsd), where each base can be visited more than once. the method used in solving this problem is the saving matrix and also the nearest neighbor methods. these two methods will be compared to the initial route that exists in the company, and the method that gives the optimal results will be chosen. based on the processing that has been carried out with the both methods, the nearest neighbor method is chosen which gives more optimal results in determining the route and also affects the fuel costs incurred. the route generated by the nearest neighbor method in one week is 283,37 km with a comparison of the initial route length of 391,17 km. while the total fuel cost savings that occur every week on the nearest neighbor method is rp. 208.475 with a cost comparison on the initial route of rp. 289.773 with a difference of rp. 81.298. the new distribution route provides 28% savings compared to the initial route in the company.","route optimization, vrp, saving matrix","From the results of the discussion of determining the optimal route of distribution of 3 kg LPG gas at PT. Rariza Putra by comparing the initial route, the saving matrix method and the nearest neighbor obtained route and cost savings, namely the initial route obtained a total distance of 391.17 km and a total fuel cost of Rp.289,773, In the saving matrix method obtained a total distance of 349, 92 km and a total fuel cost of Rp257,439 and the nearest neighbor method obtained a total distance of 283.37 km and a total fuel cost of Rp208,475. From these results, it is known that the saving matrix and nearest neighbor methods are able to provide savings in vehicle mileage and distribution fuel costs. However, from the two methods, the nearest neighbor method gives higher savings than the saving matrix method. From the results obtained from the nearest neighbor method has savings percentage of 28% compared to the initial company route and it can be concluded that the nearest neighbor method generates more optimal route.","neighbor methods (case study at pt. rariza putra) khusna dwijayanti 1, nandha syafira rosyadziba 2 12 department of industrial engineering faculty of science and technology state islamic university of sunan kalijaga yogyakarta, indonesia. jl. marsda adisucipto 1 yogyakarta indonesia khusna.dwijayanti@gmail.com",

315,Towards Integration Of Truck Appointment System And  Direction For Future Research,"congestion in the container terminal stems from many external trucks queuing up to pick up or deliver containers. the congestion makes increasing of truck turnaround time which is a vital key performance indicator for both container terminal and trucking companies. based on the results of the analysis obtained two alternative solutions; speed up container service time and control the arrival time of external trucks. controlling the arrival time of external trucks can be done by implementing a truck appointment system. this paper categorized studies on truck appointment systems based on the methods including the determination of reservation quotas, scheduling and optimization of truck arrivals, minimization of empty truck trips, and others. the study of truck appointment systems can also be grouped based on the methodologies used, including queuing theory, mathematical models, simulations, and a combination of the two methodologies. in this paper, the research of integration and collaboration in a container terminal is also reviewed. in research on integrated scheduling in container terminals, most studies integrate scheduling in the seaside and yard area. research that integrates scheduling starting from a seaside, yard area, and landside especially external truck operations is limited. in future research, the integrated scheduling that combines seaside and landside operations that emphasize the performance indicator of truck turnaround time and vessel berthing time is promising. the methodology to handle various stakeholder interests is agent-based. besides, real-time scheduling is appropriate for the development of new smart port technology.","container terminal, congestion in port",,"veterina nosadila riaventin, rully tri cahyono suprayogi, senator nur bahagia faculty of industrial technology institut teknologi bandung jalan ganesa 10, bandung 40132, indonesia veterina@itb.ac.id, rully@ti.itb.ac.id, yogi@mail.ti.itb.ac.id, senator@mail.ti.itb.ac.id","References

We can see how RED II is having a growing impact not only on the internal conditions of EU societies, particularly the domestic biofuels industry, but also in Indonesia, where it is raising environmental awareness among Indonesian government, leading to changes in palm oil sector policy and reducing deforestation in palm oil concessions. The authors recommend that, in the future, the governments of all developing countries should be more aware of the standards enacted by prospect markets, particularly if they are developed countries. Vice versa, developed countries that have partnerships with developing countries, particularly in terms of resources, must be aware of and adapt their policies to their partner countries' capabilities. Other than that, both developed and developing countries must be more conscious and adapt their policies quickly to the dynamic environmental issues.","albert antolis and arthanami ekakrisima pandjaitan international relations department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 albert.antolis@binus.ac.id, arthanami.ekakrisima@binus.ac.id",

320,Developing Pion Hydro Farm: A Hydroponic Garden And  Minimarket Start-Up,"as a form of efficiency from traditional farming systems, hydroponics is an urban farming system that does not use soil media. the current conditions in indonesia and the narrowing of the malang city area necessitate using hydroponics as a solution. pion hydro farm as a start-up assists urban farms in meeting food needs and becoming a destination for young farmers. the method employed in this paper is an experimental study carried out in the malang district of east java, indonesia. there are four stages in making this start-up business, starting from using simple materials such as waste oil gallons and palm oil, purchasing four wick hydroponic systems growing media, purchasing hydroponic production equipment in a 36-hole hydroponic starter kit, and purchasing a hydroponic ""a"" style with 180 planting holes. the investigation was furthered by creating a minimarket design that aims to accommodate pion hydro farm production. it seeks to create a good farming system integration and make reaching the intended market easier. it aims to improve farming system integration and make it easier for pion hydro farm to reach its target market. pion hydro farm promotes itself as a viable solution for addressing people's daily vegetable needs and a leader in catering to the younger generation.","agriculture, hydroponics, interior design","Long-term food supply completion is hampered by the crisis of a low number of Indonesian farmers. The current situation necessitates a transition away from conventional agriculture to meet the need for sustainable agricultural goods, particularly vegetables. People are still addicted to eating conventional vegetables and will require education to modify their habits. The critical challenge necessitates the younger generation's engagement to meet the farming interest. The author became a hydroponic farmer to solve a broad and narrow problem as an example of the first phase. As a transitional option from conventional farming, hydroponics provides an effective growing medium as an urban farming method. The hydroponics concept serves as the essential foundation for presenting Pion Hydro Farm. It begins with a modest implementation stage and progresses to the planning step of building a minimarket store. It seeks to create a good farming system integration and make it easier for us to reach the intended market. Pion Hydro farm advertises itself as a viable solution for meeting people's daily vegetable needs and a forerunner in catering to the younger generation. This study still uses the manual irrigation system. As a result, it requires an operator responsible for this hydroponic irrigation system. The following research can utilize technology in hydroponic irrigation systems using IoT. Watering can be done automatically by using a sensor to read the power of hydrogen (pH) of the growing media. Moreover, there are still imperfections in the minimarket design. Therefore, the following research can improve a more sustainable design by prioritizing green materials.","amanda beatrice, michael hermawan yuwono, and victor runtuwene entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 amanda.beatrice@binus.ac.id, michael.yuwono@binus.ac.id, victor.runtuwene@binus.ac.id andi pramono and ida bagus ananta wijaya interior design department, school of design, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 andi.pramono@binus.ac.id, ida.wijaya@binus.edu",
321,Informality And Technical Efficiency In Morocco: Lessons From  Stochastic Frontier Analysis,"this paper aims to study the behaviour of formality of 390 microenterprises (me) and its impact, based on data from a survey that was conducted in the city of casablanca. we explain, on one hand, the choice of the level of formality using an ordered probit model. on the other hand, we analyse the effect of registration and other factors on productivity, using the stochastic frontier approach which considers the risk of self-selection. the results from the first model emphasize the effect of the entrepreneur's demographic and socio-economic characteristics as well as those related to the me and its environment. the stochastic frontier approach allowed us to verify the existence of a differentiated efficiency bared on the level of formality. it also appears that the education level of the owner, gender and age of the employees, the main reason for business creation and its size, impact productivity.","formality, informal sector, productivity, microenterprises","of Becker (1985) and Petersen & al (2006). When the share of young people (under 31 years of age) increases, efficiency decreases. The experience of the staff allows us to refine specialization and therefore contributes to improving productivity. This result is shared by Taymaz (2009). A high level of education will increase efficiency. Education is seen as a factor in developing and refining the entrepreneur's management skills (Taymaz, 2009; De Vries, 2010). To analyse the effect of motivation on entrepreneurs' efficiency behaviour, we included the reasons for the creation of the ME in the estimates. The latter show that, compared to entrepreneurs seeking independence, those who did not find a job before the creation of their firm are the most productive. This result is explained by the fear of failure among these individuals if they are unable to succeed in their project. Launching a project for reasons of profitability is a variable that acts positively and significantly increases the efficiency of the UP, all other things being equal. The seniority of the ME does not seem significant in the efficiency model. The ambiguity of the variable is attributed to two neutralizing effects. In one category of enterprises, seniority is reflected in archaic techniques and management methods. While in another, a firm that has been in existence for some time, could be more efficient thanks to learning- by-doing. The increase in the number of workers leads to an increase in productivity (Chapelle and Plane,2005). Contrary to the conclusion of Doms et al (2004), the use of a computer connected to the Internet has no effect on productivity improvement. In Morocco, the use of computer equipment in the firm's activity such as stock management or advertising is still very limited. The estimate (2, Table 3) shows that the granting of bonuses has no impact on productivity growth. 6. Conclusion and limitations of the study In developing countries, the informal sector plays an important role in creating value added. Several studies have shown that informal activities are often characterized by low productivity, which could have negative effects on total factor productivity. Public policies that target the formalization of the informal sector should consider both the factors that encourage activity registration and those that impact productivity. Using data on a sample of 390 Microenterprises (ME) from the city of Casablanca, this paper suggests an answer to two questions. The first analyses the determinants of ME choice to declare their activities, using an ordered Probit model. The second question verifies the existence of differences in productivities between informal, semi-formal and formal units, as well as to study their causes using the stochastic frontier approach12. The risk of ME’s self- selection was addressed through an instrumental variable indicating the share of informal inputs in the total inputs of the ME. This choice is motivated by the suggestion of De Vries (2010). The results from the first model focus on the effect of demographics and socio-economic characteristics of the entrepreneur on one hand, as well as the impact of the characteristics of the ME and their environment on the other hand. The stochastic frontier approach concluded that the elasticity of productivity over hours worked is greater than the one for capital. We also noted the existence of decreasing returns to scale which implies the absence of economies of scale. The hypothesis of the productivity gap between the formal, semi-formal and informal units has been verified. It also appears that the level of education of the owner and the characteristics of the staff, in terms of gender and professional experience, have a significant impact on productivity. The sample data shows that even within units with less than ten workers, we can observe heterogeneity of efficiency due to the variation in the size of the ME. The improvement of productivity after formalization of companies is often due to better integration in the financial 12 We consider an ME is informal if it is not declared to the authorities, semi-formal if it has completed only a part of the procedures and formal if it has completed all the registration formalities. 3091","mounir el kadiri phd student, faculty of economics and management ibn tofaïl university kenitra, morocco elkadiri.mounir@gmail.com mounia cherkaoui professor, faculty of economics and management ibn tofaïl university kenitra, morocco cherkaouimounia@yahoo.fr","References

322,The Effect Of Indonesian Government’S Communication  Strategy During The Implementation Of Emergency Public,"the surge of covid-19 in the middle of 2021 in indonesia, made the indonesian government decided to implement the emergency public activity restriction (ppkm darurat). this study aims to understand the impact of the indonesian government’s communication strategy during the implementation of emergency public activity restriction (ppkm darurat) on the compliance of the east java people towards health protocols. by using the assumption of the governmental communication theory (with behavior change communication approach),, this study focused on the impact of communication in the aspect of cognitive, affective, and behavior of the people of east java. done with a quantitative method with a case study of the people of surabaya and malang city, the result of this study shown that there is a significant impact on the compliance of the east java people towards health protocols caused by the indonesian government’s communication strategy during the emergency public activity restriction (ppkm darurat). according to the survey results, the communication strategy implemented by the indonesian government is impactful to influence the behavior of the people to comply the health protocols in attempt to control the covid-19 pandemic situation.","government, communication, east java","Based on the results of the survey distributed to respondents, with the average level of respondent agreement on the performance indicators of the directive pattern reaching 71.6%, this pattern is said to be the most influential pattern, which is then followed by the non-directive pattern at level 65. %, and the last is the pattern of public communication at the level of 64.9%. Meanwhile, the cognitive aspect is the aspect that is most influenced by the Indonesian Government's communication strategy during the Emergency PPKM period with the average respondent's approval of the indicator being at the level of 83.6%, then followed by the behavioural aspect at the level of 80.55%, and the last is the affective aspect at the level of 73.9%. These results are in line with the assumption of stubborn audience theory which states that each individual will filter, select, and internally process all messages he receives, where despite the respondent's understanding and knowledge of what Emergency PPKM is, what rules are applied, and the reasons why Emergency PPKM is implemented, it does not necessarily affect the respondent's behaviour to carry out or implement things that they understand and know. Based on the tests that have been carried out previously, the effect of the independent or independent variable (the Indonesian Government's communication strategy during the Emergency PPKM period) on the dependent variable (East Java population compliance with health protocols) is 50.8%, meanwhile, the rest is influenced by other variables not discussed in the study. The Government of Indonesia needs to increase the efforts of the communication strategy with a non-directive pattern, by increasing dialogue or interaction with the community because based on the results of a survey of respondents, only 50.8% of respondents felt that the Government of Indonesia responded to the aspirations of the community related to PPKM Emergency and COVID -19 well. In addition, the Government also needs to further enhance the efforts of public communication patterns by better communicating the rules and policies established during the Emergency PPKM period and their implementation or implementation which must be carried out better as well. Future studies can examine the effect of the Indonesian Government's communication strategy during the Emergency PPKM period on the compliance of residents of other provinces in complying with health protocols and other factors that affect the compliance of the population of East Java province or other provinces in complying with health protocols.","activity restriction on the compliance health protocols in east java adinda widya pasugitaningtiyas and frederik masri gasa communication science department, faculty of digital communication and hotel & tourism, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 adinda.pasugitaningtiyas@binus.ac.id, frederik.gasa@binus.edu",

324,A Comparison Of Ant Colony Optimization And Depth First  Search For Solving Unmanned Aerial Vehicle – Ground,"time is of the essence in disaster relief operation. the casualties might be huge if disaster relief operation can’t be done quickly. the broken infrastructure and post-disaster environment make it difficult to search for survivors. to solve this, unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) is deployed since uav can survey the location easily from the air. one downside of uav is its limited energy capacity. uav needs to be deployed with a ground vehicle (gv) who charges or swaps uav battery during the operation. as such, the coordination between uav and gv becomes an important part in the operation. this research focuses on constructing a route for the uav – gv to find survivors using ant colony optimization (aco). the studied case is the 2010 merapi eruption, which is one of the volcano eruptions in indonesia. the result of this research will be compared with the result from previous research that used depth-first search (dfs). the route from aco needs 90.48 minutes to complete whereas the route from previous research needs 95.48 minutes, implying that the route evaluated using aco results in 5 minutes faster than that constructed using dfs.","routing problem, depth first search","This research has succeeded in making models and programs for determining UAV routes and coordinating between UAVs and GVs using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The type of ACO used is the Ant Colony System which is a development of the Ant System that aims to solve Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This study succeeded in finding the optimal route in the 2010 Merapi Case. This case consisted of 13 nodes target nodes optionalThe routes that have been generated are as follows: SMP Watuadeg – Balai Desa Wukirsari (P) – Bakalan – Ngepringan – Manggang – Kopeng – Petung (P) – Jambu (P) – Kaliadem – Srunen – Kalitengah Kidul – Kalitengah Lor – Kalitengah Kidul (P) – Srunen (P) – Kaliadem (P) – Palemsari (P) – Pangukrejo (P) – Barak Plosokerep (R) – Pangukrejo – Palemsari – Jambu – Petung – Batur – Barak Plosokerep (P) – Balai Desa Hargobinangum. These results indicate that all targets have been visited and from log the duration of the UAV has not exceeded the time limit. GV only visited the Plosokerep Barracks to recharge the UAV's energy. The duration of the route generated by 90.48 minutes; this route is 5 minutes faster than the route generated by the Depth-First Search by Larasati research (2019). This difference is mostly caused by the DFS method which cannot find from one node to shortcuts another, so it takes longer.","vehicle routing problem in humanitarian logistics alfredo aryasena department of mechanical and industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta, indonesia alfredoaryasena469947@mail.ugm.ac.id bertha maya sopha department of mechanical and industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta, indonesia bertha_sopha@ugm.ac.id",
325,Wind Energy Application  Ipfi Nemudzivhadi,"kinetic energy is the energy of motion; accelerating an object from all positions to a specific velocity takes energy, and the object maintains the energy if the speed remains constant (the global wind council, 2016). when the object decelerates, that energy from its motion can be moved in different ways; this energy is another form of generating electricity. the wind is a perfect, free, and promptly accessible renewable energy source. every day, around the globe, wind turbines are catching the wind's capacity and changing over it to electricity. this source of intensity assumes an undeniably significant part in the manner in which we control our world. a wind turbine is a gadget that converts kinetic energy from the wind into electricity and the sharp edges of a wind turbine turn somewhere in the range of 13 and 20 cycles for every minute, contingent upon their innovation, at a consistent or variable velocity, where the velocity of the rotor fluctuates in connection to the velocity of the wind to achieve a greater efficiency (chang et al, 2022). the article plans to analyze the significance of one renewable source of energy, which is wind energy. investigation regarding what wind energy is about, how wind is generated, how it functions and what are the capacities incorporated into it will be outlined into detail. this will give a superior comprehension into the use of wind and how might it be utilized as a source of energy. as a result, this renewable energy contains advantages as well as disadvantages that might need to be evaluated by the implementer beforehand.","renewable energy, wind turbine, wind energy, electricity 3128",,"lecturer, school of mechanical engineering faculty of engineering and built environment university of johannesburg doornfontein campus, johannesburg, south africa ipfi.siaga@gmail.com; inemudzivhadi@uj.ac.za",

This indicates only hypotheses 7a are supported, meaning age has a significant role in PV affecting RI. Meanwhile, t-value for each variable with gender as moderating effect shows no significant difference at all. Therefore, hypotheses 1a, 6a, 7a, and 8a are not supported. This study found that gender does not have a significant role in PE, PR, PV, and H affecting RI. 5.4 Proposed Improvements The model used in this research was adapted from previous UTAUT2 model by Venkatesh et al. (2012). Results from this study were able to explain factors influencing the technology acceptance which includes performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, price value, habit, and perceived risk and their effects on reuse intention and reuse behavior. This study also analyzes age and gender as moderating effects between the factors and users’ intention to reuse. However, this study has several limitations. Samples from this study are aged ranging from 18-31. This is due to questionnaire distribution among people of mentioned age range. However, current author does not have the overall app user data which does not rule out the possibility of users above mentioned age range. Thus, further study is advised to have larger age range that includes all age of app user. 3136","master of management study program faculty of economy and business telkom university bandung, indonesia azizahf@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id maya ariyanti lecturer at master of management faculty of economy and business telkom university bandung, indonesia ariyanti@telkomuniversity.ac.id heppy millanyani lecturer at master of management faculty of economy and business telkom university bandung, indonesia heppymill@telkomuniversity.ac.id","References

From five hypotheses, four hypotheses accepted are that eWOM has a significant effect on PI; eWOM has a significant effect on BI; eWOM has a significant effect on CA; and CA has a significant effect on PI. In general, eWOM has a significant effect on PI because respondents see that video content significantly affects their lifestyle. Respondents also follow and have the same opinion regarding the information obtained from the video content. eWOM also affects BI because the average respondent collects information from video content to find out about the views, characteristics, and quality differentiation of F&B products from other users. eWOM affects CA by increasing the activity and quality of video content on the social media platform TikTok. The increase aims to create customer desire, which will decide to buy a product. However, in contrast to the hypothesis in this study, it shows an insignificant effect of BI on PI. The main reasons are based on assumptions, namely the limited number of samples, differences in respondent characteristics, and differences in the scope of the research industry. In addition, other factors that are more relevant need to be explored further. For future researchers, we suggest collecting more respondents for an accurate result. We also suggest adding more variables related to the topic and/or conducting the research in a different industry.","tangerang jessica widjaya business management program, management department, binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 jessica.widjaya@binus.ac.id bella putri lewa business management program, management department, binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 bella.lewa@binus.ac.id ario s. setiadi business management program, management department, binus business school master program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, 11480 ario.setiadi@binus.ac.id",

As discussed, potential delay factors of projects, and their related tools and techniques have been vastly investigated in previous literature on construction industry. However, it was necessary to focus on different delay factors of industrial projects as they are less examined in recent literature. Additionally, the problem is not properly and adequately linked with recent MCDM techniques such as BWM. Therefore, with regard to these motivations, this research was completed in two linked phases as follows. The first phase of this study investigated numerous delay factors of industrial projects. To do so, a literature survey was completed to develop different delay factors of industrial projects. Following, a BWM was applied to investigate and prioritize different delay factors of industrial projects. The obtained results showed that contractors, consultants, climate, customers, shortages of raw materials, financial issues and poor manpower are the most important delay factors of industrial projects, respectively.

329,The Analysis Of Programming Problem Solving Skill Of The  Students In Software Engineering Vocational High Schools,"programming problem solving ability is one of the basic skills of software engineering vocational high school students. as a prospective programmer or software developer, vocational high school students must be able to understand problems, make plans and implement them in computer programs. however, research that tries to explore the level of problem solving ability in programming, especially for vocational high school students is still few or even non-existent. the purposes of this research are 1) to know how good problem-solving skill of vocational high school students, 2) to explore problems of programming teaching and learning especially in the pandemic era, 3) to analyze which problems influenced student’s programming problem solving skill according to relevant theory. this research is a mix method research with sequential explanatory model. the result of the study showed that programming problem solving ability is low. from 83 respondents, the average problem-solving score was 33.37 out of 100. based on the data from questionnaires interviews and learning documents we identify some problems occurred in programming class. by analyzing them with relevant theories, we found several problems in programming class which indicated influencing programming problem solving skill. those are: lack of motivation and self-confidence, lack of 3158",,"The result of the study showed that programming problem solving ability is low. From 83 respondents, the average problem-solving score was 33.37 out of 100. Based on the data from questionnaires interviews and learning documents we identify some problems occurred in programming class, which are: lack of appropriate learning resources, low student motivation and self-confidence, lack of facilities, especially laptops or computers to practice programming at home, ack of feedback and direction for students who has difficulty in learning, lack of students' understanding of the problem solving steps in programming, where some students directly type program code without make any plan, lack of learning experience in solving problems using programming, and the wrong perception of problem-based learning of the teacher. By analyzing them with relevant theories, we found several problems in programming class which indicated influencing programming problem solving skill, which are: lack of motivation and self-confidence, lack of learning resources, low ICT literation, programming learning which is still based on syntax only, and the lack of variety of problems to be solve in learning programming. The solution that can be offered to overcome this problem is to apply appropriate learning models such as problem-based learning. Programming learning is not only based on syntax but also provides a lot of experience for students to apply it to various problems. However, learning must also be interesting and fun so that students are motivated and engaged during learning. Further research as an effort to improve problem solving skills in programming is very much needed using appropriate learning strategies.","dwi maryono assistant professor of informatics education faculty of teacher training and education sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia dwimaryono@staff.uns.ac.id budiyono professor in mathematics education faculty of teacher training and education sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia budiyono@staff.uns.ac.id sajidan professor in biology education faculty of teacher training and education sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia adjid@fkip.uns.ac.id muhammad akhyar professor in mechanical engineering education faculty of teacher training and education sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia makhaliya@yahoo.com",

335,2022  Ahp And Promethee Comparison On Decision Support System For Scholarship,"youth awareness regarding the importance of continuing their education in higher institutions is very low. it has been discovered that the biggest factor responsible for this is very expensive price of higher institutions. to overcome this problem, universitas sebelas maret (uns) offers scholarships to individuals who meet the criteria. currently, the implementation of scholarship selection in uns is still performed manually and this often leads to a long selection procedure and has been considered inaccurate. therefore, a decision support system (dss) is needed to aid the scholarship selection process. the system can compute the criteria score and generate a ranking based on the criteria weight. the results showed that using the ahp algorithm on dss at school in east java yielded an accuracy score of 90%, while the promethee utilization on a system of determining the food aid recipients showed 85% accuracy. this study aims to determine the difference between the accuracies of ahp and promethe in the development of the scholarship system (sibea) at uns. this study showed the sibea prototype and the analysis of the comparison algorithm as well as the one that is better to use at uns.","ahp, algorithm, promethee","The accuracy calculation of the AHP and PROMETHEE algorithms in the SIBEA application has been conducted using a confusion matrix. It involves representing the actual scholarship recipient data with True and False as well as the scholarship recipients’ predicted data as Positive and Negative. This helps in performing the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, and F-score calculations. The comparison results of the algorithm with the confusion matrix in this aspect are based on 2 things, namely the number of adjacent FP and FN to obtain the best algorithm from the highest Accuracy value. In this case, the AHP with 93.33% accuracy was better than PROMETHEE which obtained 33.33%. Second, it was determined from the highest precision value because TP was more desirable than TN. The result showed that the AHP algorithm was better as it has a precision value of 95% compared to the PROMETHEE with 50%. Therefore, in the case of receiving a scholarship at Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, the use of the AHP is better than the PROMETHEE algorithm.","selection in universitas sebelas maret surakarta faiz ahnaf eka putra, yusfia hafid aristyagama, nurcahya pradana taufik prakisya and cucuk wawan budiyanto bachelor of informatics education faculty of teacher training and education universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia ahnaf19@student.uns.ac.id, yusfia.hafid@staff.uns.ac.id, nurcahya.ptp@staff.uns.ac.id, cbudiyanto@staff.uns.ac.id",
336,Organizational Culture Through Technology Resources As  Antecedents And Its Impact On Export Performance Of The,"the study of furniture exports in central java is a particular concern, especially during the pandemic. the furniture industry in central java experienced a slump at the beginning due to strict pandemic regulations. in the second quarter of 2021, the furniture industry received new opportunities for imports and exports with increasing demand. however, at the end of the third quarter of 2022, another challenge emerged with the soaring logistics costs of sending export products to destination countries, resulting in increased export operations. adjusting the selling price of the product is necessary but becomes counter-productive because it has implications for the price that becomes uncompetitive. thus, this study builds a supply chain management model for increasing export performance. this study offers organizational culture to encourage the role of technology resources in supply chain management, a gap problem still inconclusive. the sample of this study was 182 msmes exporting furniture in central java. the analytical instrument is structural equation modelling with the results of technology resources not significantly affecting supply chain management. the use of organizational culture (β = 0.265) to mediate technology resources to export performance is more significant than knowledge sharing (β = 0.071), and supply chain management significantly affects export performance by 0.738. so empirically, it is proven that organizational culture has a role in fully mediating the influence of technology resources on supply chain management and its impact on export performance.","export performance, furniture industry, knowledge sharing","Knowledge creation theory can describe an organizational and leadership process that represents knowledge creation in an organizational environment, regardless of the organization’s type, size, or location. Organizational culture has encouraged the awakening of knowledge from the concept of knowledge creation theory. In the perspective of knowledge creation theory, the need for knowledge is an essential material in organizations that are attached to work culture, especially in supporting them to build innovations in the production process in the furniture industry as part of the manufacturing process. Knowledge creation theory will bind to the need for technological support as a knowledge infrastructure. While organizational culture will facilitate resources such as technology, it takes a more critical role in building its influence on the existence of supply chain management. Furthermore, the knowledge built will encourage the resolution of many problems in the industry, such as organizing strategies for building supply chain management support. The limitation of the study is the unevenness of the data collection. Furniture export MSMEs who were respondents in this study were mainly in Jepara City. Nevertheless, the city of Jepara is a national furniture center, so it still represents the population. Refers to the importance of resource capabilities that drive export performance facilitated through the role of work culture. The upcoming research agenda is recommended to build supply chain management mediated by organizational culture with antecedents in the form of information technology capability and organizational structure.","furniture industry iwan hermawan, inayah lecturer, department of business administration politeknik negeri semarang semarang, indonesia iwanpolines@gmail.com, umi.inayahoke@gmail.com gita hindrawati student, school of business management institut teknologi bandung bandung, indonesia gita_hindrawati@sbm-itb.ac.id sam’ani lecturer, department of accounting politeknik negeri semarang semarang, indonesia samani.muhtarom@gmail.com ardianita nur indah sari student, department of business administration politeknik negeri semarang semarang, indonesia ardianitanis18@gmail.com",
337,"The Role Of Entrepreneurial Orientation, Organizational  Culture, And Technology Resources In Encouraging Supply","the concept of supply chain management (scm) is an alternative in facing recent business competition. the competition in question leads to the magnitude of price sell products affected by scm. able entrepreneurs build scm and could minimize supply chain costs then will have superiority compete. in creating a supply chain, a capable entrepreneur must dig information about the market to get an outlook on opportunities, trends, knowledge, and new information to increase his abilities. the phenomenon that becomes an opportunity in scm is the development of company service logistics to support supply chain processes. direction studies uncover the influence of entrepreneurial orientation (eo), organizational culture (oc), and technology resources (tr) on scm. respondent studies 162 umkm furniture in central java using the purposive sampling technique. data collection uses the nonself-assessment method through a questionnaire distribution. the effect of eo on scm has a significant value (β=0.006, p<0.05). on the other hand, oc significantly impacts scm (β=0.000, p<0.001). tr does not directly affect scm (β=0.960, p>0.05). the perspective of this study is supply chain management theory which has been empirically proven that eo, oc, and tr simultaneously have a significant positive effect on scm.",furniture industry,"This study found that SCM at this time, EO, and OC have a significant influence on supporting SCM in entrepreneurship. EO can obtain information for strategic planning, such as supplier options and excellent logistics services to support SCM. Then OC creates competent entrepreneurs and employees to establish good relations with other parties who drive SCM. While this study empirically proves that TR has no significant effect on SCM. It is because TR requires a relatively substantial investment of financial resources. Concerning the current SCM, the phenomenon of logistics services growth will facilitate the supply chain process. The number of available logistics services gives entrepreneurs opportunities to achieve SCM more optimally. Enclosed, entrepreneurs in carrying out business processes can reduce the cost of materials delivery and product shipping. It impacts the acquisition of a lower-cost production to create a competitive product selling price that can be superior. Theoretically, this research has contributed to the body of knowledge by describing SCM through the Supply Management theory perspective. 3248","chain management iwan hermawan, inayah, suharmanto, luqman khakim and jati nugroho lecturer of business administration major politeknik negeri semarang semarang, indonesia iwanpolines@gmail.com, inayah_pkp08@yahoo.com, suhenk999@gmail.com, hkmluqman@gmail.com, jatinugroho@polines.ac.id nur nelisa adah student of business administration major politeknik negeri semarang semarang, indonesia nurnelisaadah09@gmail.com","References

First problem is lack of concern for rotogravure machine operators, sheeters and pond-handles. In addition, the rotogravure machine also lacks operators and existing operators also lack sufficient expertise. Sheeter operators are often found communicating with each other about outside work. The product failed because the stack was not neat in the counting and sorting process, the cause was the operator being careless in the process. To solve the problem, this research recommended adding operators accompanied by intensive training for more optimal workmanship and also conducting socialization about the importance of product quality in production process according to standard operating procedure. Implementation has been carried out and the percentage of defects has decreased comply the company’s standard (less than 2%).","(case studyof pt igp internasional sleman) siti nurmalia, cahyono sigit pramudyo industrial engineering department faculty of science and technology universitas islam negeri sunan kalijaga yogyakarta, indonesia sayidahnurmalia00@gmail.com, cahyono.pramudyo@uin-suka.ac.id",
339,Development Of A Low-Cost Ghi Monitoring System Based On  Iot Technology,"it necessitates the implementation of a monitoring and forecasting system for solar projects which often requires data on solar irradiance - ghi (for both short-term forecasting and long-term forecasting). however, there is a serious lack of data for ghi preventing researchers from estimating precisely the development potential of solar power in certain areas and also exploring modern forecasting technologies. the industrial solar irradiance monitoring devices (often called pyranometer) have already been utilized in the scada system of solar farms for many years. nevertheless, this standard supervising system is rather expensive to afford, leading to the low applicability in term of urban scale (residential roof-top systems). realizing this practical problem, we come up with the solution of building a low-cost solar irradiance monitoring system for collecting, storing data for further interpreting such as ghi forecasting methods. instead of using a standard pyranometer, the low-cost illuminance sensor is used as an indirect measurement of ghi. the main objectives of the research are: (i) develop an electronic board to collect the data and transfer the data to the server through wi-fi connection to the internet; (ii) using information tools (python and javascript programming language) and algorithms to estimate the ghi level from measurement the illuminance; (iii) build a prototype of the monitoring system. this paper establishes a theoretical and laboratory measurement guide for the conversion between solar irradiance and illuminance. this approach concept is expected not only to solve the financial problem stated above but also to provide materials for educational purposes.","solar irradiance, systems design, internet of things",,"xuan truong nguyen, tung duong do, pham dang khoi nguyen, duc anh trong vu department of energy university of science and technology of hanoi vietnam academy of science and technology 18 hoang quoc viet, cau giay, hanoi, vietnam nguyen-xuan.truong@usth.edu.vn, duongdt.bi9076@st.usth.edu.vn, khoinpd.bi9129@st.usth.edu.vn, anhvtd.bi10-007@st.usth.edu.vn",

348,Adaptation Thresholds Method For Developing City’S  Carrying Capacity Model,"the continuing increase of urban population will cause the increase of the pressure on the city environment. some environmental problems faced in cities indicate that urban carrying capacity has exceeded. the condition of the environment will degrade if the load pressure on the environment affected by human activities has exceeded the environment carrying capacity. to achieve the sustainable city, it is urgency to develop city plan based on it carrying capacity. in this study, environmental threshold method has been designed to indicate final ecological limits for sustainable development. ultimate environmental thresholds (uets) method applies the thresholds concept to the definition of carrying capacity. the analysis methods used to achieve the purpose of model development is the description analysis, the quantitative analysis, the scoring analysis, and the spatial analysis. the analysis of the research indicates these thresholds considered as the final boundary to possible location of development, or the final limit of what natural environment can take without irreversible damage. the result being the planning contribution towards defining carrying capacity which indicate what preferred and dominant function should be promoted and where is ecologically safe would become especially relevant. in summary, an overall adaptation of ultimate environmental thresholds provides a simple approach that can be useful tool in defining city’s carrying capacity.","carrying capacity, ecological value","The application of the UET analysis on the Northern Region of Mie indicates that a spatial analysis of the interrelationship between natural resources and development is necessary, if decision about the location of the future is to be based on ecological criteria. This study does not present a solution to the problems facing Northern Region of Mie; however, it does provide a s useful framework for addressing the major issues, points to some shortcomings in the present approach and how the can be reduced. The spatial dimension dealt with current research may be seen as the initial phase of more comprehensive analyses that addresses the problems of carrying capacity (quantitative UET) and seasonal constraint (temporal UET). This research is to ensure the continued viability of significant elements of the environment. The combination of uniqueness, resilience and transformation of forest resulted in environmental territorial thresholds map. This map provided a base model to determine an ecologically solution space for development activities on the Northern Region of Mie. A solution space should primarily be determined by these constraints, which can be considered as having final (boundary, ultimate) character that indicate where and which kind of development should take place, so that a rational use of natural resources can be secured. This research demonstrated that an ecologically solution space that was produced in the Northern region of Mie provides a firm basis upon which developers can exercise their flexibility in sitting specific development proposal in their area on what and where is to be generated and contained. The result being the planning contribution towards defining carrying capacity which indicate what preferred and dominant function should be promoted and where is ecologically safe would become especially relevant. From the viewpoint of establishing tolerance to development activities, ecological carrying capacity forms an important concept. Talking the point, carrying capacity is the amount of activity or use that can be handled by system before it begins to deteriorate, another way to describe carrying capacity is determining how much use a given setting can absorb before unacceptable impact occur. 3365","erwina widjajawati directorate of economy, employment, and regional development policy deputy for development policy national research and innovation agency (brin) jakarta, indonesia erwina.widjajawati@brin.go.id anugerah widiyanto directorate of human development, demography, and culture policy deputy for development policy national research and innovation agency (brin) jakarta, indonesia anugerah.widiyanto@brin.go.id","References

Smaller than 0.05. Therefore, these variables can affect the rise and fall of NPBT Sales. All independent variables in Model 1 NPBT Sales have a coefficient of determination of 0.6889. NPBT Sales can be explained as much as 68.89% by the independent variables contained in the final model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Supervision, Image, EVP, Values, Empowerment, Performance Management, Communication, Work Structure Resources, and Working Climate variables significantly influence the determination coefficient of 68.89%. Based on the results of the t-test on Model 2 NPBT Service, it is known that the EVP and Values variables have a partially significant effect on the NPBT Service variable because they have a p-value smaller than 0.05. Therefore, these variables can affect the ups and downs of NPBT Service. All independent variables in Model 2 NPBT Service have a coefficient of determination of 0.4962. NPBT Service can be explained as much as 49.62% by the independent 3377","employee engagement drivers to sales at x car dealership ananda kejora rotty industrial engineering department, faculty of industrial technology universitas trisakti jakarta, indonesia ananda063001800037@std.trisakti.ac.id triwulandari satitidjati dewayana industrial engineering department, faculty of industrial technology universitas trisakti jakarta, indonesia triwulandari_sd@trisakti.ac.id anik nur habyba industrial engineering department, faculty of industrial technology universitas trisakti jakarta, indonesia anik@trisakti.ac.id","References

353,Sustainable Development Or Greenwashing:   The Phenomenon Of Corporate Social Responsibility,,,"Based on the analysis results, it can be concluded that all banking companies included in the research sample publish CSR activities. Banking companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2015-2020 that become most of the research samples do not only maximize company profits but carry out real CSR activities with the aim of sustainability reporting. There are 24 banking companies that fulfill the characteristics of social banks by maximizing savings collection and distributing credit to customers as well as maximizing social benefits. Meanwhile, not all banking companies publish CSR activities according to actual events. There are 15 companies that do not meet the characteristics of social banks or in other words, companies publish CSR activities with the aim of (greenwashing) marketing approach to get more attention from potential new customers. Based on the research results, the limitation of the study is an assessment of the measurement of banking companies that carry out CSR activities cannot measure the extent to which CSR activities are oriented towards sustainability reporting. The statement of financial position cannot measure the actual contribution made by the company. Further research is expected to be able to analyze the accounts in the statement of financial position by using the characteristics of the social bank approach based on corporate external dimensions and internal dimensions. Thus, it can be proven that the real CSR activities carried out by the companies are just accessories to increase customer attention or increase social benefits with the goal of sustainable development",,

Small islands must be able to supply their own energy needs independently through the off-grid decentralized concept. We followed a literature review methodology aimed at answering a series of questions that helped us understand how the main aspects of the study were addressed to contribute to best practice literature of energy community innovation and local resources utilization in a decentralized off-grid system. Based on the results of the study, there are four energy communities that have electrical energy fulfillment programs in Indonesia. Electrical energy is fulfilled using micro hydroelectric power plants, biogas dissemination program and wind energy. For further research, it is necessary to add suplementary research on the solar energy community. From our finding, research related to solar energy is still at the survey and initiation stage with the main focus on developing solar-powered fishery cold storage. Various efforts were made to meet the electricity demand. We found that the selection of the energy program was based on the existing potential in the region. So, it is important to carry out the initial mapping and survey stages before starting the program. For the smooth running of the program, it is necessary to hold deliberations and specifically involve the community and regional leaders. Understanding the leadership structure also important. On the technical aspect, training in operations management and financial management needs to be carried out for program sustainability. Most of the energy communities are grant projects that only cover surveys, initial investment, and operational costs for a limited period of time. Then maintenance and procurement training is also important, thus the energy community can independently solve the technical problem and optimize the energy production.","dana prianjani industrial engineering department, faculty of industrial technology universitas islam sultan agung, semarang, indonesia danaprianjani@unissula.ac.id ardhy yuliawan norma sakti national research and innovation agency, tangerang selatan, indonesia sirindhorn international institute of technology, thammasat university, rangsit, thailand ardh007@brin.go.id wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology research group industrial engineering and techno-economic industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id",

Although many companies have the incentive to hire disabled employees, some organizations in Peru still differ in terms of labor equity, many companies still do not have a clear concept about the inclusion of people with disabilities (PWD), when analyzing the interviews to bosses and coworkers, their perception is that people with some type of disability could delay the work, will not provide any benefit to the company and will be a high cost implementation, so many companies create additional positions (not important for the company). Therefore, it is important that the HR area has to be in constant training, and not just create a position that is not needed in the company to include them. On the other hand, it is highlighted that one of the biggest problems for people with disabilities when entering the companies were the inadequate facilities, which limits (makes it difficult) for them to develop in their work area, as well as the issue of the relationship with colleagues. Finally, the inclusion of people with disabilities in the workplace eliminates different stereotypes, generates a better work environment and changes workers' perceptions. 3494","smes in perú. sandra peña-jara, carlos augusto lizárraga-portugal and juan carlos quiroz-flores facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú 20172470@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, clizarra@ulima.edu.pe, jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe","References

363,Application Of Best-Worst Method (Bwm) In Prioritization  Of International Business Strategies,"this research provides a step by step methodology to prioritize international business strategies. although the concept of business strategy has been vastly investigated in previous literature, its prioritization is less examined in conjunction with multiple-criteria decision making (mcdm) approaches. in addition, the problem is not adequately investigated in developing countries. furthermore, recent mcdm model such as best-worst method (bwm) are more appropriate tools in comparison with older approaches such as analytic hierarchy process (ahp) as they need less judgments. in this regard, to address the gap of previous literature, this study has been arranged in two linked phases as follows. the first phase of this research examines different business strategies of previous literature. in this regard, a literature survey is completed to investigate different business strategies of previous studies. following, the second phase applies a bwm to investigate and prioritize these strategies. the obtained results show that international business strategy, multi-country business strategy, transnational business strategy and global business strategy are the most important alternatives, respectively. lastly, a summary and some directions for future research are suggested in the final section of study.","mcdm, business strategy","This study proposed a step by step procedure to rank different international business strategies. According to the discussed literature review, business and international business strategy have been adequately investigated in previous studies. However, prioritization of these strategies is less examined in conjunction with MCDM approaches. Furthermore, the problem was not adequately examined in developing countries. Finally, recent MCDM models such as BWM are more appropriate tools in comparison with older approaches such as AHP as they need less judgments. In this regard, two linked phases were applied to address the objectives of research. The initial phase of this research examined numerous business strategies of previous studies. To do so, a literature review was completed to investigate business strategies of previous literature. Next, the second phase applied a BWM to investigate and prioritize these strategies. According to the obtained results, international business strategy, multi-country business strategy, transnational business strategy and global business strategy are the most important international business strategies, respectively. As a direction for future research, the developed methodology of this study can be repeated in similar strategy related research such as Lean Manufacturing (LM), Agile Manufacturing (AM) and sustainability.","masoud rahiminezhad galankashi department of industrial, mechanical and aerospace engineering, buein zahra technical university, buein zahra, qazvin, iran masoud.rahiminezhad@bzte.ac.ir masoud.rahiminejad@yahoo.com syed ahmad helmi school of mechanical engineering, faculty of engineering, universiti teknologi malaysia, 81310, johor bahru, malaysia center for engineering education, universiti teknologi malaysia, 81310, johor bahru, malaysia helmi@utm.my shahrzad yavari sabet, sepideh safarkhani department of industrial, mechanical and aerospace engineering, buein zahra technical university, buein zahra, qazvin, iran shahrzad.ys21@gmail.com, sepideh.safarkhani77@gmail.com",

367,Implementing Ethical 'Code Of Work Ethics':   A Case Study Of Apple And Foxconn Supply Chain,"this study discusses the violation of the code of work ethics by foxconn against the rights of its workers under the protection of the fair labour association (fla) policy. this study aims to find out foxconn supply companies in increasing apple production through forced labour carried out by workers who work at foxconn without any guarantee of welfare and health and safety empowerment for their workers as well as guarantees of survival and a decent basic salary. this problem has become a form of human rights violations and inequality in the welfare of workers at the foxconn company which has led to demonstrations and protests for foxconn workers to obtain human rights for workers. although foxconn's role as apple's main supplier has helped apple in achieving its strategy in today's digital era. but not for the welfare of foxconn workers. this case study is strengthened by using the global production network (gpn) theory, which relates to production networks across economic boundaries to the actors involved. meanwhile, the role of the workforce is also involved in the gpn because as a supplier of labour it is not only involved in the interests of the company but is also involved in the state structure and global capital structure. there is also an approach used by researchers using a qualitative research approach. the data used by the researcher is secondary data obtained from journals, official websites, report data, and several articles that have been validated. the implication of this research is to improve workers' rights in a company under the protection of the fair labour association. companies are required to apply a code of work ethics to their workers to improve the welfare of workers and build a better corporate image.",,"As a company that acquires electronic products that continue to grow every day, Apple needs its supply chain to optimize the margins that Apple earns through its production. For this reason, Apple needs major suppliers to increase its production and meet customer demands continuously. To increase its competitiveness, Apple and Foxconn became the main suppliers of its production, which made Foxconn its main producer. Apple in meeting Foxconn's customer demands on its assembly production, so Foxconn has expanded branches in several regions in China located in three regions consisting of Guanlan, Longhua, and Chengdu. Foxconn is rapidly providing opportunities for the workforce as a working class in the digital age. However, behind the productivity of its workers lies inequality in poor working conditions. This is a severe concern for the FLA organization because it contributes to creating welfare for workers around the world through the principle of the ""Code of Work Ethics"" which aims to protect the rights of workers at Foxconn. In addition, the role of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) point 8 needs to be implemented into Foxconn's company policies by providing equal pay, providing health insurance, eradicating forced labour and continuous overtime work. Therefore, Foxconn is under heavy pressure from the Apple company through the FLA organization to protect workers' rights at Foxconn. Currently, Foxconn has followed the principles of the code of work ethics on basic labour rights ranging from working hours, equal pay, health & safety protection, obtaining compensation and social security insurance, as well as building industrial relations and worker integration.

370,Indonesian Songket Virtual Exhibition As A Form Of Digital  Culture To Preserve The Heritage Of Traditional Wastra,"songket is part of the intangible cultural heritage of indonesia. songket is one of the wastra of indonesia. wastra is derived from a sanskrit word and means ‘fabric with cultural content’. the objective of the paper is to analyse songket indonesia’s virtual exhibition as a form of digital cultural method to preserve the intangible culture of indonesia. digital culture is a popular topic in the world of cultural heritage preservation. the national museum of indonesia and the ministry of education and culture held a virtual exhibition of songket indonesia on december 13, 2021, called ‘songket indonesia connected the universe’. the event launched the website of the songket indonesia museum. indonesia has more than 1582 items of intangible cultural heritage. this exhibition featured forty songket wastra from all over indonesia including aceh, padang, palembang, and bali. this paper takes the form and method of a case study. the analysis through in-depth historical reviews and analysis of variables, measures, relationships, and patterns that emerged throughout the study on fashion marketing mix theory, and the promotion mix methods by the fashion marketing digital funnel. the successes and failures of digital heritage campaigns in the form of a virtual songket exhibition were identified in the review of literature, and were analysed, adapted, and enumerated according to findings from the case study. the results are limited to the study of one virtual exhibition of songket indonesia. the research was identified as digital heritage that could be used to study other virtual exhibitions and digital events for cultural preservation.","digital culture, fashion-marketing, heritage, songket","of the analysis that led to the results and discussion. 4. Results and Discussion The result of the research stated that: 1. The awareness for the media was quite good. However, the right target market, especially for the young generations (for example Generation Z) is low. 2. The content of the virtual museum needs to be improved to attract young visitors to come. 3. The virtual museum activity was well accepted to maintain the knowledge about traditional fabrics or wastra songket Indonesia. The more knowledge gained by visitors, both young and old, the more likely it is to preserve Indonesian culture. The Minister of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology must take his next actions seriously to encourage participation in culture preservation. If possible, the ministry should ask the next generation’s key opinion leaders to participate in the evaluation process. Generation Z needs to participate in heritage preservation, since they are the ones who will be leaders in the future. The songket wastra although the original one contents of golden thread, has limitation. Someday the fabrics would be broken. Digital technology documentation could be one strategy to keep this heritage alive for the future generation. As the participants in the future, generation Z who familiar with digital technology should be learnt and developed the strategy in digital cultural preservation. 4.1. Limitations of the study The findings of this study have to be seen in the light of some limitations. The primary limitation was the generalizability of these results was the depth of analysis on digital cultural preservation methods. Secondly would be the focus of the research itself; it is better to focus on which elements of this virtual exhibition would be central to the research, and thirdly would be time constraints. 4.2 Opportunities for future research With the findings of the study mentioned above, this study has opportunities for future research. Future research could be about the methods to study digital culture preservation. One element could be chosen from this research. For example, a study about traditional fabrics such as wastra songket could be related to Generation Z interest and could be focused on one particular discipline such as fashion marketing communication as part of promoting wastra songket in Indonesia. 5. Conclusion The Indonesian songket virtual exhibition as a form of digital culture to preserve the heritage of traditional wastra was a positive gesture from the government of Indonesia as an answer to challenging pandemic conditions. The method of the virtual exhibition was well accepted. The virtual exhibition needed to be evaluated to achieve the goals as cultural preservation and the heritage of songket wastra Indonesia.","dicky maryoga hutadjulu fashion management program, product design department, binus northumbria school of design, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 dhutadjulu@binus.edu prof. dr. drs. i nyoman artayasa, m. kes professor, postgraduate, doctoral degree indonesian institute of arts denpasar bali, indonesia artayasa01@yahoo.com",
371,Creating Legal Unity In A Rapidly Changing World:  Indonesia And The Netherlands Compared,"confronted with rapid and complex changes in the digital era, both the indonesian and dutch supreme court have been granted the powers of providing legal solutions at an early stage of the legal process. the dutch parliament introduced the law on prejudicial questions whereas the indonesian supreme court reinstated the chamber system. each year, pressing legal issues are discussed by the supreme court judges in the chambers and the legal solutions published in a circular (surat edaran mahkamah agung, sema) as guidelines to be followed by lower courts. in this paper we compare both ‘legal shortcuts’ and argue that, while the goal of legal unity is an urgent issue in indonesia, to be able to properly function as legal guidelines for judges and lawyers sema require a more detailed description of the legal issue and legal reasoning behind the offered legal solutions.","mahkamah agung, sema, hoge raad","The comparison between the prejudicial questions in the Netherlands and the SEMA in Indonesia has made clear two similarities: (1) their objectives of creating legal consistency pertaining to pressing legal issues; and (2) the way this is done, namely by creating a shortcut for the Supreme Court to provide legal solutions at an early stage of the legal process. However, we have also found several significant differences between prejudicial questions and SEMA with regard to the legal foundations, selection procedure, origins, formats, legal status. The main problem we found regarding the legal solutions adopted in SEMA is that the published SEMA does not contain a legal background, a concrete legal question, or a legal reasoning behind the new legal norm. This makes the legal solutions offered vague and therefore subject to interpretations by lower courts – which may lead to inconsistency in judgments.

372,The Influence Of Green Education On Sustainable Mindset In  Business English Class,"sustainability and environmental issues are crucial to address because the present and future generations are dealing with long-term consequences. thus, educational institutions need to reinforce environmental awareness and a sustainable mindset in young generations. the researchers applied green education in english for business presentations (ebp) classes in this study; students were entailed to think critically about specific issues in the environment and sustainability. the objective of this study was to instill and sustain students' sustainable mindset in business english through environmental awareness. to answer the research question of whether green education successfully influences students' mindset and behavior toward environmental and sustainability awareness, the researchers employed a qualitative method to investigate students' perspectives on environmental awareness and sustainability before and after receiving green education. three hundred undergraduate students participated in this study at binus university in indonesia. the ebp instructors designed a lesson in which the goal was to present green business ideas. the class activities required the students to analyze challenges and yield innovative solutions for their environment. the findings indicate that green education influenced students’ sustainability mindset. this study revealed that green education in business english classes integrated ethics, entrepreneurship, environmental studies, systems thinking, self-awareness, and the dimensional contexts of critical thinking as knowledge, values, and competency. in conclusion, all students obtained exposure to environmental issues by instilling green education in business english classes; they are also expected to establish green and sustainable businesses.",green education,"This research aims at instilling environmental awareness and a sustainable mindset in Business English classes through green education and business presentation projects. The activities have encouraged students to analyze the challenges and generate innovative solutions for the environment. This study revealed that green education integrated ethics, entrepreneurship, environmental studies, systems thinking, self-awareness, and the dimensional contexts of critical thinking as knowledge, values, and competency. Moreover, all students responded to the latest environmental issues. The project focused on integrating environmental awareness (green business ideas) and educational technology. In the project, lecturers could direct students to establish green and sustainable businesses in the future. The limitation of this research is the lack of previously published studies in the same field, which is the impact of green education in business English class. It was quite a challenging process to lay a foundation to determine the scope of the research based on very limited existing studies. Due to the condition, the researchers encourage other interested parties to conduct research on the same topic to enrich the scopes of works in different universities and student demographics. Also, this study only examined the sustainable mindset in Business English Class through green education, while other aspects of learning outcomes such as future implementation and other achievements could be further studied. This research contributes to best practices and studies in developing green education and SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) in universities; the result of this study shows that even a language class can include green education in its practice, not only subjects/majors directly related to science or environmental studies. Moreover, the results provide both practical and theoretical implications: (1) the researchers affirmed that the project has successfully influenced students regarding environmental awareness and sustainable mindsets; thus, integrating green education in an English business class is highly applicable (2) the survey and interview results showed that educators and authorities need to do more efforts to promote green mindset to the future generations; the present practices can bring long consequences in the future, (3) the technology used as learning tool is formatted particularly for supporting material, (4) the university students involved in this research showed low motivation in efforts to persuade other people to live a green life style; this result provides an opportunity to design and develop lesson that can boost students’ motivation, (5) and lastly, for further research, other challenges in sustainable mindset through green education can be studied in other educational contexts and settings.","asih zunaidah, and lila nathania communication science department, faculty of digital communication and hotel & tourism, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 asih.zunaidah@binus.edu, lila.nathania@binus.edu nina amalia nurichsania visual communication design department, school of design, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 nina.nurichsania@binus.ac.id desi indrawati computer science department, school of computer science, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 desi.indrawati@binus.edu",

374,"Now That We Are All Expert,   What Do We Really Think About Online Class?","as early as march 2020 the covid-19 pandemic took over globally and soon the world as we used to know underwent abrupt changes, including education sector. the key motivation for this research is to understand how teaching and learning in the art and/or design discipline might be transformed in the long term, for both teachers and learners, as a reflection of teaching practices under the pandemic condition. comparatively, this research aims to find out whether there is a shift in educators in art and/or design’s perception toward online class, by considering both technological and human aspects surrounding the subjects. this research uses mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. quantitatively, this study analysed data from online questionnaires addressed to lecturers at higher education institutions (hei). to get a deeper understanding, this research also uses a qualitative approach, by investigating both lecturers and the students majoring in art and/or design. this research maintains that while the presence of technology and internet are vital in virtual class, but such classes can only be dubbed as successful providing there is an active role from both educators and students. currently, the online classes that are taking place in a rather emergency manner are not yet running optimally, due to the lack of participation from the students. however, it is probable that in the future this situation may be changed, with the carefully planned curriculum, once our students are mentally prepared.","online class, art and design, teaching art","Logically, teaching at a Higher Education level supposedly demand less physical interaction than it does for younger apprentices. However, the act of ‘getting to know each other’ both from the perspective of educators and students are found to be indispensable. Physical presence gave an emotional yet human touch that will never been replaced by virtual experiences, no matter how superior the technology used – or at least as far as the advancement of technology that we have today. Even though it is not exclusive to the field of art & design, concrete dialogue between educators and students is a must in this field. Because at the end of the day, the expected output is somewhere between an artwork that can visually communicate to its audience and/or have the ability to connect one person to another; or vice versa, a study that can give meaning to an object, without which it would only be an inanimate entity. Of course, this research is not without limitations. First, albeit the educators’ responses were collected from 28 different institutions in several different countries, it may not entirely represent all art and/or design institutions around the world. Secondly, the answers of this research’ questionnaires relied on participants' personal data and perspectives. Therefore, cautiousness is needed when deducing from these results. However, outcomes from this research are coherent with other scholarships alike. Thus, while some aspects might be differ depending on the place and conditions, we could assume that this result is still valid to some degrees. One thing that needs to be highlighted, the teaching and learning process is a two-way road. Both parties – the educators and the students are needs to be equally participate in the process, which is one of the best parts of learning experience. 3608","liliek adelina suhardjono faculty member, school of design – visual communication design binus university jakarta, indonesia lsuhardjono@binus.edu","References

376,To Shoot Or Not To Shoot: Health Protocols In Indonesian  Film Industry Thriving Sustainable Business During,"globally, the film industry decreased significantly due to covid-19, starting in march 2020. physical distancing, lockdown protocols, and other restricted regulations were applied. vaccines were just founded and were not massively distributed. at that time, no official health protocols nor standard operating procedures regarding film production and movie theaters were applied in the “new normal.""the filmmaking businesses were threatened since film productions were restricted and movie theaters were closed down. the big dilemma occurred: which one was the priority: the safety of the crews and talents or the sustainability of national film industry? however, in 2021 there were some signs of progress. it started with makmum 2 (december 2021), which obtained more than one million viewers. it is followed by ku kira kau rumah (february 2022) and kkn desa penari (april 2022), which reached 2,2 million and 3 million viewers, respectively. in prestigious film festivals, the movies such as seperti dendam, rindu harus dibayar tuntas, and yuni won as the best pictures at locarno film festival (august 2021) and toronto film festival (september 2021), respectively. many films showed cases in festival film indonesia (december 2021). these have shown that the indonesian film industry is becoming better commercially and critically. the paper investigates how the indonesian filmmakers tried to adjust to the new normal era from both creative works and business strategy perspectives. in particular, the authors will do the mapping on the best practices of health protocols applied in film production.","film industry, business strategy, health protocols, covid-19 pandemic","Many industries experience setbacks due to the pandemic, and the film industry is no exception. There are many forms of adaptations and changes made by business people in this industry. It ranges from the following changes in patterns in film consumption (from the big screen/theatrical to virtual screening), changes in movie sales and distribution (OTT) patterns, to how to keep producing films amidst the challenges of the spread of the Covid-19. The paper focuses on the discussion of the latter, which is on how the Indonesian filmmakers were trying to find the right patterns or protocols in producing the film and practicing business strategy. The best practices are needed so that production efficiency can be achieved (not over budget), minimize the spreading of the virus, and finish the movie promptly. During the pandemic situation, particularly in 2020, filmmakers were in a dilemma: to shoot or not to shoot. On the one hand, the situation was challenging during a lockdown: physical distancing was firmly applied, movie theaters were closed down, no SOP/health protocols were formulated, PCR tests were costly, and vaccines were not nationally circulated. On the other hand, the sustainability of the film industry should happen as production houses need to make films they already planned. Hence filmmakers need to formulate a film production atmosphere where all crews and talents feel safe and comfortable and focus on film production based on their respective roles. Both Harmayn and Nugross highlight the importance of designing and applying health protocols regarding film production during the pandemic. The health and safety of all crews and talents are the most important; therefore, filmmakers need to design good preparation and ensure the application. Moreover, maintaining the excellent mood of everybody is also crucial. The protocols have reflected the business strategies adopted which are rethink, effective policy and strategic flexibility to ensure the sustainable business in this industry.","pandemic ekky imanjaya film department, school of design bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 eimanjaya@binus.edu rosidah global business marketing program, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 rosidah.s@binus.ac.id",
377,Gender Sensitive Policies During Covid-19: Experience  From Asia,"covid-19 has brought a substantial impact on women’s livelihood around the globe, including women in asia. countries are trying to mitigate this disruption by applying various gender-sensitive policies and regulations during the pandemic. yet, little is known about how asian countries are prioritising this strategy. the current paper aims to navigate how countries are responding to the spread of the virus whilst ensuring women’s welfare through gender- sensitive policies, programs, and regulations. using a dataset created by undp and un women, gender response policies are characterised into four main areas, namely social protection measures, labor market measures, fiscal and economic measures, and violence against women measures. in addition, this paper aims to analyze the correlation of women's leadership in the covid-19 national task force towards the policies that advocate women’s interests. the findings suggest that women’s low representation in the covid-19 national task force is resulting in the lack of gender-sensitive policies.","covid-19, women leaders, such as economic","COVID-19 has an impact on gender vulnerability, especially in women and children, such as biological vulnerability to infection, loss of social and economic implications, a vulnerability in gender equality, lack of women's participation in various groups, including politics as well as various adverse impacts on women thereby increasing vulnerability and inequality against women and girls. Therefore, to overcome the massive impact on women, the importance of a response or policy to COVID-19 is based on solid gender analysis or gender-sensitive policies and strong participation from the most affected groups, such as in decision making and implementing regulations. Based on an analysis of the low level of gender-sensitive policies in the Asian region in 4 policy categories with different fields in the Asian region, namely Social Protection Measures, Labor Market Measures, Fiscal and Economic Measures, and Violence Against Women Measures.

Monalisa’s painting considered a work of high art in Rennaisance Era. Monalisa is used as an experiment by adding contemporary visuals that are close to Gen Z. Star from the trend of wearing a bucket hat, and smoking a cigar. The effect of combining the Renaissance’s icon and the visuals of today's hipster themes gives Monalisa a ""close"" and ""cool"" effect as an icon of today. Element Color: Bright colors on the background, shade tone with an earthy theme on Monalisa. Forms and shapes: Organic lines on the background, supporting objects, and geometric on the main object. Pattern: Geometric from digital effect on objects. Combining the main object with the present object denotatively through the use of hats, glasses, and cigars. Merging each element also gives a connotative effect in the form of ""cool Mona Lisa"". Hats, sunglasses, and cigarettes give a different impression, where these three things are considered as objects of discourse on the hipster theme.

The artwork above was inspired by the famous painting, Mona Lisa, which represents the Rennaisance, the era of a 
well-known artist Leonardo da Vinci. His famous wood panel oil painting was created between 1503 and 1506 in 
Florence, Italy. However, The Mona Lisa painting is remains an admiration and debate issue nowadays. Monalisa’s 
smile is considered to be a mystery that causes many speculations. This is what inspired the creator to create a new 
form as an NFT art. The creator transformed the Mona Lisa painting into a NFT art, combined with a contemporary 
urban style. Contemporary style was chosen to illustrate the present era, which was intertextualized at the same time 
as the Renaissance. 
 
5. Result and Discussion 
After going through the process in the research stage, the result titled “Hipster Lisa” was assessed as an impressive 
artwork. The student was successfully combining his personal experience and historical knowledge, then transforming 
into a recent art form that represents individual characteristic. The element of intertextuality was also depicted through

380,Digitalization Of Interior Materials As Sustainable  Learning Process To Enrich Students’ Material Knowledge,"interior design department required experience-based learning through a bank of material samples. the material samples in the physical material library come in various categories and different types. the situation of covid-19 pandemic has enforced rapid growth of transformation on digital technology. digital material libraries came up as a solution for such a situation. digital samples of interior materials also can be stored and accessed easily with an internet connection. otherwise, there are things to be considered due to crucial points in relation to senses experiences such as tactility and smell senses in which students need touch and feel the texture of the materials to explore and understand them better. a qualitative method with a comparative study approach is conducted in this research to investigate which elements of image taking could bring a close impression to the real object. by using this approach an in-depth comparison study will be done in the interior design department laboratory of binus university to reveal the advantages and disadvantages of images taken by two types of equipment: 2d flat scanner and digital camera. mosaic tiles, carpet flooring, upholstery fabric, weaving, and wallcovering. result of this research will elaborate a glimpse of recommendation of digitization on interior materials to enrich sustainability on distance learning.","digitalization, technology","Amid the unprecedented time of covid-19 pandemic, long-distance learning has become an answer to ensure continuity of teaching- learning process. Digitalization of the material library in the Interior Design Department of BINUS University supports the needs of material access while physical attendance in the laboratory is not allowed. In realization, digital transformation from physical objects to digital images requires a consideration in material experiences (due to lack of tactility and aromatic sensing in digital form). From this study, can be point out that image capture becomes a factor in the digitalization process, especially its requirement whether using a scanner of digital camera. It is agreeable that different types of material require different equipment and when selecting materials for digitizing, technical questions should be addressed include type of materials, surface of material, its color and other critical features that want to be shown digitally. Thus, suitable equipment can be selected and used. From the comparative study of material documentation, we can conclude that both equipment, the scanner and digital camera has their own strengths and weaknesses. However, when using digital camera, there are important factors to be considered: 1. Provide proper lighting to reduce noise and illustrate a real material surface (especially glossy materials). The images shown in the digital library are required to be seen clearly along with the real color tone (neutral lighting is recommended). Lighting also can build a bumpy effect that shows texture and surface depth. 2. Variety of camera angles are helpful for making the real image perception, as it builds the material dimension by showing the thickness, width, and length/ diameter of the materials. Also, images show material along with the vernier callipers can add more information needed. 3664","anak agung ayu wulandari, siti chadijah, ulli aulia ruki interior design department, school of design bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 a.wulandari@binus.edu, siti.chadijah@binus.edu, uruki@binus.edu agnes paulina gunawan visual communication design, school of design bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 agunawan@binus.edu","references related to

Further studies on providing user experiences are highly required in the future to support distance teaching-
learning activities and interactions withing digital material libraries. Not only how the material samples are 
digitized, the establishment of data repository is also crucial. Moreover, the data formats must be defined in a 
standardized manner to be easily accessible to its users (Kimmig et al., 2021). With the growth of digital 
technology in every aspect including interior design, currently some of the common digital technology uses in 
interior design process are 2 and 3-dimensional drawing and modelling programs on a computer, artificial 
intelligence products, virtual reality (VR) and so on. Within the interior architecture itself, there are numerous 
design products generated via digital technology and there is a gradually increasing demand for such applications 
(Demirarslan & Demirarslan, 2020), this has opened an opportunity for further research. Not only to digitalize the 
material samples and establish a digital material repository, but also to study on how these digital material sample 
can be applied directly in 2 or 3-dimensional drawing and modelling.

381,Implementing Zero Waste Pattern Cutting For Sustainable  Fashion Collection,"the study aims to maximise the usage of the fabric and minimise the pre-production waste through the sustainable practice of zero waste pattern making and cutting technique. the entire process of designing and production of garments are now being challenged as the industry has been contributing as one of the most polluting industries, where the whole production loop needs to be looked at, from the design, manufacture, usage, to disposal stage. this research applied an exploratory research method by having exploration on pattern making technique on pre-production stage of garment making. trials and errors using geometric pattern arrangement were conducted in the zero-waste approach while considering seam allowances and finishing technique in minimising the fabric waste. paper folding technique was also implemented to support the design visualisation and further to ensure the garment fit. a fashion collection was made in response to introducing zero waste cutting as an alternative practice to create creative patternmaking with fabric efficiency considerations. overall, this study offers economic and ecological benefit that helps in utilising the fabric on garment production, at the same time adding value to leftover fabric. the study also sees the potential improvement in doing more zero waste pattern cutting as part of the design process in the future.","zero waste pattern, pattern cutting","As the sustainable issue rises, more people are becoming more aware of environmental issues. The buzzword of eco- friendly and save the earth is widely seen everywhere. The same thing happens in fashion industry, sustainable fashion is increasingly available with brands claiming to be environmentally responsible. However, this leads to the increased greenwashing practices as part of the company’s marketing strategy in promoting their products, in which in the long run it will impact brand trust. Therefore, it is highly suggested that customers need to be more mindful and selective during the pre-purchase stage. A collection was made in response to the greenwashing practice and as a sustainable alternative in minimising textile waste that is believed to have been highly polluting. Further, this study aims to raise the awareness of being transparent to the consumers about the sustainable practice in building the positive public image as opposed to the greenwashing practice. In this study, zero waste pattern cutting was chosen to be the approach in achieving sustainability in fashion. Although zero waste pattern cutting has not been a common thing in the industry especially in Indonesia, but it is believed that the approach might work well in utilising resources sustainably and in minimising the inefficiency in production. The approach was then combined with the idea of paper folding. Paper folding technique was added to help in visualising the design with a combination of pleats, folds, and darts. At the same time, these fabric manipulations would help ensuring the fit and fall of the fabric on body curves. Overall, zero waste pattern approach proves to offer economic and ecological benefit as compared to conventional approach that it helps in utilising the fabric during and after the production that it minimises the fabric consumption and at the same time adding value to existing leftover textiles. Instead of doing the greenwashing, this study might be beneficial for the creation of competitive advantage in the midst of tight competition in fashion industry. Further, this study sees the potential in doing more zero waste pattern cutting as part of design process in the future.","grasheli kusuma andhini, ratna dewi paramita, and janyfer fashion design, product design department, binus northumbria school of design, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 grasheli.andhini@binus.edu; rparamita@binus.edu",

389,Optimal Performance Of A Stochastic Repair And Replacement  Model With Imperfect Repairs,"the optimal performance of a repairable system where failure results in either an imperfect repair or replacement under exponential time between failures and repair times is discussed in this study. we develop a constrained stochastic nonlinear optimization model with capital, repair, and downtime costs constituting the three cost categories of the objective function. in this context, a closed expression for the optimal minimum cost is developed, along with analytical expressions for a variety of parameters, including repair and replacement rates. key words nonlinear optimization, down time, minimum cost, imperfect repai 1. introduction currently, industrial organizations are confronted with several difficulties that risk their financial success. during production, manufacturing systems are subjected to a variety of disruptions, including deterioration, random failures, poor maintenance techniques, and quality decline, among others, all of which have a significant impact on the overall performance of such systems. as a result, appropriate production and maintenance techniques are essential for limiting the effects of such unpredictably disruptive events. in recent years, product quality has become a significant dimension that has steadily been incorporated into the field of production systems. because effective quality methods are directly linked to production and maintenance, integrated models including the three core functions of production, quality, and maintenance have lately delivered better outcomes than traditional models that address these activities independently. several other issues, such as degradation, have a negative impact on the system's performance. in real life, not only is performance important, but so is cost, and systems also behave in an unpredictable manner. during their operational life, industrial systems are subject to repair actions when they fail during their operating life. the goal of a repair action is to decreases the system's failure rate and extend its useful life. the system's inherent age as well as the effectiveness of repair must be considered during the maintenance process. in most cases, repair efficiencies are assumed to be minimal, perfect, or imperfect. the system is returned to its operating state just before the failure in minimal maintenance. the goal of a perfect repair is to return the system to its original state which is as good as new. meanwhile, these assumptions are not necessarily feasible for a repairable system because the system can be effectively repaired but not renewed. this is referred to as imperfect repair. in this paper, we aim to develop an optimization model for a repairable system with identical components that, upon failure, is either replaced or imperfectly repaired, but with varying probability. the expressions for the optimal values for many critical metrics such as repair and failure rates are determined. furthermore, the expression for the minimum total cost is derived, noting that three cost components are incorporated including purchase cost, repair cost, and downtime cost total. 2. literature review barlow (1965) used the markov process to examine system availability and presented the principles of mathematical theory of reliability. to put it another way, maintenance is used to improve equipment reliability by preventing unexpected malfunctions, decreasing unscheduled downtimes, and lowering maintenance costs 3732",,"and Future Directions In this paper, a general optimal model for stochastic repair and replacement is developed, from which the performance of various systems can be produced. Engineers and decision makers should carefully examine all the parameters before choosing any system. It has been noted that the optimization model is more intricate, and careful research is required to identify the best options and parameters. Additionally, standby and parallel setups are more intricate and challenging to solve than series ones. Future studies should consider complicated systems, with different failure modes, and multiple components. The failure and repair rates of systems that follow different distributions, such as the Weibull and Beta Distributions, among others, must also be considered. Simulation needs to be considered for more complicated systems.",mohammed a. hajeeh techno-economics division kuwait institute for scientific research p.o. box 24885; safat-13109 kuwait mhajeeh@kisr.edu.kw; http://www.kisr.edu.kw,

392,The Effect Of Gas Injection Duration On The Restart  Pressure Of Waxy Crude Oil Pipeline,"waxy crude oil deposition in production pipelines often causes flow assurance issues in production operation. the issue further deteriorates during restarting of the waxy crude oil pipeline after an emergency shut down or planned maintenance. this is due to the obstruction caused by the solid wax in the pipeline, which requires additional pressure to disintegrate the solid wax before achieving a steady flow. the conventional equation used to measure the minimum pressure required for pipeline restart is overestimated, since thermal shrinkage, gas voids formation, and compressibility are neglected. the present study describes the effect of water bath temperature on the cooling time of the waxy crude oil and the effect of gas injection duration on the restart pressure of the waxy crude oil pipeline. the experiment was carried out using a waxy crude oil flow loop rig. it was observed that as the water bath temperature decreases, the cooling time increases, and the cooling rate decreases. when different gas injection durations were injected, a longer duration yields to lower pipeline restart pressure. longer gas injection duration implies more volume of gas; hence compressibility is increased, which provides more space for the movement of the gelled waxy crude oil and its disintegration within the pipeline during the restart process. hence, the restart pressure of the pipeline can be greatly reduced. at water bath temperature of 20°c, the highest restart pressure reduction, 40.48% is achieved, whereas at water bath temperature of 32°c, the highest reduction in the restart pressure attained is 33.52%.","waxy crude oil, restart pressure, compressibility",,"haizatul hafizah hussain and shaharin anwar sulaiman department of mechanical engineering universiti teknologi petronas 32610 seri iskandar, perak, malaysia haizatulhafizah.hus@utp.edu.my, shaharin@utp.edu.my girma tadesse chala department of mechanical engineering (well engineering) international college of engineering and management, p.o. box 2511, c.p.o seeb, p.c. 111, muscat, oman girma@icem.edu.om hazlina husin department of petroleum engineering universiti teknologi petronas 32610 seri iskandar, perak, malaysia hazlina.husin@utp.edu.my","References

393,Application Of Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp) In  Adoption Of Quality Management System (Qms),"this paper develops a research methodology to rank quality management systems (qms). the qms and its related tools and techniques are adequately investigated in current literature. however, determining the priority of adopting different qms is less practiced along with multiple-criteria decision making (mcdm) methodologies. furthermore, this combination is not vastly examined in developing countries. also, famous mcdm model such as analytic hierarchy process (ahp) can be easily linked with this problem. hence, to fill this gap, this research has been completed in three phases as follows. the first phase provides a review on previous literature. to do so, a literature survey is conducted to find the common criteria to prioritize different qmss. next, the most frequently applied qmss of previous literature are determined in the second phase of this research. following, the third phase determines the priority level of different qmss to be applied by companies. to do so, the third phase applies an ahp to investigate and prioritize the most frequently applied qmss of the second phase. according to the obtained results, iso 9001, iso 14001, and iso 50001 are the most important qmss to be applied by companies, respectively. finally, the last section of this study includes a summary and some directions for future research.",mcdm,"This study proposed a step-by-step procedure to rank different QMSs. The QMSS, their tools and techniques are properly examined in previous literature. However, the patriotization process of different QMS were less examined along with MCDM models. In addition, the problem was not adequately investigated in developing countries. Furthermore, well-known MCDM techniques such as AHP were less investigated to enrich the problem. Hence, this research applied following phases to fill the gap of previous literature. The initial phase reviewed previous literature to develop the initial idea. In this regard, a literature survey was conducted to develop the common criteria of prioritizing QMSs. Following, the most frequently applied QMSs of previous studies were determined in the second phase of this study. Finally, the third phase determined the priority of different QMSs to be used in companies. To be more specific, the third phase applied an AHP to develop and rank the most frequently applied QMSs of the second phase. The obtained results showed that ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and ISO 50001 are the highest ranked QMSs, respectively.

While the average level of performace/perception/reality falls in to the “very good” category with a percentage of 84.58%. This shows that users already feel that the quality of electronic services on the TIX ID application is very good, but still has not met the level of user expectations. The user satisfaction rate of the TIX ID application is 95.26% (<100%). All dimensions of the e-service quality variable have a Level of Conformity below 100%. All 16 attributes in the dimensions of the e-service quality variable have negative values (<1). Thus, the work of the TIX ID application has not met the satisfaction and / expectations of users. However, it is indicated that there is no attribute that is in Quadrant I (top improvement priority). There are 7 attributes in Quadrant II, namely EFF2; EFF3; EFF4; FUL1; FUL2; PRI2; and PRI2. There are 7 attributes in Quadrant III, namely SA1; RES1; RES2; COM1; COM2; CON1; and CON2. Then in Quadrant IV there are 2 attributes, namely EFF1 and SA2. 6.2 Suggestions Based on the results of the Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) diagram on the TIX ID application, according to Hatta, H. & Rumahorbo, S. G. R. (2021), if it does not have attribute that is in Quadrant I, then the author advises companies to make improvements to attribute that is in Quadrant III. After Quadrant I, Quadrant III is also a quadrant which is considered important for customers and requires improved performance so that customers feel satisfied (Hatta, H. & Rumahorbo, S. G. R., 2021). Therefore, TIX ID could do the following things to improve these attributes to increase user satisfaction: • It is recommended that the TIX ID application improve the performance of its application so that it does not error when it comes to making online booking, opening the e-ticket’s booking code, toping up the e-money, and doing the transaction. • It is recommended that TIX ID increase the speed in responding to user complaints so that the user’s time does not waste much in waiting for a response from TIX ID. • It is recommended that TIX ID improve the ability regarding a compensation to those who should get their rights if something goes wrong from TIX ID. • It is recommended that TIX ID solve the problem more effectively and not responding to the same answer repeatedly according to user complaints, so it does not waste time and the problem is immediately resolved properly. • It is recommended that TIX ID application does not use bots (automatic messages) too often when communicating with users. The bots could be used only to give greetings and ask for user complaints. • It is recommended that TIX ID put the link of the official TIX ID website on TIX ID's Tiktok and Instagram accounts (because TIX ID’s contact information such as telephone numbers, Help Center, and Consumer Complaints Service are available on the website). 3843","analysis (ipa) method malva ravieda apsari, aditya wardhana and mahir pradana business administration study program, faculty of communication and business, telkom university bandung, 40257, indonesia malvaravieda@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, adityawardhana@telkomuniversity.ac.id mahir.pradana@gmail.com","References

400,Determination Of Burn-In Period Based On Reliability Target  For Product Failure Time With Weibull Distribution,"in today’s market issues, competitions between industries are highly inevitable. strategic planning must really be considered and one of these is by improving the reliability of the products. it was also known that burn-in process has a great impact towards having this kind of plan. in this paper, the researchers will have to determine the burn-in period based on the reliability target for product failure rates under weibull distribution. in doing this, the methodology has been designed by analysing the properties of the functions of reliability. conditional reliability was used to know the time t0 which indicates as burn-in time that will best fit into the reliability target. the researchers incorporated the weibull distribution to this computation to specify the kind of behavior of the failure rates. moreover, numerical examples were also used to prove how this process works in a certain scenario.","reliability, reliability target, burn-in period","Determining the required burn-in period is essential in improving the reliability if the outgoing product reliability cannot meet the reliability target. Not only it helps in achieving the reliability goal, it also minimizes the cost of burn- in through limiting the burn-in period to the necessary time. In this study, the researchers first established the difference between the reliability and conditional reliability. Reliability is the probability that the product will perform its specific functions for a certain period of time after undergoing some predefined period of time and check operational and its functions. Moreover, the researchers were able to show when the predefined period of time i.e. burn-in time in this study will be beneficial or not by getting the derivative of the conditional probability. Since the derivative represented the slope or the change of reliability over time t after the burn-in period 𝑇𝑇0, its value should be positive, the failure rate must be a decreasing function with respect to time. For the constant and increasing failure rate function, the slope of the derivative of 𝑅𝑅(𝑡𝑡|𝑇𝑇0) is equal to zero and less than one respectively. Therefore, having a burn-in test for products that have constant or increasing failure rate will not improve reliability. The case is different for increasing failure rate because it will have a negative effect on the reliability. After this, the researchers provided a numerical example to determine the required burn-in time to achieve certain reliability targets. The Median Ranks method was used to estimate the proportion of failure to the population. These values were then transformed into a straight line by getting the double natural logarithmic of the equation. Furthermore, the Weibull shape and scale parameters were estimated. This was done using the ReliaSoft Weibull ++. These values were then substituted to the conditional probability equation to get the required burn-in period to achieve certain reliability targets. 5. Recommendations To further improve this study, the researchers give the following recommendations: 1. Use different methods in estimating the Weibull parameters and see if there are any significant differences. 2. Use a bigger sample size or better yet apply this method to an actual case study. 3. Determine the burn-in time for other distribution such as Log Normal. 4. Consider censored data and adjust the data based on the censoring. 5. Use of industrial burn-in data to track product failure rate before burn-in and to compare product field reliability with reliability target after burn-in test. 3855","innah dominique j. puertollano and michelle joy v. macapuno school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua institute of technology intramuros, manila 1002, philippines dr. ying che chien college of electrical engineering and computer science department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university chung li city, taiwan 32023, r.o.c.","References

401,Proposed Solution To Optimize Production Cost In Fulfilling  Domestic Market Obligations,"a coal-mining and trading company in indonesia annually fulfills the demand for domestic market obligations for the public interest power generation industry. the ministry of energy and mineral resources policy for coal entrepreneurs in indonesia mandates that indonesian coal producers meet 25 percent of the annual production plan for the domestic market. this policy has set the selling price of coal for the power generation industry for public use at $70 per metric ton. indonesian coal business owners must follow the policy if they do not want to be banned from export. due to higher production costs than the set selling price, this policy is hazardous to the company's bottom line. losses in the company can be reduced through actions taken by the company. based on root cause analysis using the current reality tree method, the planning of coal blending was found to be ineffective. since the user still plans the coal blending using intuition and the user's limited knowledge of methods that can optimize these activities. as a result, companies can reduce production costs by optimizing these plans. the linear programming method is used to solve the problem because it can minimize production costs by allocating the amount of coal mixed from the nine coal types available at the company and considering the buyer's quality requirements. after implementing the linear programming method, the total production cost is optimize and meets all product specifications required by the buyer.","blending plan, coal industry","In answering the research question to optimize production cost in meeting the demand for Domestic Market Obligations (DMO) coal, a root cause analysis has been carried out related to the business issue. Thus, this study has produced a production cost minimization model for coal allocation in the coal blending process to meet buyer demands by considering the desired quality specifications, namely the calorific value and sulfur content contained in the coal. From this research, it is obtained an optimization mathematical model that can be used by coal company in planning blending coal to minimize production costs to reduce company losses in meeting DMO requests. The proposed model has been verified and validated to minimize production costs while still meeting the buyer's desired quality specifications. So, it can be concluded is better to use the proposed model because the model that has been designed has been verified and validated to minimize the total production cost while still considering the needs of the buyer in accordance with the allocation and specifications of the desired coal quality. Companies must continue to prioritize customer satisfaction by providing quality coal according to buyer’s request and on time.","(study case: coal mining company in indonesia) regita hawari master of business administration school of business and management institut teknologi bandung bandung, indonesia regita_hawari@sbm-itb.ac.id mursyid hasan basri senior lecturer, school of business and management institut teknologi bandung bandung, indonesia mursyid@sbm-itb.ac.id",
402,Covid-19 Pandemic Impact On The Real Estate Industry: A  Review Of The Literature And Way Forward,"coronavirus is a global disease triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars -cov-2). the virus has put the globe's public health in danger and affected the global economy since it first appeared in wuhan, china in november 2019 and speedily spread to europe and other parts of the universe. confirmed cases of the pandemic infection according to who (2022) as of the 7th of august 2022 stood at 589,246,575 with about 6,436,274 reported cases of deaths. the world’s gross domestic product also experienced a decline of about 6.7 percent in 2020 due to the covid-19 pandemic outbreak. the global real estate sector was not left out as the industry also faces similar challenges in different ways, and despite the general optimism about curtailing the impact of the pandemic, it yet remains a risk to economic growth and stabilization of the real estate industry. this paper, hence, undertakes a serious analysis of the literature and presents the findings of various studies on the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the real estate industry, and suggests appropriate measures to adopt against similar emergency health challenges in the future that could endanger the industry’s survival. documentary pieces of evidence were obtained from various secondary sources related to the issue and were reviewed accordingly. the findings of this study as obtained from the literature revealed that the covid-19 pandemic has had a significant detrimental effect on the real estate industry and remains a risk to the stabilization of the industry. the study, therefore, suggests that industry players should act fast in adopting various digital technologies appropriate to real estate practices as well as the need for business diversification to save the industry from a state of vulnerability in case of future emergencies or challenges.","real estate, industry, covid-19 pandemic, impact","and Implication of the study The study has analyzed a significant amount of pertinent literature regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences on the real estate market. It has also made recommendations for how to mitigate these negative effects. Results from the different studies we've evaluated have revealed that the pandemic has had a detrimental influence on the real estate sector, with very few studies revealing mixed findings. Most of the literature has shown how the pandemic has hurt sales of residential, commercial, and retail real estate. Numerous studies found that the lack of mobility for people and capital led to falling real estate values and a decline in investment. According to the reports, several residential complexes no longer had as much demand from prospective buyers. Renters and the real estate supply chain thus felt the effects of the pandemic. It has been shown that travel restrictions and bans have seriously harmed real estate deals, particularly those involving shops, offices, and hotels, in many different countries throughout the world while impeding tourism. Like this, many people in the business lost their jobs both temporarily and permanently, and a significant number of international real estate enterprises' profits and stock were reported to have similarly decreased in various countries. Project deadlines, costs, and market expansion were similarly affected by the epidemic, as reported in the literature. The review also shows that the epidemic has caused a significant shift in investors' preferences, with real estate development and construction investment possibilities shifting to better individual health and well-being. A review of the literature also showed that, in comparison to those in the US and other developed nations, the real estate markets in China and other Asian countries were less negatively impacted. This could be connected to the various response strategies employed by Asian businesses, which could differ from those in the US and other parts of the world. Despite all the bad headlines about the pandemic's effects on the real estate industry, a few studies found that the epidemic had a favorable effect on certain segments of the industry. 3870","usman musa1, and wan zahari wan yusoff2 faculty of technology management and business universiti tun hussein onn malaysia parit raja, johor, malaysia wambaimusa@gmail.com, zahari@uthm.edu.my","References

403,Consumer Preferences On Packaging Characteristics: A  Case Of Sme Food Industry,"the present study aims to determine whether there are differences in the preferences of the category groups on the packaging in the food industry. the data collection was conducted by distributing online questionnaires through social media to respondents who had profiles by those determined by their qualifications. the number of respondent data that has been collected is 148 respondents. the research method used is a comparative quantitative method with the kruskal wallis test. the results reveal several important insights. female gender characteristics have different preferences in all packaging design assessments of packaging no 4. income characteristics with a scale of idr 3,000,000-5,000,000 have different preferences in ratings 1 and 2 of packaging no 1. age characteristics with a scale> 35 years have different preferences in all packaging design ratings on packaging no 2. in the selection of suitable packaging colors, there is no significant difference between each group. pastel orange is the color that respondents consider most suitable for the packaging. the research insight can be used as references for companies in the food industry and the theoretical findings in better understanding the consumers.","consumer, preferences, packaging, food",,"stefani anggraini, etsa astridya setiyati, satria fadil persada, mardhatilah shanti, bigraf triangga, febby candra pratama, hera rachmahani, audio valentino himawan marhendra, sahnaz ubud, and mufida sekardhani entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480","references for the form of packaging design. The female gender category group 
has different preferences on packaging design 4, the income category group of IDR 3,000,000 5,000,000 has different 
preferences on packaging design 1, and the > 35-year-old category group has different preferences on packaging 
design 2. Several things affect the differences in preferences of each group of respondents, namely the ways of thinking 
of men and women are different, income that affects different living environments, and generations with different 
perspectives and tastes. 
 
Based on the research results that have been carried out, the enterprise made several decisions as follows: 1) the female 
gender category group prefers packaging design 4, which means the enterprise must develop a packaging design four 
because 60% of the enterprise's consumers are women. 2) the income category group on a scale of Rp.3,000,000-
5,000,000 has different preferences for packaging design 1. The income category group has a preference if the 
packaging design 1 is a packaging that seems expensive and classy and is suitable for sweet potato donut products. 
However, because the enterprise wants to develop packaging designs and colors that are more attractive to consumers, 
preferences from the income category of IDR 3,000,000 - 5,000,000 will be stored as a database of consumers satisfied 
with the current 80 enterprise packages. 3) the age category group >35 years has different preferences for packaging 
design two which is shaped like pizza packaging. The enterprise will include packaging design 2 as another option 
because the enterprise consumers with an age scale of >35 years are in the percentage of less than 20%. 4) pastel 
orange color will be taken as the following enterprise packaging design color because most of the respondents chose 
that color as a packaging color that matches the enterprise products. The first thing that can be followed up for the 
enterprise's development and growth regarding packaging design is to hold discussions with partners. The discussion 
is related to packaging design 4, which follows the preferences of the female gender category, whose percentage is 
more than half of the enterprise's consumers. Then after a joint decision is made, the packaging will be made. 4. After 
the packaging is made, it will be executed by conducting a market test, which will be used as product packaging based 
on the preorder made. From the market test, consumers will be given a questionnaire regarding the new enterprise 
packaging, and if from the questionnaire, the packaging does not meet consumer expectations, further research will 
be carried out on which parts are not suitable and which target segment feels the packaging not suitable. However, the 
researcher will not immediately decide to re-create the packaging from the research results but will focus on more 
detailed follow-up research on packaging design. With the packaging design research that has been carried out, it is 
hoped that the enterprise can develop product packaging that is suitable for Cilembu sweet potato donuts, which look 
expensive and classy and are able to attract consumer buying interest based on the characteristics of the target segment 
of the enterprise. The expected research is to be input that can support the growth of the enterprise's business in terms 
of packaging. Further, it will come following consumers' expectations in developing the enterprise's business. 
  
Recommendations that the author can give for similar businesses that are also engaged in the bakery sector are the 
first. As a businessman in the bakery sector, the packaging is an important thing that must be designed as attractively 
as possible to attract consumers' attention other than the product's function. Sometimes many businesspeople in the 
bakery sector think that plastic packaging and logo stamps are enough as long as the products they make are delicious. 
The color and the design of the packaging are essential to attract consumers. Second, segmentation must be clearly 
and precisely defined based on the research results conducted by researchers. Gender groups, income scales, and ages 
have different preferences for several packaging designs but have the same preference for the color of the packaging

As long as heritage buildings have building constructions that can still be explored and processed for new functions that can be economically and socially beneficial and do not harm the environment, adaptive reuse is the best option. Through adaptive reuse, managers can take advantage of the nostalgia value stored in buildings. Nostalgia raises motivation for people to reorder or consumption and this give positive side for economic value. Restaurant with its old design was proven attractive all generations, from young to old generations. Referring to this, reuse building with its old design could be a promotion tool for gaining visitors to come. For future research, it is suggested to measure the life satisfaction changing related to interior and exterior design of the building, as well as the stress level reduce after visiting the place (Sedikides and Wildschut 2020). 3890","ade ariyani sari fajarwati and dila hendrassukma interior design department, school of design, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 ade@binus.ac.id, dhendrassukma@binus.edu esther widhi andangsari* faculty member, psychology department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 research interest group cross cultural communication, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 esther@binus.edu* *corresponding author","References

Previous research had explored supplier performance using qualitative and quantitative approach with various techniques and tools. This study found that the previous analysis is limited supplier performance measurement with no further explorations the impact of criteria to supply chain performance. To define supplier performance, it needs supplier criteria definition which was adopted from literature review. This study has explored five supplier criteria involving raw material price, customer care and responsiveness, raw material quality, perfect order fulfilment and on time delivery performance to evaluate supplier performance. A food supply chain that must ensure high quality product with food security standard is adopted for supplier performance analysis. Suppliers of food supply chain are evaluated during the last three months with 216 data pairs. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to evaluate supply chain performance. The result show that most of the supplier performance are inefficient and only 38.8% are efficient. Further, a statistical approach is provided to further improvement in supplier performance which is focused on supplier indicators. Based on statistical analysis this research recommends for food industry to control with raw material price and perfect order fulfilment score to improve supplier performance.

The implication of this study 1 is that the nostalgic memory kept in one's social media is not anything private, but rather something public that others can enjoy. So that modern society can still benefit from the psychological function of nostalgia by using social media as a social media memory.

Manyuchi,"work-life balance is essential in strategic human resources management. this study focused on the evaluation of work- life balance factors: effect of job stress on employees’ well-being, effect of role overload on employee job satisfaction, effect of long working hours on employee morale and effect of work-family on job commitment. the study therefore proposed a statement of problem to look at and identify those irregularities that may come up as a result of poor balance between work and life. the scope of the study was restricted to zimbabwe institute of engineers registered women engineers while the importance was given in line with the benefits to be anticipated by the stakeholders involved in the study. the study was based on the work-life border theory. the methodology adopted was an online google form questionnaire with a likert 6 scale. a random sample with 92 women engineers was used for this study. kruskal- wallis chi-squared test at 95% confidence interval was adopted for the statistical data analysis. statistically it was concluded that: job stress has an effect on women engineers’ well-being, role overload affects women engineers’ job satisfaction, as well as that work-life conflict affects job commitment for women engineers. however, long working hours do not influence women engineers’ morale as long as they are motivated and well resourced. the work-life balance of women engineers must be prioritized.","women engineers, 2021","From the key study objectives on selected work-life balance for women engineers, the study therefore concludes that: Job stress has an effect on women engineer’s well-being. This is alluded to the high demands of the profession which results in work-life imbalance. Role overload affects women engineers’ job satisfaction. Too much work which the women engineers are not in control of makes them lose job satisfaction. Long working hours do not influence women engineer’s morale as well. The presence of flexible working hours in an organization significantly influenced women engineer’s job performance by enabling a balance between personal commitments and responsibilities and organizational roles and their duties. Flexibility in working hours improved women engineer’s motivation and commitment to the organization. Work-life conflict affects job commitment for women engineers. For women engineers to perform optimally they also need a job that caters for their life demands.","department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa mercy.manyuchi@gmail.com r. rusike graduate school of business management, bindura university of science education, zimbabwe rrusike@buse.ac.zw t. n. mutusva department of mathematical sciences, harare institute of technology, zimbabwe tnmutusva@hit.ac.zw n. sukdeo department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa nsukdeo@uj.ac.za",

418,Investigating The Factors That Contribute To The  Implementation Of Business Intelligence In Non-Profit,"one of the uses of business intelligence (bi) in organizations is a non-profit organization in cianjur, where both organizations have implemented bi. it is hoped that bi can help support reporting and fact-based decision-making within the scope of the education sector organization, which ultimately leads to improved organizational performance. the purpose of this study is to find out what factors influence the implementation of bi in non-profit organizations. the research method used is quantitative, which includes the dissemination of questionnaires. the data collected through a questionnaire survey from a sample of 60 people in two non-profit organizations in cianjur district were analyzed through partial least squares - structural equation modeling (pls-sem). the results showed that data management, relative profits, and it infrastructure support significantly influenced in implementation of bi in non- profit organizations. this study provides an understanding of what influences the implementation of bi in non-profit organizations. the main limitation of this research is its focus on the non-profit sector. it is only carried out by two non-profit organizations in cianjur alone, thus limiting its application and ability to be generalized. it is hoped that the findings presented will contribute to a greater understanding of the factors influencing the application of business intelligence for researchers and practitioners to encourage non-profit organizations to be better prepared to implement decision-making through business intelligence. this research also helped offer a dashboard design proposal for bi improvement following the model of the test results.","indonesia, pls-sem",,"organizations: a case study of non-profit organization in cianjur, indonesia via vidya student, magister of industrial engineering, faculty of industrial engineering universitas telkom bandung, indonesia viavidya@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id agus achmad suhendra and ilma mufidah lecturer, magister of industrial engineering, faculty of industrial engineering universitas telkom bandung, indonesia agus@telkomuniversity.ac.id, ilmamufidah@telkomuniversity.ac.id",
419,Continuing Use Behavior Analysis Of Msmes On The Mosan   Digital Platform Using The Utaut2 Model,"this study looks at the adaptation of digital platforms as part of the support for mercy corps timor-leste’s covid-19 recovery for msme program' which targets msmes run by women to increase the ease of transactions, through collaboration with an e-wallet platform named mosan. this study aims to provide an overview of the technology used by empirically analyzing the factors that influence the user behavior of msmes as mosan users. this study uses a quantitative method with a simplified utaut2 model or theory according to the phenomenon under study. the result of this research empirically and descriptively shows the factors influencing msme use behavior finally showing that price value and effort expectancy as independent variables which highly influenced the use behavior positively and significantly towards continuing use behavior of the mosan platform, including the moderate variable of income generated and digital business literacy. in contrast, other independent variables in this research model have not shown a significant effect on the user behavior variable to achieve continuing use behavior, but this research shows the improvement of digital business literacy in 150 msmes because of the intervention of the covid-19 recovery program for msmes that also influencing continuing use behavior of msmes. e-wallet is a new concept of digital platform in timor-leste that still needs system improvements and more development on all the factors that affect its use, such as good governance, infrastructure, capabilities of human resources including msmes themselves in adapting to the uncertain situation of the future business environment.","utaut2, msmes, use behavior","This study reveals that the majority of MSME users of MOSAN in both municipalities, namely Ainaro and Bobonaro (Maliana) use MOSAN after the intervention of the covid-19 recovery for MSME's program which was implemented by Mercy Corps as a form of empowering MSMEs during the covid-19 pandemic. Considered as supporting factors for the use of MOSAN itself which are expressed in UTAUT2 theory are quite relevant, as seen in the results of the analysis shown the effort expectancy and price value variables stronger indicator that influences MSMEs to continuingly using the MOSAN, as well as the two moderating variables studied (income generated and digital business literacy) that emerged. As an indicator seen from the covid-19 recovery for MSME's program, although the UTAUT2 indicator is not fully appropriate or influences the decision to use MOSAN considering the situations and conditions available for the MSMEs studied in Timor-Leste context. This study illustrates that the e-wallet or mobile money, which is a new concept or digital platform in the country of Timor-Leste, still really needs system improvements and more development on all the factors that affect its use, especially among businesspeople or MSMEs business environment themselves during the pandemic. Covid-19 which also significantly changed business behavior and consumer behavior itself, but the intervention of the covid-19 recovery for MSME's program provides its own benefits for MSME actors such as increasing digital business literacy, as reported in (Endline Report Covid-19 Recovery for MSME's Program, 2022). However, this research supported by the results of the report from the final survey of the program which found that 95% of program participants or program beneficiaries said the training helped improve their digital skills and 100% of program participants reported that the training helped improve their financial skills and about 3 of the trainees (32%) made one digital transaction per month since they signed up for a MOSAN account during the training. Excluding frequency of use, approximately 65% of trainees have used MOSAN at least once since the date of their training, but this is slightly different from the transaction data shared by Telemor from the endline survey results, which show that 78% of trainees reported using MOSAN at least once since the training (Endline Report Covid-19 Recovery for MSME's Program, 2022). 7. Proposed Improvements Based on the results of research and analysis, as well as observations made, the researchers recommending to build trust for concepts and technologies that are considered very new such as MOSAN, and expanding on MSMEs in other areas or even the community about the importance of digital literacy and how people in the regions have basic knowledge or digital business literacy so that they are able to adapt to developments and changes that continue to occur in the business world. Meanwhile seeing the actual conditions experienced by MSMEs, Mercy Corps should design a more realistic program to answer the needs of MSMEs in conducting transactions such as facilitating the formation of a market or business relationship circle that facilitates their marketing and supply chain, also there is a need for performance evaluation and improvement during program implementation, as well as preparation and analysis of situations that are more contextualized for program implementation, such as conditions or infrastructure that can facilitate MSMEs in using the digital platform. Digital services such as MOSAN, including the selection of target beneficiaries needs to be increase their marketing skills with specific training for capacity building according to the needs in the field for Telemor marketing staff and agents from MOSAN itself. Further, most important to build a better supporting infrastructure (facilitating Conditions) to support the use of network services and MOSAN itself and designing a better marketing strategy and increasing the number of MOSAN users in accordance with the situation 4027","domingos tilman magister management, faculty of economy and business telkom university, bandung, indonesia domingostilman@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id maya ariyanti, magister management, faculty of economy and business, telkom university, bandung, indonesia ariyanti@telkomuniversity.ac.id dodie tricahyono magister management, faculty of economy and business, telkom university, bandung, indonesia dodietricahyono@telkomuniversity.ac.id","References

Disney seems to have developed to harmonize the various opinions and thoughts that exist on several types of social issues. Disney began to balance presenting a more accurate and relatable portrayal of gender. In addition, through the shift in roles, female viewers can trust their abilities more and are more confident that they can also have the same strengths and opportunities as other male roles that have always been showed to be strong and independent. Not only focusing on the part of the Disney princess who transformed into a leader and leading role in the film. However, now women's supporting roles have also begun to be given the same opportunity to express their opinions and take a stand. Some are rebelling against the leadership system which is always dominated by men's roles. Although the rebellion carried out by female characters tends to be minimal and requires more support, in general, this has progressed significantly for the development of female roles in the next Disney film. Thus, film media, which is considered more effective in gender development, can participate in voicing gender equality to a broader audience. With various findings that have been described in the literature review chapter and evidence in the analysis chapter, the author concludes that in producing its films, Disney always pours out a thought that adapts to the current era or generation. So, their loyal audience can grow together with Disney movies. The first generation seems to have room for nostalgia, while the next generation can perpetuate the values established by Disney. 4091","film department, school of design bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 bella.angellina1718@gmail.com, eimanjaya@binus.edu","References

427,"The Influence Of Financial Literacy, Risk Aversion, And  Persuasion On Insurance Demand","this study examines the influence of financial literacy, risk aversion, mediating effect of persuasion on insurance demand in indonesia. a survey questionnaire was conducted among 240 respondents in the productive age range, around 18 to 45 years old. the result of hypothesis testing was conducted by smart pls 3.0. the result shows that financial literacy and risk aversion were directly and significantly related to persuasion. financial literacy and risk aversion have positive influence towards insurance demand. persuasion significantly mediates the relationship between insurance demand, financial literacy, and risk aversion. financial literacy is directly proportional to the increasing of insurance demand. people tend to buy insurance to avoid risk when they are prone to accidents, have health issues, or to protect their wealth. since insurance provides non-direct benefit where people will get the benefit through some conditions, consumer is needed to be educated, convinced, motivated, and advised to enroll in an insurance policy. further research can be explored in more factors such as different age groups like gen x, gen y, millennials to see the influence of age group on insurance demand. since this research only focus on indonesian people, respondents from other country or region may lead to other findings. political situation, pandemics and geographic factors also can be used to provide more explanation on what factors that influence insurance demand completely.","insurance demand, financial literacy, risk aversion","and Future Research Based on the data analysis results and the formulated hypothesis, it can be concluded that Financial Literacy has a direct positive impact on Insurance Demand. It is in line with He (2020), which states that financial knowledge has a significant positive effect on increasing public demand for insurance. Increased financial knowledge drives higher insurance purchases and increases average annual premiums. Financial knowledge education is also needed to encourage public participation in buying insurance. Risk Aversion directly to Insurance Demand. In purchasing an insurance policy, consumers tend to choose a social insurance policy to avoid risk when there is a vulnerability. These findings are supported by the study of Wilfred (2020), which emphasizes that several individual risk attitudes towards purchasing insurance are (1) regarding their perception of financial risk as health risks, (2) related to exposure to safety and environmental risks, and (3) experience of these incidents. From some of these risks, people will make decisions to avoid risk by buying more insurance compared to people who are less risk averse. Persuasion as a direct mediating variable on Insurance Demand. Insurance is one type of business that is very dependent on persuasion. Prospective buyers of insurance policies will delay their decision to buy insurance without the intervention of insurance agents or influence from others. Insurance policies offer an intangible benefit to their sales. Hence, consumers need to be educated, persuaded, counseled, motivated, and persuaded to act. Low et al. (2021). Meanwhile, Financial Literacy mediates the indirect relationship between Insurance Demand, Risk Aversion, and Insurance Demand. Thus, persuasion will positively impact the relationship between Financial Literacy, Risk Aversion, and Insurance Demand. There are several significant findings from our study. The salient result is that Persuasion is the primary determinant of Insurance Demand. Thus, the influence or recommendations of the people around can increase the demand for insurance. Our results confirm that individuals' expectations of insurance benefits significantly influence insurance desirability or demand. The results obtained from the hypothesis prove that financial literacy, Risk Aversion, and Persuasion affect Insurance Demand. However, in this study, the hypothesis submitted is fulfilled, and each variable has a significant relationship. There are several inputs for improvement and further research. For example, changing the object of research from people of productive age to people in the age range of the millennial, Gen Z, Gen Y, and Baby Boomer categories to see the relationship between age groups and insurance demand. In addition, research on respondents in other areas will undoubtedly be more exciting and produce more varied results. Furthermore, further research is recommended to examine other factors that can affect insurance demand, such as internal factors (gender, educational background, income, age, and type of work) and external factors (macroeconomics, pandemics, politics, and geographical location). This will undoubtedly contribute a lot to businesspeople in the economic industry in sharpening analysis and strategies to create opportunities and attract as many new insurance owners as possible in Indonesia and globally.

Previous studies have identified critical factor for lean implementation. However, there is evidence that indicates a lack of linkage between CSF to sustainable lean performance in a holistic dimension. Due to this phenomenon, thus a comprehensive and priority factor of lean is urged for enhancement of lean adoption and sustainability. The study objective was to validate a survey instrument for the development of a preliminary framework of sustainable lean healthcare performance. A pilot study results present that all measures for the assessment of lean healthcare are important. Thus, all proposed 56 measures that have been categorized into 11 perspectives are suitable to be used for performance measurement of sustainable lean healthcare. In the next step of research, a full survey is recommended to validate the preliminary framework of sustainable lean healthcare performance that covers a different angle of dimensions (economy, environment, social aspect).

The competence of the Ministry of Religion Office Employees of Sragen Regency is included in the good category. This is stated through the average response or opinion of respondents obtained from 10 statement items regarding competence, which is around 71%. In the competency variables, which include the dimensions of knowledge, skills/skills, and attitudes, all three are in the good category, for the highest score is on the attitude dimension and the lowest score is on the skill/skill dimension. 2. Demographics of Employees the Ministry of Religion Office of Sragen Regency has employees who are dominated by male employees, employees aged 40-49 years and aged 50-59 years, employees with education levels of D4-S1 and S2, as well as employees with years of service. 5-6 years and 11–15 years. 3. The performance of the Office of the Ministry of Religion of Sragen Regency is in the good category. This is stated through the average responses or opinions of respondents obtained from 11 statement items regarding performance, which is around 70.15%. The performance variables include the dimensions of quantity, quality, timeliness, effectiveness, independence, and commitment. Of all the dimensions of the performance variable, it is included in the good category, for the highest score is in quantity and quality, with the same score ranging from 71%. Then, for the lowest value of all the dimensions of performance is the dimension of timeliness. 4. a) Based on the results of the analysis conducted using SEM-PLS, it is known that competition has a significant positive effect on the performance of the Office of the Ministry of Religion of Sragen Regency, where the path coefficient is 0.656, which indicates that the direction of the path is positive, so it can be interpreted that the better the competence, the better the employee performance. b). Based on the results of the analysis using PLS-MGA, it is known that the demographics of age and working period significantly positively moderate the influence of competence on the performance of the Ministry of Religion Office employees of Sragen Regency. Meanwhile, demographics based on education level significantly negatively moderated the effect of competence on performance. Then, for the demographic gender, competence is not significant as a moderator of the effect of competence on performance. So, it can be interpreted that the difference in gender between men and women does not have a role to play in moderating the influence of competence on the performance of the Ministry of Religion Office Employees of Sragen Regency.","of religion of sragen regency wulan hilmi rochmawati student of magister management faculty of economis and business telkom university bandung, jawa barat, indonesia wulanhilmirochmawati@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id dian indiyati lecturer of magister management faculty of economis and business telkom university bandung, jawa barat, indonesia dianindiyati@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

453,Application Of A Zone-Based System In A Short Film  Production During Covid-19 Pandemic,"undertaking film production during the covid-19 pandemic made some crews feel afraid and uncomfortable while working because many crews still did not follow health protocols and social distancing. in this research, the authors try to apply a zoning system at the shooting location. according to research that the authors have done, there are still crews who do not understand what a zone-based system is, how it is implemented, and how many do not comply with the protocol. in this research, the authors want to try to improve the existing zoning system to be even better to prevent and break the chain of transmission of covid-19 at the shooting location of the short film budak bidak.","covid-19, film production, pandemic, short film","During the covid-19 pandemic, a regional quarantine was imposed that required everyone to stay at home. Many industries are affected, one of which is the film sector. Filming was delayed, and many were canceled. As time passed, the government began allowing filmmakers to film with strict health protocols and some other conditions. However, many crews still feel scared and uncomfortable when they are on location because they still do not follow strict health protocols and do not keep their distance from other crews. Implementing a zone-based system or zoning at the filming location is done to avoid crowding the crew. Usually, filming locations are divided into several zones. Zone A is the most extensive zone because its actors are required not to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and not to keep a distance. Zone B is a zone for the crew directly related to Zone A. Zone C is a zone for the production team that does not work on set. This zone serves as a base for all crews not directly related to the set and a basecamp for the entire department to store their respective tools. In its work, many still do not understand what a zone-based system is, how it is applied and many crews do not comply with it. Implementing the zone system at the Budak Bidak filming location went well and smoothly. Although the producer experienced several obstacles in applying this zone system, the producer dealt with the problem well. Although it was well planned during pre-production related to this zone system, in its implementation, the producer had to adapt to the conditions on location. In this research, the authors want to try to improve the existing zone-based system to be even better. The implementation of a zone-based system was then applied at the filming location of the short film Budak Bidak to prevent and break the chain of transmission of the Covid-19 virus at the location of the short film filming and also to answer the research questions of this research. The research question for this study is “How can the application of a zone-based system in the production of short films be made to create a safe shooting location during a pandemic?” After making a case study of the short film Budak Bidak, the authors can answer the research question. The implementation of a zone-based system can be done well if there is a more detailed explanation related to the zone system itself, making information about the zone system, the producer making a map of the location of the zone, and whoever is the crew in each zone, making zone writings such as zone A, zone B, and zone C are then attached to each zone, and control all crews on duty to comply with the zone system. After two days of applying the system, the 4367","nadya maharini and azalia muchransyah film program, school of design bina nusantara university tangerang, banten, indonesia nadya.maharini@binus.ac.id, azalia.primadita@binus.ac.id","References

459,Factors Influencing Fresh Food Purchase Intention At  Online Store On E-Marketplace – A Mediation Effect Of,"e-marketplaces are tangible manifestations of the development of technology and communication. unlike in the past when people tended to be skeptical of buying products online, nowadays some e-marketplace sites have recorded dramatic numbers of visitors. the covid-19 pandemic also encourages an increase in online purchase activities. today's online sellers also sell fresh food products such as fruit and vegetables in their online store on the e-marketplace. this becomes interesting to study considering the commonly believed risk of getting not-so- fresh products with the fact that fresh food’s quality might deteriorate while in transit. based on the theory of planned behavior (tpb), this quantitative study with convenience sampling is to determine the impact of three major predictors of the theory on the intention to purchase fresh food products at online stores on e-marketplaces. besides, online trust in store (otis) is used to mediate the two constructs of subjective norm (online review and peer communication) on purchase intention. through responses from 228 respondents from indonesia, analyzed using pls-sem, findings indicate that subjective norms and perceived behavioral control have no significant influence on purchase intentions. it was also found that otis was successful in mediating the two constructs of subjective norm on purchase intention.","tpb, purchase intention, fresh food, subjective norm",,"online trust in store jennifer aidrin student in master’s management program binus business school bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia jennifer.aidrin@binus.ac.id liuswandi student in master’s management program binus business school bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia liuswandi@binus.ac.id evi rinawati simanjuntak faculty member in master’s management program binus business school bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia esimanjuntak@binus.edu",

The test results show that liquidity positively affects the disclosure of corporate social responsibility. However, institutional ownership and risk minimization do not affect corporate social responsibility disclosure. Future research can examine other ownership structures, such as foreign and government ownership. Further researchers can also investigate other than the risk management committee, namely the sustainability committee. This research contributes to practice. The company should increase its level of liquidity so that it has more funds to disclose social responsibility. Investors could invest their funds in companies with a high level of liquidity and CSR disclosure.","disclosure cahyaningsih cahyaningsih school of economics and business, telkom university, bandung, west java, indonesia cahyaningsih@telkomuniversity.ac.id fiska dela mustapa school of economics and business, telkom university, bandung, west java, indonesia fiskadelamustapa29@gmail.com",

468,Plough Scraper And Tilting Device On Conveyor Belts  Mpho Cacious Makutu,south african mining industry is struggling with quick methods of structural change set ups. this is also a challenge even in temporary set ups and installation. most mining materials are handled/moved using conveyor belts. these conveyor belts are reducing downtimes and increases operating cost due to higher maintenance and breakdowns. a study for different equipment making up a complete conveyor belt was conducted to learn more about this equipment and their behaviour. advantages and disadvantages were noted in studying different types. causes of failures with recommended maintenance and operating methodologies were also noted on the research made in the past. conveyors systems can be very dangerous especially when in operations. protective devices and methods are also noted and advised. plough scraper and tilting device are also researched as they provide a cheaper method of transferring materials or offloading a conveyor system either temporarily or permanently. history of scrapers and tilting device is also observed to further understand the background in contribution to recommending the best suitable solution to scrap off materials either in a tilted method or non-tilted scraping off from a moving conveyor. all of the equipment making up the conveyor belts including the tilting and scraping systems contributed to coming up with a very successful method of scraping or offloading a moving conveyor in a reasonable time and cost without major modifications as before this technology was discovered.,"tilting, plough, scraping","The objective was to acquire more information on the challenges, recommendations from past researchers and best ways to avoid failures on system equipment of Tilting Device and Plough Scraper. This included the history and other Plough Scrapers and Tilting Devices previously used and any other similar method to remove material from a moving conveyor into a new line or destination. The method of using Tilting Device and Plough Scraper was proven to be efficient and cost effective before and after being put into practice in Exxaro Grootegeluk Mine. Improvements can be made to adjust some smaller grey areas on the system. It can also be rolled out as it works better comparing to the effort and cost of using the traditional transfer tower method. More research can assist in improving this set up. Because the Tilting Device is rarely used, results obtained are good for a scarce system of this nature. This is less complicated and more ideal for the mining environment since complexity is not ideal. Ease of maintenance and operation is also evident on this Tilting Device and Plough Scraper. The only maintenance will be on the scraper of the plough, liners on the plough and flattening rollers on the tilting device. Time taken to design and install the system is also effective and economical. It takes lesser time to design and install this system with no alternative supplies or penalties to consider when installing this system. The customers remain undisrupted during this construction. The opportunity that rose to supply power station coal to other mines other than the ones currently supplied via directs belts was solved without an impact. Now coal is supplied to other users for additional income. This can open the market to supply even more customers for better profit. With this operational the mine does not depend on the current bigger customers being Eskom Matimba and Medupi. Some contracts can emerge from the ability to supply more from the current system. The scraper suppliers are to be involved when designing this kind of system. Scraper suppliers might not have supplied this kind of systems but have supplied a return belt scraper on the conveyor belts. Return belt scrappers work similar as this but they will just focus more of this kind of objective. Carry back scraping experience gives better insight to contribute to this 4539","student, department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, doornfontein, south africa cashmpipo@gmail.com daramy vandi von kallon senior lecturer, department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, doornfontein, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za","References

469,Method Of Operation Of A Plough And Tiling Device  Designed For Coal Mining,"operating a plough scraper and a tilting device should be very easy and safe. as much as the installation and maintenance is cheaper it does not require too much for both operation and maintenance. some systems are automated with the plant and needs no operator to operate manually. non-automated systems need only 1 operator of part time basis to operate and only when the system is engaged or in lowered position. interlocking for the 2 conveyors was ensured to protect the system from blockages and spillages. once the scraper is lowered material is being scraped from the 4000 tpa conveyor to the 2000 tpa conveyor. the rest becomes just monitoring with no physical contact to the running system. when scraping is completed, the plough is lifted to allow material to pass straight to another feed being eskom medupi feed line. the system is easy to operate with 4 main buttons being tilting device lifting and lowering, plough scraper lifting and lowering. once the tilting device is lifted and plough lowered interlock kicks in to reduce the feed from the 4000 tpa. once the tilting device is lowers with plough lifted the interlocks is eliminated to now feed 4000 tpa.","tilting device, plough, scraping material, crushed",The operation of the Plough Scraper and Tilting Device on the Conveyor is very simple and straight forward. Once the system starts no other activities are expected except monitoring. Once the system stops no activities are required except inspection to ensure all is in good order. No additional employees were added with this system. The operation is the simplest with only 4 buttons being Plough Scrapper up and down and Tilting Device up and down. Everything else is automated and interlocked to kick in when required. 4551,"mpho cacious makutu student, department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, doornfontein, south africa cashmpipo@gmail.com daramy vandi von kallon senior lecturer, department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, doornfontein, south africa dkallon@uj.ac.za","References

472,"The Effect Of Social Media Marketing Towards Purchase  Decision Mediated By Brand Awareness, And Willingness To","this paper aims to examine whether social media marketing activities plays an important role upon creating purchase decision, and the effects if mediated by brand awareness and willingness to buy. in addition, if income and educational level can amplify the effects towards purchase decision. causal relationships between hypothesized variables are related to each other so as to form a structural equation model (sem) with one exogenous variable, three endogenous variables, and two moderating variables. convenient sampling method was used to obtain 200 samples of ordinal data derived from respondents' assessments of 27 survey items with a scale of five. respondents from this study were taeyang culture students whose entry was allegedly due to the influence of social media marketing activities. the decision of prospective students to join taeyang culture is strongly influenced by the dimensions of smmas which include interactivity, informativeness, personalization, and trendiness. this effect is more effective, especially if the smma is more directed at prospective students who are highly educated and have high incomes. this research refines previous research that has not considered environmental aspects in the model, namely income level and education level which strengthen the desire of prospective students to decide to join taeyang culture.","brand awareness, willingness to buy","The effect of social media marketing activities (SMMA) on purchase decision (PD) is explained by the significance of direct influence, indirect effect, and total effect. The direct effect is the effect without a mediating variable, while the indirect effect is the effect through the mediating variables, namely brand awareness (BA) and willingness to buy (WB). The total effect is the sum of the direct and indirect effects. In the end, the magnitude of the total influence is also corroborated by education level (EDU) and income level (INC) which moderate the influence of WB on PD. All question items belonging to each indicator are valid and reliable, as well as the research model that has been built, has met the goodness of fit requirements. Marketing activities using social media have been proven to be able to encourage prospective participants to decide to join the training program, but the encouragement will become even stronger because these activities increase one's awareness of Taeyang Culture (BA) and willingness to participate in the training program (WB). The more effective the SMMA activities, the higher the BA and WB, and the higher the BA and WB in the end the higher the PD. Meanwhile, the rise and fall of BA in addition to affecting WB and PD in the same direction so that because WB also has a positive effect on PD, finally BA has a greater total effect on PD. In other words, it can be concluded that BA and WB as mediating variables have contributed to increasing the influence of SMMA on PD. The income level (INC) and education level (EDU) of the parents of students strengthen a prospective student who is willing to participate in deciding to take part in the Taeyang Culture (PD) training program. For academics, this research contributes an alternative model of increasing purchase decision originating from marketing activities through corporate social media by including BA and WB multi mediation variables, and multi moderating variables INC and EDU. As for business practitioners, this research provides recommendations on how to encourage Taeyang Culture’s target market to decide to join the program by making the company's social media platforms more effective.dd conclusion here.

475,Verbal Abuse And Gender Discrimination In A Work  Environment (Semiotics Analysis Of Short Film,"sexual harassment is often regarded as taboo because it is a disgrace that must be covered. the existence of patriarchal cultural practices that have been implemented for a long time has made marginalized groups become silenced. entering the development of science and technology that continues to advance, many social figures, institutions, and organizations have begun to fight for women’s rights to live more comfortably through films. researchers analyzed verbal harassment and gender discrimination in the world of work, using the object of a short film entitled please be quiet. researchers use group theory, mass communication and communication, film as a mass medium, and gender discrimination. researchers used roland barthes’ semiotic analysis method with a descriptive qualitative approach and a case study research design. this study aims to understand the meaning of denotation, connotation, the myth of the silent mouth, and the forms of verbal abuse in the film.","analysis, short films, muted group, please be quiet, sexual harassment","Based on the research results of Verbal Harassment and Gender Discrimination in the World of Work (Analysis of Semiotics in the Short Film Please Be Quiet), using Roland Barthes’ semiotic model and interpreting the scene based on denotation, connotation, and myth, the following results are obtained: 1. The meaning of denotation, connotation, and the myth of the silent mouth sign in the short film Please Be Quiet is the situation of Sarah and Putri as victims of sexual harassment by Mr. Benny at work. Mr. Benny is a dominant group who holds the principle of patriarchy in his life, and he believes that the position of men is always above women from all sides, such as social position and position in the workplace. The silent mouth describes the condition of the victims who belong to the marginal group and do not get the opportunity to express their opinions as freely as how men express themselves. The dominant group has several methods of silencing marginal groups, including ridicule based on rituals or culture, controlling to committing violence or sexual harassment. The silence carried out by Mr. Benny is to control and carry out sexual harassment. 2. The form of verbal harassment shown in the short film Please Be Quiet is Quid Pro Quo harassment or something for something, where the harasser offers something to the victim and then asks the victim to give something in return which leads to sexual harassment.","‘please be quiet’) melisa nurfadila student, communication science department faculty of digital communication and hotel & tourism bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 melisa.nurfadila@binus.ac.id frederik masri gasa lecturer, communication science department faculty of digital communication and hotel & tourism bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 frederik.gasa@binus.edu",
476,"Effects Of Ph Level, Temperature In Fish Tank, And  Temperature In Grow Bed On The Growth Of Nile Tilapia","this paper presents an experimental study to determine the effects of ph level, temperature of the tank, and temperature of the grow bed on the length of the nile tilapia and plant height of the romaine lettuce using the automated aquaponics system and to recommend optimal combination of identified factors to maximize their growth. a 23 factorial design with two replicates for sixteen runs was used to perform the experiment and the results were processed using the minitab software. measurement on the length of both the nile tilapia and romaine lettuce was done once a week. the experiment lasted for 112 days. the results indicated that the ph level, temperature in the fish tank, and temperature in the grow bed have great impact on both the growth in length of the nile tilapia and romaine lettuce. it was also found out that the two-way interaction between the temperature in fish tank and temperature in grow bed significantly impact the growth of nile tilapia and romaine lettuce, respectively. using tukey’s test, it was also found out that the higher-level values of the ph level, temperature in fish tank, and temperature in grow bed showed significance when compared to other levels for a one factor, two-way interaction, and three-way interaction. moreover, the optimal values of the ph level, temperature in fish tank, and temperature in grow bed for both the nile tilapia and romaine lettuce were (7.0 ph, 30°c, 27°c), (7.0 ph, 27°c, 27°c), and (7.0 ph, 30°c, 24°c).",ph level,"The results of the experiment using the 23 Factorial Design showed that the pH level, temperature in fish tank, and temperature in grow bed significantly affect the growth of the Nile tilapia and Romain lettuce during the one-week duration of the experiment per treatment combinations. Furthermore, there are also two-way interactions and three- ways interactions of the factors that showed significant results. Moreover, the data of the experiment were subjected to a normality test using the standardized residuals indicating to be less than ±3 sigma which means that the data are normally distributed. After determining significant factors from the ANOVA results for both the Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce, the Tukey’s test was employed to determine which among the levels of the factors showed significance. As found out from the Tukey’s test the higher-level values were significant for the linear factors of the pH level, temperature in the fish tank, and temperature in grow bed. These are the 7.0 pH, 30°C temperature in fish tank, and 27°C temperature in grow bed The higher-value levels were also manifested in the two-way interaction of factors, and three-way interaction of factors. Lastly, three three-way interactions of factors were found to be optimal values for both the Nile tilapia and the Romaine lettuce. Any of this combination of values of the three factors can be used in the actual implementation of growing Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce using the automated aquaponics system. The optimal values of the pH level, temperature in fish tank, and temperature in grow bed were also determined. Three treatment combinations were identified as the optimal values of the pH level, temperature in tank, and temperature in grow bed that will give optimal growth in length of the Nile tilapia and Romaine lettuce, namely, the (7.0 pH, 30°C, 27°C), (7.0 pH, 27°C, 27°C), and (7.0 pH, 30°C, 24°C).","and romaine lettuce in an automated aquaponics system julian clement c. villanueva, alejandro h. ballado, jr. mapua university, school of graduate studies muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines jccvillanueva@mapua.edu.ph, ahballado@mapua.edu.ph/ahballado@mcm.edu.ph rene d. estember school of industrial engineering and engineering management, mapúa university, muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines rdestember@mapua.edu.ph",
477,"Impact Of Organizational Justice, Abusive Supervisor, And  Self-Control On Cyberloafing Behavior During Covid 19","during the covid-19 pandemic, the travel industry was one of the most significantly impacted and the office operation mostly using an internet for their offices activity purpose. therefore, it creates opportunities for employees to use the internet not for office purposes but for their needs. this kind of activity is called as cyberloafing behavior. in the other hand, in indonesia, many company have made rules regarding the prohibition of cyberloafing. cyberloafing behavior often trigged by sense of officer needs like organizational justice, abusive behavior from manager, and self-control of the employees. this study is to analyze the impact of organizational justice, abusive supervisor, and self-control on cyberloafing behavior with work stress as a mediation variable. this study is descriptive research with quantitative method. the sampling technique uses a non-probability sampling with convenience sampling method by distributing questionnaires to 198 employees in travel companies in south jakarta. data were analyzed by using structure equation modeling based on partial least square at 95% confidence level. work stress found as a mediator between organizational justice, abusive supervisor, self-control and cyberloafing behavior, but does not mediate relation between organizational justice, abusive supervisor, and self-control. therefore, organizational justice has a significant influence on cyberloafing behavior.","cyberloafing, organizational, self-control, behavior","The research showed that organizational justice affects cyberloafing behavior. This is based on the results of the hypothesis test where an organizational justice has significant effect on cyberloafing behavior. It means, when employees feel they have been treated fairly in the office, the higher the chances of them to do cyberloafing. This indicates that during the Covid 19 pandemic, travel company employees in South Jakarta on average get good treatment while working in the office. The high use of electronic devices and the internet during the pandemic has made employees working in travel companies able to take advantage of office facilities to cyberloaf at the office when they feel bored or tired due to limited application requests to travel abroad. This is considered fair for travel company employees because they still must work when there is little request for their services during the pandemic. On the other hand, the results of hypothesis test showed that abusive supervisor, self-control, and work stress have not significant effect on cyberloafing behavior. This is because while working during a pandemic, travel company employees when they get abusive treatment by supervisors, they choose to work seriously rather than cyberloaf. Work stress cannot mediate the three variables. This is because there are few applicants who use their services, and their workload becomes more less so that’s why travel company employees feel less stressed about their work. this research was applied to a travel company in South Jakarta during the covid 19 pandemic so that if this research was applied in different places and conditions, it might get different results.","pandemic with work stress as a mediation variable: study on travel companies in south jakarta ashari rahmadi universitas tarumanagara jakarta, indonesia ashari.rahmadi05@gmail.com yenita senior lecturer, faculty of economic and business universitas tarumanagara jakarta, indonesia yenita@fe.untar.ac.id",
478,"Impact Of Employee Training, Work Environment,  Incentives, And Work Disciplines On Employee’S Job","the logistic sector which is engaged in services business relies heavily on its human resources to compete with their competitors. this requires employees who are high performing, disciplined, and have a good work skill. to compete in business world, company must pay attention to their employee’s development. after recruit and develop a high- performance employee, the company must also pay attention to the work environment and consider bonus for remuneration to increase their loyalty and satisfaction. this study is to analyze the impact of employee training, work environment, incentives, and work disciplines on employee’s job performance during covid 19 pandemic through job satisfaction as a mediating role. this study is descriptive research with quantitative method. the sampling technique uses non-probability sampling with purposive sampling method by distributing questionnaires to 187 employees in logistic companies in west jakarta. the data were analyzed by using structural equation modeling (sem) approach based on partial least square (pls) at 95% confidence level. the result is incentives variable has positive and significant influence on job performance and job satisfaction, meanwhile other variables don’t have any significant influence. therefore, incentives found to be an effective way to improve employee’s job satisfaction and job performances on logistic companies in jakarta.","employee, performance, training, satisfaction","This research found that employee training has negative and not significant effect on job performance. Employee training, however, has positive but not significant effect on job satisfaction. Work environment has positive but not significant effect on job satisfaction and job performance. Incentives has a positive and significant impact on job performance and job satisfaction. Work disciplines have a positive but not significant impact on job performance and job satisfaction. This study also found that job satisfaction does not act as a mediator between the independent variables and dependent variable. This research found that in this Covid 19 pandemic time, incentives affect job satisfaction and performance due to persistent inflation and the need for jobs that is very high, so employees are only focused on how to earn more income and be able to meet their needs in these difficult times. Though, this study also has some gaps and suggests the next researchers to study these variables impact on other companies, which has more back-office employee than the operational ones to emphasize the effect on these variables. 4623","performance through mediating role of job satisfaction during covid 19 pandemic: a study on logistic companies in west jakarta johanna tania universitas tarumanagara jakarta, indonesia johannatania12@yahoo.com yenita senior lecturer, faculty of economic and business universitas tarumanagara jakarta, indonesia yenita@fe.untar.ac.id","References

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is measured by the number of additional cases. Meanwhile, the volatility is measured by the increase and decrease in automotive stock prices. Opening and closing of shares for the period of 6 months before and after the Covid-19 case first appeared in Indonesia on March 2, 2020. Meanwhile, Stock Return is measured by Current Income, namely the distribution of dividends and net income and from Capital gain or loss of shares from Increase in closing price of shares for the period of 6 months before and after the Covid-19 case first appeared in Indonesia on March 2, 2020. The results showed that the Stock Return of automotive stocks in Indonesia tended to be negatively affected due to the addition of Covid-19 cases. This may be due to the reduced and sluggish purchasing power of automotive as people are affected by economic conditions due to the Pandemic and prioritize other needs. For stock price volatility variables, the test results show that stock price volatility has a positive effect on stock returns. The precarious situation during the Pandemic that caused public panic is thought to have greatly increased the volatility of stocks at that time, so that high volatility had an impact on stock returns.

484,Student Perceptions Of Blended Learning In Character  Building Courses In Higher Education,"technological advances have an impact on changing the learning system with blended learning with the consequences of diverse student perceptions. this paper aims to map students' perceptions of blended learning in the character- building course and analyze how the binusmaya lms supports the success of blended learning at bina nusanatara university. the data was obtained from online articles and then confirmed by several students as informants in this paper. informants were limited to a few students who had studied several semesters using the blended learning method and were randomly appointed from various majors. in collecting data, the interview guide instrument was used to formulate questions. open-ended questions include three things: first, data related to the effectiveness of learning with blended learning. second, satisfaction with lms binumaya. third, the success factor of the blended learning system. this study found three types of perceptions: first, in general, students were satisfied with the binusmaya lms as a supporter of the blended learning method. second, a small number of them were dissatisfied with the lms due to some technical issues, and third, the students felt quite effective and satisfied but needed improvement in the performance of the binusmaya lms. thus, it is necessary to improve so that the perception of students is happier with the blended learning method.","blended learning, student perception, lms binusmaya","The findings of this study (contrary to previous results) indicate that student satisfaction with the blended learning method supported by LMS Binusmaya in learning Character Building is quite diverse. Most students are quite satisfied with the LMS Binusmaya and feel the method is more effective in the learning process. On the other hand, for a small number of students, they are dissatisfied with the Binusmaya LMS for various reasons, including the Binusmaya application still has many small bugs that reduce the QOL (Quality of Life) of the application, and for the standard mobile application in 2022, Binusmaya mobile can be classified as one that is quite slow in processing data and so on. Thus, one thing that needs to be improved is the optimization of LMS performance in processing data from all business learning activities where the number of students is very large. With this, the quality of the blended learning LMS is very important for the effectiveness of the blended learning method in supporting student academic success. Analysis of student satisfaction perceptions has made two important findings possible. First, the perception of satisfaction with the blended learning method is dynamic and diverse, which shows that even though it has been carefully prepared, there are still obstacles in practice and of course many of these constraint factors, both from the ability of students to use the LMS and can also from external factors that affect the learning process. technically possible. Second, this research also provides a new perspective on the renewal and development of blended learning methods with new technologies, especially related to the Binusmaya LMS. This research is limited to articles and information from social media (whatsapp) for several students, both regular students and Binus online learning (BOL) students. For a more comprehensive or in-depth understanding, further studies are needed which focus more on larger students and in a longer research period based on more complete research variables.","agus masrukhin character building development center, information systems department, school of information systems bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 agus@binus.ac.id",
485,"Overtime Work, Time Management, And Employees' Worklife Balance (A Perspective From Employees At A Human","the overtime work is inherent in business development at this time. the increase in overtime work is expected because employees must complete their work. overtime work is one aspect that causes employees' work-life balance to be imbalanced. the tight time of employee activities needs to have good time management. time management helps employees' activities and work become more focused. employee work-life balance is correlated with employees' ability to cope with work pressure without neglecting personal activities. the development business requires the company to strive to be superior and compete. this phenomenon is a challenge for companies to create competitive human resources. this research aims to determine the influence of overtime work and time management on employees' work-life balance in the human capital division at a bank in west java, indonesia. this research uses a descriptive and quantitative analysis. the data was collected by distributing a questionnaire to the respondent. the data processing technique uses a multiple-liner regression. sampling was done using a non-probability sampling technique, with a total sample of 59 people—research data processing using spss 26.0 software. the research presented that overtime work and time management have a significant positive effect simultaneously and partially on employees' work-life balance.","overtime work, time management, work-life balance","According to the data obtained from 59 respondents, the results conclusions can be described as follows: a. The Overtime Work variable is in the High category. The highest score is in the amount of overtime work dimension. It means employees perceive the amount of overtime as strict frequency and length of overtime work. Then, it is not proportional to the rewards of overtime work obtained. b. The Time Management variable is in the High category. The highest score is in the managing task and works environment dimension. The employees of the Human Capital Division at a Bank in West Java, Indonesia, can manage tasks and work environment well. However, employees still have difficulty setting goals for each activity, affecting priorities. c. The Work-Life Balance variable is in the High category. The most influential in this variable is the Work Interference with Personal Life (WIPL) dimension. This indicates that employees of the Human Capital Division at a Bank in West Java, Indonesia spend more time at work, which impacts or reduces personal life activities. d. The hypothesis testing indicates that Overtime Work and Time Management simultaneously and partially significantly affect the employees' Work-Life Balance in Human Capital Division at a Bank in West Java, Indonesia.","capital division in a bank in west java, indonesia) anne dewi easya and ade irma susanty business administration department, faculty of communication and business, telkom university bandung, west java, indonesia anneeasyaa@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, adeirma@telkomuniversity.ac.id",
