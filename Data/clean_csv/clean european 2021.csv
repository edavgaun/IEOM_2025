0,A Systematic Review Of Indicators Used To Measure  Industrial Sustainability,"the purpose of this paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of the indicators that have been used to measure industrial sustainability. a systematic literature review was conducted to explore indicators published in peer-reviewed articles that are relevant to industrial sustainability performance measurement. a total of 1013 indicators were identified and analyzed: 277 for economic, 402 for environmental and 334 for social dimensions of industrial sustainability. the majority of the indicators were used only once, implying a lack of consistency and consensus on their application for measuring industrial sustainability, and invites an ongoing debate on how sustainability should be measured in different industry contexts. on the other hand, few indicators such as profit, research and development expenditure, product quality, revenue, material cost, labor cost, water consumption, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, material consumption, employment/job opportunity, employee turnover and work-related injuries were consistent and frequently used for measuring industrial sustainability. the consistent indicators have been used to measure industrial sustainability performance associated with financial benefits, costs, market competitiveness, resources, emissions, wastes, employees, customers, and the community. this paper provides a comprehensive view of indicators considering the triple bottom line dimensions of sustainability. it will contribute to future academic and practitioner work on the measurement of industrial sustainability performance.","indicator, triple bottom line",,"azemeraw tadesse mengistu and roberto panizzolo department of management and engineering university of padova vicenza 36100, italy azemerawtadesse.mengistu@phd.unipd.it, roberto.panizzolo@unipd.it","references, Journal of Cleaner Production, vol. 229, no., pp. 640-651, 2019.

1,Integration Of Freight Distribution Services:   A Case Study In Indonesia,"transportation modes, as part of the freight distribution system, have a vital role in the sending of parcels from consignor to consignee. in indonesia, transportation activities between cities or provinces are dominated by trucks which cause road damage and congestion; this has implications in terms of the freight distribution bottlenecks. by contrast, trains have greater capacity, time delivery certainty, and cost-efficiency. however, trains only cover the freight distribution from station to station, which necessitates the double handling process; this means that the consignors-consignees must place and pick up the parcels at the train station. the lack of connectivity causes logistics service providers (lsps) and consumers to choose trucks for freight distribution. thus, this study proposes the framework of integrated freight distribution systems using a case study approach. this study highlights technology as a tool for integrating freight distribution services for all stakeholders, including the train company, retailers, and lsps. process synchronization and information sharing among stakeholders must be encouraged to produce seamless distribution performance.","transportation, freight, distribution, integration",,"reslyana dwitasari, suci susanti, and zusnita meyrawati ministry of transportation jakarta, indonesia reslyana.dwitasari@dephub.go.id sucielsalim@gmail.com n1899ra@gmail.com munawir bangsawan milenialinstitute.id jakarta, indonesia munawirbangsawan@gmail.com yandra rahadian perdana department of industrial engineering - faculty of science and technology universitas islam negeri sunan kalijaga yogyakarta, indonesia yandra.perdana@uin-suka.ac.id",
2,The Soft Side Of Qfd: A Comparative Study On Customer  Requirements’ Prioritization In The Food Sector,"despite its large popularity, the quality function deployment (qfd) method has been the object of numerous studies addressing the problem of the assessment and prioritization of customer requirements. nevertheless, a comparative analysis of these approaches to investigate their practical usability is scarcely discussed. this paper aims at filling this gap by means of a practical case study at a manufacturer in the food sector, where five of the most common approaches used to augment the house of quality (hoq) were analyzed and the results were compared. to achieve such a goal, semi-structured questionnaires were developed to capture consumers’ preferences and expectations. the outputs of this study contribute to a better understanding of the potential and limitations of the examined approaches in order to address practitioners and companies in decision-making processes and resources allocation. moreover, the article can serve as a reference for further investigations in the development of food products, where both intrinsic and extrinsic qualities need to be addressed.",kano model,"Despite its global diffusion and large use, the QFD methods present some limitations especially concerning the evaluation and the prioritization of customers’ needs. This article proposed a comparative analysis of some of the most well-known approaches that are used to address such a problem utilizing a practical case study at a company operating in the food sector. The results achieved have brought to light the different potentials of such approaches in maximizing the benefits of the HoQ and reducing its “softness”, which mainly relies on the difficulties arising from the dependency on the human assessment abilities, i.e. the problem of transforming qualitative judgments into quantitative values by means of an ordinal scale. In summary, our study provides practical insights in addressing the use of the HoQ and several of its supporting approaches to better understand and prioritize customers’ needs through a case-based research.

3,Inventory Model For Raw Material: A Case Study Of A  Chemical Company,"proper management of inventories within any company is important because they represent an asset with considerable investment and mishandling generates waste. within the types of inventories, there are raw materials takes, which require greater control, since their proper planning depends on the subsequent activities of the supply chain. by making a situational diagnosis at the company under study it was determined that there were economic losses due to inventory obsolescence in the warehouse, delays in deliveries which led to fines and claims, demonstrating the need to apply an inventory model that allows to reduce its costs and meet delivery deadlines. it starts by classifying inventories according to their level of importance with respect to the level of sales, in order to determine which of them are the most demanded by customers. the dispersion of the data is analyzed to form the database and look for outliers. the demand forecast was made with the statistical package for the social sciences (spss) and r version 3.6.2, specifically with the package nnfor for neural networks. for the planning of the stock keeping unit (sku) it is done with the models silver meal (sm), wagner whitin (ww) fragmented period balance (bfp); determining an optimal result with a reduction of 57,89%, compared to the value of placing a monthly order during the period.","inventory model, abc classification, demand forecast, silver meal","1. With the theoretical basis and fundamentals in inventory management, specifically with the heuristic models for inventory planning was achieved stent the model application that best suits the company under study. 2. The ABC classification of inventories allowed to establish the SKU that generate the most sales, conformers by 78,82%, 16,66% and 4,62% of categories A, B and C, respectively. 3. The forecasting data showed high dispersion in orders, leading to the application of heuristic methods. 4. Forecasting demand over neural networks provided an average MSE of 0,0075, allowing to create a forecast closer to the reality of the company. 5. From the application of the Silver Meal, Wagner Whitin and Fragmented Period Balance inventory models resulted in a total inventory cost of $3 788,94, $3 706,68, and $3,831.43 respectively; from the contrast of the three models, Wagner Whitin's method presented the largest savings, with 57,89%.

5,Safety Management Of The Characterization Activities Of  Illegal Dumpsites,"due to the ever-increasing amount of industrial waste, illegal dumpsites have been spreading out both in well-being and developing countries. therefore, research and remediation programs have been promoted worldwide in order to limit the negative impact on both the environment and public health of uncontrolled waste disposal. accordingly, a great attention has been paid to environmental aspects of remediation activities in contaminated sites and a consistent legislative framework to deal with environmental concerns was stated. however, in such a context occupational health and safety (ohs) issues related to the operators that have to deal with the remediation activities of this type of sites are not considered sufficiently. as a matter of fact, planning suitable safety measures to prevent workers from injuries and professional diseases is essential. that is particularly true during the characterization activities, when workers can be subjected to the direct contact with the polluted environment and are not completely aware about the pollution’s entity and type. hence, this study aims at reducing such a gap, providing a general framework to plan safety during characterization activities, starting from a case-study and the analysis of iso 45001 approach.","illegal dumping, safety management, iso 45001",,"mara lombardi1, quintilio napoleoni2, francesca mauro2, mario fargnoli1 1department of chemical engineering materials and environment (dicma) 2department of civil, building and environmental engineering (dicea) sapienza - university of rome via eudossiana 18, 00184 - rome, italy mara.lombardi@uniroma1.it, quintilio.napoleoni@uniroma1.it, francesca.mauro@uniroma1.it, mario.fargnoli@uniroma1.it simona berardi department of technological innovations and safety of plants, products and anthropic settlements (dit) italian national institute for insurance against accidents at work (inail) via roberto ferruzzi 38-40, rome, italy s.berardi@inail.it","References

6,Sustainable Introduction Of Industry 4.0:   A Systematic Literature Review,"the introduction of industry 4.0 and the associated digital transformation present great challenges for many companies. such a project poses a danger to companies insofar as the technologies themselves are very often available and applicable, but their successful introduction requires great skill in change management. at the same time, companies and their manufacturing systems should be designed in such a way that they are successful in the marketplace for the long term. at present, there are already efforts in the direction of methods, roadmaps and strategies for the introduction of industry 4.0. however, only a few of these methods explicitly deal with the long-term sustainable implementation of industry 4.0.. therefore, the aim of this work is an analysis of current methods for the introduction of industry 4.0, which focuses on long- term sustainability in the redesign of systems. a systematic literature review provides a methodology for identifying relevant work in the scientific literature. subsequently, the methods found are compared with each other and limits and gaps in the literature are discussed.","industry 4.0, sustainability","In this contribution, we analyzed the scientific literature regarding the methods and tools for a long-term sustainable introduction of Industry 4.0. According to the research question, we looked into scientific works, in our case Scopus database, to find methods that already deal with the introduction of Industry 4.0 to sustain SMEs. At this moment, we have to clarify that, the study is not about investigating how to implement sustainability in Industry 4.0, but much more how to implement Industry 4.0 in companies so that companies are more sustainable!. Based on the advantages of SLR for this study we selected SLR as the research methodology. By using the SLR approach, we identified 13 works that propose methods and frameworks to improve the way of introducing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing. The content analysis and results of this investigation showed us, that there are several concepts and methods that, each by itself, is helping a system designer to improve the manufacturing system, but there is missing a comprehensive approach for designing and implementing small and medium manufacturing enterprises that are sustainable for the long-term. In the future, this lack in scientific literature should be closed by developing a methodology within the below acknowledged research project.

9,Multi Depot Traveling Repairmen Problem With Time  Windows: A Mathematical Model And A Metaheuristic,"with the rapid growth in e-commerce and virtual markets due to the covid-19 pandemic, customer satisfaction due to logistics activities has become more imperative than ever. the traveling repairman problem (trp), which is also known as the cumulative traveling salesman problem, the deliveryman problem and the minimum latency problem, is a special variant of the traveling salesman problem (tsp). all these problems differ in their objective function criteria. in tsp, the total cost (distance or time) of the salesman is minimized. in the case of the trp, the total latency (waiting time or delay time) of all customers is minimized. ultimately, with trp, customer satisfaction is maximized through minimizing the total latency. this paper focuses on a generalized version of trp with multi depots and time windows, namely multi depot traveling repairman problem with time windows (mdtrptw). a group of homogeneous repairmen initiate and finish their visit tours at depots. each customer must be visited exactly by one repairman within their provided earliest end latest times, defined as their time windows. to the best of our knowledge, there is no study in the literature on this problem. in this paper, in addition to posing the problem, we propose a mixed integer programming model for mdtrptw with o(n2) integer decision variables and o(n2) constraints. mdtrptw is an np-hard challenging combinatorial optimization problem. in order to find near optimal solutions within a reasonable computational time for realistic sized dimensions, we also propose a biogeography-based optimization algorithm as a metaheuristic approach. the performance of our formulation and metaheuristic are analyzed by solving instances with time windows from other problems in the literature that are adapted for mdtrptw. we observe that our proposed formulation is able to solve small and moderate size problems in reasonable times. the efficacy of the metaheuristic solution approach is evaluated in terms of solution quality as well as computation time. the developed metaheuristic approach is able to solve problems with 300 customers within seconds. moreover, when contrasted with the exact solution methodology, the proposed metaheuristic algorithm represents a high performance to find good quality solutions within acceptable cpu times for large-size problems. the main contribution of this paper is to define and to present a mathematical model for the multi depot traveling repairman problem with time windows. in addition, to propose a metaheuristic approach for this problem.","multi depot, time windows, italy",,"gozde onder uzun, berna dengiz and imdat kara industrial engineering department baskent university ankara, turkey gonder@baskent.edu.tr, bdengiz@baskent.edu.tr, ikara@baskent.edu.tr oya ekin karasan industrial engineering department bilkent university ankara, turkey karasan@bilkent.edu.tr",
10,Does Payout Policy Affect Firms’ Performance? Evidence  From Textile Industry In India,"this paper made an inquiry to whether dividend-paying firms are more efficient compared to their non-dividend paying counterparts. to achieve the same, we have employed a non-parametric frontier estimation technique, data envelopment analysis (dea), on the selected dataset of 73 firms from the textile industry in india. our result shows that non-dividend-paying firms are 11.17% less efficient in their performance compared to dividend-paying firms. further analysis indicates that efficient firms have better corporate governance compared to inefficient non- dividend-paying firms. furthermore, the non-parametric test “ kruskal-wallis” reveals that there is a significant difference of about 5.15 % between “high corporate governance dividend paying firms” compared to “low corporate governance non-dividend paying firms”.","payout policy, firm performance, dea","Empirical studies in different countries' contexts show that dividend payout reduces agency cost and information asymmetry between different stakeholders. A firm with lower agency conflicts and a lower information asymmetry between different stakeholders should perform better compared to the others. We find that this is indeed the case, and dividend-paying firms have better efficiency (with a mean difference of 11.17%) compared to their non-dividend counterparts. Further test results show that a dividend-paying firm with better corporate governance performs better in terms of efficiency (with a mean difference of 5.15%) compared to their non- dividend paying firms with poor corporate governance. Strangely, the mean difference between dividend and non- dividend paying firms have reduced when the corporate governance indicator is also factored in (mean difference between the two groups reduces from 11.17% to 5.15%). The probable explanation for this may be that a) either the effect of corporate governance has been suppressed by the effect of payout policy on firm performance or, b) the effect of corporate governance on firm performance is opposite to what is expected. But one has to dig this question further before reaching any conclusion. We leave this question open-ended for a future analysis on this observation.

11,Investigation For A Sustainable Use Of Fossil Coal Through  The Dynamics Of Interaction Of Smokeless Solid Fuel With,"one of the ways to solve the problem of environmental protection in the fuel/metallurgical sectors of the economy is the introduction of new complex technological processes, which can be implemented by the principle of energy- chemical-technological processing of carbon raw materials. it involves the extraction of valuable chemical components in the form of coke oven gas, benzene hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulphide, coal tar, ammonia, as well as the production of solid product with new properties. a technology for the production of smokeless solid fuel from a mixture of gas coal (80%) and coal wastes (20%) has been developed. comparative studies of the kinetics of combustion have been carried; the dependence of the rate of interaction of coke residues of anthracite, highly metamorphosed coal, low-metamorphosed coal and smokeless solid fuel with oxygen of air was obtained. the characteristics of anthracite, high-metamorphosed coal, low-metamorphosed coal and smokeless solid fuel combustion dynamics are obtained, which allow further determination of the reactivity of the carbonaceous substance of the fuel. the developed technology of production of smokeless carbon fuel offers the opportunity to use carbon wastes and improve environmental performance. according to the results of industrial experiments, the optimal quality indicators of smokeless solid fuels recommended for ferroalloy industries were established at ferroalloy enterprises.",coal,"The technology of production of smokeless carbon fuel has been developed during this research work. The result of the processing is lumpy carbon fuel, which has a homogeneous solid structure, high combustion and mechanical strength, high reactivity, high speed and complete combustion of the fuel particles. Proposed technology offers the opportunity to reutilise carbon wastes and improve environmental indicators of the air pollution. Smokeless lumpy carbon fuel has several advantages over other types of fuel: combustion of fuel particles in high-temperature zones − more than 8000C – transfer combustion mode to a phase close to exterior diffusion. Based on the obtained experimental/industrial results, the optimum quality indicators of smokeless solid fuels recommended for ferroalloy industries were established and successfully tasted.","oxygen yevgen zbykovskyy iryna shvets donetsk national technical university pokrovsk, 85300, ukraine zeixtt@gmail.com irina_shvets13@ukr.net oksana turchanina antónio castelbranco ciaud – research centre of architecture, urbanism, design lisbon school of architecture, university of lisbon, lisbon, 1349-063, portugal oksana.turchanina@fa.ulisboa.pt aacastelbranco@gmail.com",
12,Exploring Mobile Banking Adoption Through Causal-Loop  Diagrams,"the increasing quest for market share and efficiency in today’s banking sector is adding to the complexity to that particular industry. this work aims to explore and model customer adoption behaviour on mobile banking using a systems thinking approach, in particular, qualitative modelling using causal loop diagrams. this method has been integrated with a grounded theory approach to identify the variables and their relationships from the literature review of relevant studies. the relationships between the variables were used to draw up causal loop diagrams. five different perspectives were drawn from the literature to develop the diagrams through several iterations and discussions. the diagrams were brought together and analyzed to provide a proposal for effectively managing adoption in the mobile banking industry.","technology adoption, innovation, systems thinking",,"pan zhang, raúl leal ascencio and giles poulsom centre for systems engineering university college london 3 taviton st, london wc1h 0bt r.leal@ucl.ac.uk",
13,Developing A Methodology For Category Management In  Manufacturing Companies,"‘category management’ term has been used in manufacturing companies for over 10 years, but its methodology has not been clearly defined yet. traditional category management (cm) originated in retail and it is obvious that the whole set of its tools is impossible to apply to the purchases of industrial companies due to a number of specific restrictions: some of the goods purchased by a manufacturing enterprise are modified in the process of production, and the others are acquired not for external, but for the needs of company internal consumer. therefore, it is necessary to make a number of clarifications in the methodology of cm for manufacturing companies concerning the process framework, toolkit and implementation guidelines. in this regard, we proposed a fundamentally new concept of ‘category approach’. by analyzing the theory of traditional cm, the practice of manufacturing cm and summarizing the experience of russian industrial companies we outline the methodology of ‘category approach’ and its toolkit and implement these findings in a big russian metallurgical company. the questions that arouse in the course of implementation made us develop a new strategic decision-making tool, which was successfully tested during the project.",supply management,"Marketing tools used in retail CM are not appropriate for applying category approach in manufacturing companies effectively. It is necessary to have specially developed process framework, tools, guidelines and templates. We developed CM process framework and toolkit that helped us implement category approach in a big Russian metallurgical company, which led to considerable savings opportunity. Russian companies do have some specific PSM features, and its supply markets differ from those of other countries, but the methodology developed is based on general purchasing and CM theory, so it can be applied universally. During the project we found that some existing managerial tools, like Kraljic matrix, need to be adopted for industrial companies use: made more formalized, quantified. There is also necessity to formalize justification of strategic solutions. So we developed a new quantified supplier selection model based on Kraljic matrix, that combines risk assessment and cost reduction objectives. The model was tested on one category, which led to the most considerable savings. Probably some new tools should be developed specially for category approach in manufacturing companies.

18,The Impact Of Digitalization On The Define Phase Of The Six  Sigma Methodology,"the progressing digitalization not only has an impact on the technical infrastructure of companies but also on the implementation of improvement projects. six sigma is a well-tried and widely spread method for structured conduction of improvement projects. the structured approach is due to the division into the phases define, measure, analyze, improve and control. it is assumed that digitalization will have differently pronounced impacts on these phases. for this, the purpose of this paper is to determine possible changes that may affect the define phase of the six sigma methodology as a result of digitalization. for the realization of the research objective, expert interviews as a method of qualitative investigation have been selected. therefore, interviews with seven experts in the field of six sigma with different training and experience levels were conducted. results indicate, that according to the experts’ assessment, the define phase is only affected by minor changes caused by digitalization. they emphasize that the define phase is characterized by human-supported working methods. digitalization offers the chance of a more precise problem and target descriptions due to better data availability.","six sigma, digitalization","about costumer requirements could be drawn from stored usage behavior. However, two of the experts believe that VOC will continue to be human-made, as direct personal communication is necessary to determine actual customer requirements. The same insight and argumentation also apply to the CTQ tree as the method also deals with customer requirements. According to expert opinions, digitalization can potentially be useful if the creation of the CTQ tree can be made easier and more valid based on better data. On average, the potential of digitalization in VOC is rated as rather low. Furthermore, the experts were asked to what extent an automation of the Define phase is feasible. All experts consider an automation of the Define phase to be impossible. It can be assumed that the Define phase will retain its form and necessity in future. There may only be potential to automate some of these areas. For example, an automated warning system could be implemented that determine defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and point out problems. This would allow reliable predictions of process quality and data-based assessments of the urgency of improvement projects based on early indicators. But the addition of digitalization has technical and supporting character and does not replace the methods. The still human-driven methods such as the project charter or stakeholder management will in future rely on automatically-collected data in the reactive approach of Six Sigma but as a supporting aid. Only the combination of humans and machines can Six Sigma develop its full potential. Six Sigma is a problem-solving technique that, despite automated support, ultimately still primarily requires human communication. Full automation would mean that interactive and interdisciplinary collaboration in improvement projects would be increasingly lost. This is neither desirable nor purposeful, which is why the Define phase is neither redundant nor dispensable in its form. Decisions in the Define phase often have to be made on the basis of complex circumstances that cannot be substituted by any automated procedure in future. These decisions are based on the joint development of results in a team as well as the human ability to think. 5. Conclusion and Limitations The objective of this paper is to underestimate possible changes in the Define phase caused by the ongoing digitalization. In particular, the research objective is to examine the potential of the tools and existence of the Define phase within future. For this purpose, qualitative interviews with seven experts in the field of Six Sigma were conducted. The results are based on experience and subjective assessments of the selected experts. According to the experts’ assessment, a change in the Six Sigma methodology will occur as a result of progressive digitalization. The most significant change is expected in the area of data availability. The entire value chain is being networked. This makes data from individual process steps available, which allows a better description of the problem situation. The experts agree that the original form of the Define phase will change little in the course of digitalization. The influence of digitalization and automation is rated as low. This is due to the fact that the Define phase is strongly influenced by human labor. Tools contained in the Define phase are human-driven, which is why high data availability plays a subordinate role. Much more, the Define phase is based on an interactive exchange of specialists, a coherent way of thinking and the ability to make rational decisions. Nevertheless, the Define phase can be improved by digitalization in terms of a better data basis and thus a more precise description of the current situation and design of the project charter. The results of the expert interviews show that the Define phase can be supported by higher data availability in future, but the Define phase will remain a well-tried planning phase within the Six Sigma methodology. Regarding the generalizability of the findings, it needs to be stressed out that only a limited sample in terms of respective experts was interviewed. Qualitative research was employed to explore possible changes in the Define phase. By pre-structuring the interviews with topics derived from previous research, certain aspects may not have been examined in depth (e.g., further tools of the Define phase). Hence, generalizability and completeness of the results are limited.

19,An Optimization Model For Sizing Decisions Of Gridconnected Photovoltaic System,"the use of fossil fuels to generate energy produces greenhouse gases, which is the main factor in climate change. solar energy is a clean source of energy that is environmentally friendly. the photovoltaic (pv) system is a well- established technology for converting solar energy into electrical energy. sizing-decision of the pv system is a strategic decision-making process that has a long-term impact on the project. this work proposes an optimization model for the sizing decisions of the grid-connected pv system. the model considers the financial aspects in terms of minimizing project lifetime costs and the non-financial aspects in terms of reducing co2 emissions and satisfying the planned service level. the decisions are the number of pv modules, the amount of energy purchased from the main grid, and the amount of energy supplied to the main grid. besides an auxiliary binary variable for an either-or decision, either purchase-from or supply-to the grid. a case study is provided to clarify the model's practicality based on the residential area at king fahd university of petroleum & minerals (kfupm). it is found that 1,670 pv modules are required to meet the annual demand at an annual cost of m$1.45 over 25 years.","photovoltaic system, grid-connected, sizing decisions, financial aspects",,"ahmed m. attia department of systems engineering king fahd university of petroleum & minerals dhahran, saudi arabia amattia@kfupm.edu.sa","References

20,Performance Of Named Data Networking In Connected  Vehicles,"vehicular networks are likely to be implemented in future vehicles. their usage can enhance road safety and enable new forms of communications such as vehicle to vehicle (v2v) and vehicle to infrastructure (v2i) communications. the simulation of this type of network is the most useful method to test new techniques, algorithms, and architectures. this is basically due to the high cost of deploying such systems in real scenarios. named data networking (ndn) is a new architecture that researchers have proposed recently as a promising architecture for future internet technologies. it is expected to support various applications in vehicular communications and aims to overcome the problem of classically tcp/ip-based architecture concerning mobility, by relying on naming the content rather than using end- to-end node addresses. indeed, the in-network caching feature in ndn makes this architecture more suitable for vehicular networks. to prove the usefulness of ndn in connected vehicles, we propose a simulation study in an urban network architecture.","connected vehicles, ndn, v2v, tcp/ip","In this paper, we presented a performance analysis through a simulation with both NDN and TCP/IP-based vehicular networks. Using the ndnSIM and ns-3 simulators, we have conducted a comparison of connected vehicle systems powered by NDN and TCP/IP solutions. The simulation results show that the NDN-based vehicular communication system lowers the packet delay and raises the throughput compared with the TCP/IP-based one. It is also worth saying from the sent and received packets graphs that the data drop rate is null in NDN compared to the TCP/IP. We can conclude by stating that NDN-based networking is a promising alternative to the conventional IP-based one for vehicular communications, and it can be implemented in the near future to make the transportation system intelligent and accident-free. In our future work, we will propose a new method to enhance security in vehicular networks over NDN.

21,Barriers To Innovation Among Micro And Small Enterprises:  Evidence From Italian Agricultural Machinery Industry,"micro-small and medium enterprises (msmes) are the principal actors of the innovation process in the national business system of countries. despite this, these enterprises face many economic, organizational and market barriers which may hinder the implementation of innovations. this issue is particularly relevant in italy, where msmes represent 99% of the enterprises. the present study aimed to investigate the willingness to invest in innovations and related perceived barriers in a group of micro and small enterprises operating in the agricultural machinery manufacturing industry in northern italy. forty-two enterprises answered a questionnaire investigating: i) firm’s characteristics, ii) interest in introducing innovation and willingness to invest in it, iii) perceived barriers and iv) respondent’s socio-demographic information. overall, economic issues, the lack of qualified personnel and difficulty in finding cooperation partners were cited as the foremost barriers. in detail, the firms with a higher level of management organization and more willing to invest in innovations were also those perceiving barriers the most. our results showed that enterprises are actually trying to innovate but targeted measures and interventions should be adopted to support the firms in the innovation process. implications and future research developments to promote innovation in micro and small enterprises are discussed.","perceived barriers, msmes",,"lucia vigoroso, giorgia bagagiolo and eugenio cavallo institute of sciences and technologies for sustainable energy and mobility (stems), national research council of italy (cnr), strada delle cacce, 73 - 10135 torino, italy lucia.vigoroso@stems.cnr.it, giorgia.bagagiolo@stems.cnr.it, eugenio.cavallo@stems.cnr.it federica caffaro department of education roma tre university via del castro pretorio, 20 – 0018, rome, italy federica.caffaro@uniroma3.it",
22,Improving Efficiency And Effectiveness In The Development  Of Customized Software Solutions:,"this paper presents the approach and results of an improvement project carried on by a company that provides business process outsourcing services based on customised software solutions. the critical objectives considered were to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes involved in developing customised solutions. thus, the focus of this research was to identify problems in current processes and practices and develop possible solutions to improve. the processes were mapped, the inefficiencies were identified, and suggestions for improvements were presented and analysed. it was concluded that the main problems with the project management and software development processes are related to the lack of visibility of the team load, lack of standardisation and inefficient management processes. these causes result in problems such as it being unable to plan work and problems associated with quality that negatively influence the lead time of projects. therefore, suggestions for improvement were formulated and prioritised to address each of these aspects. a more agile approach to software development and redesigning the processes for creating customised solutions were the solutions developed. there was also a need to develop the existing project management software changes to adapt it to these changes.","project management, process redesign","and future research A qualitative approach to research, informal workshops, and data analysis allowed the identification of relevant metrics in analysing the company's software development and project management processes, thus managing to answer our first research question. When we identified problems that affect processes, opportunities for improvement, and the root causes of problems, we faced a significant challenge from the beginning. The procedures are mainly ad hoc. However, direct observation of the team's tasks, document analysis and informal workshops allowed the identification of 28 causes or opportunities affecting the failure to achieve the expected results in each phase of the process. After the causes have been identified, we can see that the main problems with the project management and software development processes are the lack of visibility of the team load, lack of standardisation, and deficient management processes. These causes result in problems such as IT being unable to plan the work in advance and problems associated with quality that negatively influence the lead time of projects. So, we believe that with a more agile approach to SD, specifically using some of the techniques and events of Scrum, we managed to improve the current state of the situation concerning team management. Regarding inefficient processes and lack of standardisation, we opted for redesigning the entire process of creating customised solutions by the company. As successful process redesign projects often involve significant efforts in information systems, we have also implemented several changes to the current project management software to adapt it to new changes. All changes were accepted and prepared to be implemented, however not all were initiated given the time of the project. Given the short project time and the company's priority to improve the development of customised solutions and the management of projects associated with this solution, it would be interesting to see if this development model would apply to its other solutions. Thus, it would be interesting to analyse the impact of improvements in the budgeting process on the percentage of conversion from a prospect to a client (hit rate). As a proposal for future studies in this area, we recommend focusing on the impact of a change in the organisational structure. This company has a very vertical model of organisational structure, which, as the literature points out, can hinder an improvement process. Thus, future research can focus on assessing the impact of changing the current model to a more horizontal structure model. Finally, in addition to the limitations mentioned throughout this chapter, we also point out that the context of our project is the specific context. Thus, future investigations may choose to evaluate the applicability of our solutions in different contexts because the literature is inconclusive and controversial.

23,Impact Of Covid-19 On The Trucking Industry,"the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented changes in the trucking industry. 70% of all freight tonnage goes on trucks, including essential items such as food, medical supplies, and cleaning products. covid-19 caused surges in demand for many of these products, impacting the trucking companies. medical supplies, cleaning supplies, food, and even the covid-19 vaccine itself rely on the trucking industry to be distributed across the nation, creating a new, increased demand for goods. the increase in demand caused a surge of trucks on the road, which is a good sign for the business, but at a cost to the drivers during these times. closures due to the pandemic created problems for long-haul truckers who are on the road and need a place to rest, get gas, or buy food. besides, truckers are now expected to work longer hours and make longer trips to meet the new demand. the limitations that the pandemic has created on the trucking industry have also affected the overall revenue. trucking companies are reluctant to send trucks to highly impacted areas, even if those areas contribute most to the increased demand. this paper will explore the different ways that covid-19 affected the trucking industry, how they responded, and how their response continues to affect the industry.","trucking, transportation, covid-19 pandemic, supply chain","As shown in this paper, the trucking industry was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The trucking industry is a highly used and supported mode of transportation for goods cross-country. It has been growing in technology and changing due to different demands in the market. The pandemic increased E-commerce, which was one of the reasons the trucking industry needed to adapt and be flexible in uncertainty. There were both drastic increases and decreases in demand for certain goods that rely on trucking. Increases in demand of restocking stores even gave trucking ""emergency relief"" benefits and regulations. Truckers were also directly affected by the pandemic through many safety protocols set by rest areas, gas stations, and restaurants. Due to many of these changes, truckers' stress has increased drastically, while their overall emotional health has decreased. Truck drivers are one of the most at-risk groups due to their long-haul distance travels and being in high contact, high variety zones.","hudson brooks, rachel davis, jack dwyer, isabella kew, nicky rodriguez and mohamed awwad department of industrial and manufacturing engineering california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa hrbrooks@calpoly.edu, rdavis24@calpoly.edu, jtdwyer@calpoly.edu, ikew@calpoly.edu, nrodri31@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",
24,The Effects Of Covid-19 On The California Metal Casting  Industry Supply Chain,"in 2020, the covid-19 pandemic had a profound effect on all supply chains and markets worldwide. however, most of the analysis has taken place from the brick and mortar or buyer's perspective. the purpose of this paper is to capture the effects of these closures and business limitations further upstream at the supplier level. specifically, the metal casting business that supplies all sorts of industries, from medical implants to construction. due to the cancellation of non-essential surgeries at hospitals, demand for medical implants has stagnated while the demand for construction has continued. by surveying stakeholders in california's metal casting industry, this research explores how this complex and diverse vocation fulfills these demands and how they have adapted to these changes.","covid-19, manufacturing, supply chain, metal casting","We found that the companies interviewed reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic differently, though with the common denominators of ensuring worker safety as a priority, exploring new markets, and making changes within the company. Both Company A and Company B kept the cases among their workforce to a minimum, with the cases that did occur believed to have originated from outside of the workplace. The COVID-19 pandemic also served as an opportunity for the companies to explore new markets and make changes within their company that may not have previously been reasonable. Some of these changes, such as virtual meetings, may stay after the pandemic is over, pushing both companies further into the digital age. Regarding the suppliers of the two companies interviewed, COVID-19 had a direct effect on their production capabilities either due to the incapacitation of their workforce or forcing the closing of the company. Downstream in the supply chain, customers of these two companies experience reduced demand, which forced them to cancel existing contracts and decreased the number of future contracts created. Due to pressure from above and below in the supply chain, Company A and Company B were forced to respond reactively rather than proactively due to their size compared to their suppliers and customers.","alex garcia cruz, cole pike, elliott hofferth, balthazar olivier, hunter baird-wise and mohamed awwad department of industrial and manufacturing engineering california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa garciacr@calpoly.edu, capike@calpoly.edu, ehoffert@calpoly.edu, bolivier@calpoly.edu, hbairdwi@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",
25,The Global Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Chain,"despite the start of a new year, covid-19, a disease caused by a novel coronavirus called sars-cov-2, continues to impact people's lives on a global scale. the outbreak of the disease was first reported on december 31, 2019. at this time, governments all over the world are scrambling to vaccinate their citizens. as of january 2021, six vaccines have been approved by a handful of countries. approving a new vaccine and then mass-distributing it to an entire nation is a pressing yet complicated process. this paper will focus on defining successful vaccine deployment and discussing how certain countries are currently handling the task. the global covid-19 vaccine supply chain will be discussed for each of the six vaccines and touch on various topics such as the development process, manufacturing locations, storage requirements, proximity to approved countries, capacity, and how demand is being fulfilled. this information will be used to evaluate how well different governments are obtaining and distributing the vaccines and offer suggestions to improve this process moving forward.","covid-19, vaccine, supply chain, italy",,"darion guan, hanley kerh, lauren knott, ethan norman, jack mcguinness and mohamed awwad industrial and manufacturing engineering department california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa dguan01@calpoly.edu, hkerh@calpoly.edu, lknott@calpoly.edu, emnorman@calpoly.edu, jamcguin@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",
26,Effects Of Covid-19 On United States Food Industry And  Sharing Economy,"the covid-19 pandemic has altered the market such that both supply and demand are less predictable than ever before. u.s. businesses have had to learn to adapt to the rapid influx of demand in unexpected areas while demand slows in others, especially in the food industry. one way to address this is to utilize sharing economy within the supply chain, more specifically in last-mile logistics. adopting a sharing economy model allows for an intimate working relationship between the company and a worker that can resemble an employee without much of the continuous employment and associated overhead costs. a form of this is independent contractors, who can be brought in rapidly when both supply and demand are high and can cope with the low demand with a reduced consequence to the business. one such example is a third-party app-based service providing the last mile logistics for restaurants. this research investigates the overarching impacts on the restaurant industry of a shift from consumers traveling to sharing economy providing last-mile logistics.","supply chain, sharing economy, 2020","Looking at each of the three main parties involved (restaurants, delivery services, and customers), we can see how COVID-19 has affected the relationship between them. Mainly, the power has shifted towards food delivery services instead of the restaurants, allowing these services to set high fees on restaurants without much opposition. If customers continue to order food virtually, this will continue to happen. This harms these restaurants and their employees, as shown through the somewhat negative responses towards food delivery services seen from our case study interviews. However, as the number of COVID-19 cases declines, we can then expect more orders to be placed in-person. Along with this, with cities across the United States implementing service fee caps on delivery services, we predict restaurants will run on higher margins as the pandemic ends. This shift will likely cause profits for food delivery services to dip. However, as seen before the pandemic, these services will likely still maintain a solid footing in the U.S. economy.","cade alonzo, roger chevalier, nick mediati, jack surdyk, andy wei and mohamed awwad department of industrial and manufacturing engineering california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa calonz02@calpoly.edu, rmcheval@calpoly.edu, nmediati@calpoly.edu, jsurdyk@calpoly.edu, awei04@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",
27,Applications Of Augmented Reality To Reduce Risk In  Supply Chain Management,"augmented reality (ar) has a strong potential for success in improving supply chain operations and can impact how the manufacturing and distribution sectors are handled. the application of ar devices can reduce cost, time, and error rates as well as increase usability of a system and productivity. there is a need for augmented reality within inventory management to help order picking, assess product damage, and display inventory instructions. ar technology can be applied to improve the following networks within supply chains: it can instruct workers on where to find inventory within a warehouse and help to reduce time, workers could identify objects quicker without having to scan or type codes, and products can be sorted faster with lower error rates. further, manufacturing tool maintenance can be more easily monitored and addressed remotely. standard picking and packing procedures can be displayed for workers increasing worker safety and efficiency, and fewer workers would be needed to achieve inventory goals. these improvements can result in a decrease in the cost of labor and production time, increased accuracy, and expanded production capacity for companies. the purpose of this paper is to review current case studies regarding the use of ar technology in supply chain operations, specifically in inventory management, and showcase the potential cost reductions by applying ar to these operations.","augmented reality, time reduction, accuracy","Augmented reality can be used in supply chain management to improve warehouse and manufacturing operations in various ways, as seen through the results of the case studies and in prior research. As seen through the case studies, AR technology is quite versatile and can increase productivity throughout supply chains. More specifically, AR technology has been used in the past to increase efficiency in receiving, storing, picking, and shipping processes. AR is also used to forecast demand accurately, designate warehouse layouts and order-picking processes, to diagnose maintenance problems in manufacturing equipment. And lastly, to increase the effectiveness of training employees. Through the case studies and literature review, it is apparent that the applications of augmented reality throughout supply chains have a big potential to change the way they are operated. These improvements can save companies time, reduce costs, reduce error rates, and promote a highly efficient production environment.

28,Retrofitting Agricultural Tractors With Aftermarket  Weather Cabins: Safety Issues For Manufacturers And Users,"despite the effort of governments in promoting stricter safety requirements to reduce the number of accidents among farmers, agriculture still represents a very hazardous sector worldwide. in particular, the increasing importance of safety in the agriculture activities has been characterizing this sector both from the equipment manufacturers’ and from users’ point of view, since the use of tractors is recognized as the main cause of fatalities. in fact, tractor overturn associated with the absence or the improper use of the rollover protective structure (rops) represents the prevalent cause of this phenomenon. in this study we focused our attention on the use of aftermarket weather cabins and their interferential relationship with the tractor’s protective structure. actually, although the use of weather cabins temporarily installed on tractors for specific needs is very common among farmers, there is a lack of a normative framework that can provide safety requirements for both users and cabin manufacturers. in detail, taking the cue from the issues emerged in a specific working group led by the national institute for insurance against accidents at work in italy, the manuscript analyzes the hazardous situations that might arise when using weather cabins, discussing the safety measures aimed at guaranteeing a correct safety assessment.","machinery safety, work equipment, safety assessment",,"gattamelata davide, puri daniele and vita leonardo department of technological innovations and safety of plants, products and anthropic settlements national institute for insurance against accidents at work (inail) via di fontana candida, 1, 00078 monte porzio catone, italy d.gattamelata@inail.it, d.puri@inail.it, l.vita@inail.it mario fargnoli, mara lombardi department of chemical engineering materials environment (dicma) sapienza - university of rome via eudossiana 18, 00184 - rome, italy mario.fargnoli@uniroma1.it, mara.lombardi@uniroma1.it","References

29,Scheduling Of Assembly Systems In The Footwear Industry,"in the last years, the paradigm of the portuguese footwear industry has improved drastically to become one of the main world players. in fact, a lot has changed, from low-cost mass production to serving clients consisting of small retail chains, where orders are small and models are varied. in order to deal with such modifications, the footwear industry started investing in technological solutions. the industrial case presented in this paper fits that purpose. the goal is to contribute to the solution of complex scheduling problems arising in the new mixed-model flexible automatic stitching systems of an important footwear factory. the project starts by building an optimization model. although the model has its own usefulness, the cplex program is only capable of reaching optimal solutions for small problem instances. therefore, a recent metaheuristic, the imperialist competitive algorithm (ica), has been chosen to tackle larger problems. the ica is capable of finding optimal results for smaller instances and achieving adequate solutions for real problems in short periods of time. moreover, ica improves the results obtained so far by the method currently used in the factory.","footwear industry, scheduling, optimization",". Firstly, the solution obtained for the smaller instances was equal to the optimal solution, which validates the correct functioning of the ICA. In fact, the solution proves that the ICA attempts to solve the problem defined by the optimization model. Secondly, it can also be said that the ICA has a good performance, both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. For the 3 smaller instances, the ICA was able to reach the optimal solution in little time. For the 4 larger instances, the average GAP is less than 5%, and the execution time is within the acceptable for the industrial case (where a maximum execution time of 300 seconds is convenient). It is also important to state that it was not possible to obtain a solution for the industrial case since the computer's RAM was not enough to keep all the variables generated by the model due to the size of the real problem. Furthermore, even with more RAM, the exponential growth of the execution time with the size of the problem makes it impracticable to use the model in the industrial case. This indicates that using the optimization model in CPLEX directly for the industrial case is not a viable option. 6.2 Industrial case Since this real problem could not be solved with CPLEX, it was important to find a procedure to evaluate the quality of the solutions attained by the ICA. In this sense, a simulation program was developed which balanced and scheduled the operations according to the method currently used by the factory. This way, it is possible to obtain the makespan by simulating the factory method and compare the solution with the one obtained by the ICA. In the case of the ICA, to evaluate the makespan, it was run 5 times and the value of the best solution throughout the execution time was registered for each of the runs. The makespan value obtained by the simulation is 564.16 minutes. The average value makespan value obtained by the ICA is 546.26 minutes. This means that the ICA was capable of generating solutions that reduce the makespan obtained by the heuristic in 3.173%, approximately. Furthermore, the ICA converged quickly to a solution. In the run with the longest convergence time, the ICA took 92.067 seconds to get to the final value of the solution. This fast convergence is essential due to the need to obtain a solution in less than 5 minutes. 7.

30,Integrating Lean Manufacturing And Simulation Modelling  To Improve The Productivity Of A Door And Window,"manufacturing companies are striving to compete in the global markets and to remain profitable. through increased productivity, manufacturing companies compete or remain competitive in global markets. lean manufacturing techniques have proven to improve the productivity of manufacturing companies. this technique identifies and eliminates all forms of waste from manufacturing plants and processes. this study aims to apply lean manufacturing to a manufacturing plant to increase productivity. the company selected manufactures wooden and aluminum doors and windows and has limited knowledge and application of lean manufacturing. the data was collected from time studies. simul8, a simulation modelling software was used to analyze the impact of implementing lean manufacturing. the results indicated an increase in throughput and an improvement in the company's overall productivity. the integration of lean manufacturing and simulation modelling was found to improve productivity in this manufacturing plant.","lean manufacturing, lead time",,"manufacturing plant thalia nair and oludolapo akanni olanrewaju department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, south africa 21610228@dut4life.ac.za, oludolapoo@dut.ac.za",
31,Inefficiencies Of The Covid-19 Vaccine Distribution In  California,"as we enter the new year, two companies’ covid-19 vaccines have been authorized for emergency use in the united states. while they are only in the beginning stages of distribution, we have already seen many complications in the united states as each state has a unique policy on its distribution process. within the state of california, the different counties are dealing with covid-19 differently depending on the size of the population and geographical location. depending on these factors, the counties throughout the state have their own ways of distributing the vaccine that is advised by the state. even though each county has its own distribution method, california as a whole ranked 35th out of the 50 states for efficiency in vaccine distribution as of february 28, 2021. with the efficiency so low, and cases at an all-time high, states need to more effectively distribute the vaccine to those who need it most: at-risk individuals, frontline healthcare workers, and older adults. with the discovery of a new strain, counties within the state must properly contain the spread while administering vaccines in order for the country to rebound from extended lockdowns. our paper addresses the distribution of the vaccine within california and provides insight on how the state can effectively and adequately do so.","covid-19 vaccine, coronavirus, california, distribution","The coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and then by January 2020, China began their lockdown. Soon later, most of the world was on lockdown, including California in March of 2020. “On March 30th, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) started a program they coined “Operation Warp Speed,” (OWS) in an attempt to expedite a COVID-19 vaccine” (Brothers). On December 11, 2020 the FDA issued the first Pfizer vaccine, and on December 18, 2020 the Moderna vaccine was approved. One factor that has caused inefficiencies in California’s distribution thus far is the disparity in population densities and demand of vaccines between urban and rural counties within the state. Since urban counties such as Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties have many citizens who want the vaccine, the demand is much higher in these counties. Taking this into account, these urban counties’ citizens are expressing their frustration with the state’s inability to fulfill this demand, whereas it is not an issue in rural counties. To alleviate this and ensure that distribution meets the demand, state regulators must incorporate policies to streamline distribution while accounting for the vaccine’s time sensitivity and cold storage. One step California is taking to improve vaccine distribution is the Blue Shield program, which will streamline distribution by taking pressure off the state. The third party Blue Shield will take a data-driven approach by giving vaccines to communities that have been severely affected by COVID contamination and death as a result of the virus. This will help resolve some of the problems that COVID has caused in these communities. Regarding the manufacturing of the vaccine, Pfizer Inc. CEO Albert Bourla announced on February 19, 2021 that the company will add additional capacity to its Kalamazoo site. In addition to the expansion of the site, Pfizer has contacted two new manufacturers to help with production. These efforts will hopefully bring the current manufactured rate of 5 million doses per week to around more than double [8]. Moderna plans to achieve a similar amount of vaccines manufactured per week to around 10 million doses by April 2021 [15]. Moderna plans to achieve the production goals by working closely with partners and the federal government to address production bottlenecks and accelerating production. With Blue Shield, hopefully distribution efficiency will improve so that 85% of the population can be vaccinated, which is the target number, in order for the pandemic to be considered under control.","jared mcmullen, matt akins, matt grywczynski, jack rocca, carter bergquist and mohamed awwad department of industrial and manufacturing engineering california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa jjmcmull@calpoly.edu, meakins@calpoly.edu, mgrywczy@calpoly.edu, jjrocca@calpoly.edu, cwbergqu@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",

33,Development Of An Ergonomically Designed Infant Walker,"baby walkers have a huge patronage since its introduction in the early 15th century in europe among parents aiding their children in developing their baby’s locomotor skills, a common misconception that had been overlook, due to poor consideration of the early designs injury reduction had been outlooked resulting to injuries possible, toe walking due to mismatch on the early designs versus the infant’s body measurements. despite the plea of medical professionals in banning the product in the market due to reported cases of emergency room injuries caused by walkers (molina, 2018) from which majority is from head and neck injuries along with reports that use of the baby device delays the developmental growth of the infant according to a cohort study and two cross sectional studies reporting developmental delays which has a long run to go since the evidence against the product is not enough considering the large number of baby walker users worldwide. despite such plea market for walkers had been increasing according to the market analysis conducted by the authors potential market for the product is at 8,856 this 2018 and is projected to go up to 9,753 in 2022. a potential market size indicates a high social desirability for the device, thus the researcher sought to provide a correction to the design in order to minimize if not to eliminate possible risk of injuries. in order to develop a proposed design for the product, the researchers used anthropometry to determine the appropriate dimensions of the product. identified which body dimensions will be needed as reference for the proposed product dimensions. after determining the appropriate body dimensions, the values for the dimension of the product parts with respect to the 5th and 95th. materials to be used should be mainly made up of polyethylene and aluminum alloy.","special population, infant, design, ergonomics, anthropometry","5.1 Recommendations Protection: Dimensions for the designs of the baby walker should be within the 95th and 5th percentile of the infant. The walkers’ leg should be adjustable with respect with the popliteal height, maximum height should be 19.5cm and minimum should be at least 13cm, leg braces should be spread out to provide higher stability to avoid tip overs. Lower base should be a plastic brace covered with foam since it is the portion most likely to collide to other objects. Addition of foam or air pump bracing could lessen the impact due to collision. Wheels should be caster wheels with locking mechanism so standing by, if the care taker would need to go somewhere for a short period of time.

35,Effect Of Covid-19 Pandemic On Absenteeism Rates In  Carpet Manufacturing: A Case Study From Turkey,"the covid-19 pandemic has heavily affected all industries in all over the world. although some factories stopped their production activities due to the precautions, the most of privately owned turkish carpet manufacturers have continued their production continuously. we have arranged several meetings with two credible carpet manufactures to ask for absenteeism rates of blue-collar workers. we have collected the data and analyzed it by comparing prepandemic conditions. we have seen that absenteeism rates have significantly changed. in addition, we surveyed 1258 employees from 2 carpet manufacturer and found that %81.31 of them have at least 1-day sick absence during the pandemic due to a real covid 19 or being a suspect of being covid19 (has a contact with a covid 19 positive person). it can be stated that at least for these two carpet manufacturers, absenteeism rates were relatively higher when compared to condition before pandemic. we have already seen some of the effects of absenteeism on the production quantities and some other effects are expected to be realized soon. key words: absenteeism rate, covid 19 pandemic, carpet industry 1. introduction the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (covid-19) emerged at the end of 2019 and it was announced as a public health emergency situation at the beginning of 2020 (tendal et al. 2021). the outbreak of covid-19 has influences on the health of tens of millions of people, and is expected to affect hundreds of millions in the future (li et al. 2020). on the other hand, the pandemic has not been just a global health problem it has also created problems about labor market and the economy (karmaker et al. 2021). governments across the world have closed some of the industries (habib et al. 2021), self-isolation has been a legal duty as a measure against the pandemic. some businesses also did not survive or their continuity was threatened (miyakawa et al. 2021). some employees lost their jobs (sjoquist and wheeler 2020) and some were not able to go to work places due to self-isolation or contact to a person who is covid positive. at the same time, it would not be wrong to expect a rise in the sickness absenteeism in the companies which did not seriously lose their market due to conditions of the pandemic. it has been shown that absences generally lead to innumerable personal, social, and economic losses (lima et al. 2020). furthermore, absenteeism causes considerable output losses (block et al. 2014). although the increasing absenteeism can be seen as indirect impact of the covid-19 pandemic, we still don’t know about its size and consequences. turkey has been the biggest exporter of machine made carpets in the world and turkish carpet manufacturers export their products to more than 160 countries in the world (öz 2004). according to the turkey statistical institute, turkish carpet industry made $1 billion 770 million 886 worth exports between january and september of 2020 and approximately %70 of these exports were made by companies operating in gaziantep (turkish statistics institute 2020). total amount of exports of the carpet manufacturing industry has increased 2.31% in the global pandemic period. the most of the carpet manufacturing companies worked non-stop during the coronavirus breakup. in this work, we will provide information about the absenteeism rates of two leading carpet manufacturers located in gaziantep before and after the pandemic. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management rome, italy, august 2-5, 2021 © ieom society international 402",,"Absenteeism has been considerable problem of manufacturing companies which causes certain loss of work power as a resource of the firms. There is significant amount of research on this topic, focusing on the factors affecting the absenteeism rates. From the managerial point of view, the key issue has been the decreasing proportion of absenteeism that is avoidable (Vahtera et al. 2001). Currently, the world is under pressure of widely distributed pandemic and we can’t estimate the real cost of it to the manufacturing industry. As it can be predicted, in this paper, we showed that the Covid 19 break-out has increased the absenteeism rates. Even we showed that the difference in the rate of absenteeism is statistically significant for the period after the pandemic, we can’t prove that all of absenteeism is related to this pandemic. The correlation of the absenteeism with the number of positive cases can be significant as in case of Firm A or it can be insignificant as in Firm B. We are aware that Covid 19 test implementations were not wide at the beginning of the pandemic and some people were stayed as untested even they may have some of the symptoms. Therefore, we can’t be sure of the numbers of the cases reported as positive. Therefore, the correlation between the positive cases and the increasing rate of absenteeism could be more than predicted. We have further surveyed employees to ask for the reason of their absence in order to check their reason for being absent during Covid 19 pandemic. 81.31% reported at least 1-day sick absence during the pandemic due to suspect of being Covid19 positive. 99.8% of the 14-day sick absent employees reported they never had such along sick absence before. In addition, we know that some people who have a contact with a Covid 19 positive person were also not allowed to work and stay in isolation. 40% of all (209 employees) reported a self-isolation requirement among the 1258 employees. As a conclusion we can state that the absenteeism rates were higher and longer in duration during the Covid 19 pandemic. In this study, we were not able to show either the psychological effects of Covid19 on the absenteeism rates since there is no registered proof. Willingness of the employees to work under strict conditions of the pandemic may be less when compared to normal conditions. On the other hand, we have to state that both of the firms considered in this study pays for the output of employees, any kind of absenteeism means loss of certain amount of gain. We also don’t know this effect the individual decisions of the employees. We also know that team members seem to imitate each other’s absence behavior (ten Brummelhuis et al. 2016). Consequently, the psychological effect of the pandemic cannot be estimated currently; however, a survey analysis in near future can clarify the situation. There is another phenomenon that we should not forget here: Sickness presenteeism. It is the being present of an employee at the workplace even he/she feels ill (Bergström et al. 2009). We don’t know if the fear about being COVID-19, positive has decreased the sickness presenteeism but we can estimate that the cost will be higher for a pandemic when compared to absenteeism.","zeynep didem unutmaz durmuşoğlu and alptekin durmuşoğlu gaziantep university, department of industrial engineering, gaziantep, turkey unutmaz@gantep.edu.tr, durmusoglu@gantep.edu.tr",
36,Is There A Relation Between Academic Ranking Measures  And Age Of A University? A Case Study From Turkey,"in line with the changes in higher education policy in turkey, the number of universities in turkey has considerably increased in the last decade. in this competitive environment, turkey’s scientific and technological research institution (tübi̇tak) has started to rank the universities using several academic measures such number of publications, number of cited articles, number of students (phd), number of patent applications/grants and etc. in this work, we want to show how these academic performance indicators are affected from the experience of universities. we list the establishment years of the universities and calculate an age for each of the turkish universities. subsequently, we investigate how the performance indicators are correlated with the age of universities. as result, we show that the experience (age) is quite correlated with many of the indicators such as: total number of publications, total number of citations, number of projects completed however it is not the only factor to explain all variability in these measures.",academic ranking,"Academic performance indicators such as number of papers published is expected to be influenced by several factors including the experience. This experience is not only the experience of the individuals; it is also the traditions arising from cultural climate of the universities. However, little is known regarding the influence of experience on these indicators. In this work, we see the age of a university as the proxy of experience and check if the academic measures are correlated with the age of universities. The results indicate that the number of publications, number of citations, number of projects, number of granted patents and the number of PhD graduates are positively correlated to age of the universities. We can infer that the statistics tend to be significantly different for the different ages of the universities. Most of these indicator values increase as the age of the university increases. We have two different categories of unusual observations. The first one is about the elder universities with relatively lower performances. The second category is the relatively higher performances although the university is a young one. If these rankings are assumed to be an indicator of the success, we believe that the second category of unusual observations should be announced as the success stories. In other words, the universities should be compared and ranked with the similar universities (we mean the age similarity). We have to state that there is a significant limitation of this work due to sparsely available data and these findings indicate a relation however we cannot infer causality directly. Although there are lots of studies on academic ranking, the interrelations between the indicators has not been widely considered. We hypothesize that there are some certain dependencies among these indicators. These dependencies can be checked in future work.","alptekin durmuşoğlu and zeynep didem unutmaz durmuşoğlu department of industrial engineering gaziantep university gaziantep, turkey durmusoglu@gantep.edu.tr, unutmaz@gantep.edu.tr",
37,A Supply Chain System With Capital Constraints  Considering Various Salvage Values,"this paper examines the effects of positive or negative residual values on the supply chain participants’ decisions. the supply chain consists of a cash-strapped manufacturer, a reputable retailer, and a financial institution. two financing tools are considered to address the manufacturer's financial difficulties. it is found that, firstly, positive and negative residual values affect the optimal order quantity. secondly, residual values have an impact on the profits of each supply chain member. the threshold value of the retailer's internal asset level is related to the residual value under the condition of single financing equilibrium. finally, the results are verified by some numerical experiments.",,"We study a supply chain system with a cash-strapped manufacturer and analyze the supply chain participants’ optimal decisions and financing strategies with considering positive and negative residual values. To solve the manufacturer's financial difficulties, the manufacturer can use BPOF and APD. Our research yielded some important results. In the clearance period, considering different residual values, the retailer's optimal order quantity is different. Specifically, compared with orders with no residual value, an order with a positive residual value can reduce the loss of the retailer, which will make the buyer gain more profits. On the contrary, orders with negative residual values increase losses, resulting in lower profits. Therefore, in the SCF system, the retailer is more likely to order products with high positive residual values from the manufacturer. Moreover, when residual values are high, the retailer should have higher asset levels to ensure that there is sufficient capital to provide financing to the manufacturer. Future research directions mainly include the following aspects: 1) Future research can explore supply chain coordination with other contracts; 2) Risk preferences of supply chain participants can be considered in future models; 3) In real life, information asymmetry exists among supply chain participants, which needs to be further solved.","song-man wu industrial and system engineering department the hong kong polytechnic university hung hum, hong kong songmanwu@foxmail.com felix t.s. chan industrial and system engineering department the hong kong polytechnic university hung hum, hong kong f.chan@polyu.edu.hk s.h. chung industrial and system engineering department the hong kong polytechnic university hung hum, hong kong nick.sh.chung@polyu.edu.hk",

Great welcome the opportunity of adding a new package to their credit of proficiencies. The spreadsheets that were presented in this project were well-programmed, for assisting the data processing of the complex heat exchanger model design evaluation tasks. Analytical and numerical solutions of different models were well comprised of those spreadsheets, as well as correlations available in the literature. A survey was conducted on the five chemical engineering students group who tested the spreadsheets, showing that spreadsheets were considered useful for reducing workload and boosting analyses quality where they earned the expertise of possibility of quickly rehearsing with diverse correlations and models. The students also gave valuable suggestions and feedback to improve the spreadsheet experience, such as incorporating more correlations and models and examples into the user manuals, which will be considered for the next stage of this project by creating a spreadsheet for each unit in the design laboratory course. Finally, the goal of updating the teaching and learning experience of chemical engineering students at the design course through computers was fulfilled by the introduction of these spreadsheets, without the need for students to acquire any more programming skills courses.

41,Contribution Of Biomethane To Reduce Co2 Emissions From  Agricultural Tractors Fleet: A Theoretical Approach,"the agricultural sector may reduce carbon dioxide (co2) emissions derived from fossil fuels combustion, contributing to achieving the european union environmental decarbonization targets set for 2030. in this context, biomethane has a growing interest as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels in term of co2 emission. in particular, according to the 2009/28/ec european unione directive, emissions from the fuel in use shall be considered to be zero for biofuels and bioliquids. for this reason, co2 emissions produced from biomethane combustion can be regarded as highly promising to increase agricultural sustainability. this study aims to propose a theoretical approach to estimate the amount of co2 emissions of agricultural tractors' fleet and a method to calculate the amount of biomethane required to replace fossil fuel. the method of estimation of the co2 emitted by tractors is based on the amount of tax-reduced fuel consumed each year in an area, then the amount of biomethane required to replace diesel fuel used by agricultural tractors in the same area is calculated. the method has been applied to the piedmont region, nw italy, retrieving figures from an official open-access online regional database where the consumption of diesel fuel is recorded year by year. the amount of biomethane necessary to achieve the european environmental goals in terms of co2 emissions reduction is estimated by adopting a methane emissions factor. after introducing the theoretical approach, the paper describes the different steps of the method from the diesel fuel consumption data retrieving to the following calculation for co2 emission and the biomethane estimation for the diesel fuel replacement.","carbon neutrality, climate resilience, italy, august 2-5",,"giulia barucco, niccolò pampuro, lucia vigoroso and eugenio cavallo istituto di scienze e tecnologie per l'energia e la mobilità sostenibili (stems) national research council of italy (cnr) strada delle cacce, 73, 10135 torino, italy niccolo.pampuro@stems.cnr.it",
42,A Quantitative Study Determining An Optimal Location For A  Company To Place A New Factory Through The Use Of The,"the aim of this study is to determine an optimal new factory location for a company based on the proximity of the new factory’s location to its customers and, in turn, reduce the cost related to deliveries. this was carried out using the transportation algorithm via the excel solver tool. this takes into account variables such as distance from customers, weight of the goods, as well as vehicle-based and driver- based costs, in order to determine the most cost effective location of a new factory. the current factory for the company case study is based in pinetown and kwa-zulu natal in south africa. the proposed factory locations are pietermaritzburg, durban central or another in pinetown, all within kwa-zulu natal. based on the results, the optimal location to establish a new factory would be pietermaritzburg, kwazulu natal. this location combined with the current factory location will generate the lowest cost with regards to vehicle-based and driver-based costs when delivering goods.","transportation, algorithm, excel, solver","As mentioned above this study takes into account vehicle-based costs and driver-based costs when looking for the optimal location of a new factory. These, however, are not the only costs that a company should consider when looking at a location. Other costs such as access to suppliers, employees and knowledge should be considered. Based on the data seen in Table 6, the optimal location to set up a new factory would be in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal. This location combined with the current factory location will generate the lowest cost with regards to vehicle-based and driver-based costs when delivering goods as the majority of the customers are based closer to Pietermaritzburg. Due to the nature of this paper, further studies should take into account other cost factors such as location of suppliers, employees and knowledge (such as specialists) in order to gain a better analysis of all costs involved in determining the location of a new factory.","transportation algorithm and excel solver. 1austin moreira and 2oludolapo akanni olanrewaju department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment durban university of technology, durban, sa 121710620@dut4life.ac.za, 2oludolapoo@dut.ac.za",
43,Using Ahp To Deal With Sectorization Problems,"sectorization refers to partitioning a large territory, network, or area into smaller parts or sectors considering one or more objectives. sectorization problems appear in diverse realities and applications. for instance, political districting, waste collection, maintenance operations, forest planning, health or school districting are only some of the application fields. commonly, sectorization problems respect a set of features necessary to be preserved to evaluate the solutions. these features change for different sectorization applications. thus, it is important to conceive the needs and the preferences of the decision-makers about the solutions. in the current paper, we solve sectorization problems using the genetic algorithm by considering three objectives: equilibrium, compactness, and contiguity. these objectives are collected within a single composite objective function to evaluate the solutions over generations. moreover, the analytical hierarchy process, a powerful method to perceive the relative importance of several objectives regarding decision makers' preferences, is used to construct the weights. we observe the changes in the solutions by considering different sectorization problems that prioritize various objectives. the results show that the solutions' progress changed accurately to the given importance of each objective over generations.","sectorization, genetic algorithm",,"elif göksu öztürk inesc tec - technology and science, porto, portugal faculty of economics, university of porto (fep.up), porto, portugal elif.ozturk@inesctec.pt ana maria rodrigues inesc tec - technology and science, porto, portugal ceos.pp/iscap/p.porto, porto, portugal ana.m.rodrigues@inesctec.pt josé soeiro ferreira inesc tec - technology and science, porto, portugal faculty of engineering, university of porto (feup), porto, portugal jose.soeiro.ferreira@inesctec.pt","references.

46,The Dynamics Of Social And Economic Factors  Affecting Supplier-Specific Investment On Business,"supplier-specific investment is a strategic decision that involves cost and benefit. in order to meet the needs of buyers in outsourcing certain business processes, suppliers are required to be responsive to buyer's requirements to make specific investments to meet the needs of each buyer. both buyer and supplier should not be concerned only with the level of risk they are willing to tolerate but also realize the benefit of those strategic decision. for that reason, the factors affecting suppliers’ investment specific should be taken into consideration. this study attempts to develop a conceptual framework in relation to the dynamics of economic and social factors determining suppliers’ specific investment on business process outsourcing. we do this by adding relational social capital as social factor which formed suppliers’ specific investment. we also incorporates environmental uncertainty as moderating factors. our conceptual model provides a way for firms and researchers to take a more systematic and comprehensive approach to understand suppliers’ specific investment decisions. we conclude with a discussion of using both buyer and supplier perspective on future empirical studies.","transaction cost, italy",,"process outsourcing: a conceptual paper wulan permatasari, amin wibowo, nurul indarti and rangga almahendra faculty of economics and business universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta, indonesia. email: wulansugiarto@gmail.com, aminwibowo@ugm.ac.id, nurulindarti@ugm.ac.id, 99rangga@gmail.com",
47,"A Comprehensive Integration Of Rfm Analysis, Cluster  Analysis, And Classification For B2B Customer Relationship","customer relationship management (crm) becomes more important day by day as a result of technological developments. besides improving their internal processes for customer satisfaction, companies especially with a high number of customers seek intelligent and well-designed methods for handling their customers by analyzing their behaviors and revealing their patterns. companies transform their repetitive processes to robotic process automation (rpa) by integrating systems based on intelligence, data mining, and machine learning techniques to save time, reveal patterns in data more easily, build robust interrelationships within the functions of the company, etc. as a part of these efforts, this study proposes an integrated crm methodology to manage both business to business (b2b) and business to customer (b2c) relations. in the integrated approach, recency, frequency, and monetary (rfm) analysis divides the customers into segments that define their current status, dbscan cluster analysis verifies rfm analysis and reveals the anomalies in the data fur further analysis, and decision tree classification algorithm predicts company- specific custom questions to ease the work of analysts. a case study on the data from an-el a.s. (an electrical components company) verifies that the methodology produces segments of the customers and predictive responses to custom questions to enable the analysts to carry out their actions easily. according to the results of the case study, 34 % of the customers should be contacted to detail the status of the business in terms of sample approval, new purchase order, arrangement of batch size etc.","crm, rfm, cluster analysis, classification","and Future Research In this study, we have proposed a comprehensive methodology for customer segmentation and revealing responses to company-specific questions concerning customer patterns.

Outliers are unordinary customers that behave distinctly compared to remaining customers. Distinct behaviors of outliers should be analyzed with further efforts to better understand the customers. At the final stage, the Decision Tree Classification Algorithm eases the work of analysts by revealing replies to custom questions. These specific questions clearly state the actions to be taken concerning each customer. The novelty of this study is providing a holistic approach to B2B and B2C CRM management by a methodology of segmentation, outlier detection, and responding to customer-related custom questions. Revealing all these data may be possible with intense manual analysis. However, this process would consume a meaningful time every time the analysis is carried out. The methodology can currently provide membership and classification data considering the features of the study. CRM is widely applied to B2C and not common for B2B. The study also proves that CRM may be applied easily to B2B analysis. For future study, the methodology may be enhanced by adding forecasting techniques to suggest possible future actions that may be carried out by the customers.","management ismet karacan and inanc erdogan an-el anahtar ve elektrikli ev aletleri san. a.s. pendik, 34896, turkey anelprs142@an-el.com.tr, anel@an-el.com.tr ufuk cebeci department of industrial engineering istanbul technical university macka, 34367, turkey cebeciu@itu.edu.tr",
48,How Industrial Internet Of Things Enables Engineers To  Work Remotely,"industrial internet of things (iiot) has enabled many new avenues for industrial engineers to perform their jobs. there used to be a need for an engineer to monitor, analyze, and improve a process manually. the inherent benefit of iiot applications in industrial settings no longer requires in-person contact. through the use of sensors, actuators, and data communication networks, businesses can now automate the data collection process to achieve kpis. with this digital revolution comes the ability to access the data and improve the process from anywhere in the world. while iiot brings many advantages that may improve a process improvement team's efficiency, it is not without some drawbacks such as security and cost. this paper will explore how iiot enables remote improvements and how the covid-19 pandemic has made remote work a fiscal possibility for many businesses.","iiot, remote work, actuators","In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the transition to an IIoT integrated work environment. Companies now have begun to realize the importance of incorporating IIoT in their business for the benefits they offer. With the push from COVID-19, industries inch closer towards ""Industry 4.0"", which relies heavily on IIoT, autonomous systems, and machine learning. In the example of SLO Aerospace, the engineers were able to identify issues within the current facility and propose an effective solution to senior leadership. From there, the executives noticed that not only could the technology save the business's bottom line but prevent facility shutdown from global pandemics. Engineers can now securely log into the facility data communication network and make adjustments to critical assets from their home's comfort. While a mass-scale implementation plan like SLO Aerospace is not feasible for some production facilities, engineers should carefully examine IoT benefits and compare the potential outcomes to propose accurate savings models to the business.","christopher striff, john takiff, brandon drury, jimmy algeo, moummar nawafleh and mohamed awwad department of industrial and manufacturing engineering california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa cstriff@calpoly.edu, jtakiff@calpoly.edu, bcdrury@calpoly.edu, jmalgeo@calpoly.edu, mnawafle@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",
49,Development And Initial Testing Of Lumbar Support For  Traffic Police Motorcycle Seat With Built-In Massager,"traffic police riders are exposed to prolonged static posture, causing significant angular deviation of body muscles, including lumbar angle (l1-l5). this postural alteration contributes to muscle discomfort, especially low back pain (lbp), since it is one of the most severe modern diseases nowadays. this study aims to develop a prototype (lumbar support with built-in massager system) of motorcycle seat for traffic police riders to precisely transform riders' need with comfort. there are three stages (stage 1: problem identification, stage 2: prototype development, and stage 3: prototype testing) involved in this study. a 100 mm visual analogue scale rating was used to assess the discomfort ratings of this prototype. the prototype testing showed good indicators in reducing riders' discomfort (31%) compared with the existing motorcycle seat. the majority of the items were statistically significant difference between the existing seat and prototype seat, namely the seat length, seat contour, vibration, physical design, tendency to slide, with/without lumbar support as well as massager, the pressure under the buttock, lower back, middle back, upper back, side of the body, buttock, and overall discomfort (p<0.05). a prototype (lumbar support with built-in massager system) does offer an alternative solution to improve motorcycle seat design ergonomically. it enhances the reduction of overall body discomfort on police riders. however, a further evaluation of the in-depth field, laboratory and clinical testing should be carried out to support the effectiveness of the prototype.","adjustable, lumbar support, massage system",,"system: a preliminary study in the view of ergonomics nur athirah diyana mohammad yusof, karmegam karuppiah, putri anis syahira mohamad jamil, irniza rasdi, vivien how, sivasankar sambasivam department of environmental and occupational health, faculty of medicine and health sciences, universiti putra malaysia, 43400 upm serdang, selangor, malaysia athirahd@hotmail.com, megam@upm.edu.my, putrianissyahira@gmail.com, irniza@upm.edu.my, vivien@upm.edu.my, sivasankar@hotmail.com kulanthayan kc mani department of community health, faculty of medicine and health sciences, universiti putra malaysia, 43400 upm serdang, selangor, malaysia kulan@upm.edu.my",
50,Design And Implementation Of An Automated Feeding  System For Poultry Farms,"the huge cost and high labor demand associated with the current deep litter system of poultry farming poses a great challenge to poultry farming. these drawbacks which currently threatens this system of farming, have been attributed to the over-involvement of humans in almost all aspects of operation of this farming system. the consequences are increased disease outbreak, weakness and poor bird feeding. to ameliorated some of these challenges, an automated poultry feeding system is developed and presented in this paper. the proposed system mimics the roles of real-life poultry attendants in delivery of feed and water to birds at specified interval of time. the system senses the level of feed and water in the respective trough and intelligently dispense water and feed in response to the sensed levels. the current system is able to effectively sense and predict the level of feed and water in the farm at an accuracy of 98.79% and dispense same within a response time of 50-60ms. keyword automated feeding system, poultry farm, microcontroller, arduino uno 1. introduction poultry farming currently serves as major source of protein production for human consumption. it has overtime created employment and revenue for stakeholders involved in the business. as such, the need to ensure its proper management cannot be overemphasized (barcho, 2019; olaniyi et al, 2014; adedinsewo, 2004; arulogun, 2010; grothmann, 2010). efficient management of poultry nutrition has been established as a major factor that accounts for the success of the poultry business (adedinsewo, 2004). according to (olaniyi et al, 2014), 75% of production cost in poultry farm is due to feeding. similarly, the extensive use of human labor in almost all aspect for the daily running of the farm increases the cost of production. the current deep litter system of poultry farming has been established to be characterized by improper administration of feed, wastage of feed, unfavorable weather conditions, stress associated with manual labor, increased tendency of disease outbreak, fatigue and stress (hung, 2014; reyes et al, 2015; duy et al, 2015). in an effort to ameliorate some of these challenges, technologies have over-time been developed in order to automate several aspects of this system of farming. see section ii for details. though, several technologies have been developed in an effort to automating the feed dispensing system of poultry farms, many of such systems have been inefficient and unstable hence resulting in malnutrition and increase risk of disease outbreak in many farms. thus, the present study seeks to develop an automated feeding system for poultry farms that cater for these challenges. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management rome, italy, august 2-5, 2021 © ieom society international 532",,"and Recommendations In this study, we designed and implemented an effective, user-friendly automatic feeding system for poultry farms with a view of remedying the current challenges associated with poultry farming especially as it regards the high cost associated with personnel.

60,Balletnettrainer: An Automatic Correctional Feedback  Instructor For Ballet Via Feature Angle Extraction And,"ballet is a complex art form that consists of precise movements atypical to the human body and requires meticulous technique. students receive only a limited portion of their instructor's attention in a classroom setting and private coaching is often financially inaccessible, which results in overlooked mistakes. as a result, these momentary errors become habitual and culminate in serious injuries that would be prevented with proper body alignment. this research focused on enhancing the current technology in instructional programs for ballet by training a teacher model with open-source video data of professional dancers. we used a novel feature angle extraction system as a medium to standardize variances among different dancer videos. our pipeline consisted of the pose estimation system openpose to identify dancers’ joint positions, dynamic time warping to align video frames, random forests classifier to feature select characteristics of correct movements, and decision tree classifiers to generate feedback. the outcome of this study was a highly accurate application that computes a percent depiction of movement quality and returns user-friendly feedback upon the input of a single-view video.","motion analysis, pose estimation","The BalletNetTrainer program is an accessible, automatic ballet instructor that can supplement traditional guidance with specific and easily applicable feedback. There are several notable takeaways from this study. Our novel angle- based approach to pose correction involves a Feature Angle Extraction (FAE) system and the generation of a teacher model. The FAE system developed for BalletNetTrainer selects the groups of angles most relevant to the evaluation of a dancer’s technique through a Random Forests Classifier. It is observed that the torso, shoulders, hip, and arm angles were the quantitative evaluation of the importance of the predictor variables. Those features have been assessed in various professional videos to identify a suitable teacher model. Comparison of the user’s data to this model allows BalletNetTrainer to provide potential improvements targeting particular features of the user’s pose. Unlike programs that rely on CNN and feature maps, BalletNetTrainer stores angle data to encode the position and orientation of the user.

(ii) analyze the various barriers affecting establishing a safe pharmaceutical supply chain and the critical success factors to overcome those barriers. (iii) develop a conceptual framework for showing the influence of technologies and success factors on overcoming the various barriers in different phases of the pharmaceutical supply chain. recent statistics show that counterfeit drugs will continue to penetrate the legitimate pharmaceutical supply chains and target more significant patient segments. furthermore, smugglers and counterfeiters will also continue to target all phases of the pharmaceutical supply chain. this study developed a conceptual framework for achieving a safe psc by demonstrating the influence of traceability technologies and success factors on overcoming the various barriers in different phases of the psc. the critical finding of this review was that the traceability technologies and the critical success factors have a significant influence on overcoming the barriers in establishing a safe psc.",drug counterfeit,,"mona haji, laoucine kerbache and mahaboob sheriff k m logistics and supply chain department - college of science and engineering hamad bin khalifa university doha, qatar mhaji@hbku.edu.qa, lakerbache@hbku.edu.qa, mkhadermuhammad@hbku.edu.qa",
71,Data-Driven Throughput Bottleneck Analysis In Production  Systems,"manufacturing companies are increasingly adopting digital solutions to monitor and manage production systems. by adopting digital solutions, it has become possible for manufacturing companies to collect huge volumes of widely varying production system data. alongside this, significant advances in recent years in machine learning and artificial intelligence fields have opened up opportunities to develop data-driven approaches for analyzing the huge emerging volumes of data, deriving insights, and using those insights to improve shop floor productivity. one way to increase shop floor productivity is to strive to achieve an even flow within production systems. however, even system flows may be disturbed by throughput bottlenecks. throughput bottlenecks are a set of machines that constrain the system throughput. quick and correct identification of throughput bottlenecks will help practitioners plan appropriate eliminating actions. existing academic research efforts to investigate throughput bottlenecks have largely adopted analytical approaches (based on building explicit recursive equations) or discrete-event simulation-model-based ones. these approaches are better suited for static analysis and more useful for early configurations of the production systems. on the other hand, now that companies are collecting huge volumes of digital data, this data can be analyzed directly by developing data-driven approaches. this allows the derivation of insights into throughput bottlenecks in production systems. this doctoral thesis constructs a series of data-driven approaches to analyze throughput bottlenecks. firstly, a data-driven approach is proposed to identify historical throughput bottlenecks in a production system. but merely identifying bottlenecks is not enough if informed actions are to be taken. secondly, a data-driven approach is proposed for diagnosing historical throughput bottlenecks. specifically, a diagnosis is made based on a maintenance perspective. combined with identification and diagnosis, practitioners may then plan and execute different corrective actions. however, when such corrective actions are applied, the dynamics of the production system change. that means that bottlenecks will not act as bottlenecks in the future. thirdly, to thus predict how the system dynamics will change (and thereby to predict future throughput bottlenecks), a data-driven approach is proposed to predict future throughput bottlenecks in a production system. fourthly, to help practitioners plan for proactive actions on the predicted throughput bottlenecks, a further data-driven approach is proposed; one which prescribes actions to combat the bottlenecks. the different data-driven approaches proposed in this thesis have been tested using production system data sets extracted from different real-world production systems. the insights obtained from applying these approaches may help practitioners to better understand the dynamics of throughput bottlenecks and plan for specific actions to eliminate them. such elimination helps achieve an even flow in production systems, thus increasing productivity. the research outcomes of this thesis were implemented in the real world. two automotive manufacturing companies (one in sweden and one in germany) have implemented a datadriven approach to detect historical throughput bottlenecks. a us-based manufacturing analytics software provider has implemented the data-driven approach to detect historical bottlenecks into their package. they provide it directly to their different customers who are using their software.","production system, italy",,"mukund subramaniyan chalmers university of technology gothenburg - 41279, sweden",
72,Using Aspen Plus To Simulate Pharmaceutical Processes –  An Aspirin Case Study,"the use of chemical process simulators such as aspen plus for pharmaceutical applications has received relatively little attention. this is due, in part, to the specialized raw materials, products and unit operations that are involved in the processes. this paper illustrates that the aspen plus simulation system has many of the functional capabilities that make it an attractive tool for simulating pharmaceutical processes. these features include solids handling capabilities, batch processing, drying, process optimization including data reconciliation and parameter estimation, and finally cost estimation including capital and operating costs. these features are demonstrated using a process to manufacture the common over-the-counter pharmaceutical commonly referred to by its trade name, aspirin. aspirin also known as asa or acetylsalicylic acid is one of the oldest pharmaceuticals in wide spread use today and it is relatively simple to manufacture. however, the simulation of the process using traditional chemical process simulators is not straightforward and exhibit several difficulties involved in solids handling and batch processing. the synthesis of asa is based on the acetylation of salicylic acid with acetic anhydride: c7h6o3 + c4h6o3 → c9h8o4 + ch3cooh salicylic acid + acetic anhydride → acetylsalicylic acid + acetic acid the reactants (salicylic acid and acetic anhydride) are mixed together with a small amount of sulphuric acid (h2so4) acting as a catalyst. the mixture is then heated to about 50 °c to increase the reaction kinetics. the liquid mixture of unreacted salicylic acid and acetic anhydride along with acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid products are then fed into a crystallizer operated about 3 °c. the objective of the crystallizer is to precipitate dissolved asa into solid asa by cooling the solution below the solubility limit. a hydro-cyclone is then employed to separate the solid asa from the solid-liquid stream by spinning the mixture at high velocity. the cyclone separates the solid asa from the solid-liquid stream while allowing about 15 % of the supernatant liquid to remain with the solid stream. the solid asa plus supernatant stream are finally dried to ~ 17 wt.% moisture (dry basis) which is typical in asa dryers. aspen plus was used to simulate a process designed to produce 145 kg/h of asa. based on this case study it was found that this process was able to convert about 78 wt.% of the reactants to asa product at a production cost of approximately $3/kg. based on this preliminary feasible process, process improvements in the form of optimization and process control were undertaken including studying the effect of the reactor temperature and recycle split fraction on the process operation and economics. heat exchanger network synthesis and the production rate were also investigated.","process simulation, pharmaceuticals, aspen plus, aspirin production",,"alisa douglas integrated biomedical engineering mcmaster university hamilton, on l8s 4l8, canada dougla5@mcmaster.ca ali elkamel department of chemical engineering university of waterloo waterloo, on, n2l 3g1, canada aelkamel@uwaterloo.ca",
73,Rational Decision-Making In Purchasing Medical Devices,"medical device procurement is a complex process that involves the selection of the product and its supplier. hospital management tends to make medical device purchasing decisions by predominantly relying on healthcare professionals’ experiences and observational trials on the devices. this study proposes a decision support model to purchase medical devices and compares the findings from different approaches. the study uses topsis and fuzzy- topsis methods to evaluate six mechanical ventilators under eight criteria. the results revealed that topsis and fuzzy-topsis approaches ranked alternatives in the same order at each scenario, except the fourth and fifth alternatives being in different ranking order. this study, once again, highlights the value of mcdm methods in rational decision making in purchasing medical devices. the study suggests that integrating fuzzy logic, gathering a team of experts and determining multiple scenarios have value in supporting decision-making.","decision-making, medical devices","The need for quick and rational decision-making has been boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a need increased the potential value of MCDM methods in healthcare. This study provided a case study for applying TOPSIS and fuzzy-TOPSIS methods in purchasing mechanical ventilators and compared the findings from these two approaches. The results showed that “M5” is the ideal alternative under the given two scenarios. As M5 was ranked first in both scenarios, this represents its dominance among other alternatives. This study proposed a decision-making approach to overcome the limitations of the MCDM methods. MCDM methods have been used to select, classify or prioritize alternatives. However, their use might not always be reliable. The use of different MCDM methods might lead to different rankings on alternatives. In turn, this would affect the decisions made, especially in prioritizing alternatives. The study suggests that integrating fuzzy logic, gathering a team of experts and determining multiple scenarios could improve the outputs from the MCDM methods. In conclusion, this study provides a step-by-step guide on applying the proposed approach for rational decision- making. Decision-makers can use the proposed approach in different settings to manage COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies can be conducted by involving multiple subject matter experts actually to evaluate the mechanical ventilators. MCDM methods can also be beneficial to decide which vaccination product to purchase for the national immunization program and enforce COVID-19 restrictions.","gulsum kubra kaya faculty of engineering and natural sciences, industrial engineering istanbul medeniyet university istanbul, 34700, turkey kubra.kaya@medeniyet.edu.tr",

From this perspective, the work carried out in this article focused on developing an energy dashboard interface to analyze, with synthetic data sets, the electricity consumption patterns of the main manufacturing processes of a Canadian sawmill, through various integrated EnPIs and statistical control methods. The results obtained after applying this energy dashboard interface to the case study of the Canadian sawmill revealed that the operational controls and energy strategies to be deployed at all organizational levels will depend entirely on the type of information that can be accessed. Indeed, when numerical information systems feed the energy dashboard interface, it is possible to monitor and control electricity consumption patterns, identify excessive variations in energy use, detect anomalies, develop better decision-making, map processes energy savings, establish relationships between production outputs and consumed electricity, make predictions, and define energy targets for future improvements. However, when only the electricity bill is used, the analysis possibilities become limited and only rely on the analysis of simple and approximate EnPIs, which makes it difficult to understand the true nature of energy problems. Ultimately, the energy dashboard interface is an operational guide that supports decision-making with dynamic graphics and visualizations that make it easier to interact with information. However, only through deductive reasoning, knowledge of processes, and field experience will it be possible to draw effective conclusions for operational energy improvements. This energy interface can also be easily adapted and applied to other industrial sectors as long as they have the necessary information to exploit it. The application of this tool should continue to be validated in more sawmills and case studies to further improve its interface. In future research, other types of energy sources could be added to the interface to provide a complete picture of a sawmill’s energy profile. It would also be pertinent to fully integrate the interface with the information systems to automate data processing and be easily shared through cloud systems at all organizational levels.","thomas hernández, nadia lehoux, louis gosselin department of mechanical engineering université laval quebec city, qc, canada thomas-antonio.hernandez-gutierrez.1@ulaval.ca nadia.lehoux@gmc.ulaval.ca, louis.gosselin@gmc.ulaval.ca",

This improvement should include the planning and application of practical programs for students and instructors’ involvement. The current situation demands administrators, faculty members, and the University of Jeddah eLearning center to take the initial step to involve students through the educational process and continuous improvement in the learning methods. We observed that most participants tend to prefer taking electronic exams instead of paper ones during our journey. It may be wise to first check into the interest of knowing the students’ preferences and opinions toward electronic exams through electronic surveys to obtain outcomes that form a clear strategy to build an appropriate infrastructure of electronic exams application. Adopting electronic exams is assumed to have a better exam evaluation, students’ comfortability, and environmental sustainability. 9.2 Recommendation for Future Research The findings of this study revealed the need for answers to many questions related to University of Jeddah students’ preferences toward electronic exams. These answers, along with the present study’s findings and the previous research, could provide the basis for strong and effective student involvement in higher education.

77,Conflict Minerals Supplier Due Diligence Process  Improvement,"electronic companies, which use conflict minerals to manufacture products, experience increasing operational burdens on 3tg traceability and compliance. identifying strategies to hit 75% supplier responses, lessening manual processes, reducing high-risk and non-compliant smelters in the supply chain, could improve the supplier due diligence process. data collection and analytical review were used to identify helpful strategies and impacts. surveys and training to suppliers were conducted as well to gather best practices and help them to comply. lastly, a knowledge-based system development was proposed. overall, this revealed that focusing on top spend and a smaller number of suppliers and working with other companies to identify strategies and develop a conflict-free supply chain would be a great approach. interestingly, it was also found that active smelters are now proactively engaging with the rmi audit protocols and, suppliers (both rmi and non-rmi members), are now getting aggressive to have high-risk smelters be removed from their supply chain. design of a conflict minerals automated system has been started as well to reduce manual process that contributes to low supplier response rate and inaccurate conflict minerals data. future tests and study to identify and verify efficiency results to end-users is recommended in this research.","conflict minerals, 3tg, due diligence, compliance","This study aimed to create improvements in the present Conflict Minerals due diligence processes. Firstly, the comparison of the conflict minerals supplier response rate trend from 2015-2020 shows that KPIs implemented per year contributed to the significant increase in response rate. Though the response rate trend increases per year, it was still not enough for the company to hit the target of 75% response rate. This resulted to problem identification which is manual processes taking place in the department which lead to the proposal of an automated system. Secondly, looking at the form SD of some US public companies were an effective means to identify due diligence strategies and identify and manage risks throughout the entire mineral supply chain. Companies had exercised a due diligence on the smelter or refiners, and they had also focused their outreach on smaller number of suppliers. This research is purposely limited by research framework. Information gathered are publicly available. Working together with other major manufacturers to develop conflict-free supply chains would be a great approach. Additionally, the author analyzed whether RMI member suppliers have a better supplier due diligence process than non-RMI member suppliers by conducting survey and t-test analysis. It was found that non-RMI members do not have a less comprehensive supplier due diligence process than suppliers who are RMI members. This means that any company could do its part of reducing high-risk smelters in their supply chain by having corrective actions for these bad smelters and directly contacting its suppliers and smelters. Data validation and development of corrective action plan to mitigate risks in supply chain will help improve due diligence process and transparency. It will also help downstream companies to influence upstream companies. In addition, this study proposes that companies must establish not only a management system to support supply chain due diligence related to 3TG but also an automated system designed for conflict minerals. This led to the development of conflict minerals knowledge-based system (KBS) by the author. The implementation of the KBS, as the company believes, would be significant for them to hit its target response rate of 75% within this year. This methodology, however, is limited only to system requirements gathering until prototyping. The KBS methodology was developed starting when the author analyzed the case background of the project and conducted problem analysis to know the core problem and its root cause(s). As previously discussed, the conflict minerals KBS is limited only to system requirements collection and strategy selection and overall design of conflict minerals KBS. This study opens to the exploration of the rest of the process in KBS methodology. Through the new automated system of the conflict minerals team, it is expected that they would be able to hit, and even exceed their target response rate and data reliability. In addition, the management will be more efficient, and the employees would be more productive in the business. These results hopefully affect the customer satisfaction rating of the company since it will provide more accuracy and faster services to the customers. Since the company still in its planning phase, the author suggests future tests, monitoring, and study to identify and verify efficiency results such as survey to end users. This will determine whether also the proposed system will be acceptable to users or not.","diana joy callangan, maria victorina rada, and ma. janice gumasing master of engineering – industrial engineering mapua university 658 muralla st, intramuros, manila 1002 metro manila, philippines djrcallangan@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mvdrada@mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",

79,"An Evaluation Of Supply Chain Management Performance  And Its Impact On Production Companies In Sierra Leone,","the study aimed to evaluate supply chain management (scm) performance and its impact on production, using g. shankerdas & sons sierra leone ltd as a case study and clarified the key success factors that led the company to achieve high supply chain performance. supply chain management (scm) is a link that connects each element of the manufacturing processes right from the production phase to the delivery phase and to the end-user (customers) with fulfilling the quality triangle; that is, within optimized cost, minimal time and required quality. the key success factors comprise the relationships with customers and suppliers, information technology (it), material flow management, corporate culture and performance measurement. questionnaires were the main instruments for the study, and distributed to participants. the study employs descriptive analysis and explanations of data. the findings show that relationships exist between it, management support, environmental uncertainty, value-added process and performance measurement and scm performance, but not for corporate culture. it would be of recommendation that future study will determine additional success factors that are pertinent to the firm’s current scm strategies and directions, competitive advantages and missions.","supply chain (sc), production, performance","Based on the topic under consideration, a problem statement was developed with a specific objective in mind, and data was collected, presented, analyzed, and interpreted. From the research findings, it is concluded that the SCM systems have a very great impact on the aspects of productivity, profitability and the overall performance of the operations. outsourcing, IT, strategic partnership and management support affected the performance of the production sector. In terms of outsourcing, lack of expertise, high-quality services and strict timelines influenced performance to a great extent; lack of expertise in the production industries affected the performance of production in mobilization to executing competitive strategies. As a result, the role of IT influenced the implementation of competitive strategies in the manufacturing industries because it pushed for the adoption of appropriate roles that improved the company's performance. Proper strategic partnerships affect the performance of production companies. Finally, it can be said that globalization affects performance through its advantages and its roles. The researchers also believes that the operations of the unit are caused by several problems but have hastened to suggest recommendations through which these problems can be mitigated. 6. Recommendations Based on the findings of the study, it is recommended that institutions should improve the mode of outsourcing for them to meet the needs of their customers and to ensure they receive their goods on time. They should choose a mode that is appropriate and will maximize the goals and objectives of the organization to enable the execution of the competitive strategies in place that enhance performance. Further, it is recommended that using technology that does not support the crucial realization of objectives should be sidestepped by first ensuring that all employees are well inducted into their roles and space in service delivery by using the appropriate technology. Because information technology is the primary source of improvement in the supplier-customer relationship, the flow of information and access to information should be a top priority. The company should also ensure they frequently embark on training staff in the form of workshops in other to overcome the challenges that hinder production.

80,The Impact Of Covid-19 On Indonesian Infrastructure  Companies: Determine The Company'S Survival Strategy,"covid-19 was declared a widespread pandemic by the world health organization (who) in early march 2020. it was first discovered in china and quickly spread across the world, prompting world governments to take strict steps to isolate cases and slow the virus's transition rate. indonesia government is trying to keep growth and welfare impacts from leading to a very severe scenario. this research aims to understand the impact of covid-19 towards the infrastructure sector in indonesia and to identify strategies used in infrastructure companies to survive during covid-19 by empirical study. covid-19 has negative impacts on revenue and expenses of the top nine infrastructure companies in indonesia. however, most companies applied defensive strategies as their acts to survive and intensive strategy as their act to retain the source of revenue.","defensive strategy, intensive strategy","Covid-19 has negative impacts on revenue and expenses of infrastructure companies in Indonesia. However, most companies applied defensive strategies as their acts to survive. From top 9 infrastructure companies, we found that Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk and PP (Persero) Tbk has the lowest decline of the annual revenue and lowest expense-revenue ratio. Best practice done by Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk was defensive strategies such as limiting the operational activities, postpone some infrastructure construction, reduce overhead and administration cost, evaluate and prioritize work programs through all businesses, and shifting operation schedule. In addition, they also maintain communication with banks and other financial institutions to ensure standby facilities. On the other hand, to save the financial condition, PP (Persero) Tbk reduce production costs, tight money policy, CAPEX efficiency, debts restructuration, merge in internal organization and assets divestment. Despite the unpredictable condition during Covid-19, the companies still have the optimism to develop their market by applying intensive strategies. In first-half 2020, PP (Persero) Tbk was pursuing new contracted projects and they focused on receivable collections to fulfil their annual target. What Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk has done in second-half 2020 was prioritizing both operational and capital expense to road-maintenance, and they also initiating new projects of highway construction. The limitation of this research was focusing only on revenue and sales expense performance. We emphasize the empirical study about the infrastructure sector in Indonesia. The future research may consider the additional information such as tax incentive from government, debt payable and other investment activities done by the company.

82,Impact Of Strategy On The Operational And Financial  Performances Of An Indonesian Coal Mining Company,"in light of the emergence of covid-19 pandemic, public life and industrial sectors have been significantly restricted as the attempt to curb the spread of the pandemic, which reduced the overall world energy demand. this study aims to explore the impact of competitive strategy on the operational and financial performances of an indonesian coal mining company during covid-19 pandemic. this study takes adaro energy as the object of the case study with analysis on operational aspects including coal production, sales volume, overburden removal, and lost time injury frequency rate. while financial data is analyzed by using the method formulated in decree of ministry of state owned company kepmen 100/mbu/2002, where eight financial indicators that cover profitability, liquidity, activity, and solvability are used to calculate companies’ financial health. through this study, it is found that adaro energy’s operational and financial performances were negatively impacted by the covid-19 pandemic, however, it is also found that adaro energy’s cost leadership strategy implementation was able alleviate the negative impact of the pandemic and assisted the company in maintaining its performances. therefore, this study helps to understand the concept of how the appropriate competitive strategy could assist organizations in navigating under rapid changes and uncertainty in their industries.","strategy, performance, coal, energy","In 2020, to Adaro Energy reduced its coal production target by 10 % to 52 – 54 million tons. Adaro Energy's annual coal production in 2020 decreased by 6 % y-o-y to 54.53 million tons, coal sales in 2020 decreased by 9% y- o-y to 54.14 million tons, and total overburden removal in 2020 decreased by 23% y-o-y. They are in line with the company's guidance to lower the company's ratio to better cost control under challenging situations arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The company's Health, Safety and Environmental team also implemented a number of internal initiatives and regulations in order to curb the spread of COVID-19 which is critical to business continuity. Adaro Energy recorded a high safety performance in 2020. Adaro Energy recorded no fatalities, and achieved LTIFR (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rates) of 0.01, out of a total of 74,360,750 hours of working hours. The financial performance of Adaro Energy which was also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can be measured by the method formulated in the Decree of the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises KEPMEN 100/MBU/2002. The result shows that Adaro Energy's performance in 2016 – 2019 can be categorized as healthy with AA grade and decreased in 2020 to grade A with total weight of 66. The decrease of Adaro Energy’s financial health in 2020 is primarily caused by the decline of average global thermal coal prices by US$ 17.10/ton (Indexmundi, 2020) and average Indonesian thermal coal prices by US$ 19.72/ton (Directorate General of Mineral and Coal, 2020) y-o-y. The price decline was attributed to the decrease in global coal demand in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.

84,Sourcing Strategies For Adopting In-House Additive  Manufacturing (Am) In The Automotive Supply Chain –,"additive manufacturing (am) is recognized by many supply chain professionals and global automakers as the best alternatives to manage disruptions and boost automotive supply chain resilience. a semi-structured interview was conducted among indian auto firms’ industry experts to determine the current status of am implementation in the indian auto industry. the industry experts of indian and foreign-based automakers operating in india have suggested in-house am production to tackle the upstream automotive supply chain’s complexity during disruptions. this choice’s significant cause is to protect the auto components’ design secrecy from private exposure and retain the firm’s competitive advantage. in addition, the overall difficulties prevailing in the outsourcing activities, particularly in the upstream automotive supply chain due to various uncertain events such as covid-19, also influenced their choice towards in-house am production. hence, it is necessary to analyze the feasibility of initiating in-house am production in the upstream automotive supply chain for the post-covid-19 unusual scenario. the resource-based view (rbv) and knowledge-based view (kbv) of strategic sourcing are suitable for establishing in-house am production in the oem’s plant location. in this regard, a step-wise procedure has been proposed to guide oem’s management towards significant adoption of in-house am production. the rbv theory states that resources and capabilities have to be precious, unique, and organizationally active to achieve sustainable competitive advantage. the kbv theory, an extension of rbv theory, states that intangible resources, such as human capital and knowledge, are a firm’s unique resources to help achieve a competitive advantage. as per the rbv/kbv theories, the firms may contract outsourcing with the leading resource and knowledge providers to pass knowledge and resources currently not owned by the firm. with the guidance of rbv/kbv theories, oem’s management has to make a short-term collaboration with an am service provider to transfer the knowledge, human capital, and other resources from them to oem. this short-term collaboration may help oem to develop its internal capabilities with the knowledge and resource transfer offered by the am service provider. similarly, oem can benefit from hiring technical personnel from the am service provider to develop its employees’ knowledge and technical skills on am. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management rome, italy, august 2-5, 2021 © ieom society international 830",,,a post-covid-19 perspective mahaboob sheriff khader muhammad hamad bin khalifa university (hbku) qatar mkhadermuhammad@hbku.edu.qa laoucine kerbache hamad bin khalifa university and hec paris qatar lakerbache@hbku.edu.qa,
85,Porter’S Five Generic Strategies: A Case Study From  Indonesia Automotive Industry Against Covid-19,"the automotive industry is one of the largest and most complex industries around the world. the automotive industry needs to implement a long-term strategy for the company. before the covid-19 pandemic emerged, the automotive industry was projected to witness steady growth through the course of this decade. to restore the demand for the automotive industry in indonesia, the government will provide financial incentives in the form of a reduction in sales tax on luxury goods rates. the research methodology in this article uses analytical hierarchy process (ahp), and qualitative analysis (segmentation and swot). in addition, porter’s strategy was utilized in this article to analyze automotive industry attractiveness from an outside-in perspective during the covid-19 pandemic. to do so, a case study approach on indonesia's automotive industry firms, e.g., toyota and daihatsu were employed. the analysis result acknowledged the application of porter's generic strategies to automotive industry firms to achieve competitive advantage and proved the positive impact of generic strategies on firms' financial performance. this research contributes to existing research by suggesting porter's generic strategies in the indonesian automotive industry.","automotive industry, covid-19","By using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool, Toyota and Daihatsu in Indonesia are concluded using a Cost Leadership strategy. This conclusion is proven by the segmentation analysis which stated that Daihatsu segmented a relatively cheaper car market with the smallest price range. It is indicating that Daihatsu using focuses on a very specific market. It can conclude that the strategy used by Daihatsu is Cost Leadership Low-Cost. Meanwhile, Toyota is on the top brand. So that the strategy used by Toyota is Cost Leadership Best Value. Based on the SWOT analysis, it shows that the Automotive Industry during the Covid-19 pandemic was in quadrant I, which is the position of companies that support aggressive strategies. So, in general, the automotive industry still has many opportunities to reach the target market and the number of automotive sales in Indonesia.","wirawan pratama suwardi, timotius candra kusuma, bagas muhamad kartiko department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, 16424, indonesia wirawan.pratama@ui.ac.id, timotius.candra@ui.ac.id, bagas.muhamad01@ui.ac.id",

87,The Applicability Of Porter'S Generic Strategies In   E-Commerce Companies: Study Case In Indonesia,"e-commerce is playing a more significant part in the indonesian economy. (rashidirad, salimian, soltani, & fazeli, 2017) shows that an e-business without a clear competitive strategy is very unlikely to outperform; so that in order to succeed in the increasingly competitive environment of e-business, firms would need to carefully develop and implement successful competitive strategies. competitive advantage grows fundamentally out of value a firm is able to create for its buyers that exceed the firm's cost of creating it. there is a general stream of strategy research that assesses strategy and firm performance (dess & davis, 1984; fahey & christensen, 1986; miller & cardinal, 1994; kim & lim, 1988). considering its nature and objectives, the case study method will be considered as a suitable method for this research. the paper suggests that although cost leadership strategy is able to generate greater performance, pursuing a differentiation strategy can be more worthwhile and sustainable for e-commerce companies compared to cost leadership strategy. this research contributes to existing research by suggesting porter's generic strategies as a valid and viable model for pure online firms which operate in the current e-business environment.",,"If you refer to data from iPrice, Tokopedia is currently the most popular marketplace in Indonesia with the highest download rate on the Play Store (see table).

Both of these companies have gained the competitive advantage which can be seen from the financial performance, including ROA, ROE, profit margin and operating margin. Both of the companies have various types of products with the various prices that they offer to the customer. Indofood and Mayora always do innovation and try to develop their product so they can maintain their position in the market. It is also important for the FMCG company to regularly evaluate and try to improve the generic strategy along the value chain of the company, so they can gain a sustainable competitive advantage. According to the financial calculation, Mayora has the higher value in ROA, ROE, and profit margin, while Indofood has the higher value in the operating margin. Mayora implementation of Porter’s generic strategies have a better positive impact to the financial performance of the company compared to Indofood. However, the investigation of this study is based on the limited secondary data that the data and information were collected from the online source and the annual report of the companies. To get a better and more comprehensive analysis, future study should conduct more broad research, including the primary data and the more information directly from the companies, so that the data obtained can be more accurate.","hanoum salsabila, mutia perwita sari, wendy febrianty mardhiyah, raisha dinita industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, depok 16424 hsalsabila@gmail.com, mutia.perwitasari24@gmail.com, wendyfbrnty@gmail.com, raishadinita@gmail.com",
93,Lean And Green Modelling In Healthcare Supply Chains:  The Case Of Massive Covid-19 Vaccine Distribution,"in more than 100 years, the first global pandemic covid-19 has proliferated all over the world at an unprecedented speed. the biopharmaceutical industry is moving fast to discovering a vaccine while governments scaling up to overcome the complex task of a global vaccination program. now the race is on to organize supply chains to distribute billions of vaccines around the world. the logistic of the distribution vaccine requires a huge amount of people, transportation equipment, and storage equipment for low temperatures to handle the highly perishable vaccine. the process requires a just-in-time environment to get the population as fast as possible, in the right conditions for each one of the individuals that need to take the vaccine. this is huge shipping, transportation, and distribution challenge. it inspired us to reflect on the requirements of a massive covid-19 vaccine distribution; and to contribute to the process improvement, adapting previous research work on lean and green supply chain modelling. considering the high number of challenges, this work intends to develop a lean and green model for the healthcare supply chain. an overview of developing the coronavirus vaccine supply chain, identifying and systematizing recent trends, and the impact of covid-19 on global supply chain management is considered. how lean and green supply chain practices can help in the vaccine supply chain.","covid-19 vaccine, covax facility, healthcare","COVID-19 is the greatest global shock in the last decades. Responding to the COVID 19 pandemic requires global cooperation among international organizations, governments, and local communities. Technology solutions shared between governments, logistics providers, and healthcare providers are needed to reach the end of this pandemic and move towards the “next normal” (World Economic Forum, 2021). Collaboration at an unprecedented level among all parties involved in the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is critical to success. As we move into the future, it is vital to use what has been learned from recent events to prepare for the future. Our study stresses that to deliver vaccines, all parties involved – pharmaceutical companies, logistical partners, and governments – must work together to create a “cold chain” of freezers and temperature-controlled shipping methods that ensures vaccines are kept at a precise temperature. Both the Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer vaccines need to be kept frozen and must rely on the cold supply chain to get anywhere. Only wealthy countries have the resources to implement an adequately developed cold chain, leaving back the poorer countries and the remote parts of the world where electricity is unavailable or spotty to provide mechanisms to keep vaccines at low temperatures. A conceptualization between the fields of action lean and green supply chain and Covid-19 supply chain was presented in this study. The lean and green supply chain practices help to define the massive Covid-19 vaccine distribution. This contributes to the discussion of how modeling lean and green supply chain to help to get a massive vaccine administration. Several new research can be developed around this topic. Understand which practice is more important in the vaccine distribution and which has a high impact to respond faster to the vaccination need, can be the next step around this research.

97,A Decision Support System For Production Planning In  Tyre Balancing Machines,"this project is a case study developed in a real industrial context of a company in the automotive industry dedicated to tyre manufacturing. the high quantity of items associated with a limited production capacity in the balancing section leads to a significant increase in production planning activity complexity. the allocation of products to the balancing machines is done daily by workers who use only spreadsheets, taking a significant part of their day in a time- consuming and complex activity. to evaluate the usage of the installed capacity of the machines and to minimise the setups in the equipment, a decision support system (dss) based on optimisation models is developed. having as input the items that need to be tested, the dss suggests an optimal configuration of the equipment that will minimise the setups and guarantee that all tyres are tested, facilitating the daily routine of production planners. this article describes the problem, the mathematical model of linear programming that is the basis of the dss. it presents the results obtained after testing the system in a real context.","planning, tyre manufacturing, preparation","All things considered it can be concluded that the goal of developing a DSS that helps to evaluate the capacity of the balancing section was achieved. Through the developed decision support system, it is possible to assess if the production plan is feasible and also what changes need to be made to make it feasible. The linear programming model fulfills the requirement that was assigned to it. The computational testing and evaluation of the DSS by future users were performed near the end of the project, which led to a late identification of small gaps and prevented the improvement of some aspects. Therefore, there are some future works that can be taken into consideration. As far as the linear programming model is concerned, it would be interesting to reformulate it in order to suit better the company’s context by considering consider the distribution of the workload between all the machines This means that it would be necessary to add new constrains and objectives functions to the model that would minimise the standard deviation of the remaining capacity of the equipment, preventing some equipment from being down.

102,The Impact Of Cost Leadership Strategy On Sales Volume In  The Era Of Covid-19 Pandemic: A Case Study Of Baby,"the covid-19 pandemic has limited many human activities, including the buying and selling process. it makes many companies experience a decline in sales and even go bankrupt. this paper takes the example of a baby product company to explore the impact of competitive strategies on sales volume in the era of the covid-19 pandemic. based on the analysis, the baby product company's sales volume has decreased, but not significantly. the company is still able to survive with the cost leadership strategy implemented. this research paper aims to study the cost leadership strategy and analyze the benefits of adopting such strategies on baby product companies. in addition, this paper also provides views on how companies must respond to crises such as covid-19 to survive.","strategy, cost leadership, with 270","Based on the analysis above, the baby product company's sales volume has decreased in 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019, but it is not significant. The cost leadership strategy pursued by baby products companies can survive the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. One interesting thing is that baby product companies experienced a positive impact from panic buying during the January to March 2020 period. In that period, baby product companies experienced an increase in sales compared to 2019 and 2021. This company implements the cost leadership strategy-best value to give the lowest price with the best value offered. The focus of the cost leadership strategy should be to optimize the cost structure and reduce the cost, rather than blindly reduce the product price. Enterprises with the same strategy will inevitably lead to a price war. Suppose the enterprise takes the lead in reducing the price to a minimum value, and the current cost is not enough to support the continued reduction of the price. In that case, it will lead to malicious bidding by competitors and put the enterprise at a competitive disadvantage. At the same time, to optimize the cost structure, enterprises should also have unique management methods that are not quickly imitated by competitors, such as making subsidiaries in logistics. With a subsidiary in the logistics sector, the company was able to reduce costs and increase sales volume. The company is flexible in sending anywhere and anytime at a more affordable cost. A baby product company with a cost leadership-best value strategy is one example of a company that can withstand sudden attacks by COVID-19. Thousands of companies around the world have gone bankrupt due to COVID-19. The COVID-19 outbreak is likely to cause bankruptcy for many well-known brands in many industries as consumers stay at home and economies are shut down (Tucker 2020). In the US, famous companies such as Sears, JCPenney, Neiman Marcus, Hertz, and J. Crew are under enormous financial pressure. The travel industry is deeply affected; 80% of hotel rooms are empty (Asmelash and Cooper 2020), airlines cut their workforce by 90%, and tourism destinations are likely to see no profits in 2020. The era of the COVID-19 pandemic provides lessons for all companies, including baby product companies, to always be ready to face various challenges. Various strategic plans must be prepared to face other challenges in the future, including marketing strategy. Due to time constraints, this study has not explored different strategies and has not used data other than sales volume. In further research, research can be using other strategies such as differentiation strategy, focus strategy, or different strategies, and the study must use more data to be considered.","product company andi maulana, zulfaa irbah zain, and yafiazmi dhaniswara department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, 16424, indonesia andi.maulana01@ui.ac.id, zulfaa.irbah@ui.ac.id, yafiazmi.dhaniswara@ui.ac.id",

109,Pestle Analysis Of Indonesian Family Planning Board  (Bkkbn)'S Strategic Planning On Implementing Family,"indonesia has become the fourth most populated country in the world after china, india, and the united states with a total of 270.2 million people by 2020. many problems in different fields such as social, economic, health, education, and environmental could arise due to high population growth. one of the solutions that the indonesian government provides is the family planning program which is covered by the national population and family planning board (bkkbn). the institution is now facing the limitations caused by the global covid-19 pandemic and is working harder to ensure the completion of bkkbn’s strategic planning. the pestle analysis methodology is used to help analyze issues under political, economic, social, technology, legal and environment factors and their impact on this matter. our findings show that bkkbn could reach their success through several external factors, although may find challenges from some, and need to make crucial decisions towards several factors. though managed to assess bkkbn’s success factors, quantitative future research needs to be conducted.","pestle, economic","The purpose of this paper is to analyze the external influences on the success of the BKKBN strategic planning as outlined in the BKKBN strategic planning for the 2020-2024 period. Analysis of the barriers or support from political, economic, social, technology, legal and environment factors is done to see the possibility of success in the BKKBN strategic plan for the 2020-2024 period. These factors have been shown influencing the family planning programs, not specifically in Indonesia, but throughout the world. The success of BKKBN’s family planning programs should be seen through the implementation of the strategies and completion of targets. The findings of our research indicate that BKKBN has many positive future possibilities in implementing its strategies, as well as completing its strategic targets. In order to ensure the success of its strategy implementation for target achievement, BKKBN should put an effort in utilizing this supporting nature in implementing family planning programs. Some factors, however, could challenge BKKBN’s success. BKKBN should address threatening factors like corruption in their own body, economic instability, as well as more social challenges like religion and cultural beliefs. Current population problem could be a meaningful threat as well to BKKBN’s success. Other remaining factors are very dependable on how BKKBN could address them. Factors such as civilian trust, as well as political and economic decentralization could be a great boost in the success of family planning programs arranged by governmental bodies like BKKBN. But, just like a double-edged sword, they could be a major threat for this success. Ataullahjan et al. (2019) has shown how deteriorating civilian trust could put family planning programs into busts. This study managed to assess the potential supports and barriers to BKKBN’s strategy implementation and target completion. However, this paper faces limitations on sources, as many of the sourcing research papers are focusing on the family planning matters outside, not inside Indonesia, which is the base of BKKBN’s operation. The sources available also limited the coverage of our researched strategies, thus unable to see the implications of BKKBN’s whole strategies, even when we managed to cover all the targets. Since this paper has qualitatively analyzed the barriers or support for the success of the program, future researches may work on the quantitative analysis of the factors influencing.","planning program in indonesia nathaniel viandy dondokambey, valda aqila afranovka, yola lista valentina and laras safitri industrial engineering department universitas indonesia depok, indonesia nathanieldondokambey@gmail.com valdaqila@gmail.com yolalista5@gmail.com larassftr@gmail.com","references among new acceptors in malaysia, 1990 to 2018, Turkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics

110,Porter’S Generic Strategies On Food And Beverage Industry  In Indonesia During Covid-19 Pandemic: Cases Study,"this paper aims to explore strategies that food and beverage companies are implementing to increase the resilience and sustainability of production systems during the covid-19 pandemic. the study was conducted based on analysis of primary data which includes surveys and interviews and a review of secondary data which includes websites, academic journals, case studies, research reports, books, and annual reports. the findings revealed that the companies have taken different strategies during the covid-19 pandemic, due to shifting behavior on consumers that more activities are carried out at home to prevent the spread of the virus. porter's generic strategies adopted by the food and beverage companies have helped the company through the situation either in increasing or declining sales demand. this paper reveals that implementing a low-cost leadership strategy is essential for the success of a multinational beverage company that is experiencing a decline in demand while implementing a focus strategy is the best choice for sustainable production in the trend of increasing demand for a sugar refinery company.","focus strategy, covid-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has resulted in shifting behavior in the communities that more activities are carried out at home. Increased activity in the home also has an impact on changes in the level of consumption, especially food and beverage. The study shows that both Food and Beverage companies in Indonesia are affected by this shifting behavior, which causes the change in their sales demand. This condition has led the company to implement the strategy based on the impact to their sales volume. The identification shows that Porter's Generic strategy, especially Low-Cost Leadership strategy and Focus strategy has been adopted by the company to go through this period of COVID-19 in 2020, either to fulfill the increasing sales demand or come up through the declining sales demand. However, there is still room for improvement to the strategies, regarding the period of COVID-19 still not over yet in 2021.","approach ayu mandasari nasution, fery permadi h, yaumil khairoh department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia kampus ui depok ayu.mandasari@ui.ac.id",
111,Modeling Predictive Control Of Penicillin Bioreactors  Via Radial Basis Function Neural Networks,"this work was directed to the application of advanced machine learning and process control tools in an industrial penicillin production bioreactor. the developed algorithms were the principal component analysis (pca) method, for reducing data dimensionality, and radial basis function neural networks (rbfnn), directed to create a multivariable interpolation model to predict the bioreactor temperature. regarding the process control phase, the model predictive control (mpc) method was used, which aims to calculate a sequence of control actions capable of approximating the output variables with their respective set points in an optimized way. in this paper, information from a real industrial process of penicillin production was analyzed, dealing with a database composed of 27 variables to be treated. the gaussian radial base function gave the neural network model a better adaptation to the system. finally, the control actions calculated by the mpc controller resulted in the maintenance of the controlled variables in its respective set points in a gradual manner, without impacting the stability of the system.","neural networks, data science, bioreactor","Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the implementation of the neural network and the MPC controller via Python® were both satisfied and similarly successful. It was possible to observe the importance of such tools in the chemical process industry, not only related to the control of processes, but also through the deep analysis of the data that allows corporations to achieve higher quality and profitability margins. Regarding the development of the neural network, it was found through the principal components analysis (PCA) algorithm that the optimal number of variables that explained 95% of the data behavior was equal to 11, which decreased the computational effort to perform its calculations and simplified the interpretation of results. Such variables were the flowrates of sugar, soybean oil, phenylacetic acid, acid and base, dilution water, removed broth, aeration, pH and temperature. In addition, the application of the gaussian radial basis function resulted in a better fit to the experimental data, since the SSE value was the lowest among the other functions. Finally, the control actions calculated by the MPC controller resulted in the maintenance of the controlled variables (substrate concentration, reactor temperature) in its respective set points in a gradual manner, without impacting the stability of the system or exploring it, which would compromise the integrity of the raw materials and, consequently, the quality of the final product. Another point to note was that the control actions were performed within the specified limits, and that it performance metrics were superior when compared with other controller types.","lucas stracieria, hedia fgaierb, and ali elkamela achemical engineering department university of waterloo waterloo, on n2l3g1, canada bfull sail university, 3300 university blvd, winter park, fl 32792, united states & valencia college, 1800 s kirkman rd, orlando, fl 32811, united states lstracieri@uwaterloo.ca, hfgaier@alumni.uoguelph.ca, aelkamel@uwaterloo.ca",

113,Blockchain For Agri-Food Supply Chain Traceability,"the supply chains around the agri-food sector are, in economic terms, one of the most relevant activities at an international level, employing millions of people, mainly in developing countries. the complexity of this supply chain includes key aspects related to the identification of food, from origin to final consumption. this article conceptually describes a proposal for developing a traceability system based on blockchain and smart contracts as a disruptive technology, integrating tools for the consensus and participation of the parties involved in this supply chain. in this approach, incorporating the public participation geographic information system (ppgis) is proposed as an information management mechanism. the different entities for the supply chain are described, including the inclusion of logistics operators (3pl). the results show a model for the implementation of blockchain based on smart contracts and traceability tools such as ppgis. this proposal facilitates the development of logistical aspects to increase the competitiveness of the agri-food sector.","smart contract, logistics, in economic terms","The use of the Blockchain seeks to discourage data manipulation, preventing people from entering false or erroneous information or hiding information on the Blockchain. Although there are technologies based on the use of sensors and IoT devices to minimize the problems of capturing and obtaining information, Blockchain cannot, by itself, eliminate fraud in the food chain. When more available data is linked to the Blockchain, it will be easier to detect it, due to the possibility of using cross-checks and the immutability of the records. The great challenge for Blockchain in the agri- food supply chain is to connect the different technologies for traceability with models for decision-making, favoring the different entities that make up this sector. In addition, the PPGIS provides clear visualizations of the disparities in access to transportation and resources experienced by some imagined farming communities and allows a better understanding of ways to combat these disparities. Blockchain-based applications for the agro-food sector also look for aspects related to food safety, monitoring, and control of food quality. This proposal seeks to achieve traceability that favors reducing waste, the analysis of reliable operational data, and efficient exchanges of contracts and transactions to reduce economic costs, thus supporting small farmers. These applications can be developed using existing blockchain-based technology tools to facilitate quick and easy developments. Based on different implementation scenarios of these applications, other computational and cryptographic techniques can be connected to provide flexibility to meet the requirements of different users.

115,Framework Design On Health Care System Resilience:   A Fuzzy Ahp Approach,"an established resilient healthcare system is vital in any governmental structure to protect the public’s well-being during unexpected events such as occurrence of disasters. in the philippines, barangay is the basic political unit with immediate access to the people affected by disasters. this study aims to design a framework to determine the resilience of the healthcare system at the smallest local government unit using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy approach (fahp) approach. the fahp is used to establish the contributing factors and sub-factors in the design of a resilient healthcare system. the final results show that disaster preparedness as the main priority factor with a rating of 44.77%. service continuity followed far behind at 16.60%, and then followed closely by resources and recovery adaptation at 14.74% and 14.63%, respectively. safety and vulnerability came last in the prioritization ranking at 9.25%.","fuzzy ahp, framework design","and Recommendations The resilience healthcare system at a barangay level determines the capacity of the community to withstand the effects before, during, and after a disaster strikes it. This is in line with the disaster risk reduction and management objective that aims to prepare, train, and equip everyone in case a disaster strike. However, several circumstances such as mistaken prioritization of needs lead the community to fail to achieve such therefore resulting to more casualties. This research gives importance to the designing a framework that could identify the factors that affect the resiliency of the barangay’s healthcare system with the use of fuzzy AHP approach. From the results obtained, it can be seen that priorities vary from one barangay to another. Although the barangays under study are neighboring barangays with the same sets of needs, it is very evident that the way they look at priorities are different. The Fuzzy AHP model was used effectively in defining the differences in each. Furthermore, this study could be used for future","giselle joy esmeria*, mary jean azuela, dennis paul orge and mary grace valdez, *industrial engineering department de la salle university manila, philippines giselle.esmeria@dlsu.edu.ph",

117,Examining The Readiness To Adopt The Internet Of Things  And Big Data In Egyptian Companies,"recently most companies have realized the importance of using digital technologies, especially the internet of things and big data, as it has a great impact on several industries such as fast-moving consumer goods (fmcg), transportation/logistics, automotive, textiles and ready-made garments, pharmaceuticals, etc. before applying the internet of things and big data, companies must first assess the readiness to ensure successful implementation and avoid organization failure. the purpose of this research is to investigate the readiness of egyptian companies to adopt the internet of things and big data. thus, this research proposes the readiness model for the internet of things and big data which consists of nine factors: strategy, top management involvement and commitment, financial readiness, team readiness, technical richness/ skills, it readiness, data architecture, security, and data quality. this is a work in process research that will study the readiness of egyptian companies to adopt the internet of things (iot) and big data (bd). in this paper, the literature review and theoretical framework for assessing the iot and bd readiness of egyptian companies are presented.","big data (bd), egyptian companies",,"hams abd el-hamed college of management and technology, arab academy for science, technology and maritime transport, alexandria, egypt h.oraby5450@student.aast.edu sara el-zarka international transport and logistics institute, arab academy for science, technology and maritime transport, alexandria, egypt sara_elzarka@aast.edu sahar el-barky college of international transport and logistics, arab academy for science, technology and maritime transport, alexandria, egypt selbarky@aast.edu",
118,Inventory Management Sourcing Policy Selection: A Focus  On Wastewater Infrastructure,"the wastewater utility industry serves a critical function for a nation’s growth and is one of the essential pillars for a healthy infrastructure system. efficient operations and maintenance of wastewater infrastructure heavily rely on material and equipment available at the right time in the right quantities. therefore, making correct inventory management strategic decisions a paramount necessity to gain cost efficiencies. at present, a common practice in the industry for decision making is entirely dependent on the experience of the team or individuals in the decision-making process. in this research, strategic inventory management decision-making tools are developed for the wastewater utility industry. the tools include an inventory management maturity framework, a qualitative and quantitative material-specific inventory management sourcing policy selector. the maturity model developed takes into account criteria related to cost, culture, process, and technology from industry practitioners’ experience and their envisioned future. the qualitative decision-making tool is demonstrated using sample data intended to be acquired from a global survey. the quantitative decision tool is demonstrated by performing economic assessment simulations of various scenarios, by investigating a case study for inventory management sourcing policies, using in-house and performance-based contracts for mobile flood mitigation pumps. the findings highlight the selection decision should be driven by forecasted equipment utilization. with a trend indicating lower utilization is economical with outsourcing through performance based contract (pbc), while higher utilization is economical using the in-house option. at the same time, the cost parity point for the inventory management policies under investigation can vary according to the equipment output capacity, in this case, the flow rate. the tools developed in this research have the potential to be extended to other industries to assist in strategic decision making, where operations and maintenance works are performed.",uk,,"mohommed maharoof and dr. laoucine kerbache engineering management & decision sciences college of science and engineering hamad bin khalifa university (hbku) education city, qatar shazadlks@gmail.com, lakerbache@hbku.edu.qa",
119,Do Pandemic Related Datasets With High Artificial Control  Still Follow The Benford’S Law?,"benford’s law (bl) is being used extensively in research for several purposes including for the detection of potential manipulations of the data to detect fraud since datasets tend to follow the benford’s distribution when they occur naturally without artificial control. the covid-19 pandemic has heavily impacted business and non-business- related activities. datasets related to the pandemic are being used in many different analyses to arrive at different conclusions. however, the credibility of the results and conclusions depend heavily on the accuracy of the datasets. the covid-19 related datasets are obvious results of intense human intervention and artificial control efforts; therefore, the question arises as to whether benford’s analysis can still be used to detect anomalous datasets among them? this research uses several publicly available datasets and uses predictive analytics to perform the benford’s analysis. the applicability of bl is first verified using a regular dataset occurred prior to the pandemic, and then applied on covid-19 related datasets to test the research hypothesis. the results demonstrate that even the datasets with sufficiently large sample sizes with considerable human intervention and artificial control follow the benford’s distribution and that benford’s analysis can still detect the anomalous datasets. the findings are anticipated to be useful for the data analysts and researchers and adds to the current literature gap. this paper may also serve as a class case study for the academia teaching data analytics.","benford’s law, fraud signal","This study was conducted to answer the questions on “Do pandemic related datasets with high artificial control still follow the Benford’s law?” The study used several datasets, all >100 in sample size from several data sources. The findings suggest that any dataset with reasonably big enough sample size both with or without human intervention, obey the BL, and that Benford’s analysis can be used to identify anomalous datasets. The conformity can be visualized using graphs, and verified using statistical tests, and this study used the Chi-square and the Kupier tests. One of the post COVID-19 datasets failed both tests, and when its graph for the observed % of first digit vs the expected % in Benford’s was observed, this non-conformity was apparent because the distribution was not following the expected shape of an exponential curve. As per Todter (2009), the BL is a potentially useful instrument to discover fraud and manipulation, however there may be many plausible reasons for deviations from the BL, such as insufficient variability of the underlying data, rounding effects or other irregularities (Kraus and Valverde, 2014). According to Kraus and Valverde (2014), supply chain data as well as other data requires a detailed business know how for interpreting to prevent misinterpretations. Gaining insight into data requires careful extraction, presenting of information in a meaningful way, and the transformation of findings into actionable insights (Gole and Shiralkar, 2020). Therefore, the red flag raised from Benford’s analysis is another strong signal that caution should be practiced before making use of this dataset further. It is suggested in literature that any red-flags such as this should follow the ‘trust-but-verify’ approach before making conclusions. According to Koch, & Okamura (2020), the media frequently claim that the Chinese government has understated the numbers of those affected, and that it can be because the data sharing practices China had at the early stages of the pandemic were inadequate since they were affected first. The authors further state that the Chinese government was unable to test those who did not present at hospitals, and the testing capacities were limited. The results of this study showing anomaly in Chinese data therefore is justified, and it is clear that by applying BL on any dataset of reasonable size, presence of anomaly and irregularities can be identified. This study demonstrated the procedure to detect potential data anomalies using SAP Predictive Analytics tools. Since the process is simple, effective, and quick for the supply chain managers or auditors to detect red flags in their supply chain big data, they can follow in-depth to detect anomalies including fraud. The findings will support the managers/auditors with their preventive measures and/or the formulation of organizational policies. As it is more efficient to run the checks and store the results in the cloud with SAP Expert Analytics, analysts can perform more frequent checks on big data from the business world. While this article adds to the current lacuna in literature in this field, it may also be utilized as an SAP analytics software training guideline. Since the procedure is well detailed, and the dataset is openly accessible, the supply chain academia may use this as one of the class case studies. More future research on effective sample sizes, and a clear taxonomy may help the generation of a clear set of guidelines for organizations to apply the BL. Such initiative can help the organizations to avoid the unnecessary investigations and expenditure on ‘false-alarms’. With Benford’s analysis becoming more common in fraud detection, new complementary analyses are already introduced making it more difficult, even for informed swindlers intentionally conforming to the law to remain undetected (Gauvrit et al., 2017). These complementary analyses are also a another area generating more future research.","c. kalpani dissanayake assistant professor, department of business and economics, pennsylvania state university, 25 yearsley mill rd., media, pa 19063 usa ckd5250@psu.edu jay daniel program leader, msc global operations and supply chain management derby business school, university of derby kedleston rd, derby de22 1gb, uk j.daniel@derby.ac.uk",
120,Human Related Challenges In Lean Implementation: A Case  Of Sri Lankan Large Scale Contractors,"several studies reflect that, human related challenges are heavily impacting the successful lean implementation in the construction industry. hence, overcoming the human related challenges is one of the most prominent considerations to successfully implement lean concept in construction industry. accordingly, the aim of this paper is to investigate the human related challenges and strategies to overcome those challenges for successful implementation of lean concept in large-scale contractors in sri lankan construction industry. the qualitative research approach was followed, while case studies were selected as the research strategy. data was collected through in-depth interviews with fifteen respondents from three case studies and analysed using code-based content analysis with n-vivo 12 software. the study identified issues in human attitudes, unfamiliar with the new concepts, lack of knowledge, lack of commitment, unwillingness to adopt new culture, lack of communication, lack of networking and collaboration, lack of committed leadership as few of the key challenges for unskilled, craft, administrative & professional, and managerial level employees. among the identified key strategies, introduce new rules and regulations, provide training and motivation, conduct cpd and workshops on lean, enhance communication circle and provide lean performance- based promotions for unskilled, craft, administrative, and professional & managerial categories can be highlighted.",lean construction,"LC implementation of large-scale contractors in Sri Lanka is still in the infant stage due to several reasons. More importantly, LC is not seeming to be rigidly implementing within the large-scale contractors of Sri Lanka due to the challenges impacting the successful implementation. Among those, human related challenges are carrying a significant impact towards the successful LC implementation of large-scale contractors in Sri Lankan construction industry. This study assessed number of human related challenges to the successful implementation of LC from and extensive literature review and identified several human related challenges in the global context and as well the strategies to overcome those challenges. Later, due to the identified need of investigating human related challenges and strategies to overcome the challenges in successful implementation of LC of large-scale contractors in Sri Lankan construction industry, a case study approach was conducted. Accordingly, human related challenges have been identified with respect to the unskilled, craft, administrative, and professional & managerial level employees. Issues in human attitudes, unfamiliarity in new concepts, lack of knowledge, lack of commitment, unwillingness to adopt new culture, lack of communication, and poor house-keeping have been identified as human related challenges of unskilled levels workers. In addition to the aforementioned challenges, lack of team work and lack of self-confidence are the human related challenges identified in the craft level workers. When considering the administrative and professional & managerial level employees, issues in human attitudes, lack of knowledge, lack of awareness and understanding, lack of commitment, lack of interest in new concepts, and lack of networking & collaboration have been identified as human related challenges. Further, lack of committed leadership has been identified as a human related challenge significantly to the professional & managerial level employees. Finally, the strategies to overcome the human related challenges were identified to successfully implement LC in unskilled, craft, administrative, and professional & managerial level employees. Introduce new rules and regulations, providing on the job training, conducting motivational programs, providing welfare facilities, conducting on-site meetings, and maintaining proper house-keeping are some of the key strategies that have been proposed for unskilled and craft level workers. Additionally, the open-door policy, giving recognition and appreciating the opinions are the particularly highlighted strategies only for craft level workers. Conducting training programs, workshops on LC, introducing allowance system, provide promotions, show long term benefits, conducting CPD, promote self-learning and enhancing communication circles are the specified strategies for administrative and professional and managerial level employees. In addition to that, the importance of conducting motivational programs have been highlighted for professional and managerial level employees. However, the strategies that have been proposed in this study are limited to the organisational level of large-scale contractors in Sri Lanka. The study has finally developed a model by mapping the strategies against the human related challenges. The developed model in this study will guide the large-scale contractors to identify the human related challenges impacting successful LC implementation and strategies to overcome those challenges. The findings of this study will be beneficial and applicable to the large-scale contractors in Sri Lankan construction industry as well as the contractors in the developing countries, those who have shared the same kind of practices, standards and socio-economic, demographic or cultural traits. This study mainly contributes to understand the human related challenges that are facing by large-scale contractors in the lean implementation and propose possible strategies that can be implemented within the organisation to avoid the aforementioned challenges. Further, the study will pave the way for further research to propose the strategies that can be used by the individuals, industry and the government to overcome the human related challenges in successful implementation of lean concept in construction industry. 7.

124,The Role Of Regulatory Resilience In Supply Chain  Optimization: A Case Study,"as the difficult period, we have just been through, witnesses, resilience is needed now more than ever. within this context, regulatory resilience is addressed through a case study. in fact, parallel imports and counterfeiting may have a strong negative impact on sales volume, turnover, and hence on business performance. in order to prevent this, a resilience process aiming to deal with those illegal activities is implemented, and the automation of this process by setting up a software solution named r2apid (regulatory resilience against parallel imports and doctoring) is explained in this paper.",parallel imports,"The present paper consists of a case study of the supply chain transformation imposed by the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) environment in which the company concerned operates. Following an in-depth analysis, the importance of ensuring regulatory resilience has been stressed. In this respect, a list of the different regulatory concerns faced by the company, and which may slow down the supply chain performance and threaten its functioning, has been drawn up. Then, a resilience process, serving the purpose of limiting parallel imports and counterfeiting, recognized as amongst the most threatening regulatory challenges, has been proposed. Lastly, an IT tool called R2APID (Regulatory Resilience Against Parallel Imports and Doctoring) and which automating the resilience process previously mentioned, has been introduced. In our future work, we will try to dip into other types of resilience in order to help with optimizing process management in general.","saloua said and hafida bouloiz systems engineering and decision support laboratory ensa agadir, morocco saloua.said.5@gmail.com, h.bouloiz@uiz.ac.ma maryam gallab mis-listd laboratory computer science department mines-rabat school (ensmr) rabat, morocco meryam09@gmail.com",

There are five steps in content analysis carried out in this study. The first step is to determine the text to be studied, namely reviews on TripAdvisor. The second step is to determine the text that is interesting, special, extraordinary, controversial, that is, a review that only remains in the new normal category. The third step is to categorize the text, which is to determine the satisfaction and dissatisfaction factors based on the literature review of previous studies. The fourth step is to classify visitor reviews where the author uses verification of how to apply the protocol directly to each hotel. The fifth step is to interpret, interpret and draw conclusions from the results of the review verification. Table 3.

127,A Critical Success Factors Framework For Sustainable  Contract Manufacturing In The Consumer Products Supply,"manufacturing remains a critical driver for economic development in developing countries. outsourcing of production to contract manufacturers companies (cmcs) is a global phenomenon that has gained prominence in the last three decades in the electronics and pharmaceutical products supply chains and has extended to the consumer products supply chain. significant literature on manufacturing outsourcing and contract manufacturing and their role in the supply chain is available. however, there is very little scholarship on the critical factors that make cmcs sustainable businesses and important links in the consumer products supply chain, and what frameworks are available to assist the cmcs identify and put into practice these critical success factors, (csfs). this study aims to fill this gap by identifying, through research, the factors that are critical for cmcs to be sustainable businesses that can contribute to the success of their clients and the economy. a sustainability framework will be developed from these cfcs, which will be tested in selected cmcs in south africa. this framework will assist customers of cmcs to select and appoint the best cmc partner to work with and provide a roadmap for existing and aspiring cmcs to build organisations with the systems for success and sustainability.",,"and Further Work Given that there is limited scholarship on such an important topic as the critical success factors for sustainability in CMCs, which play a very critical role in global supply chains and industrialising economies through increased manufacturing activity, there is an obvious need to take this study further and survey existing CMCs and their customers in the consumer products supply chain in South Africa so that the framework can be further improved and developed into an implementation model. This model will then be tested through implementation in existing CMCs.","chain in south africa: a review stephen matope and trust taziva mahove industrial engineering department stellenbosch university stellenbosch, south africa smatope@sun.ac.za, ttmahove@gmail.com",
128,An Examination Of Emotional Intelligence In Uae Projects,"developing human factors at the emotional and cognitive levels is significantly vital to project success. the notion of emotional intelligence is growingly gaining attention, and studies on this field are being performed increasingly. yet, the studies that have been conducted in projects in the united arab emirates are scarce. therefore, this study aims to shed light on the emotional intelligence level within decision-makers (project managers and engineers specifically) who are currently operating projects in the uae, specifically, the field of construction and information technology (it), and how far it contributes to project success. a questionnaire has been prepared for data collection. it consists of a section that measures ei among respondents and another section measuring project success. a total of 106 responses across the united arab emirates were collected from project managers and project engineers working in construction/it firms and analyzed using ibm’s spss v26 software package. our results showed that pmes in the uae have a high level of emotional intelligence and ei is strongly correlated to project success. we observed that pmes in the uae prefer to intermingle with people of the same culture, as suggested by the results of the hypothesis testing. since emotional intelligence was indeed a contributor to project success, it is suggested that employers should pay more attention to developing their employees’ ei level, as well as prioritize candidates with high levels of ei during the recruiting process.","project management, project success, cultures","In this research, the level of emotional intelligence among project managers and project engineers (and employees with related occupations) working in a project-based environment in the United Arab was measured and concluded that the participants indeed had a high level of emotional intelligence. This could be attributed to training and human development programs that have been arranged and prepared by the human resources departments of the respected participants’ employers. Another reason could be that organizations in the past few years are recruiting and employing people who are PMP© and PRINCE2© certified (or hold any related certificate to the field of project management) and the increasing number of managers and engineers holding these certificates. It was also concluded that emotional intelligence is significantly correlated with project success, as shown by the bivariate correlation and linear regression model coefficients of emotional intelligence variables, which is in parallel with the results of previous studies that examined the impact of emotional intelligence and project success (Rezvani et al. 2016; Müller and Turner, 2007; Maqbool et al. 2017; Geoghegan and Dulewicz, 2008). This research provides underpinning evidence to support the hypothesis of the impact of emotional intelligence on project success. Project managers and project engineers with higher emotional intelligence understand the emotions of themselves and of others, exhibit accurate self-assessment and trustworthiness in the workplace, sense others’ feelings and development needs and bolster their abilities. These traits were found to contribute to the project’s success and are significantly correlated to it. The arguments presented in this research suggested that emotional intelligence impacts project success, meaning that the project’s success depends on soft skills as much as it depends on hard skills. It was also found that people who work in project-based organizations across the United Arab Emirates do not intermingle the same between people of their own culture and people of other cultures. Further investigation in the dataset revealed that people prefer to deal with people of their own culture overall. This might be attributed to the communication barrier since it is always easier to communicate with people speaking the same language. It could also be contributed to the interpretation and comprehension of emotions by different cultures, as suggested by the work of Eid & Diener (2009) and Wierzbicka (1986), people of different nations and cultures use different structures of emotion terms, which are likely to reflect dissimilar ways of experiencing and conceptualizing emotions. The work presented in this research aims to eliminate the gap mentioned in chapter 2 and point out the importance of emotional intelligence in project-based organizations, which allows project managers and project engineers to consider other aspects of project success factors. Additionally, it urges PMEs to assess their emotional intelligence level to take corrective measures and employers to recruit PMEs with higher emotional quotients (EQ). Furthermore, it encourages researchers to expand the domain of future studies of the same nature to include wider regions such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) or the Middle East.","abdulrahman azzam othman industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates u18105810@sharjah.ac.ae udechukwu ojiako industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates gojiako@sharjah.ac.ae fikri t. dweiri industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates fdweiri@sharjah.ac.ae",
129,A Secure Middleware Architecture For Real-Time Tracking  Applications,"rfid for radio frequency identification represents an automated data-capture technology that evolved during the 90’s 20th centuries (qiwei 2007). it is an effective way to identify traceable objects and is widely applied in many domains (such as healthcare applications, scm, sensing applications, transportation, iot applications ...). the internet of things (iot) is a global infrastructure for the information society based on a heterogeneous set of subsystems and technologies that need to be interconnected and interfaced in real-time with each other by following suitable standards for communication, integration, measurement, control and interoperability (rouchdi et al. 2018). of the interoperable solutions, the middleware is worth mentioning. in the iot, rfid middleware is the software chain's brain that gives intelligence to the collected data from rfid-tagged objects, it represents a technical software layer that acts as an interface between the various it applications and the rfid equipment network whose role is to manage the hardware network, deduplicating redundant information, aggregation, dissemination, and formatting of rfid data (ajana et al. 2009). this work presents an rbac and nosql based rfid software framework whose goal is to increase security by making the authentication process much more efficient. this new middleware architecture enables the monitoring, processing and storing of a large volume of incoming rfid events flow in real-time by combining rfid technology with mongodb and provides enhanced interoperability through the option of presenting rfid data in json format.","rfid, middleware, in other words","In this document, we propose an RFID Middleware architecture. The proposed middleware differentiates from existing middleware architectures in that it can store any type of RFID data, integrates data stream processing to allow real- time data analysis, supports massive data, and stores data in JSON format for better interoperability (Breje et al. 2018). It also describes two application areas for RFID technology. Such a platform allows automated and real-time tracking, reduced management time, real time location, reduction of the workforce. Our middleware architecture is in its first stage of development. At this phase, we have outlined the features and services that will be used in our future Middleware. It was found in the initial assessment study that our architecture can solve problems such as security, storage, large amounts of data processing, and heterogeneity. For future work, we plan to complete the implementation of our Middleware. This will allow us to evaluate it using a real deployment case to quantify the entire proposed system's performance.","achraf haibi1,2, kenza oufaska2, khalid el yassini1, mohammed boulmalf2 1 ia laboratory, faculty of sciences, moulay ismail university, meknes, morocco achraf.haibi@uir.ac.ma, khalid.elyassini@gmail.com 2 ticlab laboratory, college of engineering & architecture, international university of rabat, morocco kenza.oufaska@uir.ac.ma, mohammed.boulmalf@uir.ac.ma",
130,Following The Trail: A Covariance Plotting Of The Crippling  Effect Of Covid-19 On Small And Medium Sized -Smes Firms,"this article analyses the impact of the coronavirus pandemic among construction small-medium enterprises (cosmes) in the uk. a global and uk effect context-analysis is given and contrasted using a multivariate scrutiny of factors determining success or failure and the extent of covariance among contributory factors leading to closure as well as survival of the cosmes. firstly, it reveals that within the uk, government interventional measures had a mixed effect. in most cases, the measures were deemed to be inadequate and too late in stopping the failure of most cosmes, though a substantial number survived due to government interventional measures such as the furlough schemes. secondly, an inventory of the specific and multidimensional measures, attributed to mitigate total failure of cosmes is drawn including a review of the perceived benefits such as minimizing extent of total closure or declared volume of bankruptcies. thirdly, it is observed that government decisive decisions contributed to the slowdown of the economy, and in particular construction activities. however, ranked among the interventional measures is the ‘bouncebackability’ driven measures which offered a soft landing for many cosmes. the study concludes that crisis- mitigating policy measures (cmpm), are necessary for the short and long-term recovery and performance of the uk economy. understanding the composition of these measures and their rank order is critical to uk economic recovery.","covid-19, construction smes, furlough","Strategy must be in place to future proof the Construction Small-Medium Enterprises (CoSMEs) involve in construction by creating the culture and control mechanism among the parties involve, building on the existing policy and provision of adequate health and safety equipment and policy. it is necessary to see more investment in innovative technology that will support management of the construction process including cash flow support that will help cushion the effect of any delays or overrun due to any unforeseen situation cause by covid-19. This should be adapted to any economic dynamism faced by CoSMEs.

135,A New Energy Efficient Mechanism To Enhance Mpr  Selection In Olsr: Eem-Olsr,"mobile ad hoc networks (manet) enables mobile nodes to communicate with each other through wireless connections without any centralized controller or base station. each mobile node is powered by a battery. the efficient use of battery energy is, therefore, a key factor in manet. optimized link state routing protocol (olsr) uses a multipoint relay (mpr) selection method to reduce transmitted packets during the flooding process. in the olsr protocol, a mpr set is selected based on reachability and degree. it fails to consider the energy constraints of the network as a result, we have focused on reducing energy consumption. this paper introduces a new mechanism for selecting the mpr in the olsr protocol, in order to enhance energy management and prolong the network lifetime based on the willingness without losses of performances (such as mprs count, the number of dead nodes, end-to- end delay, control overhead, packet loss). simulation results using ns-3 while varying numbers of nodes show that our proposed eem-olsr protocol outperforms the classic olsr by significantly improving the network lifetime.","eem-olsr, olsr, mprs","Our aim is to make OLSR energy efficient, in order to prolong the lifetime of Mobile ad hoc MANET.

136,Ergonomic Design Of A Computer Workstation For Preschool  Students Studying At Home,"technology has become an integral part of education in both courses that utilize it but also as an alternative method of teaching. due to the current ongoing pandemic, online learning has been skyrocketing in popularity, raising concerns regarding the workstation setup of preschool students and how the current designs can lead to them having musculoskeletal disorders and other diseases. the researchers aimed to model an ergonomically designed workstation that is catered specifically to preschool students from the ages four to six. this was done through a survey to identify the factors affecting the students’ comfortability through correlation and multiple regression analysis, along with their comfort levels which were evaluated using the rapid upper limb assessment tool (rula) and corlett’s and bishop’s discomfort questionnaire. the results of the correlation analysis displayed that the sitting posture (r=, seat height, and table height strongly affect a preschooler's discomfort while using the workstation. additionally, the regression equation implies that the rula score and seat height both add to students' discomfort, while the backrest height greatly reduces it for every value that was added. with the results garnered, the researchers were able to design three chairs and four tables that are suitable for preschool students.","ergonomics, preschoolers","With the lack of sufficient related studies on school equipment that is ergonomically designed for children aged four to six years old, the researchers have successfully created a model of an ergonomically designed computer workstation that will be of use for children within the age range. Based on the results of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) Scores, the researchers were able to determine the body parts that experienced the highest discomfort levels to be the upper back, lower back, and the shoulder. With regard to the statistical analysis of the data, it was determined that the factors which had the greatest effect on the discomfort levels of the respondents were the duration of study and the type of chair used, while the other factors that were taken into consideration had proven to not have a significant effect on the discomfort level. Moreover, the mismatch analysis proved that wood as a material is best suited for chairs and tables that are designed for preschoolers; along with those made of monobloc or plastic. It is also observed that metal as the material is highly discouraged. This study also indicated that the anthropometric percentiles computed for the study favored the female preschooler students; with its lowest dimensions consistently falling under the female anthropometric percentiles gathered. In the event that the parents want to set up a suitable computer workstation for their children, the design and details provided in this study may be used as a pattern or standard. Furthermore, this study has met the optimal design by intricately utilizing the recommended dimensions for both table and chair. Finally, a total of three designs for a chair were made, while four designs for a table was also created. Different models were designed with various features depending on the preference of the users that is also adjusted to their comfortability.","karylle e. famero, jared z. paguia and maui t. yumul young innovators research center mapúa university - makati makati, metro manila, philippines kefamero@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jmzpaguia@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mvtyumul@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university manila, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
137,Ergonomic Design Of Computer Workstations Of High  School Students Studying At Home,"high school students, especially in the time of pandemic, have online classes, which requires the students to expose themselves to computer workstations, putting them at risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders. this study aims to assess and evaluate the current setup used by the students studying at home. the main objective of this study is to design an ergonomic workstation for high school students who are studying at home. the data that were gathered from the respondents (n=100) include discomfort level using corlett’s and bishop’s body map questionnaire, risk level of sitting posture using rapid upper limb assessment (rula) and anthropometric dimensions as such as popliteal height, sitting elbow height, buttock-popliteal depth, hip breath, sitting shoulder height and range of functional reach. the data that were gathered from the respondents were statistically treated and analyzed using anova for mean comparison and correlation analysis. there were several factors that were considered in the study to determine the cause of body discomfort of students while using the current computer workstation in their homes while studying online. the factors include duration of study, area of study, chair design and table design. the study found out that the duration of study and the type of chair have a significant difference with the discomfort scores of students, meaning these factors significantly affect the discomfort level of the students while studying at home. another finding is that the rula score (r=0.854, p-value<0.001) and the table height dimension (r=0.773, p-value<0.001) have a positive relationship with the discomfort scores while seat height (r=-0.693, p-value<0.001) has negative relationship with discomfort scores of students. the study concluded that some dimensions and the duration of exposure to computer workstations puts high school students at higher risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders. given these conditions, we have proposed an ergonomic workstation deign for students based on their gathered anthropometric measurements.",ergonomics,"The first objective of the study aimed to assess and evaluate the current setup used by students studying at home. The evaluation of the survey administered included pertinent information that would not only aid in the proceeding of the data analysis part of the research, but would also meet such objective. Further achievement was done with the used of the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) that investigated the posture of each respondent that translated to a scoring system presenting the risk of each student in contracting musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) in each part of the body. The findings present that the respondents’ most frequent responses for each category are male, 18 years old, 6-9 hours, bedroom, morning-evening, office/gaming chair, and a wooden table. The researchers concluded that the most frequent responses present a general idea of the computer workstation setup and the behavior using such. The second objective aimed to evaluate the comfortability of students in using the current set-up and identify factors affecting such level. The first part of the objective was achieved with the usage of the Corlett’s Bishop Discomfort Questionnaire which has a similar purpose with the goal targeted. The second part of the objective, on the other hand, was achieved with, first, the Welch's t-test that analyzed the difference between the demographics and the discomfort scores, and second, the correlation analysis that presented the relationship between the discomfort scores of the respondents and the demographics and factors gathered from the survey. The data that had a positive relationship were determined as factors that affected the discomfort level of the students, namely the duration of study and sitting posture while table height has negative relationship to the discomfort scores. The data also found out that there is a significant difference between the duration of study hours and the chair type with the discomfort scores. The researchers concluded that the duration of exposure, the amount of cushion, and the specific dimensions in a chair and a table affects the comfortability level of students.

138,Cars On Weight Loss: The Development Of A Methodology  For The Topology Optimization Of Monolithic Components –,"topology optimization plays a key role in the production of strong, lightweight functional parts. it uses mathematical algorithms to create optimized geometries under given constraints while at the same time improving performance. the conventional design process is time consuming and requires high technical expertise. the raisons d’etre for using algorithms is to reduce part development time and to keep the computational cost low. further reduction in cost through weight savings can be realized though monolithic (one piece) design. in this method, weight reduction is achieved through the elimination of bolts, nuts and other joining material. combining topology optimization with monolithic design also blends the benefit of weight reduction with the simplification of the assembly process. to reach optimum weight, an effective part development process requires a methodology which takes into account the objective function and all the constraints. the methodology can be used from the early stages, throughout the design process. this provides a step-by-step approach to the design process and keeps iterations to a minimum, thereby reducing the product development time. this research therefore focuses on the trends in the development of a methodology for the topology optimization of monolithic vehicle components. it also highlights the challenges and opportunities, placing emphasis on the vehicle aftermarket industry components.",methodology,"Topology optimization is very important in enabling the production of strong, lightweight functional parts. It uses algorithms to reduce component weight and material input. The purpose of the research was to present the emerging trends, challenges and opportunities in the development of methodologies for topology optimization of monolithic components. Having methodology as part of the design process helps to eliminate the long iterations that are done in topology optimization. It also eliminates human input and accelerates the product design process. The majority of the methodologies do not factor in manufacturability and as such some optimum designs are not economic to manufacture. These disparities between optimum design and cost-effective manufacture call for the incorporation of the manufacturability of the part from the early stages of the design process. Topology optimization usually results in complex designs and these are usually difficult to manufacture monolithically when the conventional manufacturing processes are involved.

141,Energy-Related Covid-19 Studies – A Bibliometric  Analysis With Literature Review,"covid-19 pandemic was declared a global emergency as it changed people’s lifestyle socially and economically. thus covid-19 does not only have health impact, but impact global economies, energy demand or energy poverty and carbon emissions, and many more. energy demand and consumption are foremost among global challenges. specifically, covid-19 has changed the energy consumption pattern of most homes, organizations, industries, and nations as the energy sector provides fuel for most of the activities in every walk of life. this has brought everyone faced-to-face with the three-sided challenge: covid-19 health issues, economic issues and climate change. it is projected that countries that were in full lockdown would have 25% decline in energy demand per week and an average of 18% reduction for countries in partial lockdown. it was also assessed that the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on global energy demand is seven times less when compared with the impact of 2020 covid-19 on global energy demand. another projection was that demands for oil, coal, gas, nuclear as sources of energy – will drop while that for renewables will increase. precisely, oil, coal and co2 emission are expected to drop by 9%, 8% and 8% respectively. co2 emission will be six times larger compared to co2 reduction caused by global financial crises in 2009 and two times of all reductions since end of world war ii. it is however feared that the rebound effect of emission might be higher than the fall if concerted effort is not made to promote clean and efficient energy technology. in addition, the international monetary fund (imf) estimated 6% reduction in global gross domestic product (gdp) as a result of covid-19 in 2020 and a 7% rebound effect in 2021. it was projected that in 2025%, global gdp will drop by 9% due to covid-19. aviation, commuting and office-space are respectively projected to drop by 5%, 2% & 1% by 2025. the imf further affirmed that global energy demand fell by 8% in 2020, and that it will fluctuate below pre-covid-19 prediction by about (6-8)% till 2050. also, assessed was that transport energy used will never again attain it 2019 figures; the consumption of steel and construction materials for office building will tremendously reduce. in the face of this once-in-a-century crisis, there are many possible outcomes for energy use and emission as well as contributing factors. this intriguing interplay of estimates of certain indicators and determinants is very captivating and has sparked-off discussions and surveys at various levels and quarters like similar, previous crises. there is need for a systematic review, visualization, and mapping of existing literature on this subject. this study will review and proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management rome, italy, august 2-5, 2021 © ieom society international 1330",,,"jude james national centre for technology management (nacetem), ile-ife, osun state, nigeria industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, south africa institute of systems science, durban university of technology, south africa judeosagie@ymail.com victor ebin voegs integrated resources limited, a41 adisa estate, gudu, abuja, nigeria victorebin@gmail.com abubakar kazeem national centre for technology management (nacetem), ile-ife, osun state, nigeria kz4tawa@gmail.com emeka joseph pius national centre for technology management (nacetem), ile-ife, osun state, nigeria emeka.iliemena@gmail.com",
142,Effects Of Computer-Based Work On The Musculoskeletal  Discomfort Among College Students,"college students have been exposed to online classes ever since the covid-19 pandemic situation arose. exposure to the discomfort of utilizing gadgets while attending online classes or performing tasks on work desks has been rapidly emerging and increasing. this becomes a widely known issue for most college students and must be given early treatment to decrease such musculoskeletal disorders (msds) and risks. causes of these msds are awkward posture, repetitive tasks, and maintaining a posture for long periods. this study aims to identify a significant difference in the musculoskeletal discomfort level of respondents on several factors such as gender, age, type of gadget used, hand control, type of keyboard, screen time, and workstation setup. the musculoskeletal discomfort of users experienced on body and hand were separately analyzed using cornell musculoskeletal disorder questionnaire (cmdq). the results of the study revealed that college students who often use computer-based work in online classes experience discomfort on the lower back, neck, upper back, and right wrist while specific hand parts that have a high prevalence of discomfort are the wrist, ring, middle, index fingers, and thenar region. the result of anova also revealed that students who used laptops (x=709.8) have higher body discomfort compared to users of desktops (x=199.7). it was also proved that students who use computers for more than 7 hours have higher body discomfort (x=285.2) than students who use computers for 3-6 hrs a day (x=172). similarly, for hand discomfort, it was identified that laptop keyboard users (x=166.2) have higher discomfort than mechanical keyboard users (x=86.6), the same goes with screen time. students who use computers for more than 7 hours per day (x=153.7) have significantly higher hand discomfort than those who use them for 3-6 hrs (x=59). given this condition, we have proposed recommendations and prevention attributes to minimize the risk of msd of students.","discomfort, cmdq, college students","In conclusion, the study proved that there are significant differences among the different factors shown above versus the discomfort of students when having their online classes in a computer-based work setting. This means that the researchers have inspected whether these different factors are attributed to the discomfort of college students. However, there were only some factors that were significantly different from the discomfort feeling of students. From that speculation, it suggests that not at all factors are linked to the discomfort and MSD risks of the samples. This was thoroughly investigated by the researchers which among these factors has the highest CMDQ score rating. Then, it was rated based on the risk rating of the CMDQ which among these factors highly contributes to the discomfort of college students when in a computer-based work set up. The researchers considered the gender difference of each college student since they have unequal height differences. Not all work set-ups are originally made for a particular student considering its height and the length of each body part. But with the help of ANOVA, this doesn't affect the discomfort of students. Therefore, it is considered not significant. As expected, its average screen time and hand control play a big role in the discomfort of particularly the hands. As per the body parts, the only factors that are greatly affected by the discomfort of students are their age, type of gadget used, and average screen time. Both categories (body and hand) have significant remarks on the average screen time. This is practically rational because students utilize their gadgets for a long period where the eyes are for visibility, hands for typing, and body to support such agendas and tasks. This works altogether and creates a connection between factor to factor. College students have a broader field compared to high-school students. As a result, they are prone to having an extended time when it comes to computer usage. This is the reason for workloads in college. The most common areas that are affected by very severe cases of MSD are the lower back, neck, and upper back of the body. For the CMDQ hand, the most common area that's affected with MSD risks is the right wrist. There are some conditions in this research study; most of the respondents are right-handed which did not give much attention to the left wrists. But overall, the wrists, neck, lower and upper body are prone to having MSD risks and discomfort. Respondents that are identified with a very severe and severe case for the body and hand should make changes and revision of their work set-ups to avoid MSD risks. The main behaviors that cause MSDs are maintaining a posture for an extended period, repetitive tasks, and as well as awkward postures. Work-related musculoskeletal discomforts (WMSD) and symptoms are primarily caused by psychological (stress, cognitive load, etc.) and organizational (inappropriate working-rest time, lack of work-enrichment, etc.) factors in the workplace (static and poor postures, repetition of gestures, non-ergonomic workstation arrangement, etc.). It is critical to improving working conditions, organizational design and layout, and effective ergonomic interventions in the workplace. Preventing and eliminating WMSDs requires an evaluation of the workplace, monitoring of the related risk factors, medical management, and education. (Erman, 2019). This study spreads awareness that symptoms must be treated as early as possible. Recommendations and prevention actions are already given in this research study that can act as a starting point in attracting students, engineers, and ergonomists to take into action. According to Gautam (2017), if the discomforts and pain continue, it will become a chronic condition that will result in musculoskeletal distress and disorders. To enhance the current practice of laptop use and to reduce health issues among students, there is a need to raise ergonomics awareness. It's critical to monitor students' laptop use and postures so that musculoskeletal disorders and their effects can be managed before they become an obsession. Having a better understanding and being able to come up with strategies on how to deal with one's posture can eliminate and prevent musculoskeletal risk.

143,A Case Study Of Perceived Effect Of Thermal Comfort To The  Mental Fatigue Level Of Students During Online Class,"as the coronavirus disease (covid-19) took away the accustomed routines of the people, the prevalence of online platforms in present times became more evident as every field or industry opt to adapt to the new normal. with that, education was never excluded from the said adaptation. as schooling cannot be hindered, the educational system transitioned from having a face-to-face method to conducting online classes for a safer and more convenient learning experience. however, this adaptation did not solely bring convenience as numerous students and teachers encounter different challenges, and one of these is the condition of the available workplace. several studies have proven that the environment of the area of work must always assure comfortability as this can impact an individual's mental fatigue and cognitive performance. as the temperature is among the said factors, the researchers aimed to determine the perceived effect of the thermal comfort and measured temperature level on the students' mental fatigue. upon the evaluation of gathered data and application of statistical tools using anova and correlation analysis, it proved that thermal comfort experienced by students during online class varies based on the time of the study (morning, afternoon, and evening) and based on the source of ventilation (fan, a/c units and multiple sources of ventilation). results also showed that thermal comfort indeed plays a pivotal role in the mental fatigue of students. it depicted that measured temperature level of students during online class has a direct relationship to the mental fatigue of students specifically on dimensions such as concentration difficulty (r=0.482, p<0.001) irritability (r=0.813, p<0.001), unproductivity (r=0.402, p<0.001), and mental recovery from high temperature (r=0.661, p<0.001).","temperature, mental fatigue, online learning","The ongoing pandemic brought numerous challenges to everyone. These include the sudden transition of traditional learning to online education. Even though people continuously find ways to adapt to current conditions, there are essential elements that should be acknowledged as they try to perceive and survive this pandemic. One of the most significant occurring changes is the adjustment in the working environment. As mentioned earlier, it is very important to heed the state of the working area as it has a significant effect on productivity and motivation (Ernst, 2020). Through further exploration, the researchers found out that temperature influences productivity and the cognitive performance of a person (Fisk, Lei, & Seppanen, 2006). Despite the existing studies, there is a lack of understanding regarding the relationship between temperature and Mental Fatigue. The researchers believed that it is essential to establish this relationship for it can help determine the factors that can lead to mental fatigue. With that being said, the study focused on understanding the relationship between temperature and Mental Fatigue through evaluating the Mental Fatigue Score of the respondents. As the researchers analyzed the gathered data, they found out that most participants believed that the sources of ventilation found in the area of study are sufficient enough to adjust to their thermal comfort. Despite that, the researchers identified their Heat Stress Category to assess whether the respondents are in good condition depending on the room temperature. The researchers found out that the average room temperature equivalent to 28.15 degrees Celsius is under the Yellow category. It was stated that the workers should be only exposed to this temperature for 40 minutes and should have a rest of 20 minutes. Even if the conditions are met, it is still advisable to reduce the temperature for the well-being of the workers. Moreover, the researchers also found out that 63% of the respondents prefer to study in the bedroom and chose to study during the evening. Furthermore, the study used statistical treatments specifically ANOVA Test and Tukey's Post Hoc Test to determine whether factors such as the source of ventilation, time, and area of study have an impact on thermal comfort. The results showed that 2 out of 3 factors have a significant difference in thermal comfort. The researchers found out that students who study in the evening have a higher thermal comfort compared to those who prefer during the morning or afternoon. Results also showed that there is a difference in thermal comfort based on the source of ventilation. On the contrary, the researchers also found out that there is no significant difference between the thermal comfort of the respondents based on the area of study. As the researchers gathered the Mental Fatigue Scores of respondents, they were able to determine which among the dimensions have correlations with temperature using a Correlation Test. The researchers were able to specify that the dimensions Concentration Difficulty, Irritability, Unproductivity, and Mental Recovery from high temperature can be associated with temperature. Overall, the study was able to establish that there is a relationship between temperature and Mental Fatigue, thus means that it is important to ensure that the room temperature of the workplace is appropriate and comfortable, for better productivity and cognitive performance during online classes. The researchers recommend that future studies fill the gaps of the existing researches. For better and more accurate results, the temperature of the respondents should be measured using an appropriate temperature device, as the researchers of this paper had limited equipment. This can help the researchers to formulate more precise conclusions and bases. Other factors that can affect the temperature (i.e. size of the room, number of people staying in the same room, etc.) must also be considered in determining the effects of temperature level on the mental fatigue of the students. Other educational levels should also be considered for their respondents for a more extensive scope.

145,Relationship Of Work Posture During Wfh Setup On  Musculoskeletal Discomfort Of Students,"the introduction of the covid-19 had a huge impact on the delivery of education. to make the most out of the time spent at home during quarantine, students are now taking up online classes implemented to them by their respective schools. this means prolonged sitting behind their computers while learning. the objective of this study is to find various relationships between the postures of students and their corresponding discomforts experienced during online classes. the rosa method together with the application of the corlett and bishop's discomfort scale are used. the researchers found out that long durations of sitting while having online classes does lead to students experiencing more painful discomforts thus affecting the efficiency of how they study. it can also be concluded that the majority of the dimensions based on the rosa method have the most effect on the lower back of the respondents, were more particularly the dimensions of the monitor and headset are the only dimensions that do not play a role in affecting any body parts.","posture, online class","The obtained results gave a proper indication that students with underweight/overweight BMI tend to experience higher discomfort levels compared to normal BMI. While longer periods of class hours do lead to students experiencing more painful discomforts thus affecting the efficiency of how they study. It can also be concluded that all the dimensions do not greatly affect the head and neck of the respondents. Where more particularly the dimensions of the Monitor and Headset are the only dimensions that do not play a role in affecting any body parts according to the calculations computed by the researchers based on the data given by the respondents. This study certainly does not entirely indicate or represent the many students out there around the world studying in online classes, which is why we should consider that not everyone has the necessities to achieve the best possible ergonomic setup that is suitable and convenient for their bodies. Therefore, conducting a similar study in the future that is more diverse in terms of the national origin of the respondents and where they live can provide a more realistic view when trying to acquire a comparison between the work posture and MSD of students at a projected view. Overall, the ROSA method together with the application of the Corlett and Bishop’s discomfort scale made the comparison of the relationship of this study more constructive and deliverable. The conducted study is done within a restricted duration, and it should also be considered that it was also under an abnormal situation due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers used all the resources available given the limited period. It is recommended for future researchers interested in this field of the topic to consider gathering more respondents to collect data from.

146,Relationship Of Noise Level To The Mental Fatigue Level Of  Students: A Case Study During Online Classes,"this research study tackles the relationship of the noise level to the mental fatigue of the student during online classes. the researchers used survey questionnaires to gather data from the respondents who are students having online classes at home. the objective of the study is to determine if the perceived noise level of students significantly differs in terms of gender, area of study, and duration of the study. this study also intends to determine if noise exposure during online classes has a significant contribution to the mental fatigue of students. the statistical treatments used were descriptive statistics, anova, and correlation. the results of the study revealed that perceived noise level does not significantly differ in terms of gender (p-value=0.804) while the area of study (p-value=0.017) and duration of the study (p- value<0.0001) have significant differences in the perceived noise level of respondents. the result of correlation analysis also revealed that noise exposure during online class has a strong contribution to the mental fatigue of students specifically on dimensions such as sensitivity to noise, fatigue, and concentration having the p-value of 0.000, 0.021, and 0.000 respectively.","noise level, mental fatigue","Due to the pandemic, most of the community was forced to conduct their work activities online throughout their own homes, which created lots of challenges for everyone. One of these challenges is the execution of their work-related activities in a home setting which generates a lot of distraction that leads to mental fatigue and stress. One of the causes of distraction is exposure to the noise level. Noise during online class can be caused by a dog barking, car horn, TV playing in the room, people chatting nearby, and other sources. Thus, this study was done to determine the effect of noise level on the mental fatigue of students during an online class. The results of the study have revealed that the perceived noise level of students significantly differs in terms of area of study and duration of the study. It was found that students who conduct online classes in the bedroom have perceived to have lower noise levels compared to students who are studying in the living room. It was also proved that students who study for more than 7 hours a day have perceived to have higher noise levels compared to students who study for 6 hours and below. In this study, we were able to measure the mental fatigue of students concerning exposure to noise during online classes. We were able to correlate the effects of noise exposure to the specific dimension of the mental fatigue level of students. We have found that exposure to noise level could result in an increase in irritability, sensitivity to noise, and concentration difficulties of students. With these findings, it is recommended that students who are studying online at home should use noise-canceling headphones to minimize noise exposure from the background. It is also advised for students to have a few minutes break time in the middle of the class for them to take a rest for a couple of minutes and decrease their fatigue and exhaustion. And lastly, students should have a conducive space for learning such as the specific area in the house dedicated for an online class that is away from the noise and has an ambient atmosphere.","angelo luis s. doctora, william davin d. perez, abigail b. vasquez, and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines alsdoctora@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, wddperez@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, abvasquez@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
147,Mismatch Analysis Between Classroom Chair And  Anthropometric Measurements Of Mapua University,"the research studied the mismatch between anthropometric measurements of senior high school and college students of mapúa university to the current classroom chair design being used. each of the two levels was split into two based on sex. in total there were 4 groups compared; the data comprised of shs male, shs female, college male, and college female. after performing the anderson-darling normality test and one-way anova, the researchers determined that the anthropometric measurements of shs and college students significantly differ, therefore, two ergonomic classroom chairs were needed separately for the two groups. in performing the mismatch analysis, it was found that the majority of the shs students and college students have a high mismatch in terms of seat height. the existing seat height of the classroom chair is too high for the students. a proposed design of the chair was then made. in comparing the mismatch of the existing dimensions to the proposed classroom chair, it was found out that the recommended seat height, seat depth, seat width, backrest height, and armrest height improved the overall design of the chair fitted for the majority of the users. the same goes with the backrest height, it was found that the existing chair design is too high for the users. given this condition, the researchers were able to propose a new dimension for classroom chairs using the anthropometric measurements gathered from the shs and college students of mapua university. the mismatch analysis of the proposed chair proved that the recommended seat height, seat depth, seat width, backrest height, and armrest height improved the overall design of the chair fitted for the majority of the users.","mismatch analysis, anthropometry","The researchers were able to identify that there is a significant difference in measurements between male and female senior high school students as well as male and female college students. Furthermore, measurements of both female populations of senior high and college, and both male populations of senior high school and college students showed significant differences as well. Hence, there is a need to produce chairs with different armchair measurements for the two distinct levels. The researchers were also able to suggest standard measurements for the five vital chair dimensions identified for the research. It was later found out that the recommended seat height, seat depth, seat width, backrest height, and armrest height improved the overall design of the chair fitted for the majority of the users. With this, the researchers suggest future investigators have more sample sizes for better accuracy since the more people assessed, the more accurate the suggested standard measurements for the chairs will be. Also, it is recommended to eliminate outliers more precisely and accurately. Hence, in the Anderson-Darling test, future studies must not only dwell on the AD score but rather focus on the p-value of the normality test. Lastly, future studies could explore the possibility of considering the average anthropometric measurements from the participants instead of having the minimum and maximum percentiles as the basis for designing and proposing chair dimensions. In this way, the said dimensions could match more students.","students kianna denise c. villapando, lorenzo t. caday, krisanta ana e. draculan and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines ltcaday@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kaedraculan@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kdcvillapando@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
148,Fleet Replacement Analysis By Equivalent Uniform Annual  Cost Method,"one of the most important standard operating procedures for any organization is running the business in a cost- effective manner. normally during that business, workforces, equipment, fleet, etc are considered to be replaced after particular period of time, which depends on the operational situation. in this paper, replacement of grass fleet is studied in one of the universities. equivalent uniform annual cost (eauc) method is used for that purpose for three years period of time. the parameters considered for the said fleet are its operation cost, maintenance cost, procurement cost, interest rate, resale value at the end of each financial year, depreciation, interest on procurement cost, and the total marginal cost. eauc has been calculated for each year and should attracting output for the operators about the time they can replace the fleet in discussion.","fleet, economic life, salvage values","EUAC has given a valid managerial support for the concern department to have a glimpse on the expected operational status of the fleet in discussion. All related costs have been considered. It is planned to cover other assets like other vehicles, some electrical equipment, some mechanical equipment, etc at the same place using the same method by considering the associated costs. Also, other department and colleges have shown their interest in doing the same about their business duties.

153,On The Effect Of Four Interlayers’ Thicknesses With Gradually  Varying Thermal Expansion Coefficient Between Dissimilar,"dissimilar metal welds (dmws) are commonly employed in various scenarios including the power plants and petrochemicals sector. however, dmws have been reported for premature failures because of the stresses generated in the weld region owing to the high variation in the coefficient of thermal expansion (cte) of the different welded pipes’ materials. to overcome the problem of high cte difference in the weld region some researchers have demonstrated the use of the interlayers between the welded pipes which gradually varies the cte. in this paper, dissimilar metal welding of 2.25cr-1mo steel (cte = 12 µm/m˚c) and alloy 800h (cte = 14.4 µm/m˚c) materials is studied which have a large difference of 20% between their ctes. to overcome the effect of the high cte difference between the 2.25cr-1mo steel and alloy 800h, four interlayer materials are added in the weld region, namely; inconel 625 (12.8 µm/m˚c)/ inconel 718 (13 µm/m˚c)/ inconel 600 (13.3 µm/m˚c)/ and nimonic-pe16 (13.8 µm/m˚c). this results in the gradual variation of the cte from 2.25cr-1mo steel to alloy 800h. however, no previous research is reported which studied the effect of the thickness of the interlayers on the distortion generated in the weld/joint. this study employs the finite element (fe) analysis to study the effect of the interlayers’ thicknesses on the distortion developed in the joint. for this purpose, a fully coupled temperature-displacement analysis is used. furthermore, the fe analysis is conducted under the commonly encountered service conditions in the power and petrochemical sectors, i.e., superheated steam passing through the pipe at a temperature of 454˚c and pressure of 21.55 mpa. to systematically study the effect of the interlayers’ thicknesses, a taguchi l9 design of experiment (doe) approach is employed by using the levels of thickness as 40 mm, 70 mm, and 100 mm for each interlayer material. the results of the fe analysis reveals that varying the interlayers’ thicknesses between the 2.25cr-1mo steel and alloy 800h have a significant effect on the distortion produced in the joint. moreover, optimization analysis revealed that employing the interlayers’ thickness combination of inconel-625 = 100 mm, inconel-625 = 40 mm, inconel-625 = 40 mm, nimonic = 40 mm lead to minimum distortion of 2.27 mm in the joint.","dissimilar welds, 2.25cr-1mo steel","In this study a finite element model is presented to study the influence of the friction welded Ni-alloys based interlayers’ thicknesses in between dissimilar materials of 2.25Cr-1Mo ferritic steel and austenitic Alloy 800H.

154,An Overview On Dissimilar Metals Joining Techniques For  Nitinol Shape Memory Alloy To Titanium Alloy Ti-6Al-4V,"different industries have increased interest to utilize shape memory alloy, nitinol, due to its abilities like morphing, superelasticity, high corrosion resistance, and biocompatibility. on the other hand, ti-6al-4v has high tensile strength and toughness, high corrosion resistance, good biocompatibility, and low specific weight. for these reasons, ti-6al- 4v gets a lot of attention from industries like aircraft and medical engineering. joints of these two widely different alloys should then offer unique advantages for highly specialized applications. however, problems related to the joining of dissimilar metals like nitinol to ti-6al-4v have restricted the widespread use of these alloys. differences in metallurgical properties and coefficient of thermal expansion, as well as the tendency to form brittle intermetallic phases during welding, lead to cracks in the welds. this mismatch related to the thermal and mechanical properties between dissimilar metals results in the weakening of the overall quality of the joint between these two metals. therefore, knowledge on joining nitinol to ti-6al-4v should be expanded in relation to dissimilar metal joints to overcome these problems, and future solutions can be found. in this study, the shape memory effect and superelastic properties of nitinol are discussed, and how these might get affected during the welding of nitinol to ti-6al-4v are presented. an attempt is made to friction weld nitinol to ti-6al-4v using friction welding technique. both metals start to form flash indicating a positive response to the friction welding cycle and a narrow strip of intermixed zone seen to have formed at the weld interface.","shape memory alloy, nitinol, titanium alloy, ti-6al-4v","It can see that there is near-unanimous understanding that suitable welding technology for joining NiTi is lacking. Only when such a technology is made available, there would be a substantial jump in NiTi usage for wide-ranging applications, particularly in Bio-medical and aerospace fields. Although attempts are seen in open literature as early as 1991, they are still few and far between. Fortunately, the recent past is seeing an increased frequency of reports on welding of NiTi, at least in the open literature to these authors’ knowledge. Aerospace companies are one of the prominent pushers to develop joining technology for NiTi. Adaptive serrated nozzle development being a case in point. Though quite a few existing joining technologies were tried joining NiTi as discussed above, only few among them offer promising results. Laser could be said to be one of the best-joining methods for similar welding. Especially, thin sections of NiTi were quite successfully joined. The laser beam’s capacity to melt instantaneously is its main strength. The homogenous structures seen in similar welds of NiTi more than prove this point. However, laser welding may not lead itself well in joining thick sections. Poor laser interaction properties of NiTi would be one among other reasons why laser welding suffers in those conditions. Further, it can be reasonably concluded that laser welding did not prove to be a worthy candidate when called upon to join NiTi to a different material. Solid-state welding processes such as friction welding and friction stir welding showed some initial and promising results. The near-absence of fusion zone formation puts these processes a step ahead from the rest. This way the formation of intermetallic phases from the solidifying molten pool can be bypassed which is the first and foremost benefit when joining dissimilar materials. Notwithstanding their benefits, solid-state welding processes are not completely problems free. Chances of formation of new phases still exist, though reduced to a large extent. This is because, large plastic deformation associated with near fusion temperatures creates solid-state diffusion paths in dissimilar joints. One of the other significant advantages in league with friction welding and friction stir welding techniques is their ability to join comparatively thicker sections. Hence, as future scope proposed that friction welding could be developed as a joining route for NiTi to itself and Ti- 6Al-4V. Although the immediate applications for these joints are in aerospace field for realizing adaptive serrated nozzle, the accruing benefits can also be extended to the bio-medical field. The reason being that is both NiTi and Ti- 6Al-4V have excellent biocompatibility. The initial experiments presented in this work, show promise in realizing strong joint between Ti-6Al-4V and Nitinol. When welding parameters are within an optimum window, both the parent metals start to form flash indicating a positive response to the friction welding cycle. Even though, an intermixed zone was seen to have formed at the weld interface, it was only a narrow strip. It is hoped that with further developments regarding the welding trials, we will generate better understanding of the behavior of this intermixed zone and how it will affect the mechanical properties.

158,Perceived Effect Of Factors On Workers’ Task Performance  In A Cold Storage Warehouse Facility,"cold exposure has implications to worker’s health, safety, and occupational performance for the reason that it can cause injuries. interestingly, an extension of the protection motivation theory was used to evaluate the factors that affect the ergonomic risk behaviour of the employees and their task performance in a cold storage warehouse facility. structural equation modeling was then utilized to analyze the interrelationship among threat appraisal, coping appraisal, ergonomic risk behaviour, and cold storage task performance. an online questionnaire was distributed and a total of 255 data samples were collected. the results of the sem indicated that threat appraisal and coping appraisal had significant direct effects on the task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. however, the results also showed that pmt had a significant indirect effect on the cold storage employees regardless of having the latent ergonomic risk behaviour as not significant. in addition, ergonomic risk behaviour was also found to have no significant direct effect on the task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. hence, a risk assessment was conducted to identify the cold storage hazards and risk factors and to formulate cold storage operations improvements incorporating these influencing factors on task performance.",,"Like many hands-on jobs and working environments, working at a cold storage facility poses several potential health and injury risks for employees performing typical daily activities. With regular use of heavy equipment, exposure to extremely cold temperatures, damp, slippery surfaces, workplace injuries, and mishaps in cold storage facilities can be common – employees experience accidents like falls, overexertion, or cold-related adverse health effects. This current study integrated Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to evaluate ergonomic factors affecting the ergonomic risk behavior and task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. The results of the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) indicated that threat appraisal and coping appraisal had significant direct effects on the task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. However, the results also showed that PMT had a significant indirect effect on the cold storage employees regardless of having the latent ergonomic risk behavior as not significant. In addition, ergonomic risk behavior was also found to have no significant direct effect on the task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. These findings serve as an opportune reminder that safety climate scores do not always fully portray actual levels of safety behavior, implying that the use of several performance indicators to justify safety climate measures may be necessary. A risk assessment was also conducted in a cold storage facility to understand the common cold storage health and safety risks identified from the result of the SEM and incorporate strategies and guidelines to avoid personal injuries, ensure a working environment, and have efficient daily operations. 6.1 Recommendations The findings of this study indicate that safety climate perceptions will not necessarily match actual ergonomic risk behaviour and safety task performance of the employees in a cold storage facility. It is suggested that the cold storage warehouse management should focus its primary safety improvement effort on changing unsafe situations and conditions, and on preventing ergonomic related disorders. The above will help improve people’s safety behaviour as well as cold storage employee attitudes and perceptions. For future research- explore additional factors and relationships such as worker involvement to safety behaviours, safety awareness, and management commitment to ensure a safe environment for all of their employees at work.","cynthara b. leonardo and marvin i. noroña school of industrial engineering and service engineering management mapúa university, intramuros, 1002 metro manila, philippines cynthara28@yahoo.com, minorona@mapua.edu.ph",

160,Determinants Of Single Natural Fiber Stiffness Estimation  Accuracy And Enhancement Possibilities,"characterization is mandatory to exploit potential of natural fibers since most them don’t have available datasheets. coping with diameter disparity, lumen and their nature, the strength values of single natural fibers fluctuates substantially in a wide ranges. but, stiffness is relatively stable that it can be used to describe fibers and to make profound comparison among materials. hence, appropriate stiffness estimation is needed and result accuracy is depending on various parameters that allow to calculate in a deterministic way. this paper describes a strategy to enhance stiffness estimation accuracy and precision employing direct and indirect measurement methods jointly with digital image correlation techniques. enset fiber is used to display the efficacy of the methods. using these methods, materials with known stiffness are considered as a benchmark and above 5% accuracy enhancement has been achieved compared with conventional method. the effect of errors can potentially lead to wrong conclusion about the properties of the material. plus, the effect of each of the influencing parameter on stiffness result has been characterized. thus, stiffness can be used to typifies the tensile property of a fiber and its estimation accuracy, which can be enhanced using digital image correlation, plays significant role to compare materials.","natural fiber, stiffness, 2015). also","Estimation of natural fiber stiffness, specifically one of the major indicator of its property, can be affected by various factors. Error during density and weight measurement affects the diameter and in turn the stiffness value. One of the major reasons for the density result variation is the purging time and waiting time during pressure drop using the pycnometer. Similarly, digital image correlation reduces error emanated from cross head movement based strain and stiffness estimation.

163,"Global Brand Influences Brand Awareness, Intention, And  Impacts On Hotel Service Purchases","indonesia's ranking travel and tourism competitiveness report shows improvement, but level tourism competitive was lower in the world. indonesia has weaknesses in terms of infrastructure and the supporting environment in market tourism. hotel occurs to brand and price when consumer choice it. option global brand includes in competitiveness market hotel business. several local hotels had already changed the rebrand to a worldwide brand, but the occupation room decreased. this paper wanted to observe that international brand hotels can influence brand awareness through intent and purchase on service and product mice hotel. smart pls version 3.0 as a running data tool used as a partial least square model. range three months, we got 2300 customers of this hotel and using slovin formula with a margin error of 10 % and the survey spread by questionnaire. the research has proven top of global brand significant influence on brand awareness through intent and purchase. even though hotel rebranding with a worldwide brand is not influenced well by plan and buy, brand awareness could familiarize consumers with this hotel brand. our suggestion strategy using the global brand is not enough to grab consumers. excellent service and promotion hotels must capture by brand awareness of the consumer minds.","global brand, awareness, intent","Challenges of the Tourism Developing Market must interpret as a challenge to maximize the benefits of global brands. Another target increase brand awareness, especially in the hospitality industry in the era of disruption, to compete with countries that are far ahead in the hospitality industry, such as the United States, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and others. Some approaches that must apply in realizing competitiveness are: first, ongoing market research obtains valid data and provides input following consumer trends and the latest updates. Second, effective communication strategies implement integrated programs with good coordination between marketing and communication tools to carry out promotions to convey the message of the products or services of the Hotel Industry offered to consumers as part of product/service image representation. The company's effort to integrate and coordinate all communication channels to convey its message consistently and strongly influences its products. Third, optimization of marketing strategies by having partners in synergy to build a better corporate image in the eyes of consumers. Fourth, the promotion that it still did partially to improve by conducting joint promotions with fellow existing hotels simultaneously and carried out together with tourism attractions that support the hospitality business. The weaknesses in the development of tourism institutions are primarily in the hospitality industry. This industry must fix basic things. The formation of organizations that do not overshadow the field of tourism up to the regional level is not optimal. It can anticipate by increasing the role of local governments. In which organizational capacity- building programs can implement according to the Ministry of Tourism. The grand strategy to improve the tourism sector is the number one contributor to foreign exchange in Indonesia. Second, competence human resources who have professional competence by doing certification of basic competence or hospitality managerial, to have a fast response in delivering the consumer need, have empathy for guests/consumers, understanding of the products/services offered to suit the needs of consumers to achieve guest satisfaction to make more purchases and ultimately provide positive recommendations for products/services provided by the hotel (3) coordination of cross-sectoral development between stakeholders: Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Communication and Information, Ministry of Labor and others, so that they are singular in their policy establishment and implementation. In this case, the role of brand awareness must consistently increase if the Swiss-bell Hotel Bogor, always to be maintained and increase to increase intent to purchase for consumers, especially MICE products in Swiss-bel Hotel Bogor. By improving the quality of resources, facilities, business processes that aim to increase customer satisfaction, which in turn can provide recommendations for other consumers to use MICE products at the Swiss-bel Hotel Bogor.

164,Cad-Aided Preoperative Simulation In Pediatric  Orthopedics: The Case Study Of Ollier'S Disease,"this work shows a preoperative simulation procedure with computer aided design (cad) 3d software for a patient suffering from ollier's disease. this pathology is very rare and occurs in extremely different ways depending on the case. consequently, it is difficult to establish a correct surgical strategy that can be applied in a similar way to all patients. computer aided surgical simulation (cass) process uses advanced modeling technologies to reproduce bony anatomy and simulate the surgery. the starting point is represented by the 3d digital model of the bone obtained from tomographic images. through cad modeling software such as creo parametric and following surgeons directives, engineers can provide doctors with orthopedic simulation and expectation of achievable surgical outcome. if virtual surgical prediction doesn’t meet doctors requirements, model is regenerated and it is possible to seek for a better solution. cass process allow for extensive surgical planning, enhancing accuracy in theatre and enriching the amount of medical information that is needed to perform complex orthopedic procedures. in conclusion, the possibility to recognize in advance the overall orthopedic situation and outcoming expectancy represent an extraordinary upgrade of current surgical state of the art, leading to minimally invasive surgeries and patient-specific solutions.","3d modeling, cass, cad","The simulation gave doctors an overview of the possible surgical outcome, complete with all the details and specific for the case under exam. The three-dimensional model, precisely dimensioned, allows an accurate analysis in pre- operative planning phase with a consequent reduction of risks and unforeseen in surgery and therefore possible delays.

166,Sustainable Echo Absorption Material With Recycled Plastic,"the echo absorption system is the reduction of echo and noise reverberation within a room and in doing so helps to reduce the volume of noise, whilst increasing the clarity. firstly, sound absorption material is particularly important for large enclosed spaces such as classrooms, cinemas, and exhibition halls. these huge and spacious rooms are subjected to echo sounds, even a drop of a pen can make a huge sound in these rooms; so, an acoustic material is introduced to reduce such echo. secondly, sea life is affected by plastic on a huge scale. billions of tons of plastic have been used on earth which is affecting everything on earth like: humans, plants, trees, animals, sea life. to overcome such issues, we as human beings must do some efforts to reduce the waste of plastic. every item comes in plastic bags e.g., disposal cups, grocery polyethylene's, plastic bottles, etc. in this century every engineer would like to introduce sustainable material to clients/investors to make a safe and healthy living environment. using plastic as a construction material is relatively new. the main objective of the paper is to take the first step and reduce the plastic from the earth by recycling & reusing plastic to reduce pollution. by using this acoustic material, we can reach to ideal sound absorption level. this paper describes a sustainable material that has acoustic properties. this material is made of perforated wood panels, fabric, and recycled plastic. an airborne test is conducted to find the noise reduction coefficient (nrc). the target is to have absorption class a standard, the very highest rating in sound absorption. the acoustic testing data are presented for different thicknesses of these layers which will be fixed above block walls.",design,"When designing a classroom, special attention is given to architectural acoustics to control noise and create a calmer, more peaceful environment for the students. Understanding sound isolation, mechanical noise and vibration control, and room acoustics is an essential component of designing any student housing facility. The above characteristics can be achieved with waste plastic & old clothes which helps to reduce the plastic waste from the earth. So, we have two benefits. Firstly, Echo Absorption system will be done and secondly, plastic can be reduced from earth & help to reduce global warming. This material can be used in many places like hotels, meeting rooms, hospitals, sports halls, music halls, museums, etc. The experiments are conducted for three different thicknesses of 19mm, 25mm, and 22mm of Rook wool & recycled Plastic & cotton. It is recommended to use 22mm thick panels with 19mm thick Rockwool & 3mm recycled cotton & plastic considering the cost and sound absorption. 0 20 40 60 80 100 Absorption Frequency 19mm 22mm 25mm Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Rome, Italy, August 2-5, 2021","komalpreet kaur takhar undergraduate student, department of civil engineering, british applied college, umm al quwain, uae 1710101@acuq.ae dr. saleema panda assistant professor, department of civil engineering, british applied college, umm al quwain, uae saleema.p@acuq.ae","References

167,A Math-Heuristic Approach For Two Echelon Vendor  Managed Inventory Routing Problem,this paper studies a two-echelon vendor managed inventory routing problem of a honey packager company that delivers packaged products from a single facility to multiple retailers and customers. the objective is creating a supply chain which minimizes the total distribution cost while satisfying customers’ demand on time through retailers. the complex nature of the problem originates from connecting the inventory management and the routing process which makes getting an exact solution to the problem difficult. we propose a mathematical optimization model and develop a three-step clustering-based math-heuristic algorithm to solve the problem since commercial solvers fail to provide high-quality solutions within a given time limit. the performance of the algorithm is tested with randomly generated dimensions. the algorithm yields (on average) 16% improvement compared to objective value performances of the commercial solver.,math-heuristics,"The two-echelon vendor managed inventory routing problem is discussed in this paper, and the clustering-based math- heuristic algorithm consists of three parts is proposed. The first phase constructs clusters including a single retailer and multiple customers in each. The customers are paired with their corresponding retailers using a utility-based function. The second step solves the routing problem in each cluster independently and the third step solves the routing problem between each cluster’s retailer and the production center. The proposed algorithm achieves an on average 16% improvement compared to mathematical model’s four hours performance in commercial solver CPLEX on all instances run, while decreasing computational time to minutes. The proposed math-heuristic algorithm is compared with the initial model in several instances to yield a proper estimate about the performance of the algorithm.

168,Techno-Economic Analysis Of Electrochemical Recovery Of  Metals From Waste Printed Circuit Boards (Pcbs),"electronic waste (e-waste) is a potential source of valuable and critical materials such as gold, silver, platinum group metals, copper, and rare earth elements. in canada, however, less than 20% of generated e-waste is recycled. there exists a need for an efficient, sustainable e-waste metal recovery process that could be deployed on a regional scale to incentivize collection and recycling. in this paper, a process model was developed in matlab to simulate the electrochemical recovery of base and precious metals from printed circuit boards (pcbs) using regenerated fe3+ oxidant. in the modelled process, fe3+ ions are regenerated at the anode of an electrolytic cell while extracted metals are recovered on the cell cathode. a two-stage process using unique electrolyte solution for each allows base metals (cu, sn) and precious metals (ag, au, pd) to be recovered separately. the process model was able to predict economic and environmental performance of the process given a set of feed conditions and operating parameters. monte carlo analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to determine key operating parameters and optimal setpoints for a final design. the final design was environmentally and economically feasible, with an estimated net annual profit of ca$ 321,000 after tax, and a carbon intensity 57.7% lower than the conventional pyrometallurgical process used for e-waste metal recovery.","e-waste, recycling, electrometallurgy, critical metals","This paper focused on the design of an alternative small-scale, low-emissions process for the recovery of metals for e-waste that was economically feasible. Overall, the results of modelling have predicted that the proposed design was able to meet the design constraints and success criteria and is thus economically and environmentally feasible and likely to be profitable. The modelling predicted a carbon intensity under half of the current industrial route, while economic metrics suggested a payback period of under 2 years. Coupled with the potential social benefits of the current work, the design’s achievement of metric targets provides a clear incentive for further investigation. While overall findings are very positive, the modelling done cannot conclude that the proposed design would be feasible in practice. As has been discussed above, several assumptions were made to simplify the model into a solvable state. Additionally, there are many aspects of practical design and logistics that were not considered – for example, the ability to procure a steady supply of PCBs. If the processis to be developed further, it would be important to conduct more detailed environmental and economic analyses to support the design and validate the benefits of this processing method. Resolving the model limitations as discussed previously will be critical for improving the confidence in design feasibility, profitability, and sustainability, and will highlight routes for further refinement in this space. Validating the behavior of the system through lab and bench testing will be critical to verify expected performance and optimize the design for future process scale-up activities.","matthew lam, aidan o’gorman, ryan schleehahn, ali elkamel university of waterloo waterloo, on n2l 3g1, canada mrlam@uwaterloo.ca, a2ogorma@uwaterloo.ca, rmschlee@uwaterloo.ca, aelkmael@uwaterloo.ca",
169,Optimization Of Consumable Consumption In Hypermarkets  During The Coronavirus Pandemic Period,"since the appearance of the coronavirus pandemic, the activity of several companies has experienced a remarkable decline. this decline is due especially to several reasons linked to several social, tourist, and preventive factors. to do this, to find solutions to minimize losses and achieve the objectives, and above all to ensure the continuity of the desired results, we opted for several management methods such as six-sigma and kaizen. in this article we will study the case of the decline in activity in large-scale distribution, knowing that during periods of confinement, sales of hypermarkets recorded a strong regression in morocco, since the ratio of all the indicators of management and all expenses of a hypermarket is always linked to sales excluding taxes, this is why they were led to optimize their expenses and review their management method to alleviate the loss. in this article, we will see the reasons for the decline in activity and the action plans to be taken to optimize the expenses of hypermarkets using the lss (lean six sigma) method.","keywords— six sigma, lean, lean management, corona virus","This article presented a method of optimizing consumption of hypermarket consumable using Lean Six-Sigma (LSS) project management applied in a Moroccan retail company. The proposed Lean six-sigma approach is KAIZEN. Since there are not many supermarket chains in Morocco, there is a lack of knowledge or application of lean management and six-sigma applied to hypermarkets. The first thing was to be able to present these methodologies and show their benefits for all company management and finally to agree to them to help optimize one component of the costs and why not all the other components. Through this approach, the results of the study showed that improved process and project management and the involvement of the whole team can be achieved by continuously identifying, analyzing and seeing opportunities for improving processes and decisions while optimizing resources and eliminating waste.

170,Digitizing Trade Finance Using Blockchain Technology  Illustration Of Letter Of Credit Process,"this research aims to study the issues derived from the current trade finance processes, followed by evaluating the available technological solutions proposed by researchers and fintechs. the purpose of seeking technological solutions is to replace the current obsolete processes of traditional trade finance, which rely heavily on manual monotonous labor and paperwork. in this research, the impact of blockchain technology on the trade finance processes is examined using three simulation models, paper letter of credit, bank payment obligation (bpo), and blockchain letter of credit. the research findings observed a significant increase in process efficiency up to 94% while conducting processes under blockchain platform and 74% using bpo. moreover, the study demonstrates how the efficiency gained from applying blockchain technology to the trade finance processes could increase productivity and significantly reduce processing costs. the research findings provided an essential awareness to banks, corporates, and governmental authorities about the importance of blockchain technology in trade finance and highlighted the need for an urgent digital transformation. researchers can extend studies by applying proof of concept of blockchain implementation to other trade finance processes such as documentary collections and guarantees. future work can include more parties from the entire trade ecosystem such as shippers, insurers, and governmental authorities.","trade ecosystem, trade finance, blockchain, letter of credit","Many banks worldwide have considered that the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) is a serious risk of interrupting its business and raised concerns on the long-term inability of physical document delivery and circulation between all parties in the trade. This study explored how blockchain technology can essentially impact trade finance processes. The blockchain can improve trade business processes, eliminate paper manipulation, increase process efficiency, and provide a real opportunity to all parties involved in the trade process to reduce costs and increase productivity. The impact of blockchain technology on the trade finance processes was examined by testing and simulating 1,200,000 L/C processes in both cases, the current paper-based process and blockchain process, and 600,000 BPOs as an additional alternative digital solution. We used Simulation Software, AnyLogic, to examine and test the effect of blockchain technology on trade finance processes using three simulation models, letter of credit paper-based process, blockchain-based process, and bank payment obligation (BPO). The research findings observed a significant increase in process efficiency up to 94% while conducting L/Cs under the blockchain platform and 74% while shifting to digital process using BPO. In addition, the study demonstrated how the efficiency gained by applying blockchain technology to the trade finance process increases productivity and reduces labor and courier costs. The automatic notification of status changes can be an added value function enabled by blockchain platforms creating end-to-end traceability features to trade finance processes. This study is a supporting tool that enables experts make their important and strategic decision of the miraculous proven effect of blockchain technology to trade ecosystems and supply chains. It presents near-real proof of concept by Simulative illustration. As such, our study should assist banks, corporates, and government authorities in making decisions about implementation. Standardization of this technology as the first milestone will give full support for blockchain-enabled initiatives toward an umbrella use of this technology to cover all banks and trade parties worldwide. Even though this study is unique, it also has limitations. The research is limited to the specific effect of blockchain technology on supply chain and trade finance in respect of processing time efficiency implementation and costs. Other costs involved in trade finance processes such as papers, administrative, emission, technology were not considered in this study. In the future, researchers may focus on the implementation of blockchain technology in trade finance processes considering other costs. More studies have to be conducted to explore and include more stakeholders in the process or cover broader forms to include more parties involved in the entire trade ecosystem.

172,Technology Acceptance And Digital Divide As Correlates Of  Performance Among Engineering Students And Teachers:,"digital divide centers on access to various dimensions of information and communication technology (ict) including physical access, motivation, skills, and actual usage of digital technologies. this divide tends to be even wider in the context of developing countries. further, educational setting has been recognized as a domain with good potential for incorporation of new technologies. it involves a wide range of users of learning technology which should support the process of knowledge transfer and acquisition. yet, there is a lack of literature on the digital divide and technology acceptance among the students and teachers in secondary education. as an initial step to fill the gap in the existing literature, developing a new model to capture the interplay between digital divide and technology acceptance, and how these affect performances among students and teachers using structural equation modelling and confirmatory factor analysis is of essence. this paper focuses on the development and validation of such a model. the purpose of the study is to build a model that examines relationships among variables associated with factors that influence technology acceptance and digital divide. data was collected from 1000 participants using a survey questionnaire. employing structural equation modelling, a hypothesized model was tested for model fit in the study. the resulting model is found to have a good fit.","digital divide, performance",,"inputs to educational technology acquisition and adaptation model. romalyn l. galingan technological institute of the philippines; pamantasan ng lungsod ng marikina cubao, quezon city, philippines; sss village, marikina city philippines rgalingan.ie@tip.edu.ph, rgalingan@ched.gov.ph erico m. habijan pamantasan ng lungsod ng marikina sss village, marikina city philippines ericohabijan@yahoo.com, ericohabijan@gmail.com","References

173,Anomalies Detection In Smart Manufacturing Using  Machine Learning And Deep Learning Algorithms,"nowadays, the rapidly changing of manufacturing environment has pushed companies to achieve more customer satisfaction by enhancing product quality, reducing production cost, and realizing sustainability. anomaly detection has a strong influence on the quality of products and it is usually conducted through visual quality inspection. the visual quality inspection of a product can be performed either manually or automatically. the manual inspection suffers from being a monotonous task, leading to overlooked errors and subjective assessments. accordingly, the manufacturing industry has high ambitions to rely upon automated quality inspection systems to cope with the requirements of smart manufacturing and the emergence of industry 4.0. efficient utilization of big data can enable the development of intelligent quality inspection systems. machine learning as one of the prevailing data analytics methods is widely used to support and improve the performance of the automated quality inspection systems. this research compares the performance of recurrent neural networks (rnn) like multilayer perceptron (mlp) with the traditional machine learning algorithms (tmla) for anomalies detection in manufacturing such as decision trees, random forest (rf), k-nearest-neighbor (knn), support vector machine (svm), naïve bayes, and logistic regression (lr). a data set for faults is adapted from the literature to fairly compare the performance of these algorithms considering different accuracy measures such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and f1-score.","smart manufacturing, industry 4.0, machine learning","This paper presented a comparative study of different machine learning algorithms, for anomalies detection in manufacturing using the dataset of Steel plate faults, by Semeion, Research of Sciences of Communication. A framework has been developed for the multi classification of steel plates faults from fault (1-7) by investigation the use of mostly popular traditional machine learning; Decision trees, KNN, SVM, Naïve Bayes, RF, Logistic Regression and artificial neural network namely multilayer perceptron (MLP). The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1-score are considered the key performance metrics for the comparative study. It has been observed that some ML Algorithms had an accuracy above 93% in detecting faults. The RF has the best recall, accuracy, precision and F1 score performance average measures over the competitors. By comparing TMLA with MLP as one of the ANN, TMLA are superior to MLP. From the results, the faults can be classified into three categories; (i) easily classified faults like fault 4, (ii) faults cannot be easily classified like fault 7, (iii) faults detection performance depends on the type of ML algorithms. Therefore, it is recommended that, to find the suitable ML algorithm to classify those faults. The performance of the methods achieved of test data is reached 93% that guide production managers can utilize the ML to automate and improve fault detection instead of monotonous manual inspection. In addition, the significant and rapid improvements in data integration technologies make ML a powerful tool in manufacturing processes and can be utilized to gain beneficial insights into the behavior of manufacturing systems, improving the quality of decisions. Future research should consider testing the adopted machine learning algorithm in this paper with a variety of applications in manufacturing. In addition, other machine learning algorithms or hybrid algorithms should be developed and tested for improving the detecting accuracy. In particular, there is a need to find some appropriate machine learning algorithms to handle the cases such as faults 6 and 7.","mohamed gamal production engineering department, faculty of engineering, nahda university, beni-suef 62521, egypt mohammed.gammal@nub.edu.eg ahmed donkol electrical engineering department, faculty of engineering, nahda university, beni-suef 62521, egypt ahmed.donkol@nub.edu.eg ahmed shaban mechanical engineering department, faculty of engineering, fayoum university, fayoum 63514, egypt ahmed.shaban@fayoum.edu.eg francesco costantino, giulio di gravio and riccardo patriarca mechanical and aerospace engineering department, sapienza university of rome, via eudossiana, 18, 00184 rome, italy francesco.costantino@uniroma1.it; giulio.digravio@uniroma1.it; riccardo.patriarca@uniroma1.it",
174,Firm’S Sustainable Performance: Available Tools And  Proposal Of A New Module,"firm’s performance can not be limited to minimizing costs and increased production volumes. it now requires a continuous improvement approach, overall, resulting in deployment of all economic, environmental and social dimensions of enterprise: so this is a so-called overall performance to be considered. financial performance is no longer sufficient to assess firm’s performance. therefore, companies should measure their progress from a more comprehensive performance including, apart from economic dimension, environmental and social dimensions. goal of this work is to design a module for obtaining a global composite index in order to determine integrated information on economic, environmental, social and global performance of firm in time. normalized indicators were associated into three sustainability sub-indices and finally composed into a global indicator of firm’s global performance. a case study was used to validate this module, interpretation of results is given and the utility of our module with its relevance is pointed out.",global performance,"measuring global performance, vague concept, is related to many difficulties and presented by many authors as the aggregation of the economic, social and environmental performances of firm. Analysis of different measurement tools used by companies to understand their performance, shows that no one is able to measure interactions between different segments of performance. For the moment, available tools (Balanced ScoreCard in its updated version of CSR, Triple Bottom Line reporting) provide a segmented view of global performance in three dimensions: economic, social and environmental. They measure these dimensions separately and then compile them regardless of correlations between these dimensions. In the best case, some tools (crusaders GRI indicators) evaluate interactions between two dimensions: economic / social or economic / environmental, but, they do not allow to significantly integrate the three dimensions of global performance. However, it should be recalled, as financial performance and choice of these indicators is a political arbitration. They must be built in a concertatif and strategic process with leaders agreement and participation of company stakeholders. In this perspective, global performance can be analyzed as a social convention co-constructed and negotiated between company's management and its various stakeholders. While sustainability information is typically treated separately, this paper tries to translate it into a form which corresponds to needs of decision-makers. This work illustrates that it is possible to assess sustainable development in an integrated way which provides good guidance for decision-making. As the business case for sustainable practices becomes increasingly clear, sustainability reporting offers a measurable value to those whose business is to assess current sustainability health of firms and influence future actions. At present, content of sustainability reports tends to appear in forms and units that are not readily convertible into unique terms. The module presented in this article promises advance in sustainability assessment of firm and makes sustainability information more useful to decision-makers. Core and supplemental indicators (IEco, IEnv, ISoc) when combined into global composite index (Ig) can be used to reflect the achievements of firm towards sustainability. Even though further development is called for, it is evident that this module for sustainable development assessment has the potential to become very useful as one of available tools. The combination of better assessment methods is likely to continue this movement towards a new generation of integrated sustainability performance reports.

176,Availability Analysis Of A Two-Component Parallel  System Under Stochastic Dependence,"research in maintenance engineering is increasingly focusing on complex systems in which components are subject to various dependencies, such as stochastic, structural, and economic dependences. this paper proposes a mathematical approach to calculate system’s availability with stochastic dependence and assesses its effect on the system. from this perspective, cox proportional hazards model (cphm), based on the exponential survival distribution, is used. the results show that increasing the degree of dependence impacts, considerably, system availability. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management rome, italy, august 2-5, 2021 © ieom society international 1644",,"In this paper, we have proposed a mathematical approach of availability calculation for a parallel two-machine system with considering the stochastic dependence. The exposed procedure to evaluate the dependence's effect is based on the consideration of two functions. The first function, called the influence function, which defines the factors influencing availability 'dependency factor'. The second one, called basic time function. Thus, this approach makes it possible to evaluate the failure rate impact of one machine's failure rate on that of another with the time-dependent basic function (exponential distribution). Therefore, it makes possible to assess the impact of the failure rate of one machine on that of another. In this case, it shows the dependency's impact on the availability and repair rates of a machine stochastically dependent on another. Consequently, it is more realistic to consider these interactions when optimizing maintenance, production, or integrated optimization of these two functions. Hence, it is recommended to use such an approach as a starting point, to obtain a better assessment and estimation of the system availability, as well as a better planning of maintenance and production because in case of an incorrect estimation, a surplus of various unnecessary costs can be generated.","ziyad bahou moad6, mohammadia school of engineers, mohammed v university, rabat, morocco ziyad.bahou@hotmail.fr nizar elhachemi moad6, abs, mohammadia school of engineers, mohammed v university, um6p rabat, morocco elhachemi@emi.ac.ma issam krimi lamih, bear lab international university of rabat, rabat business school rabat, morocco issam.krimi@uir.ac.ma abdessamad ait el cadi lamih, cnrs, umr 8201, f-59313, université polytechnique haut-de-france, insa hauts-de-france valenciennes, france abdessamad.aitelcadi@uphf.fr najiba sbihi moad6, mohammadia school of engineers, mohammed v university, rabat, morocco sbihi@emi.ac.ma",

179,Evaluating Factors Of Profitability For Improvement At  Padumacom Karya Jaya,"the study examined the effect of working capital management on the profitability of pt. padumacom karya jaya as the company has a problem with its decreasing profit, whereas the company has increasing revenue. this study analyzes the debt ratio, average collection period, average payment period, and current ratio as the independent variables and return on assets as the dependent variable. the data was obtained from the monthly financial report of the company for three years. classical assumption, descriptive statistics, correlation, and multiple regression analysis are used as the methods to analyze the data used for this study. the findings of this study show that there is significant influence of debt ratio, average collection period, and average payment period on the return on assets, whereas there is no significant influence of current ratio on the return on assets. the three variables have negative impact that can be seen through the regression coefficients of 0.003, 0.042, and 0.0155, respectively. every increase in each variable will decrease profitability and vice versa. the most significance variable is the average payment period, so the company must be concerned about the period to pay its debt, because when the company is late, the creditor will charge interest to the company and also the company might face the currency inflation when it times to pay the debt because company uses other currency to do the transactions.","debt ratio, current ratio","Based on the result of the test, it can be concluded that: 1. There is significant influence of debt ratio on profitability of PT. Padumacom Karya Jaya. 2. There is significant influence of average collection period on profitability of PT. Padumacom Karya Jaya. 3. There is significant influence of average payment period on profitability of PT. Padumacom Karya Jaya. 4. There is no significant influence of current ratio on profitabiliy of PT. Padumacom Karya Jaya. It is proven that debt ratio, average collection period and account payable period have significant negative effect on profitability with regression coefficients of 0.003, 0.042, and 0.0155, respectively. Every increase in each variable will decrease profitability and vice versa. Therefore, to improve further profitability the company must be concerned about the period to pay its debt. Because if the company is late, the company will be charged the interest from its creditor and the currency inflation can decrease the profitability of the company. In conclusion, it is important for the company to minimize its debt, use other current assets when purchasing the equipment, obtain more capital or assets so the company can purchase in cash, and has to be wiser in collecting its account receivable. As a result, working capital has to be managed in order to increase the profitability and create more value for the shareholders and employees. It is also recommended that the company has to separately focus on each component of the working capital on the company. This study is limited to the three years period of time, therefore other researcher can use a longer period and this study is limited to four independent variables, therefore other researcher can use other or more variables.","anna gracia and bachtiar h. simamora management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, 11480, indonesia anngraciaa@gmail.com, bsimamora@binus.edu lily leonita management department binus online learning, bina nusantara university jakarta, 11480, indonesia lily.leonita@binus.ac.id",

186,A Preliminary Analysis On Road Accidents Among Food Delivery Motorcyclists:,"road accidents are the most prevalent phenomena in every part of the planet in our everyday lives. driver behavior is one of the key elements in this dilemma. in this study three behaviors, human factor, road conditions and road safety policies, are collected from road users situated in johor baharu. the purpose of the project is to discover the key elements within those three factors that might affect motorcyclists' road accidents. a regression analysis would be conducted to identify the significant three behavioral factors contributing to the accidents. a total of 112 riders would be selected using a simple random sampling technique to complete the survey. the results showed that the road conditions are an important factor in determining the road accidents for motorcyclists delivering meals in johor baharu. accordingly, the relevant recommendations based on the results may be proposed in that the local government should create an additional motorcycle route to facilitate their travel and further strengthen the motorcycle road regulations as well. these measures can assist and even help to prevent the road accidents among motorcyclists.","behavioral factor, road accident","The results of this study are highly relevant in the global setting, in particular for countries pursuing methods that are comparable to those discovered in Malaysia. Studies demonstrate that the only way to reduce risks among motorcyclists is to establish separate lanes, in particular exclusive lanes for them. However, road maintenance may be improved and suggestions from this research indicate a more optimum and consistent execution of the maintenance plan should be conducted frequently. Based on the results it proves that road condition causes accidents, and thus road safety partly relies on the proper maintenance of road surfaces. Additionally, climate and road degradation could also contribute to accidents, therefore repairs need to be carried out often and again a good maintenance schedule needs to be planned efficiently so that the consequent of wasteful costs such as repairs, delays and social cost could be lessened. Malaysia's road infrastructure should pay greater attention and develop passive and lasting solutions to prevent damage to all the key stakeholders.","determining the factors influencing the accidents siti nurul suhada rosle malaysia institute of transport, universiti teknologi mara, 40450 shah alam, selangor, malaysia sitinurulsuhadas@yahoo.com siti ayu jalil malaysia institute of transport, universiti teknologi mara, 40450 shah alam, selangor, malaysia faculty of business and management, universiti teknologi mara puncak alam campus, 42300 puncak alam, selangor, malaysia. ayu090@uitm.edu.my",

188,Analysis Of Adoption Of Globalgap Certification In  Pakistan,"in this paper, we analyzed various determinants of the adoption of globalgap certification in pakistan. the study found that higher schooling as well as financial know how increase the probability of adoption of certification. in the same way, training helped farmers to successfully adopt the globalgap standard. as there are some additional costs associated with compliance to the certification, it is clear that farmers with relatively larger farm size and those who could access credit are more likely to adopt. on the other hand, factors such as age, experience and distance from the provincial capital are not significant predictors of the outcome. however, there is a requirement to assess the properties of globalgap for pakistani agriculture; to attain this a complete methodological idea is essential. it would make the agriculture sector of pakistan more export oriented, yielding higher returns to the gross domestic production of the county. in this context, this study offers a valuable guideline in order to reformulate policies that would ultimately help to improve global competency of agriculture sector of pakistan.","globalgap, private standards, smallholders","This study is aimed to identify various determinants of the adoption of GlobalGAP certification in Pakistan. We found that higher schooling and financial know how helps to increase the probability of adoption of certification. As the figure 1 shows that the highest motivation is to adopt the certification in order to attain high price premium for the certified produce. Additionally, as demonstrated by figure 2, various reasons for not adopting the certification scheme where high investment cost associated with compliance to certification is the most important reason. Another reason for not implementing the certification report by farmers is that they found it difficult to understand various requirement of GlobalGAP certification. Similarly, trainings are the useful sources for farmers to successfully adopt the GlobalGAP standard. As there are some additional costs associated with compliance to the certification, it is concluded that farmers with relatively larger farm size and those who could access credit are more likely to adopt. In the light of these finding, we draw policy recommendations for the improvement of the horticulture sector of Pakistan. In Pakistan, almost 20 million hectares are used for agricultural and horticultural which is almost one fourth of the total arable land, (PHDEC, 2015). Robust estimates of standard errors for each model is given in the right adjacent column. Total 228 observations are analyzed. The value of pseudo R squared is estimated to be 0.5125. Of that amount only 20 percent is considered to have the potential for intensive crop production (Irshad, 2021; Khan, 2011). In addition, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, organizations such as Pakistan Horticulture Development & Export Company (PHDEC) and Agribusiness Support Fund (APS) can play important role in this regard.

193,Automation Transaction Of Motor Vehicle Registrations In Land  Transportation Office (Lto) Of The Philippines1,"motor vehicle (mv) registration issue per se has been plaguing the national capital region (ncr) and resulted in many temporary remedies and changes in the lto system. this eventually has caused headaches both for lto and private owners, as having lost in productivity, time and effort, extra cost and contracting fixers in the area. the growing demand for a fixed viable process has caused havoc in the lto and thirst for a new methodology in its system. in an attempt to solve this particular issue, a new automation and auto verification (autocheck) via online of mv may address the issue.","emission testing, autocheck","The study examined the Philippine LTO in its enforcement of or implementation of the applicable and existing laws of the land with regard to MV Registration. Such examination exposed the fundamental flaws in the Bureau with corresponding delays in checking the MV records, antiquated methods, practices of registration and issuing of the ORs. This has been chronic from time in memorial. Adding insult to the injury, the limited period imposed per LTO district on the number of individuals allowed to transact in a day has been chaotic at all times. The fact that the LTO is a bureau that generate income, did not avail of the opportunity offered in the modern 21st century. It did not take advantage of modernizing its equipment and utilities. The lack of information, advancement and improvement have placed the Bureau to a testing ground, proved to be necessary, of calling a new process or system that will be consistent for all generations to come. There is a need to recalibrate its system to adapt to the modern technology of online MV registration, at least conduct an online AutoChecking of MV in a speedy manner. It is expected that there are other ways of recalibration/reconfiguration of the systems to be undertaken in the future. The writers are hoping that this proposal-study becomes a proverbial pebble that will cause ripples to emerging online MV Registration of the LTO system. Gradual changes are good, but actual transition of modernizing a system is even better. It is not farfetched for the LTO to implement a better and modern online means of MV Registration and AutoCheck, aside from the fact that the Bureau is an earning agency, its LTMS has already established LIVE websites to 138 identified sites of all LTOs in the Philippines, with 113 sites already been awarded to private operators. It means that these 138 sites are already running, pilot tested, and actual testing connectivity from those sites rendering MV reports to LTO LTMS website. This does not have a public users accessibility yet, which means it is still under restriction that only an exclusive accessing of result-data by the Bureau only. However, during an interview with LTO- Information and Communication Technology (ICT), it was discussed that the LTMS is new within the LTO online system. It is an online registration, wherein PMVIC renders its result or report of inspection right after every MV inspection conducted. Mr. MJ Datu, LTO-ICT Consultant, mentioned that the LTMS website will eventually be open to public users to easily access an online registration, not just for MV but for other LTO services. Sadly, as of 29 January 2021 of the interview date, LTMS website is not yet for public users’ advantage. In reiterating the writers’ hope that this proposal-study will eventually be an eye-opener that the LTO Philippines is capable of having an interactive AutoChecking system and capable of finding easier methods despite the pandemic, and inspite of the IT issues of internet connectivity. Therefore, there must be a reliable-dependable-fixed and viable LTO system for public online users. Also, this proposal-study is timely applicable as the pandemic requires all to have social distancing, having an Online MV Registration befits the current environmental scenario.

195,Deadlock And Collision Prevention Algorithms For Mobile  Robots In Automated Warehouses,"recent supply chain targets have led to decreased response time requests also causing enterprises invest for automation technologies for efficient management for their warehouses. in this paper, we focus on an automated warehousing environment where there are robotic order pickers travelling on ground flexibly throughout aisles. we develop deadlock and collision prevention algorithms for safely travel of those robotic order pickers. the developed algorithms can be utilized by any warehouse system having autonomous vehicles (e.g., automated guided vehicles, mobile robots, or shuttles in a multi-tier automated warehouse) that can travel between aisles freely. while developing those smart algorithms, we also aim to improve some performance metrics such as average flow time and, maximum flow time of a transaction in the system. to test the performance of the algorithms, we model the system as a multi-agent system, where autonomous vehicles are able to communicate with each other under an internet of things (iot) environment. we compare that flexible system design with a dedicated design where a dedicated vehicle is assigned for a pre- defined number of aisles. the experimental results show that under well-designed deadlock and collision prevention control algorithm, flexible travel of vehicles can provide advantage compared to dedicated design.",,"In this paper, we focus on an automated warehousing environment where there are robotic order pickers travelling on ground flexibly throughout aisles. We develop flexible travel algorithms for those robotic order pickers throughout the storage racks so that they do not collide with each other. The developed algorithms can be utilized for any warehouse system having autonomous vehicles (i.e., automated guided vehicles, mobile robots, or shuttles in a multi- tier automated warehouse) that can travel between rack aisles freely in a facility. While developing those smart algorithms, we aim to improve some critical performance metrics: average flow time of a transaction, maximum flow time of a transaction as well as variance of travel times in the system. To test the performance of the algorithms, we model the system by a multi-agent simulation model, where autonomous vehicles are able to communicate with each other under an IoT environment. We compare those flexible travel system designs with their dedicated system designs where in the dedicated system design, a dedicated AMR is assigned for a pre-defined number of aisles. The experimental results show under a well-designed deadlock and collision prevention control algorithm the flexible travel of vehicles can provide advantageous compared to dedicated design. And, it is also observed that up to 22% improvement in average flow time value and 60% in maximum flow time value can be achieved by this design. As future works, more racking designs as well as smart control algorithms can be considered to observe better performance results from the system.","ecem eroglu turhanlar and banu yetkin ekren department of industrial engineering yasar university izmir, turkey ecem.eroglu@outlook.com, banu.ekren@yasar.edu.tr",

The researchers conducted a survey online with the use of a web-based survey tool (google form), and they were able to gather data from the respondents to get feedback on their food delivery experiences. The researchers were also able to assess their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, and the process of how people order in the application. The most important factor in an online delivery, according to 54.5% of respondents, was delivery, while the least important factor, according to 75.5% of respondents, was the interface. The survey also shows that 66.5% of its respondents utilize multiple online food delivery applications. The researchers were also able to show the statistics of different online food delivery applications per factor. The assessment was made by discussing different categories per phase and factor. The researchers then gathered the data and used it in statistical analysis to interpret them. The researchers then used the output of phase 1 to conduct phase 2 of this study. For the second phase, the ANOVA and Tukey tests identified 17 factors with significant differences between the factors and concluded that GrabFood has the highest overall rating of 4.1 for visual appeal, method, and delivery. In addition, the application of Pearson correlation resulted in the identification of factors with high-intermediate to a strong significant relationship. Furthermore, regression determined 7 significant factors that affect the efficiency of the overall delivery. The R-sq indicates that 71.34% of the efficiency of online food deliveries is explained by the 7 significant factors. Each data obtained from phases 1 and 2 were then analyzed by the researchers to create a risk assessment that identified possible risks and has a contingency plan for each category and benchmarked to provide and show which is the best practice to do.

This study surveyed major criteria and the e-payment systems' situation right now in the Philippines. The tool used in ranking the e-payment systems together with its given criteria was the AHP decision-making tool in which the results of this tool were extensively discussed. The findings of this study are both applicable to the researchers, future researchers, and business establishments that are planning to take on or revamp an e-payment system. People create developments to make lives for everyone easier just like the e-payment system. This system was made and imposed so that people don't need to carry cash around, waiting in line to pay bills, and wait for their change. This development is exactly what people need being that digital technology is now part of everyone's daily life. By connecting their debit cards, mobile wallets, and other digital gateways to shopping accounts, consumers can now buy and pay for products online. However, under criteria from the seven (7) factors given by the researchers, respondents prioritize security when choosing a payment option. Results show that PayMaya was able to offer excellent service in all the criteria, most especially in terms of security. Overall, most respondents are satisfied with their chosen payment option, although some respondents are not pleased by their experience through the cashless system; but it varies on their preference in buying or their behavior.","applications as a payment option in the philippines julianne mikhaella delos reyes, louis miguel dural julia sofie mangaoang, gaea marithe victor and rianina borres school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila 1002, philippines jmcdelosreyes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, lmcdural@mymail.mapua.edu.ph jsdmangaoang@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gmwvictor@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdborres@mapua.edu.ph",

(2021) study entitled Underlying conditions and risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among those with COVID-19 in Ireland: A national surveillance study. However, it is in the Philippines settings. The researchers assessed the medical condition by gathering the records of patients with the underlying disease to identify the risk of progression of COVID-19 symptoms. The study concentrated on the living patients that experienced symptoms from mild to severe residing in the National Capital Region without age limit. The survey determined the respondent’s demographics, underlying diseases, lifestyle, and symptoms. The researchers gathered a total of 212 individuals consisting of 87 females and 125 males. 25.00% of the respondents live in Quezon City which was the highest count in the survey. Most of the respondents are coming from the age group of 50 – 59 years old, blood type A, with a BMI of 18.5 – 25, and coming from the family with 23,381 – 46,760 and 46,761 - 81,831 income. It was found that demographics factors - age, blood type group, and gender have a significant difference between the mild and severe duration. For the lifestyle factors, vitamin intake, average hours of sleep, and vices have significant differences also between the mild and severe duration. For the symptoms, fever, dry cough, tiredness, aches & pain, sore throat, and headache have significant differences between the whole infected duration. And lastly, there is also a significant difference between Underlying disease, Comorbidities, and Severe Duration. Patients with Cancer, Chronic Kidney, and Diabetes comorbidities have the highest mean among all the underlying diseases and comorbidity. The results obtained explain that people who have Comorbidity of Cancer with Chronic Kidney Disease, and Type II Diabetes experience a longer duration of severe infection among all the Underlying disease and Comorbidity. It is concluded that there is a significant difference but low weak negative correlation between mild and severe duration which means that there are instances that a patient with mild symptoms has a longer number of days experiencing the infection and only experienced severe symptoms for a shorter duration or vice versa. The researchers established three separate regression analyses. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the most common significant factors with the most significant role in increasing the risk of acquiring the COVID-19 virus which is the smoker and non-smoker that became significant to all of the dependent variables. Disinfection of Gadget and Vitamin Intake resulted to be the significant factors for Mild and Severe Duration. Family Average Income and number of comorbidity resulted to be the significant factors for Severe and Whole Duration. The researchers created a risk assessment with the use of Kepner Tregoe (KT) Analysis to conclude certain evaluations and contingency plans to avoid the chances of being infected. The researchers advised practicing preventive actions such as staying at home, avoiding unnecessary travel, staying away from large groups of people or people with symptoms, and wearing personal protective equipment inside and outside the area. Awareness and reminder to people on how to disinfect properly, how to take care of themselves, and ways to boost their immune system. And if the person starts to experience the symptoms the contingency plan is to isolate themselves from the other people and seek immediate medical attention.

210,A Comparative Analysis Of Factors Influencing Consumer  Preference For E-Shopping And In-Store Shopping Using,"for decades, the philippines have been benefiting from brick-and-mortar shops but have altered dramatically after the covid-19 pandemic. as the globe transitions to a new normal, this study aims to determine the factors that influence e-shopping and online shopping. specifically, it investigates the buyers’ characteristics in relation to their shopping preferences by utilizing the structural equation modeling (sem) approach. a total of 277 filipinos answered the survey questionnaire, which contained 39 questions. the results of sem indicated that buyers’ characteristics have a mediating effect on influence factors – environment, which identified that customers’ features include status shoppers, brand conscious, and recreational shoppers. customers’ primary concern in online shopping is payment security and privacy, while others prefer to buy products online due to accessibility and convenience. some brand conscious customers consider physical contact with products in shopping. on the other hand, the result also showed that influence factors – product and influence factors – environment have no significant direct effect on customer shopping preference. but customers find that orders are easy to place, 24 hours accessibility and several payment options are advantages in an online shopping interface. in contrast, the ability to touch the product, immediate availability of the product, and sales assistance are the advantages of in-store shopping.","e-shopping, in-store shopping",,"structural equation modelling jamille c. riguerra and marvin i. noroña school of industrial engineering & engineering management mapúa university, intramuros, 1002, philippines jcriguerra@gmail.com, minorona@mapua.edu.ph",
211,Application Of A Multiple Carrier Cashless Payment System  For Public Transportation In Metro Manila: A New Normal,"public transportation provides a cost-effective commute for people to reach their destination. in the philippines, it is dominated by road vehicles such as jeepneys, taxicabs, asian utility vehicles, and tricycles, with most if not all, commuters go via multiple carriers for the daily routine. the highly contagious coronavirus has put the world on high alert when it comes to touching high contact public surfaces. when it comes to paying for public transport services by cash, contact is inevitably unavoidable. recent studies have concluded that the coronavirus can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 3 days depending on the conditions. interest would be on how drivers and passengers can be protected in the age of coronavirus and beyond. with the growing concern over the safety of drivers and commuters, it would be much advisable to use contactless payments to reduce the risk of transmission. with no obvious end to the outbreak in sight, the study delved on the feasibility of applying the cashless payment system for the multi-carrier commuting public. results provided a better understanding of the complexities, issues, requisites and benefits of a multi-carrier contactless payment system for public transportation and all its stakeholders.",,"In conclusion, the results on our objective show that there's an area of improvement with the effort of creating a contactless payment as shown on the service blueprint. With this approach, the application of the multi-carrier payment system in the new normal will significantly decrease the risk of the commuting public being infected by the covid-19 virus. As the researchers conducted surveys, it provides us a clear view that some people are willing to take the said app. With this type of payment system, passengers will have peace of mind when it comes to safety. The use of a contactless payment system via the mobile platform to book or have a ride will give more convenience to the commuting public especially in metro manila PUVs. The fast, ease, and reliability of transactions between the operator of PUVs and passengers will be flawless and worry-free this is also to be protected by each party on the uprising of the virus. This is also the next step to be the new normal on our local PUV system as we uncover new ways in the contactless payment system.","perspective richard jerome l. caya, fritz gerard b. hernandez, and marvin i. noroña school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university 658 muralla st, intramuros, manila, 1002 metro manila, philippines rjlcaya@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, fgbhernandez@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, and monorona@mapua.edu.ph",
212,Bread Returns Management In Commercial Plant  Bakeries: Case Study,"bread is part of the staple diet to many people around the world and commercial plant bakeries are amongst the key players in the bread market. amongst the key concerns of commercial plant bakeries is sustainability. this paper focuses on bread returns. bread returns and associated activities contribute to the costs of operating a commercial plant bakery and can impact on sustainability objectives or the lack thereof. through a case study of three selected commercial plant bakeries in south africa, this paper identifies the activities involved in the handling of returns as a means of exploring sustainable practices. the research methodology adopted in this paper uses literature review in combination with primary data collected from the selected commercial plant bakeries. the primary data is from interviews and questionnaire survey. findings indicate that participating bakeries considered bread returns very significant and material given the characteristics of the industry. they are of the view that bread returns including associated waste is a current concern. the bread returns process flow observed in this study, in relation to reverse logistics, bears some similarities with those previously identified for the swedish bread industry. key improvement areas were highlighted including take-back clause and agreement in the context of producer/suppler retailer interface, route-to-market (sales channels) contributions to total bread returns, handling and the disposal of bread waste arising from returns, and oversight role in bread returns management.","bread returns, plant bakeries, reverse logistics","In commercial plant bakeries, bread returns, and associated activities can substantially impact on the costs of operating a plant bakery and sustainability objectives. Through observations of case study commercial plant bakeries in South Africa, it can be concluded that commercial plant bakeries can run a well-coordinated supply chain system with reverse logistics activities that co-exist very well. Bread takebacks is the fundamental culprit contributing to returns and non-saleable returns can be significant. Returns in general are material to the success of operating a commercial plant bakery given the characteristics of the standard bread baking industry. Not all returns that is send for disposal as waste is ‘not’ fit for human consumption, in some cases it can be a matter of simply a squashed bread rendering it unappealing to the eye though absolutely fit for consumption. Bakeries should find innovative ways to improve and seek new ways that will lead to the reduction and possible elimination of returns through investment in research & development. While the focus of this paper is on South African plant bakeries, findings can be generalized to commercial plant bakeries internationally.

214,Reducing Manufacturing Barriers By Introducing A 5S  Hybrid Management System In Sa Industries,"the 5s method is a housekeeping method first practised by toyota to increase productivity and efficiency in the manufacturing systems. the tool instils discipline and cleanliness among staff at their workstations to maximize efficiency and reduce the 8 wastes. the study aims at establishing how efficient the suppliers of tsam and other industries in south africa are implementing 5s by focussing on the barriers that can be removed by implementing 5s and the other 2 new ss on other lean tools. a hybrid 5s tool superimposes the poka yoke, kanban, cleaner production, green technologies to remove barriers thereby improving productivity in manufacturing.","productivity, lean, waste, red tag","The study revealed that to boost productivity from your employees one needs to pay more attention to their needs and concerns. When employees feel more appreciated, they improve their performance. Companies that invest in their workers' happiness and well-being by providing employee support, and improved workplace conditions has bigger return on investment. 5S provides a working environment that is self-ordering, self-explaining, self- regulating, and self-improving. 5S saves space and speed up the process of getting and feeding materials, dies, fixtures and jigs, thus speeding the manufacturing process. 5S reduces and eliminates the 8 wastes in manufacturing and create more time. Today we have many industries that practice 5S and go further to recycle waste and manufacture new products from old tyres, plastics, metals, and wood chips. The environment at which these exist requires the application of 6S principles to save time in locating specific materials. The sixth S is safety which improve the order, cleanliness and create a safe working environment. The other S the 7th that is job security, which prevails without any resistance under the present pandemic. Every employee requires safety and security to be in the manufacturing floor otherwise working from home is the option. Under the pandemic 5S is a visual management system that has improved organization efficiency in manufacturing floor. Employee morale and company image is determined by the sixth and seventh S. The system is an ongoing process designed for continuous improvement for organization’s long-term success. The Non lean companies that are adopting 5S always find it difficult when they do not use the model and fail to set up champions for each S. The success of 5S to companies that are adopting the principle depend on the culture of the people, training provided, its implementation and above all the sustenance. 5S must be clearly defined by senior management among workers. To sustain 5S, set a habit to maintain and improve 5S so that every employee is involved in developing good working habits. The methods used are driven by executive managers and cascaded down to the staff. Visual checks, audits controls and displays on noticeboards, on company TVs in the cafeteria and online simulation refreshes the staff and act as a daily reminder. Recognition of the team’s good performance stimulates the need to understand its benefits by other teams.

216,"Selecting Interchange Scheme For Traffic Intersections, A  Combined Dematel And Network Analysis Methods","while selecting the most appropriate interchange type is a major concern that transport and traffic experts are dealing with, one of the essential questions that repeatedly appears on the table is how to select the best interchange based on the contributing criteria. in the present study, the influencing factors on selecting interchange type are extracted by delphi method followed by their clustering utilizing card sorting technique to the environment, safety, cost, executive constraint, regional, geometric characteristics, and traffic, and eventually applied the multi-criteria decision-making process of dematel to select the best interchange type. the well-known intersection of sanaat square in the iranian capital of tehran has been selected as a case study and the proposed procedure performed by receiving experts’ opinions. after validating the proposed procedure, the results revealed that land use, accident reduction rate, domestic interchange construction experience, noise pollution reduction, distance to adjacent interchange, and construction cost are the main factors that play significant roles in interchange type selection for interchange.","interchange type, card sorting","In this study the influencing factors for selecting the type of interchange that had been previously introduced by researchers in other studies explored by the Delphi method manipulating the experts’ opinions. The card sorting technique was then used to cluster the factors into main categories. The clustering procedure has also resulted to extract 31 factors out of 36 explored as the leading factors. The inter-relationships of factors have been analyzed by Dematel and the effect of inter-relationships known as super-matrix has been powered by six times to prioritize the aforementioned factors. Factors have been initially ranked and sent back to the experts for reconsideration. By combining the experts’ opinions on the degree of importance of each factor in each interchange type and considering them for the case study of Sanaat square in the Iranian capital city of Tehran, the results obtained and validated to reveal the most appropriate interchange for the case study is Single Point type and the procedure is also capable to perform for other intersections. Moreover, this study shows that the six factors with the most considerable influence on the selection of interchange type are respectively land use, crash reduction, the domestic experience of construction, noise pollution reduction, distance to adjacent interchange, and construction cost. While the present study focuses on the urban intersections, further research may lead to study rural intersections where the factors may be different from what has been ranked by experts’ opinions.

218,The Influence Of Fundamental Analysis On Stock Prices   (Case Study Of Unvr Stock In Idx Period 2015-2020),"this study was conducted to determine the fundamental factors that affect stock prices in pt unilever for the period 2015-2020. the factors analyzed in this study are price earning ratio (per), price to book value (pbv) and return on equity (roe) as the independent variable and the company's stock price as the dependent variable. this research method uses quantitative methods with the type of research is descriptive verification causal. the population in this study data from the financial statements of pt. unilever and the sample are as many as the financial statements of pt unilever listed on the idx per quarter 2015-2020, with the selection of samples using the purposive sampling technique. the data analysis technique used descriptive analysis and multiple regression analysis. based on the results of the research that partially price earning ratio (per) and return on equity (roe) have a negative and significant effect on the unilever company's stock price, while price to book value (pbv) has no effect on the pt unilever stock price and simultaneously price earning ratio (per), price to book value (pbv) and return on equity (roe) have an effect on pt unilever's stock price with a magnitude of 40.7% and the rest is influenced by other variables not examined in this study.","price earning ratio, return on equity","Based on the results of research and discussions that have been carried out regarding the effect of price earning ratio (PER), price to book value (PBV) and return on equity (ROE) on stock prices at Unilever Companies for the 2015-2020 period, the following conclusions are obtained: 1. The following is a description of the development of price earning ratio (PER), price to book value (PBV) and return on equity (ROE) to share prices at Unilever Companies for the 2015-2020 period. a. The development of price earning ratio (PER) on stock prices based on the results of the discussion obtained that the PER condition in Unilever companies shows that there is a level of increase and decrease in the PER value. This is caused by changes in the share price of a company if the company's shares manage to score a high enough value, this means that the market really appreciates the shares, which is marked by the large number of requests for these shares. The PER value of PT Unilever which is the sample of observations for 6 years tends to vary. When viewed from the trend of PER 2015-2020 from year to year tends to fluctuate, the period that has the highest percentage of Price Earning Ratio (PER) is in the 1st quarter of 2019 amounting to 213.96 in 2018, while the company that has the lowest PER is in the 4th quarter of 2018 of 38.00. b. The development of price to book value (PBV) on stock prices based on the results of the discussion obtained that the condition of PBV at Unilever companies shows that there is a level of increase and decrease in the value of PBV. This is because the PBV is strongly influenced by the book value of the stock, if the stock price is higher than the book value, the resulting PBV will be high, and vice versa if the stock price does not have a high enough price compared to the book value, the resulting PBV will be smaller than before. . The average price of PT Unilever's PBV in the 2015-2020 period is 55.65, meaning that this shows the stock market price of 55.65 times its book value. c. The development of return on equity (ROE) on stock prices is based on the results of the discussion obtained that the condition of PT Unilever's ROE value which is the sample of observations for 6 years tends to vary. When viewed from the 2015-2020 ROE trend from year to year, it tends to fluctuate, the overall average ROE in 2015- Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Rome, Italy, August 2-5, 2021","budi rustandi kartawinata business administration program faculty of communication and business telkom university jalan terusan buah batu, bandung 40257, indonesia budikartawinata@telkomuniversity.ac.id aldi akbar politeknik piksi ganesha bandung jalan jend. gatot subroto no. 301, bandung 40274, indonesia aldi.akbar@piksi.ac.id ghazi abiyu winata business administration program faculty of communication and business telkom university jalan terusan buah batu, bandung 40257, indonesia ghazi.winata@gmail.com r. susanto hendiarto universitas widyatama jl. cikutra no 204 a bandung 40124, indonesia r.susanto@widyatama.ac.id","References

219,Ergonomic Design Of Computer Workstation For Elementary  Students Studying At Home,"the purpose of this study is to understand factors that affect discomfort among elementary students studying at home and construct an ideal computer workstation using the anthropometric measurements gathered from the target respondents. a computer workstation is composed of a chair and a table and is used as a computer terminal for students when attending classes at the comfort of their home. having a workstation at home is essential for workers and students for work or academic purposes. however, users of computer workstations are commonly affected by musculoskeletal disorders (msd). in this study, the body discomfort of the subjects is measured through an instrument named corlett’s & bishop's body map questionnaire. the study was conducted requiring information on the profile of the respondents regarding the use of their workstations at home as well as their anthropometric measurements. the statistical analysis used in the study is anova, correlation analysis, and regression analysis. these were used to determine the different types of msd experienced by respondents on the use of different types of tables and chair and other factors related to their online class at home. based on the result of the analysis, it was proved that poor sitting posture can significantly affect the discomfort of respondents on their body parts such as lower arm, mid-back, buttocks, lower back, neck, and upper arm. it was also revealed that workstation design factors significantly affect the discomfort of respondents particularly the table height, table width, and seat height. given these conditions, the researchers proposed an ideal workstation design for elementary students using the anthropometric measurements gathered from the respondents.","workstation, anthropometry, discomfort, corlett’s & bishop","The researchers discovered that elementary students nowadays are utilizing office chairs, Monoblock chairs, wooden chairs, metal chairs, and stools as their seats based on the findings of the study. They are employing glass tables, wooden tables, and metal tables for tables. Age, gender, duration of study, site or area of study, frequency of study, kind of table, and kind of chair are all risk variables that might contribute to MSD in elementary students. Using their existing workstation, elementary students noticed high discomfort in their lower arm and mild discomfort in their right thigh when studying. The researchers have also identified that study hours have significant differences between the study and the type of chairs have significant differences that can affect the discomfort level in their current study station or workstation. The factors that have a considerable influence and contribute to the pain of Elementary Students include sitting posture, table width, and seat height. Finally, using anthropometric data, the researchers created an ergonomic workstation that matched the body dimensions of the elementary students, and the office chair is the best sort of chair to use in study stations.

220,Effects Of The Physical Work Environments To The Reaction Time  Of Students,"physical environments like noise, temperature, and illumination are frequently associated with students’ participation and academic performance. this study aimed to identify the effects of the physical learning environment on the learnability and engagement of students during online classes. a total of 30 grade 12 students from mapúa university, during the academic year 2020–2021 were chosen as the correspondents. survey questionnaires were provided to collect information from the respondents' demographic profiles as well as measures for the sources of the work environment such as the source of light, noise, and temperature. furthermore, the student's reaction time was measured using the stroop test experiment through coglab: the online cognition lab software, while the assessment of their physical learning environment was obtained using mobile applications. from the data gathered, the correlational analysis was used to evaluate the relationship of the independent variable (physical environment levels) to the dependent variable (reaction time). subsequently, multiple regression analysis was used to determine the significant factor affecting the reaction time of students. results showed from the correlation analysis that illumination and noise level have significant relationships to the reaction time of students, having p-value <0.0001 and pearson correlation of -0.902 and 0.865 respectively. moreover, it was found that illumination level was the only factor that significantly affects the reaction time the most (p-value<0.001). 1. introduction in 2014, asiyai stated that a classroom’s physical environment condition significantly affects the students' motivation to engage in classroom activities. it can influence students’ behavior, attendance, health, enjoyment, and learning (asiyai, 2014; che ahmad & amirul, 2019). cantrell (2019) also added that teachers should create a positive physical learning environment to make students feel emotionally and physically comfortable learning in the classroom. otherwise, a poor, substandard classroom physical environment is just as detrimental to the students' learning as a bad curriculum (hannah, 2013). physical environments like noise, temperature, and illumination are frequently associated with the student's participation and academic performance. the learnability of students is physiologically and psychologically affected by these factors. according to barth et al. (2014), poor workplaces were correlated with substandard ranges of students' aggression and academic focus. edem et al. (2017) added that students and employees' productivity decreased because of poorly planned environmental workplaces as it resulted in no motivation and no work satisfaction. in the study of gilavand (2016), noise pollution, inappropriate lighting, and temperature played a vital role in students' education quality. ergonomically speaking, the design of learning environments is necessary to optimize human interaction with peers and improve academic and work resilience. students are also seen to perform well in a lively workplace atmosphere where they feel safe, secure, and involved (suleman & hussain, 2014). there has been a significant number of studies that aim to identify the effects of physical environments, such as illumination, noise, and temperature, on a student’s academic performance. however, those particular studies did not satisfy proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management rome, italy, august 2-5, 2021 © ieom society international 2083",,"The study identified the relationship of noise, illumination, and temperature level to the learnability of students, assess their physical working environment and determine the factor that significantly affects students' reaction time. The only factor that significantly affected the reaction time of students was the illumination level, having a p-value less than 0.05. Additionally, a significant difference was found in the reaction time of students based on time of day. The reaction time of students' studying at night was also relatively higher than those students studying in the morning, afternoon, and midnight. The analysis showed that as the level of illumination decreases, the reaction time of the student's increases. In light of this, the relationship of illumination level to the academic performance of students was strongly negatively correlated, having a Pearson value of - 0.902. While the noise level increases, the reaction time of students increases as well, having a strong positive correlation with a Pearson value of 0.865. Although illumination and noise level were the only ones having a significant relationship with the reaction time, based on the ANOVA test, the temperature level has an effect on the students' reaction time based on the time of day with a p-value less than 0.05.

233,Smart Actuators: A Review,"robotic systems are a combination of actuators and control systems for manipulating a tool or end effector along a specified path. different types of actuators exist for different applications like bio mimicking, rehabilitation and prosthesis, and are classified based on their principle of actuation. these actuators include serial elastic actuators, shape memory alloys (sma), dielectric elastomer actuator (dea), fluidic actuation etc. various robotic systems have been developed with different actuators. sea are conventional electric actuators are coupled with flexible elements. the main purpose is the introduction of compliance. smart materials like sma, soft actuators like dea and flexible elastomer actuators using fluidic actuation principles, pertaining to their actuation principles, can be used for biomimicking applications and their compliance nature due to their flexibility results in better shock absorbing and energy recovery capabilities. this paper presents a comprehensive literature survey relating to various actuators and their applications. a brief review of use of emg and eeg as control systems is also presented in this article. mathematical formulations have also been summarized in this article.","shape memory alloy, soft actuators, italy",,"n.v.s. shankar department of mechanical engineering, vignan’s institute of information technology visakhapatnam, ap, 530046, india shankar.publications@gmail.com taranikanth kamma department of mechanical engineering, vignan’s institute of information technology visakhapatnam, ap, 530046, india taranikanth19866@gmail.com b mahesh krishna department of mechanical engineering, swarnandhra college of engineering and technology, seetharampuram ap, 534275, india b.maheshkrishna@gmail.com ch harish kumar department of mechanical engineering, swarnandhra college of engineering and technology, seetharampuram ap, 534275, india harishkumarchitti@gmail.com burra shalem department of mechanical engineering, dnr college of engineering and technology, bhimavaram, ap, 534202, india shalemburra303@gmail.com",
234,Analysis Of Critical Success Factors Of Gemba Kaizen In  Lean Manufacturing Within Sa Industries,"gemba kaizen is used successfully by manufacturing organizations that supply toyota south africa (tsam) with finished auto part. the paper seeks to establish how tsam and its suppliers have used this kaizen tool. the principle has been used in four stages namely going to gemba where the manager physically goes to the production line floor. at the manufacturing floor the manager checks the whole process (machines, materials, tools, rejects), in order to identify for muda and rejects. when the waste is identified, a temporary measure to stop the waste is quickly devised and installed to allow production to continue whilst a team of engineers is analysing ways of removing the root cause. when the solution is obtained they implement it and standardize the process establishing standard operating procedures (sops). gemba reduces the lead-time, rejects, and muda in the production line whilst improving quality. key words mura, muri, muda, rejects, lead time. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management rome, italy, august 2-5, 2021 © ieom society international 2250",,"The Gemba Kaizen improvements reduce the effort, shorten the process time, improve quality, reduce material input and above all bring job satisfaction to employees. TSAM and its suppliers have been so successful in LM because its employees are satisfied and interested in improving their performance and effectiveness. Job satisfaction help retain employees at one company but may migrate from one sister company to another for better rewards, upgrading and recognition. Learning experiences in the Gemba are based on appreciation of fundamental human values, such a respect for humanity, commitment, determination, economy (sensible use of resources), cleanliness, and order. The best learning experience you can get is the one you gain through practicing, using your body, and learning by doing. Look, see, think and act hence implementing Gemba walk to see the anomaly, find and eliminate the root cause. A Gemba walk is not an opportunity to find fault in others or a time to enforce policy adherence except for safety problems or gross violations. It requires a mutual respect and interest approach to workers and their tasks. If ideas or complaints arise, note them and make a follow up after the walk but do not quickly focus on the details before seeing the whole production line. If the walk is punitive, employees may close doors and resist any change. Gemba walk is not used solve problems and make changes immediately, but to observe, get inputs and reflect? The study noticed that employees who leave TSAM go to its supplier as champions of Gemba or other Kaizens. A two-way migration of experienced personnel from the suppliers to TSAM and vice versa is prevalent. The migration happens mainly for promotion to fill senior management posts. TSAM and its suppliers does not dismiss employees but places the employee where he is best in the production line. Gemba Kaizen is driven by Teamwork and cross-functional teams, quality planning and control, employee awareness and training- team autonomy, productivity improvement, management support, goal difficulty, work area routineness, goal clarity, affective commitment to change, internal processes, team Gemba Kaizen experience, action orientation, functional heterogeneity and team leader experience. All these are the drivers of productivity improvement through Gemba Kaizen.

235,Design And Development Of A Dual Chambered Interactive  Juice Packaging For Children,"juice packaging design as a marketing strategy to children is becoming highly sophisticated, increasingly well- funded, and takes place within the environment of other kinds of child-targeted marketing. the joint decision- making process by both parents and children who are the consumers of these products are often influenced by nutritional concerns and price sensitivity for parents while children aim to fulfill spontaneous desires resulting from factors such as visual elements, package image, cartoon characters, colors etc. even with varieties of innovative juice packaging plaguing our markets today, issues such as little or no user experience, indecisive nature of kids picking just one flavor, and poor shelf life of packaging materials where tiny bit of oxygen penetration results in mold growth and unsustainability are yet to be fully addressed. this paper proposes a juice packaging design solution that adopts polyethylene furanoate material for prolonged shelf life and reduced carbon footprint selected through relative performance index of key features, a dual chambered body design to accommodate both lead and fringe users indecisive nature, a pressure induced closing diaphragm beneath the bottle cap and an interactive labeling for improved user experience in an environmentally responsible way still relatively cheaper compared to current market competitions.","packaging design, dual chamber, user experience, packaging material","The aim of this research has been designing and developing a user centric interactive low cost and environmentally friendly juice packaging for children. The dual chambered bottle body made from PEF prolongs shelf life, 4.2 Vol. CO2 Shelf life to -17.5% (wks), reduces carbon footprint as it is fully recyclable being 100% biobased. Dual chambered also implies that juice producers can now have different kinds of flavors all fitted in one container which helps solve the problem of indecisive nature of kids as to which flavor to forgo as they can now have both choices. The adoption of cartoon character figures in the design of the bottle cap with a pressure induced diaphragm drives home the interactivity between product and target end users which we hoped to achieve.","chukwumaobi ndukwe ibe, efthimia pantzartzis, giovanni pappalettera and paolo ferrari department of civil engineering and architecture sciences politecnico di bari bari,70125, italy c.ibe@studenti.poliba.it, efthimia.pantzartzis@poliba.it, giovanni.pappalettera@poliba.it, paolo.ferrari@poliba.it",

237,The Effect Of Esg Rating On Credit Rating,"this research aims to evaluates the relationship between environment, social and governance (esg) rating and firm credit rating. the study focuses on listed companies in indonesia and tries to examine the relationship using ordered probit regression model to reach conclusion of this study. the findings show from three pillars of esg, only environment and governance significantly affect firm credit rating. specifically, firm credit ratings are negatively associated with environment pillar and positively related with governance pillar. this research also documents that individual categories of each esg pillar possess different significance and effect. this research results show that resource use, emission, human rights, management, and shareholders significantly affect firm credit rating. however, only emission and management possess positive effect. the overall research shows esg rating as a non-financial information plays a huge role in creditworthiness assessment.",sustainability,"This research is intended to analyse the relationship between ESG rating and firm credit rating of Indonesian firms. Companies with lower ESG should pay a higher cost of capital since corporations who violate ESG comes with substantial fines and long term financial effect, the probability of default is higher for those firms with ESG violation with long term impact and financial loss on their financial performance. Researcher tested this argument using ESG rating of individual pillars and firm credit rating data over the period of 2015 –2019 using ordered probit regression model. Our research shows that environmental pillar negatively affecting firm credit rating and firms with higher environmental score tends to have lower credit rating, social pillar possesses positive effect on firm credit rating but is insignificant, which later will be eliminated due to the insignificance effect. Lastly governance pillar possesses a significant and positive effect on firm credit rating. Aside from these results, researcher finds not all individual ESG categories are significant and relevant to firm’s credit rating.

238,The Impact In Using Influencers For A Non-Profit  Organizations’ Campaign (Which Results In Donations),"the purpose of the research is aimed to fill that gap whilst also furthering the knowledge and understanding as a whole within the context of using influencers for a non-profit organizations’ campaign. the focus on influencers’ usage would also help raise the number of donations (in any currency) for every new, growing or even bigger npos in these competitive eras. overall, this research is mainly focused on the npos' perspective towards how influencers become a tool that leverage marketing communication campaigns to achieve npos’ sales and the impacts that influencers can bring to an npos marketing campaign. to attain the objectives of this exploratory research, a qualitative approach by interview will be implemented. this will be done by collecting data through a semi-structured interview with npos to identify themes and explain patterns. the researcher has determined the key informants, which are a person from a marketing team from npos, people who work and or involved in an npo and or handles the building of the npo and marketing or marketing communication division in indonesia. the npos are moving in the sector of education, children, poverty, social/public health, environment and environmental sustainability. the study findings help small and growing npos to obtain a maximum result in their sales which is their donations and for them to be able to adjust the current marketing communications conditions in the society to invent trust and understanding for donors. this correlated with helping the country (indonesia’s) betterment in social problems.",digital influencers,"A non-profit organization has been playing a vital role for a country, especially in Indonesia, with numerous cases of social problems, from hunger, needs of education, environmental issues until health, and with the existence of an NPO has helped the government to at least solve the unsolved problem in the society. Non-profits are typically organised around a social mission and provide donations for a problem they will solve (Quarter and Richmond, 2001) and in this context, Acar et al. (2001) discovered that non-profit organisations prioritise their social obligations considerably more than for-profit organisations. Then in those conditions, many people admit knowing little or nothing about how charitable organisations are organised and operated, according to surveys (Ipsos MORI Social Research Institute, 2008). With that, building what is called awareness before leading to numerous donations is proven very important. From the result of data analysis, the roles of influencers and people with social power have shown their effective result in gaining exposure, campaign’s virality, driving it into a trend and turning it into numerous engagement and awareness. This indicated that society should be provided by the feeling of trust before donating and the feeling of understanding and or emphatize the problem that will be solved. Especially in this digital era, it is also important to have an online existence in order to spread the information and communication fast and provide E- Words of Mouth. Combined with the matched link of previous research about a successful campaign and what happened in the field when finding donors, made it stronger that the usage of influencers and people with social power has given a positive impact to the number of donations.","alya salmaa putri gunawan school of business and management bandung institute of technology bandung, indonesia alya_salmaa@sbm-itb.ac.id",

From the proven by the testing of weight loss of apples within 20 days according to the data obtained, the uncovered apples (control) was 4.38% weight reduction, apples covered with edible films of catfish gelatin + turmeric extract 0% was 2.11% of reduction, apples packed with a mixture of edible films of catfish gelatin + turmeric extract 5% was1.44% d, and apples packed with a mixture of edible film gelatin + turmeric extract 10% was 1.18%. There was one thing that needs to be noticed that the addition of 10% turmeric causes more thick films so if applied commercially it would not be effective because the sheet was not flexible, even though it was able to withstand the Escherichia coli bacteria better than others. The darker yellow color appearance of the films with the 10 % turmeric seems to need to be modified to be appeared brighter while still in good inhibition against bacteria. The thick and stiff of existing films were necessary to be added a food-safe plasticizer.","based films for escherichia coli flora elvistia firdaus*, alvira liviani, firelda putri ambaratri department of chemical engineering, jayabaya university, jl pulomas selatan kav 23 jakarta – 13210 indonesia flora_elvistia@yahoo.com, alvira.liviani1998@gmail.com,fireldaputriambaratri@gmail.com",
242,Interest In Stem In Bay Area High School Students,"previous studies show underrepresentation of minorities in stem, but this project concentrates on comparing stem interest between different demographic groups of high schoolers in the san francisco bay area. google forms was used to distribute this survey, which asked participants to rate their interest in stem from one through five and select which stem subjects, or none, they were interested in. to analyze the results, the kruskal-wallis and the mann-whitney u tests were used to compare general and career interest in stem due to ordinal data and a slight negative skew, and the chi-square goodness of fit test was used to assess whether or not groups were underrepresented or overrepresented in their interest in a specific field of stem, such as science or engineering. after obtaining the results of these tests, it was discovered that the demographic category of gender differed in both interest in the overall stem field and in specific subjects, while the demographic category of race differed only in interest in the overall stem field.","stem, high school, gender, race","Even though Bay Area high school students display an interest in STEM, this project has found that there are still differences in interest in STEM between minorities. In general interest for the overall STEM field, tests found that demographic categories in gender exhibited a statistically significant difference, namely men and genderqueer students. However, when testing for career interest, race and gender were both found to have statistically significant differences among their respective categories. In race, Asian and White people had a higher interest than Black people, and Asians had a higher interest than White people. When examining the distribution of responses for specific subjects, for both general and career interest, only gender had a statistically significant result. For general interest, the chi-square goodness of fit test returned a statistically significant result for technology and engineering. For career interest, the test resulted in statistically significant results for technology and math. Women and Gender Non-Conforming people are still falling behind in interest compared to men. What was also interesting to note was the lack of statistical significance in other categories, such as between women and men in both general and career interest in STEM, specific subject interest for race, all types of interest for economic stress, and the lack of statistical significance for the category of science. Therefore, even though there are still inequalities in interest in STEM present in Bay Area high school students, demographic groups that had statistically significant relationships in previous studies were not statistically significant in this study. The lack of statistical significance could indicate that previously underrepresented demographic groups did not have differences in interest from demographic groups that are overrepresented, which may lead to a more proportional distribution of workers from all demographic categories. Through this study, demographic areas that need more resources have been identified, and initiatives can be implemented in areas with high concentrations of these demographic groups to boost interest in STEM. 5. Future Research Future investigations could include looking into a specific demographic, such as race or gender, and probing into more of the factors that result in the statistically significant differences among demographics such as race and gender, such as previous exposure to STEM or family members in STEM. Also, because two forms were used to separate the data into Bay Area independent schools and other schools outside of that organization, further research can be conducted using only the data gathered from one specific survey. Another idea for further investigation is the redistribution of this survey after a certain period of time to determine whether or not the proportion of interest according to demographic categories has changed over time. Further statistical analysis could be run comparing the two times. If this project is performed again, more time would be allotted for data collection and analysis. The priority for data collection would be obtaining a more representative sample, especially since some categories in demographics, such as American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander in race had to be removed due to no responses in those groups. Also, some groups received little responses compared to other groups. One notable example is the category of Economically Distressed, which received only seventeen responses, compared to Economically Comfortable, which received 113 responses. More diversity could be achieved by reaching out to people in groups who originally did not have many, or any, responses. Additionally, the data for general and career interest in STEM as a whole was negatively skewed, and a larger and more representative sample could make the distribution less skewed.

243,Customer Segmentation Based On Fuzzy C-Means And  Weighted Interval-Valued Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Sets,"marketing strategies have been one of the top considerations in commercial companies due to the effect on business sales lead to the revenue. in order to build an effective marketing strategy, companies need understand of customer’s preferences and needs. with the digital marketing, many companies are able to have customers around the world. managing and analyzing the customer data in large scale and transform it to useful information is necessary for supporting to business under uncertain environment. this study aims to provide a new two-phase framework for segmenting customers based on the rfm model. phase 1 implements fuzzy c mean clustering algorithms to segment the customers. phase 2 focuses on ranking customer segment using weighted interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy sets which allow to integrated opinions of groups decision makers even different knowledge and points of view when giving judgments. a numerical example in e-commerce is provided to illustrate the proposed method for solving practical problems. the results obtained from the model can be used to develop object-oriented marketing strategies or to develop customer relationship management campaigns.",rfm model,"Segmenting customer and identifying target customers are a complex procedure because integrating opinions of group rather than that of individual. Inviting experts in various fields to give their judgements in the same object. However, experts may give no judgment or show degree of certain or uncertain in their judgments. Additionally, the judgments of the key person are considered more impact than that of others. These factors are ignored in the existing studies. The study proposes the two-phased framework for segment and ranking segment customers based on RFM model by using the Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm and weighted interval-valued dual hesitant fuzzy numbers. Highlights of this study are to allow to aggregate degree of certain and uncertain of decision makers when giving the judgemnts. The role of each expert is expressed under the weights. Higher weight shows the more important role. The final result shows that the framework is effective for segmenting and ranking group of customer with the same priority for R, F, M, various fields and different weights of experts. This method still works if these priorities of R, F, M are changed based on type of business or suggestions of experts.

244,On The Effect Of Layer Thickness And Cutting Orientation Of  Laser Powder Bed Fused Ti6Al4V Parts During Wire,"machining additively manufactured parts to improve surface finish is, sometimes, a challenging process because different manufacturing orientations and process parameters result in different machined surfaces. extensive research has been devoted to additive manufacturing (am) technologies and their abilities to produce end-use parts. however, post processing such as machining is still required for many applications. in this paper, non-traditional machining, wire electric discharge machining (wedm), is used to study the result of wedm on the surface roughness and machining time when the layer thickness and cutting orientation are changed. in this study, three layers’ thicknesses (lt = 60, 80, 100 μm) and three orientations of cut are considered; wire cuts in a perpendicular plane to a layer (ori- 1), wire cuts in a parallel plane to a layer (ori-2), and wire cuts all layers at the same time (ori-3). surface profilometry, scanning electron microscope (sem), and machining time are used to evaluate the machining performance. the results show that the variation of the machining time for all layer thicknesses on ori-1 and ori-2 was minimal, except for ori-3. similarly, better surface quality could be achieved when the wedm cuts along the ori-2, whereas the variation of surface roughness (sa) increases for the ori-3. lt is also found to affect machining performance. for instance, when lt = 100 μm is employed, the roughness variation among different orientations increases up to 22.36%. on the other hand, roughness variation among different orientations reduced to 2.42% and 10.7% for lt of 60 μm and 80 μm, respectively. overall, it was found that the wedm along the ori-2 yields improved surface roughness for any layer thickness. similarly, the sem results also show that improved surface morphology with less redeposited material could be achieved when the parts are machined along the ori-2 as compared to ori-1 and ori-3.",,"Ti6Al4V powder bed fused samples were built with three different layer thicknesses and then machined using the WEDM process in three different orientations to studying the effect of the WEDM on surface roughness. The performance of the WEDM process on the L-PBF fabricated Ti6Al4V samples’ surfaces was accessed by using the 3D scanned surface contours and scanning electron microscopy. Based on the results, the conclusions can be drawn as follows: Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Rome, Italy, August 2-5, 2021","electric discharge machining abdullah y. alfaify industrial engineering department, college of engineering, king saud university p.o. box 800, riyadh 11421, saudi arabia aalfaify@ksu.edu.sa","References

247,A Stochastic Optimization Algorithm For Joint Inventory  And Fulfillment In An  Omnichannel Supply Network,"we study an inventory optimization problem for a retailer that faces stochastic online and in-store demand in a selling season of fixed length. the retailer has to decide the order-up-to inventory levels and an order fulfillment policy that optimizes the expected total costs. we propose a technique that combines the framework of turing-good sampling and stochastic optimization. our algorithm obtains an average of 6.2% total cost reduction compared to a state-of- the-art algorithm. the cost decrease is obtained by reserving more inventory, thereby reducing the lost sales costs and reducing fulfillment costs. the algorithm we propose is especially beneficial for shorter time horizons and higher in- store demand.",inventory,"This paper proposed a new technique to optimize initial inventory for an omnichannel retailer facing stochastic demand in a selling season of fixed length. We used the Turing-Good estimator to sample demand scenarios, which are then clustered based on a similarity measure. We approximate the optimal solution by solving a two-stage stochastic optimization problem on a reduced set of scenarios via the L-shaped method. Compared to (Govindarajan et al. 2020), our experiments obtain an average total cost reduction of 6.2%, with a maximum of 28.6%. In general, this cost decrease is due to higher levels of the on-hand inventory and lower lost sales costs. Higher inventories at stores also result in lower fulfillment costs, as they facilitate transportation from closer locations. Our algorithm outperforms (Govindarajan et al. 2020), especially for shorter time periods and a relatively high proportion of in-store demand.

249,Simulation And Game-Based Lean Training,"a popular form of participatory active training methods in the education of professionals and executives are simulations and game-based teaching methods. these approaches are ideal to teach lean management, focusing on knowledge transfer rather than studying plane theory. the application of lean management is much focused on practice, but not memory. still a critical assessment of existing simulation and game-based lean training methods in this field has been lacking. limited information is available on simulation and game-based lean training of executive and professionals. thus, a web-based search was conducted using a set of key words and logical relations among them and constraints on them. a total of 49 different simulations and games were identified and classified according to their emphasis on standalone lean tools or the overall lean philosophy, the area of application, the manifestation, number of iterations and the consideration of soft-skills. the majority lacks a stress on soft-skills and concentrate on single tools to be used in production. the number of findings concentrating on an application in offices resp. administration is dwindling. only few are designed for online usage and most are fairly abstract, which requires the participants to be familiar with abstraction and the aspects of lean tools. authentic and realistic simulators and games are missing in professional and executive education. future directions for the improvement of lean simulation design are proposed.","lean management, szedlak","The main conclusion of the evaluation summarizes as follows: - The analysis of 49 simulations and games from vendors of professional and executive training showed that the majority has a production line focus. Lean administration is usually neglected or it is recommended to book the same simulation or games, since the learning outcome can be transferred. Therefore participants are usually confronted with a high degree of abstraction or an unfamiliar situation that makes it hard to see behind the concept, e.g. focusing on physiomotric skills instead. Thus, more realistic simulations of office environments to teach lean administration are needed. - The majority of games and simulation focus on an awareness training. This means participants are trained to apply the theory and discussed tools in an unique and simplified situation, learning how to apply lean tool in a single set of conditions. We argue that simulations and games should present real life problems, which also includes stress or uncertainty. Learning must happen at an application level, enabling participants to put their know how to practice under various conditions. Also more attention must be paid to teaching soft skills and the understanding of different roles. - Almost all existing simulations and games concentrate on a single pass approach demonstrating the transformation of a current to a desired state. The design is set up to reach the ideal situation within a single run. This conveys the wrong image and raises unrealistic expectations. We argue that simulations must be a preview of the real world to experience incremental change in lean transformations, also allowing participants to discuss and reflect on the humans role and behavior during the problem solving. - Digital or virtual versions are not existing. Spatially distributed teams pose a particular challenge, both in terms of application and as an object of simulation. Not to be neglected is the role of the moderator, who, as an experienced lean expert, has to slip into the role of thefacilitator. However, results only included games and simulations that provided detailed information to be analysed. Many vendors offer different variants or versions of the reviewed games and simulations, that might address learning outcomes differently. In particular, information on digital versions was only sporadic.

251,"Malicious Url Classification Using Extracted Features,  Feature Selection Algorithm, And Machine Learning","websites have different purposes. some of which intend legitimate functions in the economy while some of which intend harmful cases towards users. although various research has been made to address this problem, these detection systems still leave plenty of room for improvement, specifically on its performances. this study was based on the recommended approach for future work by a related work wherein it contains 10 base features of a url for its classification. the recommended approach states that an extended number of features from the base features increases the detection accuracy. in this paper, it proposes a comparison between the performance of three cases: the base 10 features, an extended feature set, and a set where a feature selection algorithm is applied. the researchers utilized machine learning algorithms to build models in classifying legitimate and malicious urls. the study showed that there is a directly proportional relationship with a model’s number of features and a model’s performance. extending the number of features of the data set leads to an increase with the performance of each model.","url classification, machine learning","By the end of the study, the researchers were able to apply the recommended approach from Cuzzocrea et al. (2018) for malicious URL detection using machine learning techniques. Features were added from the related works of Aung and Yamana (2019), Al-Janabi et al. (2017), and Chapla et al. (2019). Feature selection algorithm method was applied to determine which are the relevant features in obtaining the performance of the model. As recommended by Cuzzocrea et al. (2018), extending the features influenced the performance of the model. In the study, each of the models had an increase in performance. This is because with several features included, it considers numerous combinations of those features to yield the optimal classifier for the model (Chatterjee and Namin 2019). Feature selection method was used on the extended features using Gain Ratio Algorithm. In the study, each of the models had a decrease in performance but also a significant increase in performance as compared to the base features. The average best performance in the variations of selecting the top number of features in the Gain Ratio algorithm is the top 75% of the features. However, the Extended Feature Set still had a better performance than the Feature Selection Set. Overall, the machine learning algorithm that produced the best model in malicious URL detection is Random Forest in the Extended Features Set which achieved an accuracy, precision, and recall of 99.552%, 99.553%, and 99.552%, respectively. Compared to the result of the work of Cuzzocrea et al. (2018), their model using J48 yielded 92.3% in precision and 91.6% in recall. As for the related work with regards to Gain Ratio feature selection algorithm in the study of Aydin et al. (2020), with the best accuracy of 97.18% using J48. From these, this study resulted in better performance in accuracy, precision, and recall.","techniques jo simon ambata, jose gaurana, dan jacinto, and joel de goma school of information technology department, computer science mapúa university makati, philippines ambata.josimon@gmail.com, gauranajose@gmail.com, jacinto.dnj@gmail.com, jcdegoma@mapua.edu.ph",

254,Applying Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms To  Predict Professional Career Development Preferences,"this research is focused on the development and comparison of models based on ensemble machine learning algorithms to predict professional career development preferences among students five years after their graduation using the results of the university entrepreneurial spirit students’ survey 2018. the research is carried out following a classic 4-stage methodology (analysis, design, development, and validation). during the analysis, surveys are thoroughly reviewed and preprocessed. during the design, questions are grouped and combined to build 11 predictive models. construction and validation are carried out entirely using the software weka. for the purposes of this investigation 1.121 surveys are considered. initially the dataset is split up in a subset for training and test (80%) and a subset for validation (20%). the approach to predict students’ mid-term career preferences comprised the use of an ensemble scheme (stacking) composed by a logistic regression as meta-model, and a decision tree, and a support vector machine as base models. experimental results show that half the proposed models predict correctly around 77% of the surveys. in conclusion, ensemble models can be used to predict students’ professional career development preferences. however, predictions’ accuracy depends on the attribute selection.","machine learning, predictive model, cross-validation","The answers to GUESSS 2018 survey provide valuable information about students’ career development preferences that can be used adapt lectures and contents to help students develop the skills needed either to start their business or to facilitate their access and adaptation to companies. When working with machine learning schemes, either single or ensemble algorithms, it is preferable to apply a cross-validation (k=10) scheme to get rid of the influence of partitioning randomness instead of simply holding out a portion of data. Averaging ten (k=10) results will be always better than having only one number. Furthermore, running replications help reduce the bias caused by the fold partitioning. Having a validation dataset is an important part of the investigation, it helps determine whether the models can generalize properly or not. The results show that half of the models proposed in the research (M0, M1, M3, M4, and M9) can predict correctly around 77% of the surveys in the training and test dataset, and in the validation dataset too. Even though, prediction ratios are similar there are significant differences in the number of attributes of each model. Finally, prediction ratios and confusion matrices suggest that the proposed classification models based on ensemble schemes do help predict mid-term professional career development preferences among university students using objective criteria based on multiple attributes.

259,Developing Conceptual Leadership Model For Project  Management In Uae Using Structural Equation Modelling,"project management highly requires effective leadership in managing resources and people in high complexity projects. despite extensive studies in the areas of project management and studies of leadership, the extent to which leadership influences project success has not been fully explored nor have the styles of effective leadership in project environments. failure in managing projects is determined as the main challenge due to ineffective leadership in uae. therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a leadership model for effective project management. the research adopted a quantitative research approach along the research process. the study was carried out within uae abu dhabi national oil and gas company (adnoc). the results for this study were based on questionnaires distributed to the 417 respondents which are employees in the project management department in adnoc. the results for this study were based on questionnaires distributed to the 417 respondents which are employees in the project management department in adnoc. the data have been gathered were then analyzed using analysis of moment structures (amos) in structural equation modelling (sem). the results show that competency leadership, servant leadership, behavioral leadership has a significant impact on the success of project management, while situational leadership was found not significant in this study. thus, the results from this study are benefitted the top management of adnoc, to helps them in deciding on project management in an organization.","leadership, project management","A new model of a leadership model for effective project management in the public organization was to propose a framework for an effective privilege approach thereby provided significant insight into how to improve the environment of work to achieve the organization objectives. The findings of this research contribute to the UAE government. With this new model, it is believed that the government can improve the employee productivity and performance of public organizations. SEM models provide a guide for a better understanding of these facilities and their interactive behavior. The study contributed to explore how a successful project manager must exercise a wide range of critical leadership characteristics and management styles to effectively succeed in project management. Most significantly, within the framework of the statistics, the model developed of this research drawn from existing theories satisfy all the conditions with the desired level of personalization in the data. This confirms the contributions in all respects. Conducting this study is therefore expected to be significant to various stakeholders in the organizations.

260,Comparing The Accuracy Of Prediction Models Based On  Ensemble Machine Learning Schemes,"this research analyzes the influence of the configuration of ensemble learning algorithms’ accuracy when predicting the annual production of honey for export in the south of chile. the research is carried out following a classic 4-stage methodology (analysis, design, development, and validation). during the analysis, data is gathered and preprocessed. during the design, independent variables, ensemble algorithms, and performance metrics (correlation coefficient, mae and rmse) are defined. construction and validation are carried out using the software weka. to build the models, 9 variables are considered. the dataset is split up in a subset for training and test (80%) and another one for validation (20%). the predictions are obtained by means of configuring a stacking scheme as ensemble and interchanging a support vector machine, a linear regression, a decision tree, and a gaussian process as meta or base learners. according to the results, while the correlation coefficient between predictions and actual values fluctuates significantly in the range of 18% to 46%, mae does it between 32% and 37%. in conclusion, although being inaccurate, results suggests that the arrangement of the meta and base algorithms within the ensemble does affect the prediction accuracy.","predictive model, machine learning, stacking","Since the performance of predictive models based on machine learning algorithms is the result of a learning process, supervised in this case, having a complete and large enough dataset is important. Small datasets, like the one studied in this work, might lead to an incomplete learning process and consequently to inaccurate predictions. Even though, ensemble schemes are rather complex, the results are not much better than those produced by single algorithms. This is a good example that not always an ensemble can overcome the lack of an adequate dataset. Although cross- validation might help get rid of the partitioning effect that affects the simple hold out, the results in Table 4 show that when the dataset is small (50 instances) the selection of a large k (e.g., k=10) might produce folds so small that testing results varies significantly. In this case, while the mean of the correlation coefficient is close to 50%, its standard deviation is in the range of 30%. Despite of being minimal, the implementation of an ensemble with four algorithms does produce more consistent results than learning schemes acting alone as shown in Table 5 for models 5, 6, 7, and 8. Finally, based on the results, it can be concluded that more prediction consistency is achieved when working with ensemble schemes. However, their capabilities cannot overcome the lack of an adequate dataset.","carlos hernández departamento de ingeniería industrial y sistemas universidad de la frontera temuco, chile carlosalberto.hernandez@ufrontera.cl álvaro alvar instituto de ingeniería industrial y sistemas universidad austral de chile valdivia, chile alvaro.alvar@alumnos.uach.cl",

265,An Investigation Of The Dynamic Of Cocoa Commodity  Competitiveness In Indonesia And Ivory Coast Before And,"as a primary agricultural commodity, cocoa is the essential commodity and source of income for farmers, workers, and companies in terms of its supply chain. in indonesia, cocoa is a commodity number three after coconut palm oil and rubber. therefore, it plays a crucial role in creating job opportunities, which focusing on agribusiness and domestic agroindustry, environmental conservation, and regional development. in conjunction with the significant contribution of cocoa as an agricultural commodity, this study seeks to investigate the cocoa commodity competitiveness dynamics in indonesia and ivory coast before and during the covid-19 pandemic. this study calculates the data of export using a four-digit harmonized system (hs) on the basis of the united nations' standard international trade classification (sitc) from 2016 to 2020. in determining the country's competitiveness, this study applies the balassa revealed comparative advantage (brca). this study indicates that the competitive dynamics of cocoa commodities occurred in indonesia and ivory coast before and during the covid-19 pandemic. thus, the chocolate industry network should promote good governance for improving sustainable agricultural resources, including fair and inclusive labour policy and green supply chains incentives. also, creating a better policy climate for effective agricultural management and developing a downstream chocolate industry should be crucial for both countries.",cocoa,"Indonesia and Ivory Coast have experienced international trade dynamics in Cacao commodities since the last decades. Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia have contributed around 70 percent of cocoa production in the world. According to the BRCA analysis, both countries have enjoyed strong competitiveness mainly from raw material or semi-finished cocoa commodities. For instance, Indonesia has a strong and medium comparative advantage for cocoa paste, whether or not defatted, as well as cocoa oil, fat and butter. While Ivory Coast is competitive in producing cocoa skins, shells, husks, and other cocoa waste, and cocoa beans, roasted or raw, broken or whole. Unfortunately, both countries experienced weak competitiveness in processed or final cocoa commodities such as chocolate and all food preparations with cocoa ingredients (HS-1806). For Indonesia, international trade revenues from cocoa commodities are profitable, especially for semi-processed cocoa products. For Ivory Coast, as it is the major cocoa exporter product globally, it depended on market stability to gain from trade. Furthermore, Ivory Coast and Indonesia should increase the added value of cocoa commodities by developing the downstream chocolate industry. It could be realised if both countries focus more on increasing their human development capacity in chocolate production.

269,Efficient Optimization Model For Buffer Size Problem In  Production Line With Rework Path,"modern production systems in modern industries are constructed with one or more support lines, such as rework, parallel, assembly line, and so on, to satisfy their objectives. producing a rejected part is a common issue in manufacturing processes. rework path (rp) is one of the most common types of production paths used to repair rejected parts and return them to the main line for reprocessing. the ideal buffer size in front of each machine tool bay in both branches of the production system should be optimized to create an efficient production system, including the main production line with rework path (mpl-rp). the optimization of buffer size of the system leads to the improvement in their overall performance, management, and operations. the key criteria influencing the buffer size decision and hence the mpl-rp production rate are the characteristics of machine tools, particularly their uptimes and downtimes. an efficient optimization model (eom) is conceived in this study to determine the buffer size between each two neighboring machine tools in mpl-rp at any given uptimes and downtimes. to determine the ideal buffer size of the mpl and its rp, eom employs a genetic algorithm (ga) based optimization model. the suggested method can estimate the ideal buffer size in an acceptable period of time, as demonstrated in the numerical examples, for small and large production lines, included in this study. as a result, when compared to previous selection approaches, the buffer sizes can be selected in a short span of time. the suggested approach can assist manufacturing engineers in making decisions during the design of new mpl-rp systems, as well as be utilized to improve the working of existing mpl-rp systems.","production line, rework path, optimization, buffer size","This paper has presented the implementation of an accurate and generic optimization algorithm to estimate the optimal values of the buffer size and productivity of production lines with a rework path. The results show that the algorithm carried out the prediction/optimization values at any given uptimes and downtimes values and can perform the desired task with large and small production lines without restriction to a specific number of machines. The algorithm was tested in two case studies of parameter settings with small and large production lines. The results of the small production line show that case study 1 (same values of uptime and downtime parameters) gave a higher productivity than those obtained in case 2 (random selection of uptime and downtime parameters). However, in the large production line, the algorithm identified buffer sizes in case of random selection of uptime and downtime that gave higher productivity than those for the case where same values of uptime and downtime for the sub lines are considered. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable to estimate the buffer size of SPL with a rework path. It is worth emphasizing that the proposed algorithm can be integrated with other software libraries because it is quite fast approach and can help the user make the rapid decisions with regard to the buffer size for the design of production lines. For future work, the authors aim to deploy this algorithm on an embedded system board and integrated it as an internet of things node within an Industry 4.0 framework.

278,Potential Effectiveness Of Quality Tools And Techniques To  Introduce Total Quality Management (Tqm) In Ready Made,"this study is a research program on the implementation of the total quality management (tqm) framework in the readymade garments (rmg) manufacturing industries detailing the order in which quality tools and techniques should be implemented. this study aims to implement tqm and determine whether and how the application of total quality management (tqm) practices can improve organizational and quality performance in the readymade (rmg) garments manufacturing industries. the study suggests implementing the tqm framework to develop quality performances within the ready-made garments (rmg) industries in bangladesh by applying and analysing, various quality tools, techniques, and tqm approaches the research methodology adopted a comprehensive literature review on tqm, followed by a questionnaire survey. a self-completion questionnaire was designed and perception-based data were collected from a sample of three hundred and twenty-two (322) readymade garment (rmg) firms, from greater dhaka city bangladesh (bgmea, 2018-19). quantitative data analysis is being adopted, following a questionnaire survey within rmg industries to collect primary data, from 06 (six) different places of greater city dhaka, in bangladesh by self- designed questionnaires, and analysed through statistical software i.e. spss and amos (sem). secondary data is to be collected from articles, journals, various ministry websites of bangladesh, and related online resources. the research study covers a wide range of various concepts of quality. tqm is defined and illustrated by various authors and scholars. the literature part also includes detailed discussion, benefits, justification, and hindrances of tqm implementation. researcher practices spss-25 & amos (for sem) software to carry out various tests for data analysis, such as reliability and validity, descriptive statistics, frequency distribution, p-test, chi-square, ordinal logistic method (olm), confirmatory factor analysis (cfa), factor loading, average variance extracted (ave), discriminant validity tests to find out proper findings for justifying the research study. 1. introduction quality holds significant importance in the world trade of garments. after phasing out of mfa (multi-fiber agreement), bangladesh garment manufacturing trade is competing with other countries for the market share in the world without quotas. quality as the number one source of competitive advantage for garments export (rashid et al. 2016). the product line of rmg is a complex array of styles, seasons, varying life cycles, and multidimensional sizing. many garments firms are upgrading their quality control procedure to be more competitive in the world market (nuruzzaman 2015). total quality management (tqm) refers to organization wide effort to achieve quality. it can accurately be described as a philosophy about quality that suggest for involving everyone in the organization in a quest for quality. it extends to suppliers as well as to customers. in fact, in tqm, the customer is the focal point, as the business is driven by customers. as such, customer’s satisfaction is the main driving force. everyone in the organization, form the top most chief executive to the bottom most workers, has to take part in this endeavour. tqm requires all employees of the organization for improving the products, processes and services (islam & haque 2012). all employees, no matter what role, are responsible for quality and quality assurance. the research attempts to fill the gap in literature of tqm, essential aspects of tqm elements in the readymade garments (rmg) trade in bangladesh and it is expected to be the beginning of further investigation and related studies. 2607",,"TQM is a catalytic tool for achieving excellence in the practice of management. Its continuous improvement principle gives it a dynamism by which organizations can anticipate, meet and surpass customer expectations. However, its implementation requires the presence of a culture—of ethical conduct, of integrity and of trust— that harmonize with its principles (Alaskari. O, & Pinedo-Cuenca. R., 2012). In the last few decades the concepts and frameworks of total quality management (TQM) are warmly welcomed in developed countries, however, industries in gradually developing nations like Bangladesh remained unacquainted with such initiatives. To implement TQM framework successfully, in the RMG industries as well as to improve their performance this study indicates some necessary steps (Akter, P., 2016). The study still have some analysis and findings to investigate. Though several points can be obtained from the above discussions and study (Syduzzaman, 2014) which are listed as follows-  Leadership including top management commitment is first and crucial factor for implementing TQM;  Continuous improvement which is the main goal of TQM can be achieved through training and teamwork;  To motivate employees, supplier, customers and stakeholders concept of TQM is indispensable;  If it can be ensured continuous improvement, then a culture will develop that will help to build relationship among management, employee, supplier and customer;  To assure product quality and maintain other related activities by using total quality management in the organization (Mazumder et al. 2011). The current pragmatic literature on TQM is subjugated by empirical studies in the framework of developed western countries, but one can just hardly find any wide-ranging research in the context of a developing country, like Bangladesh. Implementing a framework on TQM, the present study can help in:  Understanding the awareness of TQM or any other quality program in Bangladesh service sector.  Investigating the TQM implementation experiences in Bangladesh service sector.  Identification of the key TQM practices for effective TQM implementation in Bangladesh business sector. 2617","garment (rmg) manufacturing industries in bangladesh. md mazharul habib, (phd student) dr michele cano (director of studies, senior lecturer) dr evi viza, (sr. lecturer) and dr andisheh bakhshi, (lecturer) school of computing engineering and physical sciences (ceps) university of the west of scotland (uws) paisley, uk b0023005@studentmail.uws.ac.uk; michele.cano@uws.ac.uk; evi.viza@uws.ac.uk; andisheh.bakhshi@uws.ac.uk","References

282,Mobility Problems With Predicted Uncertainties In  Transportation Network Due To Storm Impacts,"disaster such as hurricane, by nature, involves uncertainties in many facets, from the time of its occurrence to magnitude of its impacts. due to its highly erratic movement, uncertainty during a storm event can quickly cascade. failure to incorporate these uncertainties when forming any emergency response operations can significantly affect the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations. understanding that the storm hazards such as strong winds, torrential rain, and storm surge can inflict significant damage on the transport network affecting population’s ability to move during/after the storm event, we proposed a cascading network failure model to accentuate this mobility issue. the model takes the scenario-level storm impacts generated by the data-driven probabilistic scenarios model from our previous work as inputs to predict uncertainties in the land transport network states during the storm event. we tested the model on hurricane irma case study to determine the mobility states of the tampa bay network over the 72-hour time horizon. the proposed model serves as a mean to predict uncertainty in the mobility states over the course of a storm event – a critical factor in forming effective and efficient response operation models.","hurricane, storm impacts, transport network, by nature","and Future Works Road transport network is the backbone of moving people and goods in the United States and its operational activities are greatly affected by the weather conditions. During a storm event, the importance of road transport amplifies as it becomes primary means for evacuation and other response operations. Being able to predict the potential changes in the transport network due to the storm impact is of interest to decision makers to arrive at founded response operations. Since a large part of disaster response operations use transportation networks, which are greatly impacted by the weather conditions, a network failure model introduced in this research aims to predict the network states for a given set of weather forecasts over the course of a disaster event. We use the model to determine the mobility states of the Tampa Bay network over the time horizon during Hurricane Irma. It takes the spatial-temporal weather profiles from the simulation model to determine the mobility states of the Tampa Bay area network. The resulting stochastic dynamic network that explicitly represents uncertainties in the predictions of the network states during a storm event can then be utilized to derive the appropriate response operations. When predicting the mobility states, the model compares the node’s elevation with the storm surge height to determine whether evacuation should be issued for population residing in that node. Since choosing the appropriate elevation is important, it is possible to define the elevation of a node using the center of population distribution approach as Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Rome, Italy, August 2-5, 2021","ketut gita ayu and pitu mirchandani school of computing, informatics, and decision systems engineering arizona state university tempe, az 85281, usa kgita@asu.edu, pitu@asu.edu","References

285,The Effect Of Brand-Relationship Quality On Positive Wordof-Mouth Intention,"measurement and management of consumer relationships with brands are critical issue that marketers have focused on for years. the quality of the relationship between the consumer and brand affects behavioral intention in favor of the brand. this research aims to reveal the effect of consumer-brand relationship quality (brq) on positive word-of-mouth (wom) intention. the brq components were applied on the sample of private university students in istanbul, turkey. the questionnaire form with 5-point likert scale was distributed and 199 valid surveys were obtained. cronbach's alfa was examined to internal consistency of the scales, and exploratory factor analysis was conducted to assess constructive validity. multiple regression analysis resulted in love/passion, commitment, and self-connection, which are the dimensions of brq, have a positive wom intention. on the other hand, the intimacy factor has no significant effect.","consumer behavior, word-of-mouth, factor analysis",,"mahmut selami akin business management, vocational school of social sciences istanbul medipol university 34810, beykoz, istanbul, turkey selamiakin@medipol.edu.tr onur dogan department of industrial engineering i̇zmir bakırçay university 35665, i̇zmir, turkey onur.dogan@bakircay.edu.tr","References

286,A Combined Approach For Predicting Operational  Performance In Port Terminals,"this paper proposes an approach to predict the operational performance of a port terminal using the combination of exponential smoothing, arima and artificial neural networks forecasting models. the empirical research was performed using data from the unloading operation of iron ore from the carajás mine (brazil), which is the largest open pit iron mine in the world. the results showed that the proposed combined forecasting approach generates better predictions than the univariates models when compared to other possible methods. the proposed approach can be applied to other complex decision problems that need to predict operational performance with high accuracy in the industrial and logistic context.",arima,"and implications.
