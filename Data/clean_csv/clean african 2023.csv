1,Theoretical Aspects Of The Short-Term Consumer Credit  Interest Rate Model,"the main objective is to explore the short term consumer credit high interest rate problem and the infectiveness of current interventions such as regulation while developing an alternative model. therefore, the paper develops a theoretical alternative model which addresses the major interest rate cost drivers subject to stakeholder engagement through suitability, acceptability and feasibility assessment. this is because previous studies have arguably unsuccessfully attempted to solve the matter through policy regulation albeit without satisfactory stakeholder engagement hence the shortcomings. the rationale of the new theoretical interest rate model suggest that the alternative model informed by key stakeholder engagement would be more appropriate to address the adverse effects of high-cost short term consumer credit than regulation.",oecd 2019,"The main objective was to explore the short term consumer credit high interest rate problem and the infectiveness of current interventions such as regulation while developing an alternative model.

This was because previous studies had arguably unsuccessfully attempted to solve the matter through policy regulation albeit without satisfactory stakeholder engagement hence the shortcomings. The rationale of the resultant Interest Rate Model suggest that the alternative model would be suitable, feasible and acceptable to key stakeholders. Therefore, the study contributes to relevant existing theory by advancing a proactive possible solution to the short term consumer interest rate conundrum. The theoretical model basically advocates for market driven solutions such as addressing the interest rate cost drivers to market problems unlike policy regulatory measures which are based on the inadequate reductionist methodology.","henry lukama chikweti and lubinda haabazoka and graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia chikwetihenry@gmail.com, lhabazoka@yahoo.com jackson phiri school of natural sciences, department of computer science university of zambia lusaka, zambia jackson.phiri@cs.unza.zm",

3,Process Improvement Through Built-In-Quality In  Automotive Component Manufacturers,"the competitiveness of automotive component manufacturers is no longer driven by the price at which they sell their components but by the quality of the products they deliver. vehicle assembling corporations are inclined to moving their business to component manufacturers that deliver quality components as opposed to delivering low-priced components with poor quality. an automotive component manufacturer which manufactures vehicle side-steps through a blow-moulding process was struggling with the implementation of the principle of built-in-quality. this was reflected in their traditional reactive approach of using quality gates as opposed to driving built-in-quality in their conversion operations. this has resulted in high labour requirements (inspectors), high rate of reworks and scrap which impacted significantly on the profitability of the manufacturer. given the severity of this problem, the aim of the study was to develop a strategic approach to aid automotive component manufacturers in the implementation of built-in- quality in their manufacturing streams. several lean manufacturing techniques such as pareto analysis, 5why analysis, standard operating procedures, time studies, and statistical process controls were employed to identify operational gaps and opportunities in the manufacturing streams, to develop a strategic approach to implement built-in-quality. the results of the study were the implementation of built-in-quality on a manufacturing line, and the development of a 4-step approach for manufacturers to attain built-in-quality in their processes that was guided by deming’s plan- do-check-act cycle.","built-in-quality, quality gates","The study applied several lean manufacturing techniques to identify gaps in the implementation of built-in-quality in automotive component manufacturers and developed a subduing strategy. Automotive component manufacturers can follow the developed strategic approach that is centred around Deming’s Plan-Do-Check-Act method. The study has shown to an extent that automotive component manufacturers need to invest in technology and empower employees to make decisions through coaching and training. automotive component manufacturers need to close the departmental gaps that are currently created during process design and enforce a unified multi-departmental approach towards designing their processes. Quality assurance must not be a departmental responsibility, but an organizational responsibility from the inception of processes. The employment of built-in-quality strategy brings into light hidden cost benefits of labour reduction, adequate utilization of resources and reduced process times especially in manufacturing lines where quality gates are in series with manufacturing processes. The first objective of the study was met through the development of a Pareto analysis, while the second objective was also met using a 5Why analysis technique which identified the root-causes of defects. The third objective of the study was also met through an experimental study of comparison. Gaps and opportunities that were identified using the various lean techniques led to the identification of technological advancements that can be employed to drive built-in-quality, which talks to the fourth objective. A detailed strategic approach was developed to aid automotive component manufacturers in implementing built-in-quality on their manufacturing lines. Further research into this area of study would be centred around the integration of shopfloor employees to fool-proof systems, defect detection technologies and comprehending digital product information to drive built-in-quality.

4,An Assessment Of The Use Of Quality 4.0 Trends In Higher  Education Institutions In South Africa.,"the fourth industrial revolution (4ir) has brought many changes in our lives, and we must adapt in different ways. quality 4.0 is also part of the change. 4ir affected how organizations perceive quality; how has it affected the higher education sector in south africa? this is the question this study attempts to answer. the study aimed to assess the use of quality 4.0 trends in higher education institutions in south africa. to best achieve the study, the following objectives were listed: (1) to identify the most used quality 4.0 trends in higher education institutions in south africa; (2) to highlight the respondents' perspective on quality 4.0 and finally; (3) to recommend ways to a successful implementation of quality 4.0 in higher education institutions. the study followed a quantitative approach using a questionnaire to collect data from 300 respondents mixed between staff and students from higher education institutions. descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze data. to assess the reliability of the questionnaire, cronbach's alpha was used. the study revealed that quality 4.0 is a relatively new field in south africa, both on the business and academic levels. in addition, most of the respondents are not familiar with the quality 4.0 concept but are familiar with its trends. from the most used trend in higher education institutions, the top five were: online social platforms (youtube, whatsapp, zoom, etc.), iot, simulation, ar and big data analytics.","quality 4.0, 4ir, higher education, zambia","and recommendations The study offered perspectives on using quality 4.0 trends in the South African higher education sector. A review of the existing literature showed that quality 4.0 is relatively a new field in South Africa, both on the business and academic levels. Nevertheless, the results revealed that even though most of the respondents are not familiar with quality 4.0 concepts, they are at least familiar with some trends that come with it. This is generally because quality 4.0 trends are similar to 4IR's. The literature identified nine trends: Augmented Reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), Multi-Agent Systems, Systems Integration, Big data analytics, Simulation, Cyber Security, Cloud Computing and Additive manufacturing. Not all these trends are used to the same extent in higher education institutions. The results revealed that the top five were: Online social platforms (YouTube, WhatsApp, Zoom, etc.), IoT, Simulation, AR and Big data analytics. Although there is a need to commend higher education institutions on their involvement in adopting quality 4.0 trends, it is recommended that with the fast-growing technological rate, more should be done to keep up the pace. Developing institutions that are 4IR ready, raising awareness on quality 4.0, and empowering staff to use more quality 4.0 trends in their lecturing styles are a few recommendations higher education institutions should try to implement.","eric mikobi bakama quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa bakamae@uj.ac.za nita inderlal sukdeo quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa nsukdeo@uj.ac.za kemlall ramsaroop ramdass operations management university of south africa johannesburg, south africa ramdakr@unisa.ac.za genevieve bakam fotso quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa genischou@gmail.com",
5,Process Improvement Through Single Minute Exchange Of  Dies For Reduction Of Changeover Time,"businesses around the world strive to operational costs and waste across their supply chains to remain competitive in the growing global market. initiatives for set-up duration reduction are critical for lean manufacturing implementation despite than many organisations that initiate single minute exchange of dies (smed) fail on implementation. the plastic injection moulding machines at an engineering firm are characterised by an ineffective process and the main problem was that the single changeover time ranged from 45 min to over 60 minutes, thereby leading to longer downtime and less production time. the scenario resulted in production capacity constraints, longer lead times and this led to loss of future business with some of the customers due to failure to meet delivery dates. the objective of this study is to identify and separate external and internal elements, establish cycle time and reduce tool changeover time for the plastic injection moulding machines. by implementing the new tailor-made smed improvement programme of having tools ready before machine stops running, combining steps, bringing tool-holder before commencing the tool change process and establishing the production sequence to take advantage of temperatures, material type and colour, the engineering firm achieved 22% reduction in changeover time.",process improvement,"The data collection and analysis provided the work element sheets that were categorised as external and internal elements. The total cycle time for changeover was established as 59.59 minutes. The implementation of the proposed improvement initiatives by the engineering firm reduced the tool changeover time from 45 min/changeover to 35 min/changeover or 22% reduction. It is recommended that to sustain the minimum tool changeover time, the established production sequence to be followed, that would minimise the time lost due to material purging, since the production sequence takes advantage of material colour, type as well as material temperatures. Companies must pay attention to SMED activities carried out during separation phase, since proper identification of internal and external 59.6 17.9 26.7 15 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Total Change Over Time Internal work Elements External Work Elements Material Purging Time (min) Before After 10 min decrease 54","mendon dewa senior lecturer department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, south africa mendond@dut.ac.za","References

6,Industry 4.0 Implementation Challenges In An Unfacilitated  Environment: A Case Of Manufacturing Industries In,"the current fourth industrial revolution, called industry 4.0, implies digitalisation is central to african countries to leverage the african continental free trade area (afcfta) and boost its manufacturing sector. however, the lack of right governmental policies, poor state of industries, and lack of regulatory frameworks in most african countries make digitalization of industries and for the continent to realize the goals of integration in line with afcfta complex. for zambia, where no national industry 4.0 initiative is in force, how is the manufacturing industry preparing for the digital future? this study was designed to answer this question. the study used a quantitative research design, and a structured questionnaire distributed to manufacturing companies appearing on the zambia association of manufacturers’ database for data collection. a total of 50 questionnaires were successfully completed. the data were analysed using spss to conduct descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis. the results from the study show that the major challenges to the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies included; high investment cost of industry 4.0 technologies, need to reduce costs to stay competitive, it security, growing complexity of processes and lack of skills and insufficient training of the staff. these findings suggest that zambia is likely to lag the adoption of the current industrial development, digitalization, and greater integration trajectory, and risk being left out of the afcfta and industry 4.0 opportunities. it is recommended that a industry 4.0 national initiative be put in place to help bolster industry 4.0 adoption by manufacturing firms in zambia.",industry 4.0,"The knowledge level analysis produced the mean Likert Scores for the majority Industry 4.0 technologies between 2 and 3 scales, representing Low and Moderate levels, respectively. This implies that Manufacturing Industries in Zambia had a low to moderate knowledge on Industry 4.0, meaning most of the companies had a low awareness on the main technologies of Industry 4.0. They had low to moderate knowledge on internet of things, mobile technologies, cybersecurity, smart sensors, big data and analytics, cloud computing and predictive maintenance, all of which are core to digitisation. Some of the main challenges to implement Industries 4.0 identified by the companies were ‘high investment costs and a need to reduce costs in order to remain competitive as common challenges to digital transformation. On the question of whether the company had any strategy to move to Industry 4.0, 29% of respondents indicated that they do not have a strategy in place for industry 4.0, while 18% are preparing one, and 12% said they have a strategy for Industry 4.0 but it’s not part of their company strategy. Only 22% said they have a strategy and its part of their company strategy. Clearly initiatives at enterprise level are not leading to expected 4IR technologies adoption levels. These findings suggest that Zambia is likely to lag the adoption of the current industrial development, digitalization, and greater integration trajectory, and risk being left out of the AfCFTA and Industry 4.0 opportunities. The establishment of a national Industry 4.0 initiative would create an environment that facilitates industry adoption of new technologies because the economic challenges identified can easily be addressed by the Government.","zambia tola toyin afolabi and levy siaminwe department of mechanical engineering school of engineering university of zambia lusaka, zambia eng2100200@student.unza.zm, afolabitolatoyin@gmail.com, lsiaminwe@unza.zm",

9,The Implementation Of Six Sigma And Dmaic Methodology  To Increase Productivity And Meet Customer Requirements,"the lean six sigma approach has become a popular initiative which companies have embarked on to remain competitive, ensure growth within the global market and to establish customer satisfaction and loyalty. six sigma is at the top of the agenda for many companies that aim to reduce cost and improve a firm’s productivity. this paper focuses on a production that was unable to meet the hourly target. using the six-sigma approach and dmaic methodology, the current problems on the line were studied and the root cause was established by using a fish bone diagram. process improvement initiatives were characterised by the installation of a conveyor, synchronised with the takt time, and the production line was able to meet the daily output a. an andon system was also installed to keep track of scoring, to ensure each process meets their required cycle time and process operation as well as to indicate to line management if there is an abnormality at any process or holistically.",hourly target,"The DMAIC Approach, is one of the fastest and most efficient way of defining the problem, measuring or collecting data, analyzing the data collected, propose ways to improve the current situation and lastly how to control and maintain the selected recommendation if carried out. In a nutshell, six sigma was proposed as a tool to improve the reliability & the quality of products by starting off at the manufacturing process to attain the end goal i.e. Reducing defects. The article further goes on to stay that even though Sis sigma was developed as an operational strategy due to globalization, it is now a “competitive corporate strategy used extensively throughout the corporate world” (Kumar et al 2007). From the constraints mapped out on a fishbone diagram successfully and from this we were then able to deal with issues relating to man and method. A pacemaker in the form of a conveyor was successfully implemented and was set and running according to the takt of the line.

10,The Impact Of Digital Divide On Integration Of  Organizational Discourse With Digital Media During Covid-,"digital media has influenced the even organizational communication has it has become the present day toolbox for knowledge sharing. it is a very dynamic form of information exchange that happens in real time and spaces reaching out to large numbers in an instantaneous manner as compared to traditional media. effecting the integration of organizational discourse communication with digital media cannot go on without first analyzing the impact of digital divide as was the case with the seventh-day adventist in zambia during covid19 at the same time establishing if there is any impact among these challenges. a descriptive and survey design was employed in this research. the study population was made up of church members, church workers, and administrators of the seventh-day adventist church from all the ten provinces of zambia with a total membership of 1,295,153. the research objectives were handled by mixed method with an interpretive or constructive paradigm with an embedded subjectivism philosophy and spss was used for thematic and content analysis. the finding from this study posit that digital divide significantly impacts the integration of organizational discourse with digital media as was the case during covid-19 pandemic. it was recommended that the organization builds up a digital media communication infrastructure spearheaded by experts who can effectively implement the established model of organizational discourse integrated with digital media and effectively use digital media engagement tools.",digital divide,"Regarding the influence of the digital divide on the integration of organizational discourse with digital media and virtual conferencing during the Covid-19 pandemic, the following conclusions may be drawn: I. It goes without saying that the church has a fairly young membership, as 67 percent of respondents were under 30 years old. This demonstrates that over two-thirds of the organization's church members are screenagers. And because their gender, age, employment, and marital status impacted the extent of their digital media involvement, the organization must continue to utilize digital media to engage with these church members. There are particular communication strategies that these church members would want to see their organization employ. As a means of communicating with its church members, the company utilizes blogs, podcasts, and Twitter less frequently than it should. 113","19 pandemic dexter adamson njuka institute of distance education university of zambia lusaka, zambia dextertambulukani@gmail.com jackson phiri school of natural sciences, department of computer sciences university of zambia lusaka, zambia jackson.phiri@cs.unza.zm","References

11,Framework For Implementation Of Industry 4.0 Tools And  Technologies In Electrical Power Generation Plants Asset,"power production systems are made up of assets that support material handling and production of electricity. as these assets deteriorate, it may be difficult to deliver the expected quality of service, and to meet regulatory requirements and sustainable development goals (lutchman, 2018). moreover, covid 19 has accelerated both manufacturing and service industries to go digital (biard & nour, 2021), increasing demand for both electrical power and production systems reliability. this challenge imposes an increase in the focus on efficiency of physical asset management and has prompted power production industries to look for innovative solutions that yield maximum value for physical asset management functions. the arrival of asset management 4.0 concepts enables the exploitation of big data to improve and manage system reliability (longhitano, et al., 2021). furthermore, asset performance depends on various factors like quality of maintenance and operating environmental factors, such that even two identical assets will seldom obey their estimated mean time to failure (longhitano, et al., 2021). considering this, a data driven approach is necessary as it spot deviations in time and maintenance is done when required, increasing its effectiveness (jasiulewicz-kaczmarek, et al., 2020). the present research aims to develop a data driven asset management framework that is enhanced by industry 4.0 technologies to execute the key functions of asset management in the operation, maintenance, and management phase of the physical asset’s life cycle, and effectively integrate the environmental, social, and economic aspects into physical asset management related activities to improve system performance and extend its service life.",industry 4.0,,"management. tsitsi mashupeka and professor stephen matope meng (research) industrial engineering and associate professor industrial engineering stellenbosch university stellenbosch, south africa mashupeka.tsitsi@gmail.com, smatope@sun.ac.za",
12,Analysis Of Connection Fee Subsidies On Rural  Electrification Projects In Zambia: Case Of Chibombo,"zambia like most sub-saharan countries grapples with low electrification rates especially in rural areas. currently, rural electrification rates in zambia stand at 8% (4.4% and 7.4% on-grid and solar respectively) and the country has a universal access to electricity sustainable development goal (sdg) of attaining 51% rural electrification rate by 2030. the country has been advancing various renewable energy technologies, upscaling hydro power plants as well as subsidy-based electrification programs in selected areas. however, the electrification rate remains low. further, with the shift in government policy to remove subsidies in the energy sector, there was need to ascertain what influence the connection fee subsidies had on sustainable rural electrification in line with meeting the set universal access to electricity target. therefore, the research conducted an analysis of connection fee subsidies on sustainable rural electrification with a focus on chibombo district where the connection fee subsidy mechanism was implemented under the electricity services access project (esap). the study used a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach for data collection. quantitative data was attained via the administration of research questionnaires with closed-ended questions while qualitative data was attained via semi-structured interviews with experienced experts in the electricity sub-sector. the study found that 938 beneficiaries had been connected under the subsidy mechanism of the esap project which was almost three-fold the initial target of 385 beneficiaries. the study further applied descriptive statistics to analyze the quantitative data. through correlation analysis, the study established a statistically significant positive correlation between connection fee subsidy and increase in electricity connections and sustainable electricity consumption levels. further, the study found a negative correlation between high connection cost and rural electrification rates. the study also identified critical success factors for sustainable rural electrification which included: economic sustainability, social-cultural sustainability, institutional capacity and environmental sustainability. thereafter, the study developed a sustainability framework for rural electrification by integrating the critical success factors with sustainable rural electrification.",sustainability,,district michael kalumbu nsefu zambia metrology agency university of lusaka kalumbunsefu@gmail.com,
13,Diagnosis Of Maintenance Maturity In An Indonesia’S Coal  Mining Contracting Company,"the trend of coal production in indonesia has been increasing since 2020. this increase in coal production also has an impact on sales of heavy equipment. heavy equipment sales have increased from 2020 to the first semester of 2022. mining haul trucks are currently equipped with industrial 4.0 technology, namely iot, which can be used to monitor equipment health. through predictive maintenance or maintenance 4.0, companies can manage resources and energy efficiently. the complexity of technology and this digital revolution if not managed properly will have a negative impact, one of them is reducing the competitiveness of a company. this study aims to identify maturity levels of maintenance in coal mining actors in indonesia, especially about data driven asset management. there are four maintenance maturity levels that will be assessed: visual inspections, instrument inspections, real time monitoring, and predictive maintenance in industry 4.0. it will be combined with three data maturity levels: initial, established, and advanced. questionnaire is used to collect opinions of maintenance managers as the owner of maintenance process about their experience in conducting maintenance. it is then summarized to state maturity level of maintenance practices in an indonesian coal mining contracting company. it is concluded that maintenance characteristics in this company mostly fit with predictive maintenance in industry 4.0 characteristics.","coal mining, heavy equipment, maintenance 4.0",Diagnosis of maintenance maturity level is an important step to develop maintenance strategy. This activity should be taken if an organization want to shift their maintenance level to the higher maturity level.

14,Barge Capacity Plan Analysis For Coal Transhipment  Process With Decomposition Forecasting And Fuzzy Logic,"pt xyz is a company in the supply chain of coal distribution activities from jetty loa tebu to muara berau. the coal distribution fleet operated is a barge guided by tugs. pt xyz must be able to plan the needs of effective coal distribution capacity to avoid uneven distribution, anticipate fluctu ations and increase demand for transhipment. this study aims to calculate the projected number of coal transhipment and distribution capacity needs by barges at pt xyz in the next 5 years and determine the appropriate capacity planning strategy to be implemented in meeting the needs. the research method used is forecasting to project the number of coal transhipment from 10 years ago, the methods being compared are regression and decomposition which appropriate for long-term forecasting. the accuracy of the forecasting model is compared and shows that forecasting using decomposition has better results to apply because it has the smallest rmse and mape values. coal transhipment projection in 2027 is 1,008,638 mt and we build with fuzzy logic mamdani optimization model with some rules and parameter. furthermore, based on forecasting and optimization result we need to add 8 barges to balance the transhipment projection in 2027, a cost analysis comparison is conducted for alternative lead, lag, and average capacity strategies. the calculation results show that the lead capacity strategy has the lowest cost value and is the best capacity planning strategy by investing in or adding sets of tugs and barges.","transhipment, decomposition, forecasting","Based on the results of calculations and analysis that has been done on the data processed, then it can be concluded as follows: 1. The accuracy of the forecasting model is compared and shows that forecasting using decomposition has better results to apply because it has the smallest RMSE and MAPE values. Coal transhipment projection in 2027 is 1,008,638 MT. 2. In line with the significant increase in coal export, we have to add assets in order to fulfill export needs. Based on forecasting and fuzzy logic calculation, the exact optimal number to increase the barge is 8. 3. Appropriate capacity planning strategy to implement in fulfillment of tugboats and barges at this company is the lead strategy capacity with the total cost IDR 2,746,115,872,435.00 for adding sets of tugboats and barges the lowest.","yeni nuraeni and dendi p ishak departement of industrial engineering faculty of engineering university of indonesia jakarta, indonesia yeni.nuraeni@ui.ac.id, dendi@ie.ui.ac.id",
15,Pivotal Relationship Between Service Delivery Automation  And Job Losses:  A Case Of The South African Banking,"service delivery automation is seen as the new norm that uses automated service delivery channels and advanced technologies to provide services to customers. in recent years, the integration of advanced technology-based practices to deliver services in the banking industry has grown exponentially and is currently having a significant impact on customer perceptions and, subsequently, on the productivity of the entire financial sector. this paper looks at the influence and impact of adopting service delivery automation on the potentiality of job losses or unemployment in the south african banking industry, with a focus on the five prominent banking institutions in the country. an analysis of the employees' perceptions of the phenomenon at hand was conducted to determine whether service delivery automation brings along unemployment through job losses. a conceptual framework was developed to lay the ground for hypotheses to test the model developed for this paper. through the hypothesis testing, it was found that there is a significant relationship between service delivery automation and the generation of job losses, whereby the more banking institutions integrate automation into their structural business model, the more certain category of job opportunities are lost or displaced.","digitalisation, job losses","Service delivery automation through the adoption of bank automation displayed a strong relationship with the generation of job losses, which is also referred to as a dimension of unemployment orchestrated by implementing technology-based practices. The path analysis based on the primary data indicated that the more Absa, Capitec bank, FNB, Nedbank and Standard bank restructure their business models to integrate automation, the greater the number of job losses observed throughout the service delivery chain. Therefore, this seems to influence and impact low-skilled employees, unlike employees with technology-related skills, who are privileged and reap a large portion of the benefits of adopting automation. In addition, the inferential interpretation of the secondary data also supported the primary data's results. The implementation of service delivery automation creates new types of jobs or job opportunities which are not beneficial nor within reach of all employees at all levels because they require advanced skills. 6. Recommendation for future research The influence of service delivery automation on job losses was examined using the five largest banking institutions in South Africa as a case study. For more rigorous results, it would be commended to conduct a study that will examine the relationship between service delivery automation and the generation of job losses from the entire financial services institutions' perspective in South Africa. This would provide additional robustness in generalising the results.","industry save akilimalissiga and nita sukdeo department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa savea@uj.ac.za, nsukdeo@uj.ac.za",

So, the big challenge for scientists is to find a cure to recover the cognitive ability of Alzheimer’s patient. Unfortunately, till now there is no medical solution for this illness, but because of the current technological and software advances, we can reduce the bad effect of AD. In fact, the existing technological solutions have the ultimate goal to make the patients more independent, so they can handle autonomously their daily activities. The integrated solution that we propose has many features once implanted correctly, it will make it a prominent solution comparing to the already existing solutions in the market. By using geolocating technics, we propose to establish a distant monitoring of the Alzheimer’s patient, more explicitly the patient will wear a bracelet which has a GPS module and a permanent internet connection, so the web application already developed can monitor continuously the real time position of the patient. This web application has a confidential access by the caregivers and the responsible family members of the patient. Based on the need analysis that we have done, we have taken into consideration all necessary features that this solution must have, in order to work properly, for instance the long battery autonomy, the GPS position accuracy, internet coverage, water resistance, shock resistance, etc. But for us, the most ambitious goal, is to integrate a machine learning module, that can process a data collected from a several patients wearing the bracelets. This data is related to the patient health like his body temperature, blood pressure, heartbeat and the walking distance, and also this data contain the environmental conditions like the exterior temperature, the humidity, the noise, etc. Hence, the study of this data might guide us to understand more the eventual factors that affect positively or negatively the health situation of the Alzheimer’s patients. In this paper, we presented the outline of our solution especially, the choice of the bracelet and watches devices and the global features compared with anther solutions. We identified the methodology and methods. After a conceptual model has been presented. We finally identified the architecture of an integrated solution for tracking patients with Alzheimer’s disease and discussed the study’s contributions. In the future, we intend to integrate a machine learning module, that can process data collected from patients wearing our bracelets. This module will recommend environmental conditions like the exterior temperature, the humidity, the noise, etc.","kawtar retmi institute of biological sciences, issb-p mohamed vi polytechnic university (um6p) 43 150 benguerir, morocco kawtar.retmi@um6p.ma fatima ouzayd smart systems laboratory, rabat it center, ensias, university mohamed v, rabat, morocco fatima.ouzayd@ensias.um5.ac.ma hamid ech-cheikh naval engineering department higher institute of maritime studies casablanca, morocco. h.echcheikh@isem.ac.ma",
17,Policy And Projection Of Solar Pv Waste Management:  Indonesia Case,"indonesia is a tropical country where the equator passes, and the sun tends to shine longer than other countries. solar energy is one of the sources of energy that indonesia is currently developing. thus, solar energy has considerable potential to be developed in indonesia. according to the institute for essential service reform (2021), the potential for solar power in indonesia reaches 207,898gw using 4.34% to 24.43% of the total land area. the photovoltaic (pv) module and inverter are the two primary parts of a pv system. pv modules are anticipated to last 25 to 30 years, while inverters are anticipated to last 10 to 15 years. pv modules and inverters are not designed with reuse in mind when entering the end of life of the product, therefore, some of the materials used to produce pv modules and inverters will be discarded because they cannot be reused. indonesia will produce a significant amount of electronic waste due to the lifespan of a pv system. this study was conducted based on examining information from papers, journals, research reports. this research will discuss the policy, regulation, the projection of solar pv waste in indonesia in the future and classify the different kinds of hazardous waste in pv systems.","solar energy, hazardous waste","As one of the nations strategically located on the equator, Indonesia has the potential to develop solar energy because the sun shines for a longer period of time there. At the moment, Indonesia is actively working toward a goal of 23% new and renewable energy by 2025 and reaching emission-free by 2050. Indonesia is progressing in the implementation of innovative and sustainable energy, particularly in the energy from solar power plants. Despite the fact that solar energy has no emissions, the parts of a power plant system eventually create hazardous waste, and such as mercury, lead, tin, and zinc, which can have a harmful impact on the ecosystem and human health. The estimated waste that will be generated from the PV system from one of the solar power plant installers in Indonesia is 72,277 tons for the PV module and 190 tons for the inverter.","nadya tamara genta maharani, rahmat nurcahyo, djoko sihono gabriel industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia nadya.tamara@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id, dsihono@gmail.com",

19,Planning Guideline For Failure Handling In Onboard  Cbtc Device Using Rcm (Reliability Center,"nowadays, the need for public transportation keeps on growing rapidly. one of the globally rapidly growing transportation modes is the train. train operation has something to do with the signaling system. communications-based train control (cbtc) is a modern type of signaling system based on two-way communication using radio waves between wayside and onboard devices. cbtc system is a fully automated system that requires robust maintenance of many components in order to prevent failure. even after the maintenance, a cbtc failure may still occur. focused on the onboard cbtc device, a reliability centered maintenance (rcm) method is adopted as an effort to discover the severity level of failure and what kind of maintenance should be given to the onboard cbtc device. fmea and fta methods are also included in the rcm method to conduct the evaluation. the evaluation result indicates that remote input output (rio) is the most vulnerable equipment to experience failure, in severe conditions, it’s resulting in an emergency brake and threatening the safety of passengers. it also indicates that the frequently unclear reports from mainline officers and different directions from the control center significantly impact poor handling, resulting in delayed traveling. in addition to the need for maintenance, this research aims to produce guidelines in form of a standard operating procedure (sop) for dealing with mainline failure during operating hours. it is expected that any different direction from the control center and engineer’s action can be eliminated in dealing with the mainline failure.","onboard cbtc, failure","and Discussion CBTC is a signaling device consisting of OnBoard and wayside equipment connected using two-way communication radio signals. CBTC devices are designed with high standards in order to have good durability and can work optimally in accordance with standards. The high standards provided include the CBTC Onboard device, but in practice, it does not rule out the possibility that there will still be failures in the device. Failure itself can be fatal to operations, tight headways, distances between trains that are not far apart, high speed, failure to detect locations can result in collisions, double track lanes with heavy traffic, making a failure in the field must be handled immediately so that operations can still run well and smoothly. This study provides recommendations to prevent and reduce the possibility of failure on the mainline and treatment if failure is forced to occur. The proficiency of the control center officer in providing direction and the field officer in carrying out the direction is 184","maintenance) analysis widhi bayu aji and maya arlini puspasari industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, west java, indonesia widhi.bayu@ui.ac.id, mayaarlini@ui.ac.id","References

25,Voltage Event Signature Classification For Power Quality  Disturbance Identification,"the power quality indices corresponding to voltage event are provided by iec 61000-4-30 and ieee 1564 standards. the popularization of machine learning techniques in modern and smarter power grids inherently characterized with randomized big data motivates their inclusion. we aimed to establish key voltage disturbance event features that a machine learning model can use to attain a high classification and prediction accuracy. the feature extraction was achieved using the singular value decomposition and wavelet transform of a three-phase system represented as a space phasor model with the corresponding ellipse parameters and the shape index feature extracted. the 6 by 500 dataset with the six (6) features (rms, event duration, 3rd harmonic, 5th harmonic, 7th harmonic, shape index) was used to classify voltage sag, swell, interruption, harmonics, and normal conditions. matlab r2021a classification learner application was used to create a supervised machine learning model by training twenty-nine (29) classifiers and comparing their performance using the accuracy (%), confusion matrix, total cost validation, prediction speed and training time. the results indicated that without the shape index, the voltage sag and voltage interruption events were misclassified in some scenarios for all the classifiers, with the highest accuracy obtainable of 99.6% by four (4) classifiers. the inclusion of shape index feature improved the trained models to 100% classification accuracy for fourteen (14) classifiers. the training, computing and processing is required to be of high performance and accuracy to increase the online situational awareness of network operators when such systems are implemented.","decomposition, shape index",The research aims at establishing key voltage disturbance event features that a machine learning model can use to provide 100% classification accuracy (validation).

29,"Improving Knowledge Distillation Using Data Augmentation  Jun Seung Woo, Shin Dong Ho,","knowledge distillation (kd) is a type of transfer learning where a large, pre-trained model (teacher model) transfers knowledge to a smaller, simpler model (student model) to make the latter more efficiently trainable. knowledge distillation (kd) can effectively transfer the knowledge of a teacher model to a student model in image classification tasks. however, the results of kd can vary depending on the specific method and approach used, thus a standardized improvement method is necessary. data augmentation techniques are powerful performance improvement methods for image classification. in this paper, we propose a standardized approach to improving knowledge distillation using various data augmentation techniques based on the α value. the results showed that data augmentation techniques provided a significant performance improvement in the knowledge distillation model. we demonstrated that as the strength of data augmentation increases, the performance of knowledge distillation (kd) also increases proportionally. and it seems that the α value does not have a significant impact on the performance improvement of knowledge distillation (kd).","deep learning, computer vision","This paper conducted experiments on applying Data Augmentation to Knowledge Distillation (KD), a method for effectively training the Student Model, a relatively small architecture in the Image Classification field, and found that it significantly improved the model's performance. We also tested the effect of different values of α on the performance of Data Augmentation. The results showed that the performance improvement of models trained with KD and Data Augmentation was substantial, and the impact of α value was minimal. Additionally, an interesting finding was observed that when the α value is 1.0, the performance improvement of Data Augmentation is relatively reduced compared to other α values. 236","student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net","References

30,A Study On Emg Signal Classification For Improving  Control Methods For Electric Prosthetic Hands,"in general, it is difficult to recognize emg patterns for controlling prosthetic arms because they are not fixed and vary greatly in characteristics. in this paper, we evaluate the classification ability of root mean square, integral, and power spectral densities to identify various hand motions including wrist flexion, extension, wrist adduction, abduction, grasping, and abduction. to perform this study, emg signals are measured in the finger extensors, carpal tunnel extensors, carpal tunnel flexors, and carpal tunnel flexors. emg signals are analyzed for root mean square, integral and power spectral density. through experiments, it was shown that the proposed method can estimate hand movements efficiently.","emg signals, emg patterns, finger extensors","In this study, a folding mechanism developed for the wrist amputee who needs a prosthetic hand was studied to operate according to the classification of EMG signals to use as an effective method for controlling the prosthetic hand. The system for EMG analysis used in this study enabled monitoring by accepting EMG signals from four muscles. EMG signals were measured in each channel during 6 types of motion. By measuring signals from four muscles for each motion and classifying the signals, it could be used as an effective signal for controlling the prosthetic hand. It was confirmed that it is possible to implement the control method.","benny choi, shin dong ho student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim student, department of economics, college of economics, nihon university, 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan eavatar@hanmail.net",
31,"Vehicle Driver Interaction Using Emg Signal Analysis  Lee Ji Yun, Shin Dong Ho","in this paper, we present an emg signal analysis and classification technique for hand gesture recognition specialized for autonomous vehicle environments. in addition, we propose a new user interface method that considers the bio signals received from wearable devices and the characteristics of self-driving cars. emg is an electrical property produced to command the contraction and relaxation of muscle tissue. the medical surface emg sensor mounted on the myo armband used in the experiment transmits emg signals and sensor information wirelessly from the arm to the terminal via bluetooth. the emg-based interaction system proposed in this paper processes the collected emg signals to classify hand gestures and interacts with the autonomous driving system. gestures for control transfer are classified in a double threshold method through emg signal analysis and used as a more efficient interface by applying a separate low pass filter. this emg-vehicle interaction system was developed to enable control of an autonomous vehicle through a system capable of controlling an autonomous vehicle. in addition, we introduce constraints and methods using vehicle state information to reduce gesture recognition errors that may occur in situations unintended by the driver.","emg sensor, wearable devices, human error","In this paper, a method for an intuitive user interface for safe and efficient driving mode conversion in an autonomous driving environment is presented. Recently, in order to find a specific button typical of the autonomous driving mode switching method, a new switching method was implemented and tested using an EMG-based wearable device as a method to reduce the risk of gaze dispersion that occurs while driving. Through experiments, it was confirmed that the operation using gestures, which is the method presented in this paper, relatively reduces driver's distraction compared to the existing button operation method, and enables switching of driving modes while stably maintaining vehicle steering. In particular, the proper setting of the number of sampling of EMG sensor values for recognizing gestures and the low-pass filter that rectifies them prevented most unintended commands, preventing the recognition rate from deteriorating due to errors. In addition, additional vehicle information was used to limit the control transfer conditions, and it was confirmed that this allows the driver to more safely switch the vehicle from manual driving mode to autonomous driving mode. In addition, by determining the amount of force given to the driver's arm and the position of the arm through the EMG, it is possible to determine whether the driver's current condition is a state in which he can manually drive a vehicle or not. This can be used to safely move the vehicle to the shoulder of the road or other safe areas in preparation for a situation in which the driver cannot accept the system's mode change request when the system requests a transition to the manual driving mode. In this paper, a new type of user interface is provided, and as a comparison target, the button operation, which is a general mode switching method, was selected as a standard in consideration of one of the vehicle peripheral devices or the installed infotainment environment among the autonomous driving mode switching methods, and the experiment was conducted. . In order to secure more reliability of the proposed gesture-based method, it is necessary to compare the lack of information sharing that is not provided by car companies and to compare with more various wearable devices or buttons and interfaces mounted on vehicles and vehicle models. In addition, it is judged that more quantitative and qualitative evaluations that individual drivers can experience and feel are additionally needed in the future through more diverse driving environments and many experimental groups. Based on this, future research will attempt EMG analysis through Recurrent Neural Network, which will show good performance in analyzing time- sequential data as it is likely to be a method that can more closely judge the recognition rate and situation. This is expected to be able to implement more abstract and complex gestures, and it is judged that higher flexibility for the proposed gesture method can be secured by applying it to an autonomous driving system.","student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim student, department of economics, college of economics, nihon university, 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan eavatar@hanmail.net",
32,Multi-Product Inventory Modeling With Demand Forecasting    Angie Valencia Olivares And Axel Mendoza Bojórquez,"many wholesale companies do not use an adequate control of their inventory level, and variables such as product demand tend to vary continuously due to seasonality and market trends, generating costs that reduce profitability and eventually produce customer dissatisfaction with the service offered. in this paper we propose the application of a method to reduce the level of uncertainty and risk in sales and to simulate the implementation of a policy of continuous inventory review. using the monthly demand of the wholesale company and considering the maximization of profit, the arima time series model was chosen, developed through the r programming language, and then modeled in the arena software the results of the forecast found. the relevance of the study is to present inventory improvement tools that encourage a favorable management in terms of inventory management costs.","forecasting, inventory","From the results in the previous section, it is concluded that it is feasible to optimize the inventory management process by implementing a forecast based on the ARIMA technique, since products tend to be mostly stationary. Short-term forecasting approach accompanied by an inventory policy significantly reduces the level of imbalance between demand and inventory thanks to the tools of the review model such as the reorder point, the economic lot quantity, and the replenishment period. However, this must be complemented with the implementation of the simulation software, in this case the ARENA program. In summary, this research used simulation modeling and optimization to determine the inventory policy parameters for different products. Finally, as for the practical implications of this study, the proposed improvement tools were used to encourage efficient inventory practices for companies focused on wholesale. 266","universidad de lima, facultad de ingeniería lima, perú 20183375@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20173599@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima, facultad de ingeniería lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe","References

33,Re-Engineering Of Gold Precious Metal Production Process  In Mining Companies,,,"Through the use of BPR (Business Process Reengineering) and VSM (Value Stream Mapping) tools, we can understand the existing process in the gold manufacturing industry and improve it. By creating current state mapping and future state mapping, we can increase the production of precious metal gold. This can serve as a benchmark for other companies in the precious metal gold industry. However, there are still areas that need improvement, such as automation in every process. This is because many other industries are already implementing Industry 4.0.",,
34,Overall Equipment Effectiveness-Driven Process  Improvement Through Total Productive Maintenance: Role,"customer needs for automotive products are still increasing, this has forced the automotive assembly industry to focus more on productivity and make measurement adjustments and improvements to produce products that meet customer demands and improve performance. as one of the largest automotiveare unprepareds in indonesia, pt astra honda motor faces complex problems related to increasing customer demand which is not in accordance with the plan, reducing component availability and disrupting the production process, while also causing greater performance losses, including operators who unprepared, erratic machine cycles can even be slower because they have to work not according to machine capacity, it can even cause start-up defects in machines used for production processes. all that of course resulted in quality problems becoming more frequent. the overall productivity of the integrated manufacturing system through the overall effectiveness of the equipment regardless of capabilities, and flexibility is considered insufficient as a solution to drive improvements and improve performance. therefore, pt astra honda motor must pay attention to equipment flexibility and overall equipment effectiveness (oeeflex) to address customer requests. this study aims to identify losses related to the effectiveness of the equipment as a whole and the possibility of repairs carried out by implementing equipment flexibility that can drive the repair process, this is done by looking at the planning, losses, and availability of parts by eliminating unplanned events by finding the causes and take precautions. this study provides a contextual model of overall equipment effectiveness and equipment flexibility that will help automotive assembly companies meet customer demands through customization.",,"OEE is a useful tool for increasing the implementation of the total productive maintenance (TPM) program which is carried out quantitatively, so as to create overall equipment effectiveness and minimize downtime on the HPDC 800 machine. Meanwhile, the flexibility of OEE (OEEFlex) can be continuously increased if there is involvement from management in carrying out equipment (machine) repairs, because with the involvement of repair management carried out on the HPDC process line it can be controlled properly and produce maximum results. FMEA is a method used to find the root causes of failures that occur in HPDC machines and prevent recurring failures on these machines. The OEE value can be increased if FMEA is carried out, as seen from the increase in production from 2,400 CCL to 3,600 CCL produced or an increase of 38.73% to 61.22% of CCL production. In addition, the FMEA has reduced the downtime of the three HPDC machines as a whole, from 28,152 mins to 17,170 mins.","of equipment flexibility rio prayoga kusumo and dendi p. ishak industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, jawa barat, indonesia rio.prayoga@ui.ac.id, dendi@ie.ui.ac.id",

36,Towards A Lightning Detection And Warning System In  Zambia,"lightning is essentially an electromagnetic field phenomenon that can fundamentally be characterized using scientific methods. it would interest property designers and managers to have a facility of protection against lightning for property and life and one stage to effect the protection is an ability to predict the occurrence of lightning. in one type of approach, lightning alert regions can be configured around important assets such as buildings in different locations. notifications about alerts in an area of interest can be sent via emails, sms texts to phones and user interface (ui) platforms on personal computers. the meteorology industry can leverage real-time lightning information to improve forecasting, monitoring and safety of communities. this paper uses big data from 2016 to 2022 to show how much lightning zambia experienced in the seven-year span. big data was used to detect patterns and trends around the country. big data is one common and contemporary factor that informs policy and decision in business sectors. the paper also shows how an alert region, lusaka city, can be configured in order to send alerts and warnings to the users within the city about lightning threat developments. by employing ai-based analytics the results show that zambia experienced a total of 89,826,330 lightning events from 2016 to 2022. by centering lusaka city at coordinates 15.3875 os and 28.3228 oe, 168 alerts were monitored using thunderstorm manager between 25 january 2023 and 24 february 2023. the longest lightning threat duration observed was 11 hours 20 minutes within lusaka city.","buildings, forecasting","The objectives of this paper were to determine lightning statistics and characteristics for the seven-year period from 2016 to 2022, determine the lightning strike potential zones (LSPZs) in the capital city, and to configure a lightning detection and warning system (LDWS) for Lusaka. It was determined that Zambia as a whole experiences on average 4,600,000 lightning strikes per year and this translates to a lightning flash density of 7 flashes/km2/year on average. The determined LSPZs in Lusaka were found to be more in Chawama, Kabwata and Lusaka Central constituencies than in the other four constituencies. The monitoring of the lightning threat developments (LTDs) within the capital from 25 January to 24 February 2023 showed that 13% of lightning flashes were experienced within a radius of 8 km from the town center, 42% occurred within 8-24 km radius, and 45% within the 24-48 km radius. The longest duration of LTD recorded was 11 hours 20 minutes on 8-9 February 2023. Further studies are needed to establish why the central business district experience fewer lightning events despite having the tallest buildings in the country. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Vaisala Inc. for the GLD360 data and for the configuration of Lusaka city for lightning alerts. Without this assistance, this paper would not have been possible. It must be noted that to have a region configured for lightning alerts requires an annual subscription of $6,978.00 to Vaisala Inc.

37,Core Strength Development Behaviour Of Organic And  Inorganic Binders With New And Reclaimed Foundry Sand,"foundries using organic binders like alkaline phenolic show interest in the use of inorganic binders like sodium silicate in core making and mould process. the cost of dumping waste sand from alkaline phenolic plants are more as they contain more toxic gases as compared to those of inorganic sodium silicate plants. foundries are looking into saving cost by possibly using their already existing reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant in new plants using sodium silicate. this research initiated to assist an alkaline phenolic foundry decision to use their already available reclaim sand in the new sodium silicate plant planned to build. a process for preparing foundry cores or moulds, sands and chemical resins used made available. the chemical binders consisted of inorganic binder of alkaline phenolic and an organic binder of sodium silicates with their catalysts. sand materials consisted of new silica sand and reclaimed sand from foundry alkaline phenolic moulding plant. core prepared by mixing sand with each binder and allowing them to cure at room temperature. alkaline phenolic at a 1, 5% binder addition to sand and 20% to binder of catalyst addition. for sodium silicate testing completed at 3% binder addition to sand and 10% to binder of catalyst. the curing time of 1 hour, 4 hours and 24 hours. the results showed that alkaline phenolic developed higher bending strength with new silica sand with strength of up to 32 n/cm2 than with reclaimed and 20:80 new to reclaimed sand mixture which only reach the bending strength of 15 n/cm2. alkaline phenolic developed higher tensile strength of 25 n/cm2 with reclaimed sand and 20:80 new to reclaimed sand with 20 n/cm2 than with new sand reaching only five n/cm2. in conclusion, new sand can develop strength with both alkaline phenolic and sodium silicate binders. it is difficult to develop strength with sodium silicate binder when using reclaimed sand. based on this research it not recommended the use of reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant on the new sodium silicate plant. key words sodium silicate, alkaline phenolic, self-hardening/ no bake, curing time, core 1.0 introduction in foundry production system, the more we can reuse the sand the more cost effective is the process. sand reclamation is very important as it reduces cost of production in the foundry, as new sand is expensive. recycling foundry as much as possible also reduce the cost of dumping waste sand. this research focus on of effect of sand condition on bending strength and tensile strength behaviour on self-setting sodium silicate sand binder system and alkaline phenolic sand binder system at different curing times. this research will assist the foundry to determine cost effectiveness of using their already available reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant when starting new sodium silicate plant. alkaline phenolic ester cured (organic) and sodium silicate (inorganic) system are the two chemical bonded sand systems focussed on this research 1.2 objectives to mix sand with alkaline phenolic and soidium silicate resin to produce cores for bend strength testing and tensile strength testing using the mixed sand to allow the cores to cure for different times 314",,"New silica sand can develop bending strength with both alkaline phenolic and sodium silicate binders. Higher bending strength reached with sodium silicates than alkaline phenolic when using new silica sand. Alkaline phenolic binder can develop strength with reclaimed sand and 20:80 new to reclaimed sand. It is difficult for sodium silicate to develop bending strength with reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant. Sodium silicate can develop higher tensile strength with new sand than alkaline phenolic. Alkaline phenolic can develop tensile strength with reclaimed sand and 20:80 new to reclaimed sand whereas sodium silicate struggle to develop strength with reclaimed sand. It is not advisable to use reclaimed sand from alkaline phenolic plant in the sodium silicate plant. For future, more test with different new sand to reclaimed sand ratios should be tested to see how to reduce the use of new sand. The sodium silicate samples can be cured using CO2 gas or using heat in the furnace to improve curing time. 6.0","livhuwani libunyu contract: technologist faculty of engineering and built environment sapienza – university of johannesburg-south africa technologist, metal casting technology station livhuwani.libunyu@gmail.com farai banganayi contract station engineer faculty of engineering and built environment sapienza – university of johannesburg-south africa station engineer, metal casting technology station fcbanganayi@uj.ac.za",
38,Score Card Utility Matrix For Prioritization Of Asphalt  Paved Road Maintenance Projects,"accessibility to social and economic amenities and the provision of a crucial link between production and consumption make transportation infrastructure one of the most crucial factors for a nation's development. this is especially true for landlocked nations like zambia, which depend on a vast network of both public paved and unsurfaced roads. poorly maintained roads lead to both macro and micro economic losses, and this study focuses on sustainable prioritization of asphalt-paved road maintenance projects. regardless of how well-designed or constructed they are, all pavements deteriorate over time because of the combined effects of traffic loads and the environment which could lead to huge costs of repair and rehabilitation if not addressed effectively. maintenance treatments slow down the degradation process and so extend the pavement life. the choice of which public road to maintain is a challenging decision that governmental agencies must make that can be addressed by taking a multi-criteria decision-making approach. this study answers the question of which public roads to sustainably prioritize for maintenance considering decision-criteria subject to factors that include physical, climate resilience, socio-economic and environment aspects addressing an african’s concern. in this study, the authors establish the importance of decision-criteria aspects and develop a score card utility matrix as an objective decision-making tool. in developing this score-card, the authors rely on semi-structured questionnaire guides and analytic hierarchy process (ahp) structured questionnaire approaches in data collection, while adopting a combined ahp and utility matrix approach in developing a score card assessment tool.","decision-criteria, pavement, prioritization, marai et al. 2021",,"kelvin agabu lungu, chabota kaliba , ph.d. and erastus mwanaumo, ph.d. department of civil and environmental engineering university of zambia lusaka, zambia lungukelvin91@gmail.com, chabota.kaliba@gmail.com, erastus.mwanaumo@unza.zm pumza mpundu school of civil engineering university of leeds leeds, uk mpundupumza@gmail.com","References

39,Sustainable Airport Planning: Applications For African  Airports,"sustainability is a topical issue in the global air transport sector. there is consensus among global air transport stakeholders that the current air transport systems will not be sustainable in the future. as such, there is a call for action to develop more sustainable air transport infrastructure including airports, airlines, air traffic control, air navigation systems and other supporting infrastructure. among the challenges aviation and aerospace managers face today is defining sustainability. one of the most widely used definitions of sustainability was developed by the united nations world commission on environment and development (wced) also known as the brundtland commission who defined sustainability as the ability to meet our current needs without comprising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. notably, there is no one universally accepted definition of sustainability specifically for the air transport or airport sectors. globally, various government agencies and transport organizations have dedicated resources to the development of sustainable airport infrastructure. for instance, in 2010, the federal aviation administration (faa), the united states civil aviation industry regulator launched the sustainable master plan airport improvement program (aip) grant to fund airports of all sizes across the united states to support development of airport sustainability planning documents. the first of its kind, the faa sustainable master plan aip grant has funded 44 airports in the united states as of 2022. of these, six airports are classified as small hub airports in the united states national plan of integrated airport systems (npias). small hub airports are primary commercial airports that handle more than 10,000 enplanements annually, similar in operation to most commercial airports located in major african cities like nairobi, lagos, johannesburg, addis ababa, etc. using the multiple case study methodology, the author will analyze the sustainability management plans prepared by the six us small hub airports and find areas of application in african airports. the author hypothesizes that there are approaches to sustainable airport planning that are transferrable for applications in african airports based on similarities in the number of operations between airports in the two geographic regions and the ease of adoption of selected sustainability projects. the expected results will show the lessons learned from development and incorporating sustainability principles in airport planning from the perspective of us airports and provide recommendation for sustainable airport planning in african airports.","sustainability, airports planning, dr. johnson. 330",,"caroline k. marete, ph.d. visiting assistant professor school of aviation and transportation technology purdue university west lafayette, in. usa. cmarete@purdue.edu",
40,469,"zimbabwe is considered as one of the developing countries in africa. analytical statistics show that as the country will be developing, the power demand in that country will also increase. currently, the amount of the power that is being generated in zimbabwe is lower than that required for consumption. the power utility company in zimbabwe, zesa, prefers load shedding when such a scenario that consumption exceeds generation occurs. load shedding can be an intentionally engineered electrical power outage where electricity supply is stopped for non-overlapping period over a particular zone. currently, load shedding is done manually where an electrician will be assigned a task to go to the substations and isolate as well as restore power when the intended period of the shedding is reached. this has never been an effective method since it doesn’t allow operations to be done effectively in emergency scenarios which is leading to equipment failure. this has also caused a lot of accidents to the operators since the reclosers are prone to many hazards such as explosions and arcs when being operated. this paper is intended to phase out manual load operations and allow load operations to be performed remotely using low cost gsm module or rtc technology that if the period of shedding is foreknown, the system can be hardcoded so that it will isolate power and restore power when the set period is reached automatically.",isfahan,,"automated load shedding with remote feeder control system using gsm for zetdc network takawira cuthbert njenda, joseph mudare, munyaradzi munochiveyi, trymore pawandiwa department of electrical and electronics engineering, university of zimbabwe (uz); tnjenda@eng.uz.ac.zw; josephmudare@yahoo.com; mmunochiveyi@gmail.com; tmpawandiwa@gmail.com edward chikuni professor department of electrical and electronics engineering botho university, botswana chikuni@yahoo.com",
41,A Swot Analysis Of Smart Cities Frameworks  Portia Mupfumira,"during the last decade, the name smart city has been trending around the world playing a role in urban strategic planning. the concept has been recently introduced to embrace and contain modern urban challenges (dameri, 2017). chatterjee and kar, (2015) said that the smart city definition varies concerning the context and perspective through which it is being conceptualised and applied. after a comprehensive literature review; yin et al., (2015) defined it as ‘a system integration of technological infrastructure that relies on advanced data processing with goals of making city governance that more efficient, citizens happier, business more prosperous and the environment more stable’. this is based on technical infrastructure, application domain, system integration and data processing. smart cities contribute to urban sustainability, this urban sustainability relies on several elements and their mutual relationships, including natural resources, human, technological, social and cultural. interactions of these have the economic growth, social equity and environmental issues. in their assessment of how future studies will be applied to cities, miguel et al., (2016) noted that long-term planning for modern cities is difficult due to the increased complexity and diverse nature of the cities that rise due to cities’ operational processes and diversity. since cities differ from country to country and city to city the inception of smart cities has seen flooding of the literature with a plethora of frameworks. in order to develop a sustainable smart city, one needs to make no mistake in choosing the correct framework to work with, hence the purpose of this research is to carry out a swot analysis on different smart cities frameworks.","swot analysis, harare",,"namibia university of science and technology windhoek, namibia pmupfumira@hit.ac.zw professor michael mutingi, ph.d. namibia university of science and technology windhoek, namibia mmutingi@nust.na",
42,The Effect Of Reverse Logistics Practices On Economic  Performance: A Case Study Of Simba Breweries,"the subject of reverse logistics has grown exponentially due to an increase in production and consumption activities. companies are now more pressurized by regulatory bodies to be more responsible in dealing with the environment and producing their products. reverse logistics has been proven to be an effective and efficient way to deal with the environment and optimize the performance of organizations. however, this concept is often misunderstood and many companies still don’t realize the benefits of implementing it in the operation of their businesses. academic research in this field is limited, especially in the context of the republic democratic of congo. they are no studies conducted to evaluate the effect of reverse logistics practices on the economic performance of companies, this is the case of the manufacturing companies such as simba breweries in particular. the gap has been identified and should be filled by researchers. the study aimed at evaluating the economic benefits of the reverse logistics system at simba breweries. for this, a descriptive research design was followed and data was collected through a questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. the results indicate that there was a positive and significant correlation between reuse practice and the economic benefit of the company with a correlation and regression coefficient of 0.91 and 3.38. the study identified the economic benefit of implementing rl practices. reuse practice decreases the cost of production by 65% and increased the profitability of the company by 60%. more research is needed to investigate feather the implementation of other practices of this system.","reverse logistics, reuse, remanufacturing, recycling","The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the reverse logistics system on the economic performance of the company. To conclude, the results from Tables 1, 2, and 3 indicate that the company had a reverse logistics system in place in which only the reuse practice was implemented out of the three practices considered in this study with an overall mean of 3.60 and a standard deviation of 0.113. Results in Table 4 indicated that the reverse logistics practice implemented by the company increases brings economic benefits to the company as the grand mean found was 3.69. Tables 7 and 8 indicate that reuse practice had a positive and strong correlation with the economic performance of the company, a unit increase in the reuse practice resulted in an increase of 0.38 in the economic performance of the company. The study also indicated that the reuse practice decreased the cost of production by 65% and increased the profitability of the company by 60%. However, remanufacturing and recycling did not have any correlation with the performance of the company as they were not implemented. In Table 5 the study found that the high cost related to the implementation of the RL system, the lack of the implementation of IT solutions, the lack of collaboration with partners in the Supply Chain, the lack of government implication in green, and the product return are the biggest challenges faced by the company. There is a need of conducting more research on the topic of reverse logistics in general, especially in African countries, and the focus should be on its economic benefits on the performance of manufacturing companies and other RL practices. The study contributed to the body of knowledge and covered the gap by focusing on the evaluation of the economic benefits of this system on a manufacturing company in the RDC. Firms in this industry should focus on the implementation of the reuse RL practice and open doors to other practices of the system to maximize the benefits. The study was limited to one company in the brewery industry of Lubumbashi/DRC and considered only three practices of the system. Further research can pick it from here and include many companies and other practices.","alex lumba and bupe getrude mwanza postgraduate student, associate director and senior lecturer graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia lumbakis.al@gmail.com, bupe.mwanza@gmail.com, getrude.mutono-mwanza@unza.zm",
43,Digital Transformation Capability Maturity Framework For  Digital Audit Readiness In Public Sector (Case Study),"digital readiness is the organizational readiness to face digitalization. the development of digital audit must be balanced with digital readiness. organizations can use a specific capability maturity model to assess their existing position in relation to the adoption of digital audit readiness measures and receive help in advancing to the required level of implementation of relevant capabilities. this study looks at how such a model might help integrate measures linked to digital audit readiness and aid in achieving the right degree of maturity. based on four digital transformation process categories: internal policy and governance, information and technology, digital process transformation, and human resource management, the implementation of digital audit readiness has been evaluated. five maturity levels describe the various phases of implementing digital audit readiness measures (incomplete, performed, managed, established, predictable, and innovating). aligning it governance frameworks can assist implement digital audit readiness. to determine whether an organization is prepared for digital transformation, it is necessary to assess its readiness for a digital audit. the results of the digital audit readiness assessment will show problems with how digital audit transformation is being used. sub-criteria that have a low level of maturity and high global weight can later be prioritized for increasing audit readiness.",digital readiness,"The development of an integrated digital audit must be followed by digital readiness. In this study, capability maturity models or frameworks are used to assess digital readiness. The capability maturity frameworks combine the DX-CMM and Indonesian regulations. This model is the ""digital transformation capability maturity framework"" (DX-CMF), which has four aspects: internal policy and governance (IP), information and technology (IT), digital process transformation (DP), and human resource management (HR). Using established standards that have been approved by professionals, maturity is evaluated. The final outcome of the maturity assessment will be used to determine levels of digital readiness.

45,Analytical Factors For The South African Foundry Industry:  A Benchmarking Study,"the south african foundry industry is in a state of decline. from 2010 to 2020, almost 37 foundries were closed, resulting in 123 operational foundries from 160 foundries. a benchmarking study was done using analytical factors to determine how competitive sa (south africa) foundries were compared to those in other countries. notably, an attempt was made to map the analytical factors, such as capacity utilisation, labour productivity, process yield, and energy cost, of sa foundries and compare them to chinese foundries. questionnaires were formulated to acquire primary data from sa foundries and china. in south africa, 11 out of 14 foundries responded to the questionnaires administered through face-to-face interviews, whereas in china, one out of three foundries responded through email. on average, data from sa foundries indicate that they are uncompetitive in gating systems, scrap casting, labour productivity, capacity utilisation, and energy costs. in conclusion, based on these analytical factors, chinese foundry has a competitive edge over sa foundries and the eu; consequently, buyers may prefer to acquire casting from china due to lower production cost, which translates into cheaper casting. it is recommended that sa foundries invest in upskilling their workforces, adopt casting simulation software, and participate in energy efficiency programmes to improve their competitiveness.","benchmarking, gating systems, scrap casting","The study provided the analytic factors benchmarked with Chinese foundry. The analytic factors of process yield include gating system, scrap/reject casting, labour productivity, capacity utilisation and energy cost. All the derived analytical factors show that the Chinese foundry has an average competitive edge over SA foundries. However, they are some exceptions where some SA foundries are compared on their best performance. As a result of this analytic factor, it demonstrated why most buyers would prefer to purchase casting from China than in South Africa. Chinese foundries provide higher process yield (less gating systems, less scrap casting), higher labour productivity, higher capacity utilisation, and lower energy costs. This factor results in lower production costs and more profitable business, which gives leverage to cheaper casting than the competitors. The main aspect that SA foundries need to focus on is the upskilling of employees, which will assist in reducing casting rejection and producing more good casting, adoption of a simulation package to optimise the liquid metal casting, and energy efficiency practices, which will assist in reducing the energy consumption. The capacity utilisation will be realised by a localisation programme which will assist foundries in the increase in orders to allow better capacity utilisation. South Africa has the potential to save their local foundries if attention is given to the analytical factor provided in order to compete with Chinese foundries, which are flooding the market with cheaper casting. 6.","kulani mageza, boitshoko kaelo sedumedi and xiaowei pan metal casting technology station faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa kmageza@uj.ac.za, bksedumedi@gmail.com, xpan@uj.ac.za",
46,Adopting Lean Principles For Cost Saving And  Waste Minimization In Manhole Construction And,"lean-based sustainability refers to studying and analyzing a current process and improving it. the process can be improved by indicating the non-value-added activities that delay the process and eliminating, combining, or simplifying these non-value-added activities. in this manner, waste has been reduced to a minimum, and overall process efficiency and customer satisfaction are augmented. the paper aims to oversee the current process of manhole construction and work in a manner to reduce the time taken, materials used, and general resource wastes. specifically, it has been observed that the manhole backfilling process can be broken down into key activities. the process can be improved and made more efficient by linking lean-based tools to sustainability. the results have revealed that the overall process time and total lead time have been improved by around 17.6% and 41.2%, respectively. furthermore, waste production has been significantly reduced by approximately 83.5%. the waste mentioned above reduction percentage has been obtained without sacrificing or compromising the quality and standards.","lean construction, sustainability","and Recommendation This paper presented a lean-based methodology for enhancing the sustainability performance of one of the major processes for Manhole construction, the backfilling process. Non-value-added activities have been identified and reduced waste to a minimum by combining, eliminating, or simplifying the actions taken. In turn, the process’s overall duration and the drastic saving of material utilization have decreased, which works hand-in-hand with the sustainability concept without compromising the standards and quality of work being done. Cost reduction was also a major factor in optimizing this process rather than the traditional backfilling procedure. Continuous improvement by implementing these methodologies on a larger scale will incentivize a more sustainable construction process. However, there is much more room for improving the process, and further analysis is needed for continuous development and improvements. Using different eco-efficiency indicators to assess the proposed approach is a future research trend; for instance, Abdella et al. (2020, 2021); Kucukvar et al. (2020); Kutty et al.

47,Impact Of Operations Strategy On Business Performance:  A Case Study Of Lusaka Business & Technical College,"the study aimed at investigating the impact of operations strategy on business performance at lusaka business and technical college in the last 5 years to address challenges that the institution was facing. a descriptive case study design with a target population of 150 respondents was considered. a sample size of 75 was stratified into; top management, middle management, academic staff, administration staff, regulators, industry partners and clients. purposive sampling method was used to arrive at the sample by identifying members of the population who were willing to be in the study. primary data was collected using self-administered likert type questionnaires. secondary data was collected from physical and online publications and other sources the collected data was processed and analyzed with the aid of “statistical package for social sciences (spss)” version 26. the results were presented in tables and figures. regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses at 0.05 significant level (β =0.808, f =28.281, r=0.808, r2=0.382, p < 0.05). test results showed that operations strategy has an impact on business performance. the financial impact was also established with average income growth of 1 million and 2 million kwacha before and after implementation. the income made the institution finance its operations better than before. contribution to the country’s economic growth is by improving labor productivity through technology. the results revealed that operations strategy has an impact on business performance. the study recommends that technical institutions formulate and implement operations strategies that are market-centered and can contribute to business performances.",operations strategy,"The financial records from audit reports during the study period indicated that the impact of operations strategy was practically determined with an increase in income from 1M to 2M kwacha before and after implementation respectively. The theoretical results of the study showed that training institutions should be involved in analyzing operations strategies in order to evaluate their impact on business performance, analyzing OS and their impact on BP brings positive benefits, employees are aware of OS strategies of the institution, Stakeholders are aware of the impact of OS on institution performance, some of LBTC strategic objectives have been implemented, LBTC interacts with stakeholder groups such as employees, students, the board, the authority TEVETA, EIZ,GIZ, industry, Ministry of Technology and Science and other cooperating partners, LBTC standards are established and verified by the regulatory authority TEVETA, financial impact of analyzing and implementing OS is experienced both in the short and long term, and implementation of strategic objectives is the responsibility of all employees. This further implies that operations strategies have an impact on business performance at LBTC. It was also established that LBTC in collaboration with GIZ has made a contribution towards the growth of the economy through the training and upskilling of technical labor force from informal and formal sectors respectively. This is in conformity with other research findings in section 2.4 which established that there is a linear relationship between operations strategy and business performance. This suggests that operations strategy can be applied to any form of business ranging from domestic business setups up to big business corporations, social groupings and/or organizations. 7. Recommendation The study recommends that institutions formulate and implement operations strategy if they are to remain competitive in the business environment since there is sufficient evidence that there is a linear relationship between the two variables. Further studies are however recommended that will determine the performance of college graduates from an industry perspective. We also recommend that further studies be conducted to analyze skills gap between college graduates and industry so that necessary interventions can be made to narrow that gap and increase production levels. 8. Limitations of the study The first limitation of the study came with the collection of primary data from the respondents especially those from industry, cooperating partners and regulators. Most of them indicated that they were very busy with their work schedules and the researcher allowed them to attend to the questionnaire willingly at their convenient time because any form of forcing could have contravened with ethical issues of the study. However, this created a delay 384","bizeck obster daka graduate student graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia bizeckdaka@yahoo.com bupe getrude mwanza associate director and senior lecturer graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia bupe.mwanza@gmail.com, getrude.mwanza-mutono@unza.zm","References

48,Dependent And Independent Variables For Exploratory  Analysis Of Road Traffic Accidents,"road safety is an interesting and complicating field. according to the world health organization (who), approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes, and between 20 to 50 million are injured, 93% of the world's fatalities on the roads occur in low- and middle-income countries, even though these countries have approximately 60% of the world's vehicles. the young are particularly vulnerable on the world’s roads and road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5-29 (who, 2021). first, the consequences of these numbers are reflected in families' pain, human tragedy, shattered destinies, and lives. then in the economic situation of the country and its health services. road traffic safety refers to the methods and measures used to prevent road users from being killed or seriously injured. despite decades of research, this continues to be debated due to the factors associated with it such as road users’ factors, environmental factors, road conditions, and economic factors, so forth. exploratory data analysis (eda) is an important stage when it comes to understanding data and extracting useful information. several analyses have been conducted in order to better understand the factors most affecting road traffic accidents (rta) and reveal hidden information that can give insights to road stakeholders and law enforcement to take some preventive actions against accidents. among the most important part in eda is to determine the dependent and independent variables which make the data interpretation better and obvious. this paper presents some dependent and independent variables of road accident and the metrics for measuring the traffic accident severity.","road safety, rta, eda",,"hamza khyara, professor aouatif amine and bouchra nassih national school of applied sciences university of ibn tofail kenitra, morocco hamza.khyara@uit.ac.ma, aouatif.amine@uit.ac.ma, nassih.bouchra@univ-ibntofail.ac.ma",

50,Small And Medium Scale Farming In Zambia: A  Competitive Analysis,"the agricultural sector in zambia has been described as the backbone of the economy. it contributes to the country’s gdp, national exports and employs most of the population. the agricultural sector in zambia is dominated by small and medium scale farmers who are mostly located in the rural areas. due to the importance role played by the small and medium scale farmers in zambia, it is necessary to conduct a competitive analysis to assess their competitive environment. michael porters five forces model was used in the analysis. in assessing the competitive environment of the agricultural sector, this analysis focuses on small and medium scale farming with reference to the crop sub sector and focusing on the major crop -maize. the analysis was informed by secondary data sources from peer reviewed journal articles and professional reports about the agricultural sector in zambia. thematic analysis was used to analyze the data in line with michael porter’s five forces framework. the findings indicate that the threat of new entrants to small and medium scale farming is relatively high due to lack of barriers of entry and supportive government programs for the farmers, the barging power of buyers is relatively high because buyers are often fewer and buy in large volumes which makes them more powerful than the small and medium scale farmers. the bargaining power of suppliers is also high as the small and medium- scale farmers are mostly dependent on subsidies due to the financial constraints that they face. key words small and medium scale farming, competitive analysis, michael porter five forces, agriculture sector and zambia. 1. introduction the agricultural sector plays an enormous role in the economy of zambia and is said to be the backbone of the economy. the agricultural sector contributes approximately 12% to the national exports earnings and to the country’s gross domestic (gdp) (policy monitoring and research centre (pmrc) 2021). the agricultural sector is arguably the main source of income and employment for much of the population in zambia. the agricultural sector employs 70% of the labour force and provides a livelihood for most people living in the rural part of zambia (pmrc2021; mwando 2022). the agricultural sector in zambia is dominated by small and medium scale farmers who are mostly located in the rural parts of the country. the small and medium scale farmers supply about 80% of the domestic food in zambia (world food program 2020). it can thus be observed that the small and medium scale farmers in zambia play an important role in the economic development of the country and as such it is important to conduct a competitive analysis of the industry. the competitive analysis done through michael porters framework highlights how attractive the industry is from the eyes of the small and medium scale farmers. michael porter’s five forces has been used by several researchers to analyze the competitive environment of various industries (yunna and yisheng 2014; rajasekar and raee 2013). assessment of the agriculture industry in zambia in the context of the small and medium scale farmers is vital because of their contribution to the economy and it can help to devise strategies that benefit the small and medium scale farmers in zambia. © ieom society international 389",,"and Recommendations Based on secondary data this paper conducted a competitive analysis of the small and medium scale farmers using Michael porters five forces model. The results show that the threat of new entrants is relatively high. This is because there are so significant barriers to entry as small and medium scale farming is not mechanized in Zambia. The government policy of FISP and FRA can also be viewed as encouraging factors rather than restricting entry. The barging power of buyers and suppliers is relatively high and outnumber the buyers who mostly impose the buying price. As for suppliers, the small and medium scale farmers’ financial constraints bring about challenges of accessing farming inputs. When it comes to the threat of substitutes, small and medium scale farmers mostly cultivate maize which is a staple food in Zambia and thus a crop may not have much threat of substitution. However, the threat of substitution can be looked at from the point of view of the other players in the industry who also cultivate the same product and offer it to the market. Threat of substation comes from large and commercial farmers who have more resources to package and reach out to the markets. The results of the five forces analysis suggest that the small and medium scale farmers do not benefit the most out of their farming activities. It can be argued that from the small and medium scale farmer’s perspective, the profitability is on the low side as it appears that the farmers are at the mercy of the buyers and suppliers who exert more influence on them. That being the case, the small and medium scale farmers need more support in terms of adequate farming inputs (which are normally in short supply or delayed) and cost reflective prices which absorbs their cost of production. The small and medium scale farmer’s views should be considered when the floor price for commodities such as maize is being determined. Since the small and medium scale farmers account for a larger proportion to the provision of food security and employment, there is need to ensure that their challenges such as access to credit, market and fair prices are in improved. The government as well as the private sector should offer agricultural credit at lower interest rates to the small and medium scale farmers. This has potential to boost their faring activities as they will be able to meet some of their farming requirements such as farming inputs. 5 Limitations This study has some limitations. Firstly, this study is based on secondary data of peer reviewed articles, professional reports, and websites. It would be great to conduct a Five forces analysis using primary data such as a survey or interviews with small and medium scale farmers. Secondly this study only looked at small and medium scale farmers in crop production with particular emphasis on maize. Future studies can look at the other sub sectors of the agriculture industry or the whole industry analysis.","maureen lupunga malesu, pavel syrovátka faculty of business and management mendel university brno, czech maureenmalesu@gmail.com benjamin kaira graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia kbenmav1979@gmail.com",
51,Identification And Evaluation Of The Accident Prevention  Practices Utilized In The Zambian Construction Industry,"the construction industry is a hazardous field, with a high risk of accidents due to the nature of the work involved. these accidents range in severity from minor to major injuries and even fatalities, leading to a growing need for occupational health and safety measures. this study therefore aimed to identify and evaluate the accident prevention practices utilized in the construction industry in zambia. the study used a mixed-method approach that included semi- structured interviews and a survey questionnaire, with a sample population consisting of national council for construction (ncc) - registered local contractors in grades 1 and 2, including both employers (contractors) and employees (workers) working on construction projects in lusaka, zambia. the study found that common accident prevention practices in the zambian construction industry included safety training and orientation, the provision and proper use of personal protective equipment (ppe), safety inspections, strict safety enforcement, and the provision of safe working conditions and environments. the research is essential in providing useful information for policymakers, stakeholders, and practitioners in the construction industry in zambia, by identifying effective accident prevention practices that can be adopted to improve safety in the workplace.",accidents,"The research identified and evaluated the accident preventive practices common to the Zambian construction industry as safety training and induction, provision and proper use of PPE, provision of safe and healthy working environments, safety inspections and enforcement. Furthermore, the study categorized these practices into three main groups for simplicity purposes namely: accident control measures, safety audits and inspections and shared expectations in the construction companies. It is important to note that the research focused on large construction companies, which may introduce a bias in relation to company size and safety practices. However, other studies, have suggested that company size is not necessarily a determinant of safety climate. Therefore, the findings of the study are still relevant and important for improving safety practices in the Zambian construction industry. The low levels of adherence to reporting accidents, injuries, near misses, and illnesses on construction sites identified in the study are concerning. It is important for employers to create a culture of safety where workers feel comfortable reporting incidents without fear of retribution. This can be achieved through education and training, clear reporting procedures, and effective investigation and follow-up. Overall, the study highlights the need for ongoing vigilance and improvement in safety practices on construction sites to prevent accidents and protect the health and safety of workers.","charity kamwale and penjani hopkins nyimbili department of civil and environmental engineering and geomatic engineering university of zambia lusaka, zambia kamwalec@gmail.com, penjani.nyimbili@unza.zm wellington didibhuku thwala professor, department of civil engineering, college of science, engineering and technology university of south africa (unisa) pretoria, 0003, south africa thwaladw@unisa.ac.za erastus misheng’u mwanaumo head, department of civil and environmental engineering university of zambia lusaka, zambia university of south africa (unisa) pretoria, south africa erastus.mwanaumo@unza.zm",
52,Assessing The Last Mile Delivery Logistics Of The Zambia  Medicines And Medical Supplies Agency,"transportation is crucial in the delivery of medicines and medical equipment world over. in africa, the challenge of poor road infrastructure and limited options of delivery channels restrict delivery to road transportation. in zambia, the zambia medicines, and medical supplies agency (zammsa), faces these challenges to deliver medicine to the last mile. it would be useful to know how exactly zammsa has responded to the logistical challenges that relate to last mile system. therefore, the main objective for this research was to evaluate the last mile delivery logistics process performance at zammsa, to investigate challenges of the transportation system in use in relation the last mile delivery process, to assess the last mile delivery performance at zammsa and to address any challenges pertinent to transportation. a quantitative approach was used, and data was collected using semi-structured questionnaires. purposive sampling technique was adopted and 50 employees from zammsa were selected. the data was presented through tables, graphs and charts and standard deviation was used to analyse the responses. data was analysed using microsoft excel. the main findings of the research were that zammsa uses a combined transportation system of own and outsourced vehicles and the challenges of the last mile system at zammsa lead to operational inefficiencies. the implication of these results is that the last mile logistics system is particularly ideal for organisations that pursue the profit-making objective. however, the last mile system can still be used by any logistics organisation to improve efficiency in the supply chain. to improve efficiency and the operation of the last mile system at zammsa, it was recommended that staff be trained to understand how the concept is operationalized. key words cross-docking, last mile, logistics, medicine, supply chain management 1. introduction globally last mile logistics is an emerging research area with growing interest from scholars and practitioners, especially over the past five years (cárdenas, et. al., 2017). the mainstay of the health system stems from a well- organized supply chain of vaccines, medicines delivery, and other health commodities. in developing countries, health product supply chains are characterised with many problems which negatively affects the overall health care system (yadav, 2015). transportation in logistics management is a fundamental part of the supply chain of goods and services from the point of origination to the destination (tseng et. al., 2014). multi-national companies such as coca-cola and international pharmaceuticals such as johnson & johnson, novartis and bayer have demonstrated how they depend on a reliable transport system for their deliveries. (tseng et. al., 2014). further, change in techniques and management concepts increases moving load, distribution speed, and quality of service, running costs, facilities usage, and energy savings therefore making transportation to be a key aspect of logistics utilization (ibid). proceedings of the 4th african international conference on industrial engineering and operations management lusaka, zambia, april 4-6, 2023 © ieom society international 407",,"The study concluded that ZAMMSA uses a combination of own fleet and outsourced third party logistics. Last Mile activity was also found to be quite challenging due to the lack of proper addresses of facilities, thus leading to slow rate of delivery of health commodities to the Last Mile. Last Mile delivery system at ZAMMSA has improved operations due to an increase in the number of vehicles, but it has come with increased operational costs. One factor affecting the performance of the Last Mile logistical delivery system at ZAMMSA was the lack of training and development for staff in the logistics department. Efficiencies of the system could be improved with training that will bridge the existing knowledge gap identified among the logistical staff. 6. Recommendations In line with the research objectives, it is therefore recommended that: 1. Zambia Medicines and Medical Supplies Agency invests in other transportation systems that would enhance the effectiveness of the Last Mile delivery system. Airfreight logistics for the Last Mile was found to be a feasible option in South Africa, Nigeria and Uganda (Dube & Shivanandan, 2016); 2. Improvement to vehicle scheduling and routing could be a way to increase the efficiencies of the Last Mile delivery at ZAMMSA. Vehicle routing for the Last Mile is challenging and hard, yet is is thought to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs (Gevaers et al., 2014); 3. Zambia Medicines and Medical Supplies Agency invests in training and development for its logistics staff so that the knowledge gap is reduced. This would increase operational efficiencies as was also suggested by Nakagawa and Beale, (2019); Since Last Mile delivery is such an important phenomenon in transport and logistics, further research in the field is recommended. As such, this study recommends further study on: 1. Ways to improve efficiency in the Last Mile delivery system 2.

54,Determining Factors Influencing Disaster Consciousness In  The Philippines: A Multiple Regression Approach,"natural disasters are among the most destructive occurrences that pose a substantial risk to individuals, property, the economy, and so on. flooding, which is produced by typhoons, monsoons, and excessive rainfall, is one of the most frequent natural disasters and has been one of the philippines’ main concerns in recent years. the findings of the study will give information on the elements influencing flood disaster preparedness. an online survey questionnaire was deployed among filipino participants to gather data pertinent to disaster preparedness through multiple regression. results show that significant factors are age (p-value = 0.000), gender (p-value = 0.034), province/city (p-value = 0.000), type of residential homes (p-value = 0.000), risk perception (rp) (p-value = 0.000), media (m) (p-value = 0.000), personal experience (pe) (p-value = 0.000), perceived severity (ps) (p-value = 0.000), perceived vulnerability (pv) (p-value = 0.000), attitude toward the behavior (atb) (p-value = 0.000), social norms (sn) (p- value = 0.000), perceived behavioral control (pbc) (p-value = 0.000), and intention to follow (itf) (p-value = 0.000). the researchers were able to determine the perceived preventions of disaster preparedness and mitigation in the philippines' flood-prone areas. this study has successfully provided findings that can be utilized by the academe or government leaders in implementing determining factors that may affect a person’s preparedness for flooding.","natural disasters, flooding, readiness, philippines",,"bianca danielle c. bornilla, ranice ysabelle b. ang, john karol f. angeles, justine lian p. fabia and yoshiki b. kurata department of industrial engineering university of santo tomas españa blvd., 1015, manila, philippines biancadanielle.bornilla.eng@ust.edu.ph, raniceysabelle.ang.eng@ust.edu.ph, johnkarol.angeles.eng@ust.edu.ph, justinelian.fabia.eng@ust.edu.ph, ybkurata@ust.edu.ph",
55,The Effect Of Exchange Rate On Stock Market  Capitalisation In The Zambian Capital Market,"in recent years the performance of most african capital markets has shown a downward trend, zambia included. the lusaka stock exchange stock price index performed the worst, dropping 26.83% in local currency by the end of 2016. this study sought to find out the effect of exchange rate on stock market capitalisation. the time sample that was used in this study was a yearly time series that span from 1994 to 2017, thus representing 23 observations from each zmw/usd exchange rate and market capitalisation. multiple regression analysis was performed using the johansen cointegration test and the vector error correction model (vecm), where market capitalisation was used as the dependent variable while exchange rate, inflation rate and gdp were used as the independent variables. all the findings were conducted to test whether f-test statistic hold at 5% level of significance and these were done using e-views, statistical software package. the probability rejection rule of p value < 0.05 indicating relationship between variables, the research results with a probability of 0.0416 and 0.0440 shows that there is a long run relationship between valuables. while the study also found a negative relationship between exchange rate and stock market capitalisation, that the coefficient of - 0.109843 indicates that the stock value decreases by 10.98 percent for any one percent depreciation of the kwacha against the dollar. hence, this suggests that the depreciation of the exchange rate negatively affects the performance of the lusaka stock market capitalisation. gdp also showed a negative effect of exchange rate on gdp implying that for any one percent depreciation of the currency, gdp decreases by -54.15879. the results for inflation rate also showed a negative relationship between exchange rate and inflation. inflation rate of -20.7728 showed a negative effect. if the currency depreciates by any one percent change, inflation changes by - 20.7728.. therefore, this study recommends that the bank of zambia, ministry of finance and mines to adopt policies that can lead to boosting the economy via an increase in productivity so as to ensure an increase in foreign exchange earnings in the country. these policies may include a predictable and non-discriminatory regulatory environment and an absence of undue administrative impediments to business more generally. hence, ensuring that there is public sector transparency, which may include an impartial system of courts and law enforcement penned at redressing the tax system that could constitute eliminating barriers to attracting more firms to participate in the capital market. generally, development in financial inclusion in the financial system will encourage both foreign and domestic capital flows. therefore, the more foreign currency inflows in the country the better will be the performance of the stock market which will ultimately result in an increase of values all shares on the stock market.",exchange rate,"From the research conducted, the findings conclude that a negative and significant relationship between exchange rate and stock market capitalisation both in the long run exists. The coefficient of -0.109843 indicates that the stock value decreases by 10.98 percent for any one percent depreciation of the Kwacha against the dollar. The gross domestic product and inflation also shows a similar trend, GDP and Inflation decreases by -54.15879 and- 20.7728 respectively showing a negative but significant relationship. Therefore, the study contributes to relevant existing theory and practice by advancing a proactive possible solution to the effect of exchange rate on stock market capitalisation. Hence, according to the results, there is need for a careful review of the tax system and policy administration in Zambia that could constitute eliminating barriers to attracting more firms to participate in the capital market. Generally, development in financial inclusion in the financial system will encourage both foreign and domestic capital flows. Therefore, the more foreign currency inflows in the country the better will be the performance of the stock market which will ultimately result in an increase of values all shares on the stock market.","obed shiyunga student researcher (phd) graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia oshiyunga@gmail.com",
56,Relationship Between Procurement Management And  Project Performance Of Public Infrastructure Projects At The,"the objective of the study is to determine the effect of procurement management on project performance as little research has been conducted on this topic regarding government institutions in zambia. the researcher determined that contract management at the ministry of infrastructure, housing and urban development (mihud) was not adequate as most of the respondents felt they had adequate training and personnel in contract management despite the project management challenges being faced by the ministry in zambia. a quantitative research design was adopted. primary data was collected using structured self-administered questionnaires on employees involved in the procurement and project management of public infrastructure. the constructs in this study were developed using measurement scales adopted from prior studies. the instrument was evaluated for reliability and validity. quantitative data were analyzed to determine any statistical relationships that affect project performance due to procurement. the coding of data was done for ease of data interpretation. data were analyzed using spss version 20. the result of this study showed that all the procurement management variables for the research have a significant effect on project performance. procurement planning and bid solicitation had a positive correlation and contract management had a negative correlation based on the study’s findings. finally, it was recommended to give due attention to all the stages of procurement management and give contract management training to both procurement staff and project managers. the researcher recommends future researchers consider a larger sample size, other variables that are not included in this study, and other government ministries and quasi-government institutions to get more reliable results. 445",,,"ministry of infrastructure housing and urban development in zambia (mihud) mark zulu postgraduate school university of lusaka lusaka, zambia zulumark93@gmail.com funmilayo caroline jayeola department of civil and environmental engineering university of zambia lusaka, zambia funmilayocaro@gmail.com ayodeji emmanuel oke department of quantity surveying federal university of technology akure, nigeria emayok@gmail.com erastus misheng’u mwanaumo department of civil and environmental engineering university of zambia and university of south africa (unisa) lusaka, zambia and pretoria, south africa erastus.mwanaumo@unza.zm","References
