0,The Effect Of Background Music On Immersion In Virtual  Social Game Experience,"background music is one of inseparable and indispensable elements in video games. it is considered as one of the aesthetic elements that contributes to players’ enjoyment. this research is a part of ludo-musicology studies, which aims to investigate the effect of background music on the players’ immersion, including sense of spatial presence, and emotions during the game. participants were assigned in groups to play the same virtual social game experience (vsge) two times – one time with their headphones on, and the second time without any headphones. every game lasted for 15-20 minutes. after the experiments, participants were asked to fill questionnaires to compare both experiences regarding the immersion, spatial presence, and the emotions they feel during the game using likert scales. to validate the participants’ answers, we held a forum group discussion (fgd) consisting of 5 participants to gain deeper understanding regarding the causes that support the players’ immersion. 1",,,"christabel parung, dian prianka, viviany, hairunnas, maya louk faculty of creative industries university of surabaya surabaya, indonesia christabelannora@staff.ubaya.ac.id, dianprianka@staff.ubaya.ac.id, viviany@staff.ubaya.ac.id, annashairunnas@staff.ubaya.ac.id, mayalouk@staff.ubaya.ac.id",
1,Optimization Approach For The Design Of Ipm  Synchronous Motor For Express Motorcycle,"the paper proposes an optimization procedure for the design of a three-phase interior permanent magnet synchronous motor. the multi-objective function maximizes the average torque, and the constraints are the efficiency and torque ripple. various metamodels were generated for each of the multi-objective functions and constraints, and the metamodels with the best prediction performance were selected. by applying a multi-objective genetic algorithm, several optimal solutions were compared to those of the initial model. the proposed multi-objective optimization method can guide the design of ipms for electric vehicles with high reliability and strong demagnetization characteristics.. this program allows estimating the back emf, flux density, electromagnetic torque, and ripple torque by analytical matlab program coupling to finite element magnetic method (femm) and ga optimization. finally, rotor lamination was stamped and assembled in the motor for the back emf test and no load-test. the design optimization is based on a new algorithm belonging to the class of controlled random search algorithms. this optimization technique has been able to find a very efficient design pointing out its effectiveness besides its versatility and robustness","brushless dc motor, external rotor","An effective analytical model is developed and verified with a prototype. To optimize the design process of the motor in a very short period of time and also without any need of FEM an intelligent optimization algorithm is fully implemented and described. The result of optimization shows the efficiency of the entire approach. The analytical model and the optimization program are both implemented using MATLAB which makes it easier to use. To validate if the suggested motor truly meets the requirements and boundaries, results are verified using FEM which is also controlled via MATLAB and will be initiated automatically after optimization. The entire package is a very powerful tool for the optimized design of a permanent magnet synchronous motor.

4,Optimal Design Of Induction Motor Using Genetic Algorithm  With Different Rotor Slot Number,"efficiency is affected by the geometry parameter and rotor slot number selection therefore a genetic algorithm based optimal design of a three-phase squirrel cage induction motor is applied to improve the efficiency of im 2.2kw-4p from efficiency class ie2 to ie 4 motor design. an analytical calculation will investigate power, losses, and efficiency with different geometrical parameters of stator/rotor. different constraints and different variables are imposed to achieve the best design within a specified range of variables. a genetic algorithm is used to achieve optimal design of the squirrel cage induction motor-scim 2.2kw-4p with 36 stator slots/ 28,32, 40, and 44 rotor bars are verified under starting and constant speed. their electromagnetic characteristics, such as electromagnetic torque, stator current, and magnetic flux density are compared in between two configurations. the paper contributes that the proper geometry parameters have a strong impact on the induction motor efficiency and the best design is applied for a 2.2kw induction motor with fixed stator and rotor diameters. the results obtained after running the optimization technique give visible improvements in efficiency as well as cost. to obtain the best design efficiency and cost of material is obtained using multi-objective genetic algorithm.",,"This paper has analyzed and compared the electromagnetic performance of three induction motors for industrial applications. The 44-rotor bar has the lowest iron loss. To verify the proposed design, a detailed design of a 3-phase 36-slot and 4-pole IM is assembled and verified torque, power, and efficiency performances. The back EMF waveforms have been analyzed based on the FEA modeling. The thermal simulation was implemented to validate overheat capacity. The main aim of the present investigation is to optimize the induction motor efficiency using a genetic algorithm tool. It optimizes geometric parameters such as inner stator diameter, geometric ratio, stator slot height, back iron thickness, air-gap length and stator tooth flux density, rotor tooth flux density to minimize the machine weight and maximize its efficiency. The GA optimized approach has been successfully applied on a typical 2.2 kW, 4 poles induction machine. It can be drawn from the optimized results, that the choice of the magnetic metal sheets has in important impact on machine efficiency. The achieved results with three material sheet types of this investigation have clearly demonstrated that the machine efficiency can be improved by this optimization procedure. Such achievement can be considered of great interest since it results in a paramount of energy saving and consequently an important reduction on the energy running cost. 36","1bui minh dinh, 2nguyen viet anh, 1school of electrical engineering and electronics hanoi university of science and technology 2 hanoi university of industry dinh.buiminh@hust.edu.vn","References

7,"Hybrid Model For Locating Fire Station In A City  Prof R.R.K. Sharma,","fire outbreak, traffic accidents, rescue operations etc. are fairly common in a human settlement all over the globe. the government funded fire stations are responsible to control such situations at the earliest possible. the response time and road route must be minimized to ensure that the adversity is taken under control quickly. to set up such a fire station at an optimal location we also need to consider the budget involved and the value of the locality which it would serve. this paper presents three models i.e. establishment cost, optimal service level and hybrid model of locating a fire station in a city by extending the mixed linear programming formulation using binary genetic algorithm. the proposed models are tested for problem sizes of n = 30 and 60 using gams 23.5 and comparisons of optimum results are reported. hybrid model performs best that help to decision-makers to enhance their decision capabilities. keyword fire station location, genetic algorithm, facility location problem, hybrid model 1. introduction we all have seen bright red coloured fire trucks rushing on the roads. fire-fighters are summoned whenever there is a fire outbreak, traffic accidents, rescue operation or any kind of disaster and emergency situations. time is the biggest challenge for them as each second could be fatal for human lives and could also bring huge loss to property as well. presently, most of the fire department operations are concentrated mostly in the urban areas. fire trucks take the shortest distance to the place of incident along with ambulance to control the adversity and provide medical assistance to the victims. to improve the rescue operations, the most important factor that comes into the play is locating the fire stations at the optimal places in a city. since, fire department is run by the government and public funds are used for the setup, the fire department need to work according to the budget provided by the government. as this is an emergency requirement for the society, fire department can not compromise on their quality of service and the requirements which are stated in the regulations. thus, numerous constraints and variables are taken into account before deciding the optimal location of a fire station. for example, if a locality has a high value; meaning the locality comprises of industries, large human settlements, expensive properties etc. then a fire station should be set up at a near distance from it. this type of facility location problem comes under the umbrella of hard to solve problems. hence, computer is required to solve these kinds of problems for the time being. the advancement of computer technology has brought convenience to the solution approaches. general algebraic modelling systems (gams) is a mathematical modelling programming environment which is useful for solving complex mathematical problems easily. the problem is fed and coded in the gams ide. various linear models are made and ran in the software by importing data tables from ms excel. the outputs are recorded and put up for tests and analysis. the best model is then selected on the basis of the results produced. 46",,,"dept. of ime, iit kanpur (india), rrks@iitk.ac.in dr vinay singh, abv-indian institute of information technology and management gwalior (india), vsingh@iiitm.ac.in pranit roy and uddyan goyal iit bombay (india) pranit8roy@gmail.com, abhi25goyal@gmail.com kk lai president, cyut taiwan laikk.tw@gmail.com","References

11,Developing Data Analytics Skills For Complex Thinking  Among Tomorrow’S Global Engineering Leaders,"the global engineering workforce needs to have the ability to analyze ‘big’ data sets critically to understand how and when to apply data in various settings and also understand how data can be interpreted to reveal a deeper contextual understanding about risks involved from multiple perspectives. in order to be able to provide aspiring engineering professionals with the complex skills necessary to use a variety of data sets, undergraduates require exposure to fundamental skills, challenging problems based in real world settings, and exposure to undergraduates with different disciplinary perspectives. this paper will provide an overview of a university-wide effort to facilitate the development of the fundamental data analytics skills through transdisciplinary workplace relevant learning opportunities that bring engineering students together with the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and arts. discussion will focus on the transdisciplinary faculty design effort and how industry professionals were involved in the construction, implementation, and support of the effort. discussion will focus on the curriculum that is offered through a data and decisions minor as well as the opportunity to earn a digital tech credential that is co-approved by a consortium of employers and institutions in the capital collaborative of leaders in academia and business (colab). the information presented in this paper provides an opportunity for universities and industry professionals to consider creative partnerships that can better prepare future leaders of the engineering workforce. engineering educators and future employers can use the findings presented in this paper to consider how to implement similar approaches at other institutions.","data analytics, decision making","To date, the curricular experiences that are part of the Data and Decisions effort have provided unique opportunities for currently enrolled engineering students as well as students more generally to develop data analytic skills as well as decision making skills. In addition, the curriculum advances communication skills and team-based collaboration skills which are highly sought after in the workforce. Students demonstrate their mastery of these important skills with the attainment of a minor and potentially with an additional workforce relevant certificate. Future efforts plan to examine more closely the specific learning outcomes of the students and the long-term outcomes as students matriculate into full-time jobs. In conclusion, the efforts at Virginia Tech to facilitate interaction between faculty from different and departments to design curricular offerings in key thematic areas has produced a series of learning experiences that are unique and important for the future workforce. The holistic experience that includes multi-disciplinary team-based learning around real world data challenges is developing future engineers that will have the skills necessary to analyze, use, and evaluate data more effectively in the workplace.","catherine t. amelink associate vice provost, office of the executive vice provost affiliate faculty department of engineering education virginia tech blacksburg, va, 24060, usa amelink@vt.edu g. don taylor executive vice provost and charles o. gordon professor, department of industrial and systems engineering virginia tech blacksburg, va 24061, usa taylorgd@vt.edu","references.

12,Container Pickup And Delivery With Charge Planning  Using Diesel And Battery Electric Heavy-Duty Trucks,"this study aims at reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions caused by drayage operations in port areas. due to globalization and economic prosperity, freight movements have been increasing during the past decades. in port areas, a large portion of freight movements is made by trucks, causing significant negative impacts on traffic conditions, energy consumption, and ghg emissions. in the last decade, battery-powered vehicles have become an emerging topic, but only limited research attention has been paid to battery electric heavy-duty trucks (behdt) in drainage operation. addressing this understudied but promising field, we examine the research potential of using behdts for daily container movements by proposing mathematical formulations, developing solution methodologies, and building simulation testbeds to evaluate transportation systems. meanwhile, given that the most challenging issue for using behdts is the battery life, we also consider the current status and future development trend of the battery industry. we will estimate the impacts of using behdts from 2022 to 2050. the freight movement problem will be decomposed into two subproblems. the first is figuring out the minimum cost flow for demand satisfaction. the second solves a bin-packing problem based on a flow solution, which also considers the behdts’ charging plans with range constraints. the numerical experiments are conducted with real-world data which can provide quantitative comparison in terms of truck travel costs, fleet size, and ghg emissions. sensitivity analysis will be performed under different mixtures of diesel trucks and behdts.","drayage operations, emissions, traffic simulation",,"maged dessouky, siyuan yao, and shichun hu daniel j. epstein department of industrial and systems engineering university of southern california los angeles, ca 90089, usa maged@usc.edu, siyuanya@usc.edu, shichunh@usc.edu",
13,Sustainability And Resilience In The Nigerian Power Sector  Justicia C. Otobo,"electricity is widely used to manufacture goods and services in all sectors of the economy. while a country's standard of living and degree of economic development is primarily determined by its energy use, electricity generation and distribution influence productivity and overall economic growth. unfortunately, many developing nations, like nigeria, are still unable to supply their populations with enough long-term power, which is essential to enhance their standard of life and fuel economic progress. despite being africa's largest economy, only around 60% of the nigeria’s 200 million residents has access to electric power. with a rapidly expanding population, it is critical to increase electrical supply to satisfy demand. the federal government of nigeria (fgn) wants to boost access to power from 45 percent to 90 percent by 2030. this paper examines policies created from 2001 to 2020 to investigate how they increased the country's generation and supply of electricity. the findings demonstrate that, because nigeria is still in the early phases of economic development, it would be sensible to promote renewable energy to boost the economy, decrease energy poverty, and protect the environment. this may be accomplished by diversifying the country's energy mix and constructing renewable energy power plants.","sustainability, renewable energy, construction, climate change, energy poverty","Nigeria's electrical infrastructure serves around 60% of its population; however, the power is unreliable and insufficient. As a result, most Nigerian families produce power using generators or solar panels (Elegbede, Kerr et al. 2021). They do, however, demand more stable, economic, and long-term electrical sources. According to this analysis, Nigeria's power sector challenges may be remedied if appropriate regulations are put in place to encourage renewable energy investors. For example, households with direct electrical connections might employ off-grid solar to transition to cleaner, renewable energy sources. This opens the possibility of building additional power plants to generate and distribute electricity to areas and consumers who are not currently serviced by the national grid. This calls for cleaner and more sustainable power to be generated by utilising the country's untapped natural resources, such as wind, biomass, and tidal. 84","phd researcher school of the built environment and architecture london south bank university 103 borough road, london, se1 0aa, united kingdom otoboj@lsbu.ac.uk","References

16,Determining The Level Of Prefabricated Module  Requirements In Offsite Construction,"offsite construction technique presents substantially speedier construction processes whilst lowering construction wastes. the level of prefabricated for offsite construction projects depends largely on the amount of complexity and the level of prefabricated components, which can be classified into two levels such as 2d penalized and 3d volumetric construction. however, there is often no specific method adoptable for determining the level of prefabrication construction. this research aims to determine the level of prefabrication requirement for offsite construction and their significance. an online database collected for offsite construction projects was analysed with decision making models. the results revealed that the building volume, i.e., the building footprint and height were the most influential factors. furthermore, three other factors related to timber material, low-income target user, and residential function of prefabricated projects were also identified as crucial in deciding the prefabrication level. the research concluded with certain guidance recommended for choosing the appropriate prefabrication level for building construction. for example, penalized construction generally had a higher level of implementation than volumetric construction in prefabrication.",,"The purpose of this paper is to help stakeholders including investors and designers decide the most suitable prefabrication level for construction projects. The volumetric construction and penalized construction were compared based on building performance in the operation stage. The results reveal that the penalized construction seems a better choice for offsite construction projects. Whereas, without considering the differences of projects, the suggestion cannot be conclusive. Since various factors can affect the prefabrication level of a modular building, the study adopts the decision tree model for analysing the identified critical input factors, and their significance. The analysis suggests that building height & footprint should be emphasized as top priority for deciding prefabricated level. Additionally, the construction material, target user and building functions are also relatively important factors. Specifically, the three attributes related to timber material, low income target user, and residential function of prefabricated projects should be highlighted as more critical factors. Moreover, the specific suggestion is that the volumetric construction should be utilized more in projects with these attributes: having less than 2500 ㎡ footprint with 3-8 stories, low-income user, timber material, and residential function. Instead, penalized construction can be applied to projects with these attributes: more than 2500 ㎡ footprint, over 8 stories or low rise projects, no more than 2 stories, non-low-income user, non-timber material, and non-residential function. 112","rafiu dimeji seidu, ruoyu jin, bert ediale young and obas john ebohon. school of the built environment and architecture, london south bank university, 103 borough road, london, se1 0aa, uk. seidur@lsbu.ac.uk, jinr@lsbu.ac.uk, youngb6@lsbu.ac.uk, ebohono@lsbu.ac.uk yizhe lu, the bartlett school of construction and project management, university college london, faculty of the built environment, 1-19 torrington place london, wc1e 7h, uk.","References

17,Prioritization Of Fire Risk Remedial Actions In The Readymade Garment Industry Of Bangladesh: A Hybrid Mcdm,"the ready-made garment (rmg) sector of bangladesh is one of the largest garment manufacturing sectors in the world. fire incidents in rmg factories are always a highly discussed issue among local and international policymakers and stakeholders. an efficient prioritization of the remedial actions for fire risks can aid the decision-makers to mitigate the fire hazards and associated damages. this study, thereby, proposes a hybrid multi-criteria decision- making (mcdm) framework, combining stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (swara) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (waspas) method, to prioritize the remedial actions for fire risks in rmg factories. at first, the 16 most important remedial actions have been identified by a panel of experts. for the evaluation of the identified actions, four evaluation criteria- initial cost, maintenance cost, feasibility, and risk reductant- have been selected from both the literature review and expert feedback. by using the swara method, the study finds ‘initial cost’ and ‘risk reductant’ to be the two criteria with the highest weights. later, using the obtained criteria weights, the waspas method finds that ‘proper electrical wiring and connections’, ‘separating the gas cylinders from the main production building’, and ‘keeping egress paths and stairs clear of obstruction’ are the top three prioritized remedial actions that can be taken to mitigate fire risks in the rmg industries. results obtained from this research are expected to help the managers of rmg industries to devise an effective fire risk remedial action plan, within their technical constraints and limited resources, to ensure a safe workplace for their workers.",ready-made garment,,"approach md. tanvir siraj, a. b. m. mainul bari, md. mahfujul haq department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka 1000, bangladesh. tanvir25392@gmail.com, mainul.ipe@gmail.com, mahfuzipe.buet@gmail.com md faiaz al islam department of mechanical engineering, bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka 1000, bangladesh. faiazalislam@gmail.com","References

18,Picking Optimization In A Peruvian Smes Based On Lean  Warehousing Techniques,"picking is a basic process within warehouse management, comprising the activities carried out since the order is received until the products are located in the warehouse and are ready for dispatch. the objective of this study was to optimize the productivity of the picking process in a peruvian food company. for this purpose, a pre-test and post-test methodology was designed with a qualitative and descriptive approach in order to suggest an innovative proposal. lean warehousing techniques, such as 5s and systematic layout planning (slp) were utilized, as well as an inventory record automation model and adkar, a change management model. the proposal was validated through pilot tests and a simulation in the arena software (16.1 version), proving its effectiveness in increasing productivity by more than 36%. the value of this study lies in that it can be applied both in companies in the same sector or other areas that have their own warehouse and want to increase its productivity.","productivity, picking","The improvement proposal was effective in demonstrating that the different tools applied significantly increased the productivity of the picking area, achieving the objectives initially set. The application of the 5s made it possible to increase compliance with the audit from 62% to 100%, by applying different organizational techniques related to the tool's components. The implementation of the Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) and the inventory register automation model, validated by means of the Arena software, allowed reducing the average time of picking activities by 26.9%, after reducing the time of the search of the register order and the extraction of the merchandise. The change management model, ADKAR, validated through training and a pilot questionnaire, showed that a successful change could be implemented in the organization, obtaining an average score of 4.56 per question, out of a maximum of 5 points. The integration of the previously mentioned tools successfully increased the productivity of the picking area by 36.5%, obtaining a productivity of 180.7 packages/hour and successfully reaching the industry standards. Finally, the transferability of this study lies in the possibility of being applied in other SMEs in the sector and other industries, as well as in logistics companies seeking to increase the productivity of the picking area. To this effect, the reports detailed throughout this study facilitate that the methodology can be replicated in other contexts.","daniela barrantes and belen galdos facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú dbarrantes1999@gmail.com, belengaldoss@gmail.com marcos fernando ruiz-ruiz associate professor universidad de lima lima, perú mruiz@ulima.edu.pe wilfredo yushimito associate professor universidad adolfo ibáñez santiago, chile wilfredo.yushimito@uai.cl",
19,An Exploration Of The Notion Of Improvisation Within  Project And Project Management,"urgency of accomplishing a certain task within any project is always considered as a common situation. improvisation happens when the project manager must deal with unexpected situations within a specific schedule and limited data. this paper aims to present a review of how improvisation has been addressed through the literature within projects and project management perspectives and what are the factors that affect it. this review has been undertaken by defining project, project management, improvisation, and how it leads to project success. this has been considered by analyzing various studies related to improvisation. the paper will help the project managers to understand the concept of improvisation, how it is important to project, and the required factors to be considered to obtain successful project outcomes. it has been proved in this research that a project manager to be able to improvise successfully must have knowledge, experience, and being trained. this research will help project managers to understand how to improvise successfully by knowing the required skills to focus on to improve themselves. moreover, this research suggested a model that includes factors to be evaluated based on their impact on successful improvisation. the suggested factors that could impact the project manager decision are experience, age, and training. at the end, a successful improvisation will result in successful project outcome when the project is within the schedule, budget, and meets the quality requirement. in addition, the introduced model and hypotheses can be evaluated on further study and more factors can be considered.","factors, knowledge, project, project management","The purpose of this paper was to undertake a review of the academic literature on ‘improvisation’ within the context of project management and the factors that affect improvisation. The literature review shows the importance of knowledge and experience in leading to successful project outcomes. Project and project management are two different terms that have been addressed in the literature review section. Project includes tasks and activities that lead to achieve objectives while project management is the process that control and lead to achieve objectives (Munns & Bjeirmi, 1996). On the other hand, improvisation is an act to unexpected situation that requires immediate decision with limited data and resources. It occurs to help continuing the project and the project manager must have enough experience to improvise with successful project outcome. It is also necessary for the project manager to focus on improving the quality of work, training, experience to have successful project outcomes. This research proposes a model for the sequence of improvisation within a project in an organization along with hypotheses which will help in understanding the factors that affect the decision making and in particular how it is related to improvisation. In addition, more factors can be studied along with the factors that have been introduced in this study which are experience, age, and training. These factors need to be studied to check the affection on final project outcomes in terms of cost, time, and quality. Moreover, for future research it is suggested to establish a survey that covers the factors that need to be evaluated in order to be able to check if the hypotheses are supported or not.","alya j. abuseem research scholar in engineering management program university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates u18104184@sharjah.ac.ae udechukwu ojiako and fikri t. dweiri industrial engineering and engineering management department university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates gojiako@sharjah.ac.ae, fdweiri@sharjah.ac.ae",
20,Agility In Resilient Supply Chain Risk Management Design  To Cope With Supply Shortage Under Covid-19 Pandemic:,"growing global supply chain trends across different industries have driven enormous changes and complexity of traditional supply chain management (scm). simultaneously, unprecedented disruptions impacting worldwide commerce further add more vulnerabilities to current scm practices. the most recent covid-19 pandemic is a major global catastrophe that has created unpredictable disruptions towards supply chain activities and caused interruptions, especially in supply or sourcing activities. this low-frequency and high-impact disruption have created severe ripple effects in scm, resulting from propagation of disturbance from upstream point of supply to downstream part of production and distribution. while traditional scm focuses more on developing initial strategies to avoid forecasted future risks, covid-19 phenomenon has forced scm practitioners to propose modern scm with agile and resilient risk management capability to adapt and respond quickly to unpredictable risk. however, it is found that only a scarce number of academic papers have suggested appropriate supply chain risk management (scrm) solutions for the commercial sector while most addressed the issues in humanitarian scm. hence, this paper aims to investigate the phenomenon of supply shortage as the root problem of ripple effects in the supply chain caused by covid-19 pandemic and propose effective scrm to build an agile and resilient commerce supply chain for responding to the disruptions. beyond that, the objective of this research is to also provide a clearer picture of the critical role of scrm in the future post-pandemic world that is advantageous for supporting agile and resilient decision-making processes to turn risks into opportunities. the study first provides a comprehensive review of existing literature related to scm and scrm as the basis to define measurements in assessing and improving supply chain agility and resilience. based on this preliminary study, a simulation modeling approach based on real-life case study is designed, and experimental results are presented to depict more conceptual and realistic illustrations. this paper implements a combination of agent-based and discrete- event simulation methodology with anylogic simulation software. through this proposed approach, the paper finally concludes with providing managerial insights on scrm, particularly for strategic sourcing and identifying possibilities for potential research areas. the findings and recommendations from this paper can be further exploited for advancing scrm based on simulation technology in real-life practices as an integral part of modern supply chain capabilities. in turn, this paper contributes to help supply chain practitioners accumulate better understanding on the importance role of agile and resilient scrm, especially in sourcing activities during disruptions period, and effective methodology for its real-world implementation that supports making investment decisions in priority settings.",152,,"simulation-based supplier strategy sheren aurelia dyka chandra department of industrial and systems engineering faculty of engineering the hong kong polytechnic university, hung hom, hksar, china sheren-aurelia-dyka.chandra@connect.polyu.hk c.k.m. lee1,2 1associate professor, department of industrial and systems engineering, the hong kong polytechnic university, kowloon, hong kong 2the laboratory of artificial intelligence in design limited, the hong kong science park, new territories, hong kong ckm.lee@polyu.edu.hk",
21,The Antecedents And Marketing Outcome Of Customer  Trust In The On-Demand Ridesharing Platform,"in the on-demand ridesharing services (odrs), a business revolves around situations that urge individuals to rely on parties they have never encountered. as uncertainties are inevitable, trust acts as the fuse that ignites the whole industry. currently, few scholars have studied trust dimensions concerning the odrs, particularly in developing countries. this study aims to grasp a complete understanding of trust in this industry by incorporating its antecedents: familiarity and reputation with the multiple dimensions of trust: trust in a peer, a platform, and a product, alongside its implication towards its continuance intention to use. the study involved 215 respondents, and utilized a pls-sem analysis. the result shows that reputation significantly influences trust's multiple dimensions, while familiarity does not. furthermore, all trust dimensions significantly contributed to the continuance intention to use. companies can use this study to construct trust and stimulate intention to participate in the odrs.","familiarity, odrs, reputation",,"fandy christianto, jonathan raharja, rajendra khalil afif, evelyn hendriana bina nusantara university binus business school master program business management, management department jakarta, indonesia fandy.christianto@binus.ac.id; jonathan.raharja@binus.ac.id; rajendra.afif@binus.ac.id; evelyn.hendriana@binus.ac.id","References

However, the main difference that stands out in this comparison is that, although the article by Esmaeli and Hashemi mentions that a third configuration of the model can already be identified, it is in the years following this research that more information has become available that allows us to determine a third stage in the evolution of the model. This third stage demonstrates a change of focus for companies seeking to utilize their platforms as a center of commerce and betting on social interaction and web traffic. Technological disruptions such as those mentioned in the article will play a fundamental role in the future of social commerce, and it is because of this technological sensitivity and dynamism that a role of curiosity and constant research must be maintained concerning the model, since social commerce and technology can evolve faster than expected.","lucia isabel fanárraga olivares, francisco alejandro crousillat cheneffusse, ezilda maria cabrera gil grados industrial engineering faculty of engineering and architecture universidad de lima lima, peru 20170540@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20170429@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, ecabrera@ulima.edu.pe",

28,Analysis Of The Effect Of Learning On The Solution Of A  Simple Assembly Line Balancing Problem,"the objective of simple assembly line balancing problem type1 is to minimize the number of workstations organized to perform tasks with precedence constraints. assembly lines, which require a lot of manual labor, are an example of a manufacturing environment where learning effect influences the operation. in this case, when the minimal number of workstations is determined, the change of task times as a consequence of learning must be considered. this paper investigates the effects of two exponential learning curves on the minimal number of workstations when a simple assembly line balancing problem is solved. a modified simple assembly line balancing model incorporating the learning effect is formulated, and a sample problem to illustrate the application of the model is provided. some general conclusions related to the type of learning curve function applied and to the change of learning rates are also presented.",learning curve,"In simple assembly lines without the learning effect, the task times are constant, and consequently, so are the station times; therefore, when solving the SALBP-1 model, merely one solution is found. In the presence of the learning effect, as tasks are repeated frequently, task times and station times decrease, causing the minimal number of workstations to drop along with the output units and the SALBP-1 has more than one solution. In this paper, a modified SALBP-1 model incorporating the learning effect is formulated and applied. The modified SALBP-1 model developed in section 4 is illustrated with a simple example in section 5. The Wright’s and the Plateau learning curves were chosen for our model because of their wide use. The model, however, can be valid for any other learning curves. In the illustrative example, two learning curves were chosen with four different learning rates: 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. The results showed that the minimal number of workstations at the start of production (𝑄𝑄=1 units) is the same as the basic SALBP-1 model (In our case, it was 4), which is logical since the learning effect has not started yet. However, for both LC models, the minimal number of WSs decreases along with the output unit due to the learning effect causing the allocation of tasks and operators and consequently the station times to change after each produced unit. Comparing the two learning curves, the results showed that if the decrease of the minimal number of workstations in the case of Wright’s LC model occurs before the plateauing quantity 𝑄𝑄𝑠𝑠, the results will be identical in the case of the Plateau LC model regardless of the learning rate. Nonetheless, if it happens after 𝑄𝑄𝑠𝑠, then the decrease of WSs in case of the Plateau LC model can be either delayed or never reached. In the present paper, the evolution of the minimal number of workstations in the presence of the learning effect is investigated. As a result, different task allocations and station number configurations were obtained during a production run. In practice, it is not practical and frequently not even feasible to change line configuration frequently during a production run. The solution for this problem is a unique line configuration that considers the evolution of task time in the early stages of operation when the decrease of task time is significant.

30,Analyzing Lexical And Prosodic Features Of Bilingual Job  Interviews In Evaluating Interview Performance,"different organizations have started to provide automation in evaluating applicants during their interviews. due to globalization, bilingualism has become essential in assessing individuals. past studies have focused on analyzing the features and developing models for evaluating applicants who spoke only one language – english – during their interviews. hence, this paper aims to analyze the lexical and prosodic features of interviews spoken using both english and tagalog in evaluating interview performances based on three criteria: leadership ability, communication skills, and candidate enthusiasm. after consulting with domain experts, 60 mock interview recordings were gathered. the researchers used google cloud services api for transcription and translation, praat to extract prosodic features, and liwc to extract lexical features. the researchers gathered different algorithms from past studies and selected the most suitable ones based on the characteristics of the datasets. from the results of model training, the researchers concluded that the optimal algorithms were lda for leadership ability with 94% accuracy and 95% f1-score, svm for communication skills with 88.89% accuracy and 82% f1-score, and random forest for candidate enthusiasm with 87.5% accuracy and 89.2% f1-score. furthermore, the researchers concluded that words categorized under psychological processes were the most prevalent for lexical features, while features under frequencies and formants were the most prevalent for prosodic features.","job interviews, bilingualism","For the first specific objective of the study, the researchers conclude that the essential features pertain to psychological processes and frequencies and formants. For the lexical features of all criteria, the most common lexical category was psychological processes, with a percentage distribution of 62% - 68%. As for the prosodic features of all criteria, formants and frequencies are prevalent, with 25% for CS, 37.5% for LA, and 29.1% for CE. To measure the effect of translating Tagalog words into English to capture their lexemes for this study’s bilingual data, a separate dataset was created that treated Tagalog words as noise. It was trained to a separate set of models. The results were compared to the metrics of those models trained with the inclusion of translated Tagalog words. The models that treated Tagalog words as noise showed poor accuracy and F1-score values and poor overall generalization due to the significant differences in their training and testing results. Therefore, capturing the lexemes from Tagalog words through translation is essential for the models to avoid overfitting, have similar predictions on the study’s bilingual interview data, and have better generalization. For the second specific objective, the researchers conclude that removing momentary mistakes and personal information negatively affected the performance of the models. This suggests that features about momentary mistakes and personal information are relevant to the candidate's overall performance during an interview. For the third specific objective, the researchers conclude that the algorithms which provided the optimal results in predicting interview performance scores concerning this study’s datasets and their features were LDA (for Leadership Ability), SVM (for Communication Skills), and Random Forest (for Candidate Enthusiasm). The Prototype’s Kappa validity test results also show that using shorter interview recordings may result in predictions that exhibit weaker agreement levels. To further improve these models’ predictions over unseen data, better convergence between training and testing performances, and stronger agreement levels in Kappa validity tests, adding more interview samples (varying in duration and context) to the datasets is preferable for future attempts.","matthew von nathaniel corcuera, rudnick james donaire, rey victor mendillo, dr. larry vea, and joel de goma school of information technology mapúa university – makati makati, philippines mvnecorcuera@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rjadonaire@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rvdmendillo@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, lavea@mapua.edu.ph, jcdegoma@mapua.edu.ph",
31,Quality Management Directing The Way To Defect  Reduction And Production Improvement,"with growing competition for markets in the various production sectors, both in brazil are looking for improvements in the world, as well as improvements that can improve their productivity and reduce production costs and quality services. for this, among other strategic actions, continuous improvement can be sought as a means to remain competitive. in this context, the present work case, developed as a work study, has as its central objective the reduction of refuges generated by deficiencies in the production process in a metallurgical company that manufactures ductile iron pipes, among other products. from the application of the method and quality tools used, it was possible to identify the main causes of scrap, favoring its reduction through process improvements. with the identification and analysis of problems related to the training of manpower, lack of compliance with material specifications, inadequate or unfulfilled methods of production and making adjustments to machines used in production processes, it was possible to reduce the occurrence of defects in cast iron pipes, when compared to the amount of scrap counted before and after the changes implemented. the results achieved showed significant gains for the company by reducing the amount of scrap and rework generated during the production process. the reduction in the occurrence of defects favored a reduction of costs, contributing for the company to become more competitive.","masp, metallurgy, quality, scrap","With the objective of contributing to make the company more competitive, it was sought, with the development of this work, the reduction of the scrap index called A30, in ductile iron pipe produced by a metallurgical industry, after analysis and identification that it was the most relevant defect to be studied at that moment. The quantitative survey of the defects in the produced pipes identified the anomalies in the period of three months of production. Since the types and quantities of defects found were numerous, we sought to establish the analysis of the most common ones. Thus, of the six defects identified in the produced tubes, defect A30 represented a total of 40% of those defects that caused scrap. To obtain the solution or reduction of the problem identified with the help of the Pareto Diagram, it was sought to observe and understand the way the process was being performed, as well as if the company's standards were being followed, generating potential causes that, using the 5 Whys tool associated with the Ishikawa Diagram, it was possible to reach the root causes. The identified causes were grouped into 6 categories (Labor, Material, Method, Machine, Measurement, and Environment) in the Ishikawa Diagram as a way to facilitate the analysis and its understanding. In function of the results obtained, it was observed that the most incident causes of the identified defect were caused by Method (33%) and Labor (25%) problems. Thus, based on the results of this study, the company was able to elaborate countermeasures to try to nullify the causes of the problems, as well as establish plans and goals and apply training to understand how the company's standards should be interpreted to guarantee that they are followed, with the objective of reducing the scrap rate resulting from defect A30, which before the beginning of the work was 40% of all problems or defects incident on the product. After the implementation of the MASP project, the scrap rate dropped from 40% to 28%, representing a reduction of 30% of the scrap caused by defect A30. This 12% saving in scrap ratifies an average saving of 3 thousand tons of cast iron per month, representing an annualized gain of more than 100 thousand Reais. 237","rodrigo dias da costa, josé glênio medeiros de barros, antonio henriques de araujo jr department of industrial engineering rio de janeiro state university resende, rio de janeiro 27537000, brazil costa.rodrigo@hotmail.com, glenio.barros@gmail.com, anthenriques2001@yahoo.com.br ronald palandi cardoso department of mechanical engineering rio de janeiro state university, resende, rio de janeiro 27537000, brazil ronaldpalandi0805@gmail.com nilo antonio de souza sampaio department of mathematics, physics and computing rio de janeiro state university, resende, rio de janeiro 27537000, brazil nilo.samp@terra.com.br josé salvador da motta reis department of industrial engineering rio de janeiro state university, resende, rio de janeiro 27537000, brazil jmottareis@gmail.com","References

34,Enterprise Operations In A Three-Level Supply Chain Under  Cap-And-Trade Regulation,"many countries have implemented various policies to reduce carbon emissions. among the policies available, cap- and-trade regulations have well been accepted as an effective market-based mechanism to curb carbon emissions. this policy offers the opportunity for firms to share the benefits of low-emission in a carbon trading market by selling and purchasing credits. in this paper, we focus on the cap-and-trade emission reduction policy. specifically, we study an emission-dependent supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a supplier and a retailer. in this supply chain, a cap on emission permits for the manufacturer is primarily imposed by the government and additional emissions must be purchased from the emission trading market if the permit needed is larger than the cap. we investigate the effects of the emission cap-and-trade on the supply chain members' decisions for decentralized and centralized supply chain using a stackelberg game model. in the decentralized supply chain, a product's retail price is higher than in the centralized decision-making mode. moreover, the price of extra emissions under the decentralized supply chain decrease as the carbon emissions cap increases. our results show that in the centralized supply chain enterprises obtain higher benefits than in the decentralized supply chain. the outcome of this research can help i) policy-makers to make effective emission reduction policies and ii) manufacturers and retailers to make sustainable operations and supply chain decisions.","cap-and-trade, stackelberg game",,"fatemeh rezaei and maximiliano udenio faculty of economics and business, ku leuven, belgium f.rezaei@ieseg.fr, maxi.udenio@kuleuven.be linda l. zhang professor of operations management, ieseg school of management univ. lille, cnrs, umr 9221 - lem – lille economie management, f-59000 lille, france l.zhang@ieseg.fr",
35,Collision Avoidance And Trajectory Tracking For Multiple  Autonomous Mobile Robots In Robot Operating System,"increasing the demand for robot usage in different industries has considerably changed companies’ operation and management complexity. meanwhile, automation is a further trend to satisfy the shortage of human resources and enhance productivity. because of the popularity of 5g technology and industry 4.0, the linkage of devices becomes more stable to connect with multiple robots simultaneously to track their location precisely. therefore, it can boost the development of robot operating systems (ros) and the popularity of robot applications across different industries. in the current situation, the company’s trend is to apply automatic guided vehicle (agv) in operation to increase the productivity and decrease human power involved. this technology is only suitable in a static environment to complete some assigned jobs with collision avoidance. agv focuses much on repetitive work without any humans involved. the main weaknesses of agv are not capable and flexible when applied in dynamic and unknown environments. however, autonomous mobile robot (amr) can work in these environments while it can help to achieve human-robot interaction without collision avoidance. this research studies collision avoidance and trajectory tracking for multiple amr. adopting a path planning approach based on discrete optimization of path tracking is normally assumed in amr in real-life scenarios. dynamic path tracking should be investigated to solve the current issue of choosing the best path from a limited number of options while calculating vehicle acceleration and speed simultaneously. meanwhile, the study provides a literature review to show the existing algorithm, navigation method, simulation method applied on amr. based on the above research, experimental results display more realistic data using a simulation modelling approach based on a real-life case study. the case study is set in different changes of the retail environment and different parameter changes of the robot to indicate how efficient the robot is, and which set of robots is suitable in an actual retail environment. three case studies have been considered for multiple simulation scenarios, including a small convenience store, a medium-sized restaurant, and a supermarket. gazebo software and turtlebot 3 are used in the simulation. the service robot in a retail environment is evitable to conflict with humans while doing job tasks. the conflict resolution and human-machine cooperation are shown in simulation under complex task prioritization how the robot follows its own task-related goals while it has a conflict with humans. the results are shown with multiple parameters comparison, including the number of amrs, different environment, types of algorithm and human involvement. the paper can conclude which method is suitably applied in multiple amrs to achieve collision avoidance, trajectory tracking, and human-robot interaction. the findings and recommendations presented in this study can further assist with ros effectively by implementing amr into real-world scenarios.",,,"cheung ho hin department of industrial and systems engineering, the hong kong polytechnic university, kowloon, hong kong sar, china hin677.cheung@connect.polyu.hk c.k.m. lee1,2 1 department of industrial and systems engineering, the hong kong polytechnic university, kowloon, hong kong sar, china 2 the laboratory of artificial intelligence in design limited, the hong kong science park, new territories, hong kong sar, china ckm.lee@polyu.edu.hk",
36,Minimizing Maximum Lateness For A No-Wait Flowshop  Scheduling,"we address a no-wait flow shop scheduling problem where the setup times are treated as separate and uncertain. the objective is to minimize maximum lateness which is one of the most essential performance measures for customer satisfaction and loss of goodwill. the considered problem is common in manufacturing environments like metal, food and pharmaceutical industries where some of the operations must not be interrupted. in many cases, setup time, the time required to set up a resource, is either ignored or assumed to be constant. however, these assumptions might lead to inefficient planning. therefore, we relax these assumptions and consider uncertain but bounded setup times. the problem has been addressed in the scheduling literature where dominance relations were presented. in the current paper, we propose new dominance relations and show that the newly proposed dominance relations are around 100% more efficient than the existing. one of the main strengths of the newly proposed dominance relations is that their performances get better as the uncertainty in setup time increases. these dominance relations can also be used for initial sequence generation or improving the final solution as well as finding the optimal solutions for small size problems. moreover, we also propose new and efficient heuristics as potential solutions for the problem and also for similar problems. based on extensive computational experiments, we show that our new heuristics are around 90% more efficient than the existing ones in the literature under the same computational time.",heuristics,,"harun aydilek mathematics & natural sciences department gulf university for science and technology, kuwait aydilek.h@gust.edu.kw asiye aydilek economics & finance department gulf university for science and technology, kuwait aydilek.a@gust.edu.kw muberra allahverdi department of mathematical sciences kean university, new jersey, usa. muallahv@kean.edu ali allahverdi industrial and management systems engineering department kuwait university, kuwait ali.allahverdi@ku.edu.kw",

42,Methodology For The Evaluation Of The Value Chain In The  Chemical Industry,"the objective of this research was to propose a methodology for the evaluation of the value chain of the sector dedicated to the manufacture of chemical substances and products. to carry it out, a systematic literature review was carried out, whose conceptual basis was porter's value chain model. it was found that this model is applicable in different sectors, thus allowing this evaluation to be carried out in the sector in question. the proposed tool, of a qualitative nature, evaluates both primary and support activities that make up the generic value chain. in addition, a series of questions related to corporate social responsibility (csr) in this sector is proposed. it is concluded that the value chain represents a powerful evaluation tool, with the capacity for flexibility and adaptation to the contexts and business sectors to be evaluated.","assessment tool, chemical industry","The high levels of uncertainty and volatility of the environment in which companies operate today, have turned value into a necessary element, but not optional, to survive in the market. To achieve this, the value chain is presented as the appropriate tool for this, since it has the capacity to carry out a comprehensive business examination, taking into consideration all those economic-productive activities that are carried out, as well as the interests of the stakeholders. Thus, its careful examination allows obtaining an overview of business performance, quickly identifying strengths to be exploited, as well as weaknesses to be corrected; all this, framed within a context of improving competitiveness, management, growth and sustainability. On the other hand, the importance of making efforts aimed at evaluating the value chain must be established, considering it as a key management model that should not be neglected. Thus, the tools built for this purpose, whether of a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed nature, constitute valuable contributions to be considered by businessmen, according to their convenience and purpose of analysis. Likewise, this work aims to highlight the importance of CSR evaluation as a complementary and unavoidable element of the value chain, given the importance and the dynamic and transversal role of the environmental field that it plays today with all interest groups. In addition, the inclusion of this theme demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of the value chain model, thus showing that it can be adjusted to any economic-sectoral reality. It is recommended that, for future research, quantitative evaluation tools, such as dynamic modeling, be built so that continuous evaluation and control can be carried out. Likewise, it is recommended to work from the academy in the construction of this type of tools that help in a substantial way to improve the business management of different economic sectors.","maría josé gonzález calle, ana carolina armijos-orellana, juan manuel maldonado- matute and pedro fernando guerrero maxi faculty of management sciences, business administration school universidad del azuay cuenca, ecuador mgonzalez@uazuay.edu.ec, aarmijos@uazuay.edu.ec, jmaldonado@uazuay.edu.ec, pedromaxi@uazuay.edu.ec",
43,Evaluation Of The Complexity Of Generic Models In System  Configuration,"in the context of industry 4.0, companies must offer the market personalized systems (from goods to services). this customization is mainly supported by specific tools, called configurators, which are based on a generic model formalizing the catalog and diversity proposed by a company, on a family of systems. the generic model or gm formalizes all the items (systems, subsystems, components, services, sub-modules, etc.) needed to build a system, in terms of nomenclature, compatibility (which items can be connected or associated to others) and options, which can be added to meet specific needs. companies typically offer several variations of families of systems, all based on a common nomenclature. for example, a bicycle manufacturer will be able to offer its customers basic bicycles, road bikes, mountain bikes, children's bikes, women's bikes, etc. two policies for formalizing knowledge in the form of gms can thus emerge: 1) the gm formalizes all the knowledge and diversity proposed for all families of systems, 2) the gm formalizes only the knowledge and diversity specific to a family of systems; in this case, several gms ranging from the most generic to the most specialized family cover the proposed diversity. it is thus possible to derive from a generic gm, the other more specific gms. this specialization of generic models (from a basic bike to a competition road bike for children) can be achieved via a specialization mechanism between models. in this communication, we focus on this modeling problem by studying the complexity of the different models according to the chosen modeling policy. this complexity could be measured using the density of the model, its maximum degree, its number of vertices, etc.","configuration, modeling, specialization",,"elise vareilles professor isae supaero - toulouse france elise.vareilles@isae.fr michel aldanondo professor imt mines albi - albi, france michel.aldanondo@mines-albi.fr thierry coudert associated professor enit / lgp - tarbes, france thierry.coudert@enit.fr maryam mohammadamini phd student enit / lgp – isae supaero – imt mines albi - france maryam.mohammadamini@enit.fr",
44,Thinking About The Sustainability Of A Start Up Project:  Uda-Erp Case,"business plans become an important preliminary step for all start up. properly defining the market segment and penetration, growth and operation strategies are activities that become essential. the objective of this work is to identify the necessary strategies that allowed a product called uda-erp to go from research to a business model. for this, a market study was applied by means of surveys to a group of micro and small companies in cuenca, the third most important city in ecuador. with the application of various strategic analysis tools, macro-strategies were determined that made it possible to establish a sustainable business model for a product resulting from an academic research project.","business model erp, start up, research","In response to the research question ""What are the market characteristics that must be considered for the UDA-ERP to be self-sustainable?"", it can be said that the Ecuadorian market responds to 98% of companies in the MSME sector, which during the pandemic caused by Covid-19 suffered several economic problems, since during the year 2020 there was a reduction in sales, generating a negative impact with the closure of many of them. To this reality, during the government of President Lenin Moreno, a 2% tax was applied on the income from sales, affecting the profit of small businesses that usually range between 10% and 20% of the profit, an aspect that was negative for the business model of the startup UDA-ERP. Under this perspective, the best scenario for the sustainability of the project is to lease the software through a monthly subscription payment, as opposed to the models that pursued a percentage of the net business profit or free software with paid consulting services, the latter being the least profitable for the Start up. In response to question 2, ""What are the commercial strategies to be considered for the product's life cycle?"", it can be stated that the commercial strategies should be considered according to the product's life cycle and evolution in the market. The BCG matrix resulted in a strategic decision which consists of taking advantage of the available resources to make a representative investment to achieve a firm position in the market and transform the product into a ""Dairy Cow"" product. The first strategy is the penetration of the product in the market, which should be initiated with the concept of brand pre-activation.

45,Digital Supply Chain: Conceptualisation Of The Research  Domain,"in this decade, manufacturing companies are facing events that disrupt delicate balances and experiencing tangible challenges that cannot be deferred. among these, the acceleration of technological transformation to follow the introduction of industry 4.0, the difficulty in sourcing raw materials and accessing different markets due first to the covid 19 pandemic and more recently to geopolitical tensions and conflicts. in this scenario, traditional supply chain models need to transform into digital supply chains (dscs), where functional silos are broken down to enable end-to- end visibility, agility, collaboration, and resilience to such shocks. the literature on the subject is still immature and many concepts are still vague and undefined. in this regard, this article aims to answer the following questions: (i) what are the main research areas within the topic? (ii) what is the development trajectory of the topic? (iii) what are the main digital technologies that can support dsc capabilities? (iv) what can be its research agenda? for this purpose, this paper aims at reviewing the existing scientific production on dscs, combining a systematic review with bibliometric tools. the resulting framework can serve as a preliminary guide for companies facing the challenges listed above and can open up future research that can validate the results empirically.",,,maria pia ciano assistant professor operations management and information systems business school university of nottingham nottingham uk maria.ciano@nottingham.ac.uk marco ardolino post-doc researcher rise laboratory università degli studi di brescia brescia - italy marco.ardolino@unibs.it julian m. müller professor international business studies kufstein university of applied sciences kufstein austria julian.mueller@fh-kufstein.ac.at,
46,War Of The Wilds: Future Invaders And Invasions  Nicholas Lu,"invasive plant species can change an ecosystem’s food web by destroying or replacing native food sources, providing little to no food value for wildlife. they are also able to alter the abundance of diversity of species that are important habitats for native wildlife. some aggressive species are even capable of changing ecosystem conditions, from soil chemistry to the intensity of wildfires. this project uses several algorithms to understand the factors that contribute to the spread of invasive species. our model uses three different algorithms: one-way analysis of variance (anova), linear regression (lr) as well as nonlinear regression (nr) to examine the characteristics of the ecological profile of current invasive species, specifically its spread and length in time it has had to spread. based on statistical profiling of 77,075 records of 75 invasive species, over 10% of the species have matched the profile of known invasive plants, which are likely to become the next global invaders. these results present an opportunity to implement timely and proactive management strategies against biological invasions.","machine learning, invasive species, linear regression, anova","This paper examined whether the type of the invasive plants and time factor controlled their growth behavior, using one-way ANOVA, linear regression, and moderated nonlinear regression. Via each technique, the paper was able to determine the relationship and the strength between the type of plant and time their species has had to spread to the distance they have spread. The paper determined that there is strong proof that the type of plant and the time elapsed factors into how far the invasive plant has spread, along with the fact that a nonlinear quadratic regression model more accurately represents the relationship between time elapsed and the distance the invasive plant spreads. 6. Future Research Through the findings, the paper not only determined whether or not different types of invasive plants and the time they have had to spread impact the distance spread, but it also determined the extent to which each time factor impacts the distance spread. Using this information, the most invasive plants, or the ones that spread the farthest Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Rome, Italy, July 26-28, 2022","the haverford school, haverford, pa 19041 nichlu@haverford.org","References

47,Factors Determining The Behavioral Intention To Use Consite  Application For Heavy Machine Management System: Using,"the research focused on the internet of things in heavy machine management with consite application usage. the main objective of this research is to examine the five variables (experience; subjective norms; self-efficacy; perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use) affecting the intention to use the consite application at pt. hexa in indonesia. the research used a survey method by distributing an online questionnaire to 115 employees who are working in pt. hexa, as the consite application users. for testing the hypotheses, the research adopted the structural equation modeling method using smartpls software. results have indicated that experience and self-efficacy have a positive and significant effect on both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, while subjective norms do not affect both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use have a positive significant direct effect on the intention to use the application of consite in pt hexa. furthermore, the results study implication and findings are discussed.",consite application,"Experience has positive and significant effect on Perceived Usefulness. This result is in line with the previous results by (Abdullah et al. 2016; Irani 2000). The experience will develop the perceived of usefulness in using the Consite Shot App. Hypothesis 2: Subjective Norm → Perceived Usefulness The t-statistic < t-table: 1.364 < 1.96 meaning that this hypothesis is not supported. In conclusion there is no effect and insignificant Subjective Norms on Perceived Usefulness to use Consite Shot App. This result is corroborated with previous research by Abdullah et al. (2016). However, it is contrast with the result by Izuagbe et al. (2019), stated that subjective norms has a strong factor with perceived usefulness. Hypothesis 3: Self Efficacy → Perceived Usefulness The t-statistic value > t-table: 4.385 > 1.96 meaning that hypothesis 3 is supported. There is a positive and significant effect of Self-Efficacy on Perceive Usefulness. This result supported with previous research by Alalwan et al. (2016). With the capability of users to use the Consite Shot App will increase the perceived usefulness of the app. Hypothesis 4: Experience → Perceived Ease of Use The t-statistic value > t-table: 4.061 > 1.96 meaning that the hypothesis 4 is supported. There is a positive and significant effect of Experience on Perceived Ease of Use. This result corroborated with previous research by Hamid et al. (2016); Tubaishat (2018). With the greater user’s experience of using the Consite Shot App will increase Perceived Ease of Use to the app. Hypothesis 5: Subjective Norms → Perceived Ease of Use The t-statistic < t-table: 0.546 < 1.96 meaning that this hypothesis 5 is not supported. There is no effect of Subjective Norms on Perceived Ease of Use. This result is contrast by previous research by Abdullah et al. (2016). This app will help to increase the performance and service and the subjective norms is not affected the perceived ease of use. Hypothesis 6: Self Efficacy → Perceived Ease of Use The t-statistic value > t-table: 6.359 > 1.96 meaning the hypothesis is supported. There is a positive and significant effect on self-efficacy and perceived ease of use. This result is in line with previous research by Abdullah et al. (2016). The greater user’s ability in using the app will increase the perceived ease of use. Hypothesis 7: Perceived Usefulness → Intention to Use The t-statistic value > t-table: 3.341 > 1.96 meaning the hypothesis is supported. There is a positive and significant effect Perceived Usefulness on Intention to Use the Consite Shot App. This result is corroborated with previous research by Boon-Itt, (2019); Larasetiati and Ali, (2019). The greater perceived usefulness of the app will increase the intention to use. Hypothesis 8: Perceived Ease of Use → Intention to Use The t-statistic value > t-table: 3.694 > 1.96 meaning the hypothesis is supported. There is a positive and significant effect Perceived Ease of use on Intention to Use the Consite Shot App. This result is corroborated with previous research by Tahar et al., (2020). The greater perceived ease of use of the app will increase the intention to use. 5. Conclusion and Limitation From the total 8 hypotheses, there are 2 hypotheses are not supported on this research. The subjective norms on perceived usefulness is insignificant and no effect meaning that the users of the Consite Shot App do not require the influence from other people nor the social environment as the decision to use the app included in the company policy 355 Proceedings of the 5th European International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Rome, Italy, July 26-28, 2022","tam 2 model mukromin kamal, ryan andriadi, habib herwanto undergraduate students, management department, faculty of binus online learning bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia mukromin.kamal@binus.ac.id, ryan.andriadi@binus.ac.id, habib.herwanto@binus.ac.id lianna wijaya faculty member, management department, faculty of binus online learning bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia lianna.wijaya@binus.ac.id","References

Results revealed that the other materials' production rate is lesser than the spray waterproofing membrane. Thus, the researcher concludes the need for more training and continuous improvement to both the operations and managers involved in the systems. Also, the availability of installation and application areas affects its good advantage, thus, recommending having better resource planning and workforce allotment to maximize its profit. The researcher recommended applying other accompanying risks to the task for further studies, such as environmental, safety, and other construction-related risks. It is also recommended to look for other linear programming programs such as LINGO and TARO software to have a vast array of solutions to the problem.","construction projects mark anthony v. santiago, rianina d. borres, and maria victorina d. rada school of industrial and engineering management, mapua university 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines 1002 mavsantiago@mymail.mapua.edu.ph; rdborres@yahoo.com; mvdrada@mapua.edu.ph",

The satellites were interconnected forming multiple clusters on the LEO orbit. To improve spectrum efficiency, a decentralized cognitive radio technique is applied. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence of the CubeSats consensus algorithm and how does the number of interconnected satellites effect the probability of detection. For future work, we should study and interconnection cluster that accounts for link failure, and satellite movement.

53,Artificial Intelligence In Procurement: An Overview And  Case Study Of Qatar Foundation,"although artificial intelligence (ai) has been reluctant to gain attraction in the procurement segment of a company, many organizations have started to see its potential in the supply chain activities since it enables numerous sectors in the evolution of their business models. ai refers to intelligent algorithms or apparatuses that are capable of autonomously and systematically performing activities or cognitions without human intervention or mental decisions. in procurement and supply chain applications, ai can enhance design and operational frameworks, data visibility and analytics, opportunity assessment, accurate report generation and contract management, etc. this paper presents opportunities and applications of ai in procurement with particular emphasis on the procurement process carried out by qatar foundation (qf). qf is a non-profit organization which has a unique system as it involves over 50 entities with different activities related to education, research, and community development. this one-of-a-kind ecosystem comprises a unique and complex supply chain model. as a result, procuring different materials and services to cope with all entities’ requirement is a challenge due to the tremendous amount of data and purchases. the use of ai methodologies is anticipated to provide multiple benefits towards achieving improvements over diverse areas.",procurement,"Industry 4.0 technologies and the digitalization of the procurement process are evolving in this field, resulting efficient decision making and increased efficiency. AI is efficient at solving complex problems containing a vast amount of data. Such a technology has the potential to manage all the data from multiple sources, including supplier management software, online catalogs, and contracts. AI can automatically consolidate data, process data, and utilize it across business operations with its set of algorithms. Applying this know-how enables clients to constantly monitor and use complex information at any phase of the procurement cycle, from supplier identification to adopting deals, monitoring invoices, and organizing orders. Besides value extraction, analysis visibility, and quick and accurate automated data integration, AI also helps customers manage procurement performance by fastening decision-making, disclosing savings and cost visibility, and using machine learning to generate reports. QF is a unique organization with different entities involved in education, research, and community development. This uniqueness in products and services created challenges in purchases categorization. Using AI by procurement department in QF will help to overcome the current challenges and will contribute in QF AI strategy. Therefore, adopting AI in procurement in QF is anticipated to provide numerous benefits for procurement and supply chain applications.

56,The Effects Of Extended Exam Time On The Performance Of  Regular Engineering Students,"usually, exam time is imposed by the educational institution to facilitate examining a huge number of students within a limited time frame. while the instructors might consider the mid-level (both in knowledge and skills) students while preparing the exams, slower students might get overlooked. in this research, four midterm exams were used to study the effect of extended exam time on the students’ performance. the four exams were given to the students with a standard established time limit, and, in a different semester, were given to another group of students with extended time. the results proved that students generally performed better in the extended time exams with higher differences for mid-level students than for top and low level. it is recommended that instructors should consider the slower (in reading, writing and/or doing calculations) students while preparing their limited time exams.","extended exam time, how much","match those of Alster (1997) and Cohen (2005) for students without learning disability. The fourth exam did not show a significant difference between students’ scores in regular time and extended time. This might be due to the nature of this exam being an ‘open book’ exam. It might also be due to the significant difference in the students’ level (measured by accumulative GPA) in favor of the regular exam time students. The given exam time extension might have closed the gap between the students. In exams 2 & 3, the results showed significant differences between top, medium and low-level students in both groups with a p-value for exam 2 ranging between 0.000 and 0.030 and the p-value for exam 3 ranging between 0.008 and 0.015. For exam 1 only medium or low-level students had significantly different scores with p-values ranging between 0.000 and 0.020. These results show that students on all levels, generally, benefited from the extended time. The effect size numbers show that middle-level students benefited more from the time extension than the other two groups in exams 1, 2, and 3. In exam 1, Cohen’s d value for mid-level students was 1.23 (very large effect) compared to 0.62 (medium to high impact) for the low-level students and no significant difference for the top-level students. In exam 2, Cohen’s d value for mid-level students was 1.94 (almost huge effect) compared to 1.17 (large effect) and 0.58 (medium to large impact) for top and low-level students, respectively. In exam 3, Cohen’s d value for mid-level students was 1.66 (very large to huge effect) compared to 1.20 (very large effect) and 1.28 (very large impact) for top and low-level students respectively. These results verify that mid-level students are the most vulnerable to the exam time limitations, as they might have the needed knowledge and skills to perform better in the exam. Still, their scores are restricted by the exam time. Results of F-test for the equality of variance indicated non-significance for all comparisons amongst exams 1-3 except for group 5 vs. group 6 and for group 1 (L) vs. group 2 (L). In both cases, the variance was significantly lower in the extended time exam with p-values 0.03 and 0.01 respectively. The values of the variance in Tables 2-4 show mixed pattern with the trend towards reduction in the extended time exams. Variance comparisons in exam 4 do not seem to provide a useful interpretation which may be due to the small size of the tested sample. 6. Conclusion As the exam time limitations, imposed by the educational institutions, might be hard to change, the research results recommend that the exam content be reviewed as the exam time might not be sufficient for all students to perform up to their level of knowledge and skills. The instructors might consider the average level (in both knowledge and skills) students’ capability to finish all questions within the given exam time. However, it is easy to overlook the slower students who might perform much better if they had extra time for reading, writing and/or doing calculations. The study in this paper is correlational in nature and does not investigate the causation behind the presented observations. Extra research in this topic is needed for better understanding. Several limitations apply to this study due to the nature of participants and structure of considered exams. As mentioned earlier in the paper, all students are senior male engineering students. Also all courses’ materials and exams are administered in English language which is the students’ second language. Exams considered do not include essay questions (short or long) and do not need sophisticated math to solve them thoroughly. 441","adham ragab associate professor, industrial engineering department king saud university, riyadh, ksa aragab@ksu.edu.sa tamer khalaf assistant professor, industrial engineering department king saud university, riyadh, ksa department of mechanical engineering, college of engineering al-azhar university, cairo, egypt tamkhalaf@ksu.edu.sa mohamed ramadam professor , industrial engineering department king saud university, riyadh, ksa ramdanmz@yahoo.com ahmed elsherbeeny assistant professor, industrial engineering department king saud university, riyadh, ksa aelsherbeeny@ksu.edu.sa","References

57,A Decision Support System For A Modified Kanbancontrolled Flowshop,"researchers and practitioners have long been interested in developing effective priority rules for a variety of production systems. implementing some of these priority rules require robust computing resources and networks to collect and analyze data in real time to provide decision support to station operators in production systems. numerous priority rules have been developed and implemented in a variety of production systems. some of these priority systems like kanban in just-in-time (jit) systems have been deployed using simple and creative ways. however, others require computing resources and networks to implement effectively. one such priority rule is nerjit that uses real time information about demand for each product and each station’s work-in-process (wip) units (ardalan, diaz, 2012). nerjit for a product in a station is determined by subtracting the wip of that product in that station and all the station’s downstream stations from demand for that product. nerjit is the amount of deficit for each product at each station. operators assign priority based on nerjit and produce products with the largest deficit. the use of this priority rule requires real time information about demand and wip for each product in each station. while nerjit priority rule is easy to understand, its calculation for each product in each station requires a nimble/real time data collection and information sharing system that can provide real-time information about the state of the system to each station. nerjit for a product at a station is determined by subtracting wip for that product in that station and its downstream stations from demand for that product. the wip for that product is the sum of the number of units of that product currently being processed in that station and all its downstream stations, the number of units of that product in the output stock points of that station and all its downstream stations, and the number of units of that product in input stock points of that station’s downstream stations. application of nerjit in a production system with dynamic order arrival creates a challenging, if not impossible, situation for station operators, especially when customer arrivals are unknown and dynamic. this priority rule can be applied only when the data for its calculation is collected and applied in real-time. this presentation discusses the information systems architecture, data flow, information systems’ resources and facilities such as scanners, radio frequency identification devices, online application processing, database technology, and a network that are necessary to implement this priority rule. the costs and benefits and sensitivity analysis of the overall system including the type and profitability of the product versus the cost of the information system will be presented. reference ardalan, a., and r. diaz, “an evaluation of the nerjit priority rule in a kanban-controlled flowshop,” production and operations management, 2012, vol. 21, no. 5, pp. 923-938.","decision support, jit, priority rule",,"ali ardalan and roya ardalan professor, faculty of information technology and decision sciences strome college of business, old dominion university, norfolk, va 23529 usa aardalan@odu.edu, rardalan@odu.edu",
58,The Effectiveness Of Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Chain In  Indonesia And Hungary,"the covid-19 pandemic has brought the importance of the supply chain of vaccines from the movement restrictions that have been imposed everywhere. vaccination is simply one step in the fight against covid-19. the procurement of the covid-19 vaccine is a critical step in promoting herd immunity and reducing viral transmission. the implementation of any immunization program is seen as a problematic element as it depends on the vaccine supply chain. to achieve a specific percentage of the population vaccinated according to the vaccination program, it requires the timeliness of the vaccines delivered, since it has become a race for public health and economic recovery. as a result, prior to vaccinating the population, governments should establish a countrywide distribution plan based on careful observation of numerous factors to ensure the success and efficiency of the vaccination campaign, therefore, securing the distribution channel is a crucial step towards a successful vaccination program. this article compares the vaccine supply chain in indonesia and hungary. needless to say, that both countries are not comparable in size, population, gdp, and many other aspects. however, the comparison is limited only on the supply chain mechanism to see its effectiveness. it is expected that the distribution of the vaccine in hungary is simpler than indonesia. this article is essentially about explanatory research, taking sources from existing literature and databases. the expected results explain the success and barrier factors affecting the streamlined distribution of covid-19 vaccines in indonesia and hungary, and what we can learn from examples of these two countries.","covid-19, effectiveness, indonesia",,"rosita widjojo faculty member, faculty of business and management, creativepreneurship study program bina nusantara university, bandung, indonesia rosita.widjojo@binus.ac.id santi setyaningsih phd student, regional science and business administration széchenyi istván university, győr, hungary setyaningsih.santi@gmail.com; setyaningsih.santi@sze.hu fachri rizky sitompul masters student, supply chain management. faculty of economics széchenyi istván university, győr, hungary sitompul.fachri.rizky@hallgato.sze.hu; fachririzkysitompul@gmail.com","References

61,Ipa Analysis Of  Service Quality (Servqual) Case Study:   The Largest Mortgage Bank In Indonesia,"the banking industry as an industry engaged in services relies on service quality as the main strategy in increasing customer satisfaction and interest in using the products offered. in indonesia, there are four state-owned enterprises in the bank industry: bank bri, bank btn, bank bni, and bank mandiri. good quality of bank services can increase customer satisfaction and can indirectly have a positive effect on increasing state revenues. this study will analyze the quality of service at a state-owned bank, the largest mortgage bank in indonesia, using the dimensions of service quality variables, namely tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy, through the ipa analysis method (importance performance analysis). this study uses survey data from 107 respondents with a total of 15 service quality attributes. ipa analysis in this study uses a cartesian diagram consisting of 4 quadrants on the cartesian diagram, namely quadrant a (priority), quadrant b (maintain service quality), quadrant c (low priority), and quadrant d (excessive). the results of this study indicate a comparison between the level of interest (expectations) of customers with the level of actual service performance.","service quality, tangible, responsiveness, reliability, assurance","Based on the explanation of the research results above, several conclusions were obtained, namely as follows: 1. Based on the results of data processing using the IPA (importance performance analysis) method, it was found that the average level of conformity of employee performance with consumer expectations is 92%, so it is considered that 15 service quality attributes of Bank X Kuningan branch office, South Jakarta have been quite satisfactory to consumers. 2. Each of the quadrants above shows the location of the Bank's service quality attributes in terms of the level of performance and level of importance. In quadrant A there are three attributes, namely RY2, RY3, and E3 where quadrant A shows a high level of importance but very low performance. Quadrant A is a top priority for the Bank to improve employee performance so that they are able to meet high consumer expectations for the three service quality attributes. 3. Quadrant B shows the service quality attributes that are already very good with a high level of importance and high performance. Quadrant B consists of five attributes, namely RY1, E2, E4, T3, and A2 so that the Bank must be able to maintain service quality on these five attributes. 4. Next is quadrant C. Quadrant C has a low priority because it is an attribute that is not too important for consumers and low employee performance. Quadrant C consists of three attributes, namely RS1, T1, and T2. 484","aini farmania fulltime lecturer management department – binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 aini.farmania@binus.edu riska dwinda elsyah program management bakrie university, jakarta indonesia riskadwinda1998@gmail.com","References

62,The  Phenomenon  Of  E-Wallet Usage In Indonesia Based  On The Theory Of Technology Acceptance Model,"the diversity of people's needs in financial context nowadays has pulled many financial companies to offer financial service using technology, the most popular is an e-wallet (electronic wallet). currently, more people are shifting their financial activity to use an e-wallet. while e-wallet has become more prevalent in many countries including indonesia, it is essential to understand the basic concept of user behavior towards e-wallet usage. based on the previous study, this phenomenon can be explained using the technology acceptance model theory. therefore, this study discusses the user's views regarding the use of e-wallet and the factors that influence behavioral intention to use based on the theory of technology acceptance model. the results of this study discuss two main factors influencing people to use an e- wallet, namely perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness",e-wallet,"This study discusses the perception of the Indonesian people regarding the use of e-wallet in conducting transactions seen from the conceptual theory of technology acceptance model (TAM) by (Davis 1989). This survey indicates that the Indonesian people percived the benefits and conveniences of e-wallet technology in assisting the transaction process and show a high interest in using e-wallet by the public. In addition, this study explains that the technology acceptance strategy designed by e-wallet companies has been successfully implemented in Indonesia. This research can provide insight to many people that the Indonesian people have a great interest in new technology and can adapt quickly as long as the technology can positively impact its users. The novelty of this study is the current perception of technology users of e-wallet in Indonesia based on the conceptual theory of TAM through the online survey. For future research we suggest to do comprehensive analysis using other variables to complete this research results.","aini farmania fulltime lecturer management department - binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 aini.farmania@binus.edu riska dwinda elsyah management program bakrie university, jakarta indonesia riskadwinda1998@gmail.com",
63,The Most Preferable Of E-Crm  Values On   Ecommerce Sector From The Users Perspective Case,"the use of e-commerce in indonesia continues to increase. one of the things that support this phenomenon is the successful implementation of e-crm strategies by e-commerce companies. e-crm is a strategy to manage the relationship between consumers and companies through technological intermediaries. this paper will explain the e- crm factors that most influence changes in customer behavior in indonesia in shopping using e-commerce platforms. the research method used is a descriptive analysis based on survey results from 780 e-commerce users spread throughout indonesia. this study indicates that there are four e-crm factors that are most desirable and affect the use of e-commerce, namely customization, interactivity, choice, and site security.","e-crm, e-commerce, customization, site security, care","Based on the results of the research above, the conclusions of this study are as follows: 1. Customization is the first important e-CRM factor to be considered by e-commerce businesses. Therefore, user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designers' ability to design the appearance of e-commerce features is an important point in ensuring the continuity of a good e-CRM strategy in e-commerce. 2. Care is the next e-CRM factor that e-commerce users in Indonesia highly consider. The ability of e-commerce customer service to solve user problems in a friendly and timely manner is an important thing in e-CRM through customer service 3. Choice is the third important e-CRM factor to consider. In Indonesia users of e-commerce in Indonesia believe that the more choices of products and shops available in e-commerce, the more reliable the e-commerce will be and can help users choose the desired product options. Therefore, e-commerce needs to continue to look for new sellers or features of various product variants in order to maintain good relationships with users in using certain e-commerce 4. Site security is the last e-CRM factor that e-commerce users in Indonesia most consider. E-commerce security in maintaining the privacy and user information provided in e-commerce is important in the e-CRM strategy.","study : indonesian market place aini farmania fulltime lecturer management department – binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 aini.farmania@binus.edu riska dwinda elsyah program management bakrie university, jakarta indonesia riskadwinda1998@gmail.com",
64,Ergonomic Improvement In A Roll-Forming Station For A  Metal-Mechanical Company,"the present research seeks to design and implement an ergonomic improvement in the roll-forming station of a metal- mechanical company, where the incidence rate for low back pain is 29.4%. the methodology used to evaluate the situation prior to the improvement was the niosh equation, where the risk of injury was found to be 3.30 at the origin and 3.57 at the destination. according to niosh benchmarks, these factors constitute a high risk of injury and urgent intervention. following the design and implementation of the improvement, the niosh equation was again used to demonstrate the decrease in risk presented by the operation. an improvement of 81.5% in the rate of lifting at the origin and 73.4% at the destination was achieved. the research presented validity in the niosh equation, helping to corroborate the effectiveness obtained by the design and implementation of an ergonomic improvement, thus reducing the probability of injury,and increasing job satisfaction.","ergonomic design, niosh equation","The purpose of this work was to find a solution to the problem found, which dealt with ergonomic failures in the profiling workstation. Through different methods and instruments, the risk of lumbar injury of the operators in the mentioned area was reduced. Also, job satisfaction was increased, and this was verified after surveying workers at workstation. Using the revised NIOSH equation, it was possible to measure the risk of injury before and after the implementation of the improvement, which was significantly reduced, and improved by 81.5% at the starting position and 73.4% at the destination. Some limitations found throughout the study were the suitability of the hydraulic table for the workstation, as it needed to be relatively small and easy to maneuver, and the initial investment of the table, which will eventually reduce visits to the physician and save costs.","martin camet, frank tweddle universidad de lima, escuela de ingeniería y arquitectura, carrera de ingeniería industrial, lima, perú 20172853@aloe.ulima.edu.pe , 20162594@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidadde lima, instituto de investigación científica, grupo tecnologías exponenciales, carrera de ingeniería industrial, lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",

67,"A Study To Analyze The Impacts Of Covid-19 On The  Textile Industry: Evidence From Bursa, Turkey","at the end of the year 2019, the world has been faced with new coronavirus pandemic, and it affected people’s lives, the environment, the economy, and businesses in different sectors. during the pandemic, many sectors and businesses tried to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic and tried to turn crises into opportunities. the textile sector - which has a big share in turkey’s economy in terms of export and production volume- was affected during the pandemic. this study aims to analyze the economic impacts of the new coronavirus pandemic and yearly based comparison analyses on the textile sector in bursa, turkey. two questionnaires containing twenty-four questions were applied to 241 textile companies in bursa. data were analyzed with spss (statistical package for social sciences) 25.0 software. analysis results showed that most of the participants have negative opinions in terms of the economy, and they have economic worries post-covid-19. tested hypotheses also showed the significant differences between operation year, legal status, the market of businesses, and the monthly turnover of companies and how they were affected by covid-19. internationally serving and operating for many years, corporations or limited companies have an advantage and less negative opinion. study results also pointed out increased lead time of raw material and delivery time in 2021 compared to 2019.","coronavirus, questionnaire, supply chain","and Recommendations In this study, the Coronavirus Pandemic impact on the textile sector in Bursa, Turkey was analyzed. SPSS 25 software was used for the analysis. To analyze the economic impact on the textile sector, three subsets; COVID-19 effect on the sustainability of economic activities, opinions on economic policies implemented in COVID-19, and economic forecasts for post-COVID-19 analyzed. In terms of the sustainability of economic activities, most of the participants thought of decreasing the number of employees working at the company. In the scope of economic policies implemented during COVID-19, participants pointed out they couldn’t profit from the benefits which were given and taken precautions were not sufficient. They also thought economic recovery will take a long time and inflation and unemployment will increase post-COVID-19. These opinions revealed that the textile sector in Bursa was affected negatively in terms of the economy and participants have economic worries for post-COVID-19. To mitigate negative effects and stimulate the economy after the pandemic, economic support packages of states have gained importance and should be better prepared. Developed hypotheses were also tested and analyzed. Results showed that companies were affected differently according to their operation year. 21 and above years operating companies had a less negative opinion. That can be related to their experience and knowledge about how to manage a crisis. Companies were affected differently according to their legal status and their market. The sole proprietorship has more negative opinions about pandemics, so the importance of being institutional became apparent during the pandemic. Internationally serving companies have fewer negative opinions than national and local ones. Results showed that companies were affected differently according to their monthly turnover. In the years 2019 and 2021 firms whose monthly turnover is less than 1,000,000, TL have a more negative opinion. That was probably related to the size of the company. Companies that have less turnover were affected more negatively. This study’s results showed the effects of some important characteristics of companies against the pandemic. Internationally serving and operating for many years, corporations or limited companies have an advantage and less negative opinion. In the final stage, different criteria, such as monthly operation capacity, the average number of monthly employees, average delivery time, and average lead time, were compared based on years. Participants pointed out that average delivery time and average lead time significantly increased. Increased deadlines and delivery times related to the pandemic resulted in disrupted transportation activities, decreased working capacity, and lockdowns. But, compared to 2019, in the 2021 monthly operation capacity, the average number of monthly employees increased in the textile sector in Bursa. This can be related to increased production volume and the development of the textile sector in Bursa. 549","melike bulur and eren özceylan industrial engineering department gaziantep university, turkey bulurmelike1@gmail.com, eozceylan@gantep.edu.tr, cihan çetinkaya management information systems department adana alparslan turkes science and technology university, turkey ccetinkaya@atu.edu.tr","References

68,Model To Determine Humidity Level Of Cloud Seeding For  Agribusinesses In Mexico City,"non-renewable resources are being depleted at a faster rate and consequently can cause a strong asymmetry in marginalized cities and towns, a resource as vital as water is a gift of nature that is not valued as it deserves, and the lack of it can be a high-risk factor causing serious economic, social, and health problems (unhcr 2019). that is why the research objective is to design an industrial application model for the capture of atmospheric water, focused especially on agribusinesses in mexico city. the design of the model is based on the models of cloud seeding (super and heimbach 1983) and fog trapping (bautista et al. 2018), applying the analytical mechanics model (zayas 2019). the main contribution of this research is that the proposal of this model supports the fulfillment of three sustainable development goals of the 2030 agenda: sdg 2. zero hunger; sdg 6. clean water and sanitation and sdg 9. responsible consumption and production.","cloud seeding, fog sublimation, atmospheric water","According to the documentary research, we propose the design of a device that efficiently allows the collection of water, that is, without using Silver Iodide (add a conclusive figure, the good thing about this model is and add comparative analysis advantages and disadvantages), significantly decreasing the operating costs and increasing the amount of water collected through the conditions of pressure, temperature and relative humidity in agribusinesses located in Mexico City. In this way, we actively contribute to the fulfillment of three of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are: SDG 2. Zero Hunger, due to obtaining the expected harvests to meet current and future demand without interruptions in the supply chain, SDG 6. Clean Water and Sanitation, facilitating access to atmospheric water in indigenous peoples and marginalized areas, not only for domestic use but with a business approach since up to 70% of the water used in the world is used for irrigation. SDG 9. Responsible Production and Consumption, population growth exerts a strong pressure and demand for available resources, which is why we must optimize available resources to maintain the current lifestyle.","victor martin maldonado-benitez, gabriela guadalupe escobedo-guerrero esca santo tomás, instituto politécnico nacional, mexico city, mexico vmaldonadob1500@alumno.ipn.mx; gescobedog@ipn.mx; gabrielaeg@hotmail.com; gabrielaeg@hotmail.com; lila margarita bada-carbajal instituto tecnológico superior de álamo temapache, tecnológico nacional de méxico veracruz, mexico lila.bc@alamo.tecnm.mx antonio uribe-méndez, brenda esmeralda moreno-garduño esca santo tomás, instituto politécnico nacional, mexico city, mexico auribeme@ipn.mx;auribeme@ipn.mx; bmorenog1500@alumno.ipn.mx",
69,Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts For Sustainable Food  Waste Management And Collaborations,"food waste is a significant problem in modern society. it is well documented that about one-third of the food produced globally is lost or wasted, harming the firms’ economic, environmental, and social sustainability. this problem is evident in supermarkets and restaurants, which are the most important wasters after households and agriculture. in most cases, supermarkets use new technologies to manage expiry dates, tackle food waste via implementing dynamic pricing and encourage customers to buy near-to-expired over fresher products. however, these practices are not sufficient to guarantee the achievement of sustainability. supermarkets need to cooperate with more parties such as their counterparts (other supermarkets), restaurants, online selling platforms, fertilizer producers, and charities besides their general customers. this study introduces a framework that uses blockchain-based smart contracts to manage the cooperation between supermarkets and other parties with the goal of reducing food waste and seeking to achieve sustainable targets. a smart contract is an appealing feature of blockchain technology to facilitate and automatically execute the terms of an agreement once the specified conditions are met. we analyze the benefits that a smart contract grants to supermarkets to manage food waste in a sustainable way.","food waste, blockchain, smart contract","In this paper, the application of smart contracts for making decisions regarding the surplus inventories at the supermarkets is studied. A sample algorithm is developed to check the proper conditions for executing agreements between the supermarket and other parties including minimarkets, restaurants, online stores, and charities at the beginning of each quality period to avoid food waste and increase the revenue of the supermarket at the end of the evaluation period. The quality periods are categorized based on the expiration dates of the products and the selling price will reduce when the quality level decreases. To automatically execute agreements, the system considers various factors such as the prices that are offered by different parties, the inventory levels, discount rate, donation rate, and the rank or priority of the parties when they offer identical prices for the products. This platform can help all of the parties to provide for their needs at a reasonable price and avoid food waste. Making decisions about the surplus inventories when they have a higher quality would be more efficient rather than trying to sell them when they have poor quality. In future research, different scenarios and algorithms can be examined to find proper strategies for executing the terms of agreements between the supermarket and other parties considering specified conditions. Moreover, a cost-benefit analysis can be done for implementing a smart contract platform as well as the possibility of outsourcing its implementation, maintenance, and monitoring to a third-party company.","behzad maleki vishkaei and pietro de giovanni department of business and management luiss university, rome, italy bmalekivishkaei@luiss.it, pdegiovanni@luiss.it",

71,Consumer Loyalty To The Use Of E-Marketplaces In  Indonesia: A Systematic Literature Review,to find out what factors significantly affect consumer loyalty in using e-marketplaces and what methods can be used to obtain loyalty data. technological developments play a major role in humans and have a changing impact on the business world. electronic commerce today is known to continue to increase every year and this is realized by the increasing number of developments in information technology. consumer loyalty in using e-marketplace applications can be observed from the actions taken repeatedly in using the same application. the research method used in this study is to use a systematic literature review on research journals published in 2017–2021 with three research questions and use 11 journals to conduct further analysis and discussion. the results obtained based on 11 journals that have been analyzed state that there are various factors that influence consumer loyalty and e- service quality is the most significant and most discussed factor and the data collected mostly uses quantitative methods.,"consumer loyalty, e – marketplace","Based on the results of the research that has been done, it can be seen that the systematic literature review research method can be used to analyze consumers in the e-commerce industry and provide comprehensive analysis results. From the research that has been done, it can be concluded as follows: 1. Found factors that influence customer loyalty, namely the existence of e-service quality, trust from customers, e-satisfaction, brand image owned, advertising, price discounts, brand equity, value equity, perception of price, convenience of services provided, as well as corporate image. 2. The most significant factor influencing customer loyalty is e-service quality which is the factor with the most contribution. 3. The research method that is focused on examining customer loyalty factors is mostly quantitative methods. However, there are several studies that also use quantitative methods or a combination of both. The limitations experienced when creating this systematic literature review were based on a generally limited set of key words, and using the Google Scholar database to compile journal papers from 2017 to 2021. 7. Suggestion From the conclusions that have been made, the following are suggestions that we can give for further research: 1. The next systematic literature review would be better if using topics that have a larger number of samples and topics that are easier to find so that more data can be obtained. 2. E-commerce in Indonesia must prioritize and focus on the e-service quality provided in order to increase or maintain the loyalty of its customers.","haryadi sarjono, adi teguh suprapto, alifa zulaykha, andre gunawan, jason, jessy felicia chai binus business school undergraduate, bina nusantara university jl. k.h. syahdan no.9, palmerah, jakarta barat, indonesian 11480 haryadi_s@binus.ac.id, aditeguhs992@binus.ac.id, alifa.zulaykha@binus.ac.id, andre.gunawan001@binus.ac.id, jason021@binus.ac.id, jessy.chai@binus.ac.id",

The quality of human resources has an important role in increasing the value of the company which will indirectly increase incoming investment due to the increased productivity and efficiency of the company. The quality of Indonesian human resources is still low, there are many gaps to improve the productivity, skills, abilities and capabilities of these workers so that training and conditions from the company play an important role in improving the quality of human resources. Efforts to improve the quality of human resources itself can be done by providing periodic training that is appropriate for each different group of existing human resources to improve the capabilities, skills and values of the human resources themselves and carry out regular control over the level of ability and skills to increase worker productivity. Especially for the Indonesian textile and textile product industry, which absorbs a lot of labor and is an industry that is expected to be superior and help the country's economy in the future and can develop and increase its level of competitiveness in the international sphere. This research is expected to be an aid for the Government to pay more attention to the textile industry, especially small and medium-sized companies as well as in designing new policies regarding further improving the quality of human resources to prepare future generations for global changes.

75,"Project ""Schedule Is Different"" Why? And  What Should Be Done About It?","the portion of projects in the industrial activity is growing. one major cause are the rapid changes of product and models which force more frequent conduct of development projects. in the short history of project management as a self stand discipline, it is well known that many projects fail to wholly meet their planned objectives. a major reason to this reality is that projects last time. often, very long time. this results in knowledge deficiencies and high levels of uncertainties. to improve projects' performances, substantial efforts are invested in project control, which is aimed at assuring that the project meets its planned objectives within budget and no later than a specified deadline. accordingly, schedule is a prime concern in project control. it had been observed, however, that 'schedule is different' in the sense that it is known that schedule (performance) indicators of methods for project control fail to provide good information. here it is proposed that the cause for this shortcoming is the fundamental difference between costs and duration in projects. the duration of the project is determined by only a subset of its activities as oppose to the project's cost, which is the sum of the costs of its components. this is the notion of criticality: the critical path, or critical chain – project's duration is determined by its critical activities. a direct consequence of this distinction is that the analysis and evaluation of control data at the project level can be misleading. this issue is discussed and demonstrated. moreover, schedule and schedule control provide foremost input to the coordination of the project's operation – the synchronization between the various resources which are required for each activity. hence, in this aspect, too, the relevant information should be developed and provided at the activity level. in response, it is argued that project control data should be processed, analyzed and evaluated at the activity level. a framework to implement this approach is proposed and its benefits are discussed.","earned value, earned duration",,"moshe eben chaime contract professor department of industrial engineering & management ben gurion university of the negev, be'er sheva, israel even@bgu.ac.il",

This research has answered the question a research designed, where Danone-AQUA has been proven to help the implementation of SDGs in Indonesia through the #BijakBerplastik program which has been running since 2018. The data we have compiled shows that Danone- AQUA is strategically aligned to implement SDGs points in Indonesia, through collaboration with partners such as building water absorption wells, developing education about the importance of plastic recycling, and building green system-based technology to tackle plastic waste in the ocean. The #BijakBerplastik program not only has a good impact on improving the company's image and economic value, but can create shared value for the parties involved, such as the community feeling good environmental changes because the percentage of plastic waste is reduced, and partners participating in the collaboration get balanced benefits. Therefore, this research is also very important because we provide a practical contribution to the topic of CSR in Indonesia and contribute to the development of research that will be researched in the future.","corporate social responsibility (csr) program: case study #bijakberplastik campaign diana josephine afifah and roseno aji affandi international relations department, faculty of humanities bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 diana.afifah@binus.ac.id, roseno.affandi@binus.ac.id",

78,Determination Of Occupational Stress Factors Of Firefighters  In Kuwait,"firefighters can be considered one the most stressful occupations as they are often responding to emergencies in a time-constrained environment while frequently performing hazardous activities, and may even get complaints from the public when they are not satisfied. firefighters’ missions are very sensitive and critical as their work is related to saving people and the environment from fire hazards. the nature of firefighters’ operation, which includes saving people, offering medical assistance, going through debris, etc. made “attention” to be an essential component in their work. if attention is lost while performing their decisions, this would lead to severe consequences for both people and property. one of the reasons of attention loss is to be under occupational stress. this paper explores the key factors of occupational stress among firefighters in kuwait. the work is based on a series of interviews, which are engaged from the perspective of psychological contract, as a mean to explore the different areas that could be related to high stress levels among the firefighters in the region. the interviews use psychological contract as an exploratory tool that partially guides the dialogue among a series of potential factors in their lifestyle and work environment, expectations, etc. the collected data is analyzed on a one by one basis, to categorize and identify which of the topics discussed is more relevant as an occupational stressor for the firefighters. the results show that witnessing and experiencing traumatic events during missions, and fear of injuries are the top stressors among the firefighters in the region, and that perception regarding the presence of stressors is inversely correlated with age.","occupational stress, stressors","and Validations The following two stressors are identified in firefighters in Kuwait, as shown in the top 2 of table 2: Stressor 1: Witnessing and experiencing traumatic events during missions (from topic 2, rank 1).

80,Empowering Innovative Team Among Knowledge Workers:  Mcclelland'S Needs Theory With Rasch Model Analysis,"human capital components are seen as critical knowledge resources for long-term success. as a result, knowledge sharing has become an essential component of organizational innovation. individual and organizational learning, performance, job satisfaction, and creative behaviors are predicted in knowledge sharing. personal objectives and needs, according to experts, have a significant impact on human behavior, such as creativity and innovativeness. most need-based motivation theories assume very identical fundamental needs. achievement, affiliation, and power describe the three basic psychological needs. this study aims to contribute to current research on mcclelland's needs theory in knowledge management, especially team knowledge sharing. the research used rasch model analysis and multiple regression to examine mcclelland's theory of needs in team knowledge sharing among knowledge workers in a service-oriented business. these rasch results prove that team knowledge sharing varies greatly depending on the needs for achievement, affiliation, and power. while the regression analysis results also reveal that the need for achievement is greater than the effect of the need for affiliation on knowledge sharing. on the other hand, the need for power has a detrimental influence on information sharing.",rasch model,"Knowledge and learning have emerged as critical components in retaining competitiveness in an increasingly complicated, global, fast-paced corporate environment. The effectiveness of individuals, teams, and/or units is heavily reliant on how successfully information is transferred between individuals and/or groups. Human capital components are seen as knowledge resources. In the knowledge-based model, it is critical for long- term success in terms of innovation. As a result, knowledge sharing is an essential component of knowledge management. Individual and organizational learning, performance, job satisfaction, and innovative capabilities are all predicted by knowledge sharing. The Person Map Recapitulation reveals that the desire for connection is the most powerful motivation, with the greatest logit value. It implies that these knowledge workers are more likely to engage in team activities that foster interdependence and collaboration with others. They cherish friendship and prefer cooperation over competition. All hypotheses are statistically accepted. These findings suggest that team knowledge sharing differs significantly depending on the needs for achievement, affiliation, and power. The regression analysis findings also suggest that the need for achievement is more significant than the effect of the need for affiliation on knowledge sharing. Although intimate ties among team members might enhance team knowledge sharing, the capacity to solve problems creatively has a more significant influence on knowledge sharing. On the other hand, the need for power has a detrimental influence on knowledge sharing. It suggests that team members with a strong need for power will dominate their work teams. They impose their will since they wish to constantly issue commands to other team members and shut their discussion room. It can have a detrimental influence on team performance and team spirit. The study still has limitations. First, using the research instrument in other service businesses such as hospitality, education, or public service is preferable. Other organizational characteristics, such as leadership and organizational culture, should be included. Finally, more items should be included in the research instrument to address McClelland's need theory in the local cultural context.","maria grace herlina*, randy hadipoespito, jefta harlianto senior lecturer, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 herlina01@binus.edu, randy.hadipoespito@binus.edu, jefta@binus.edu","references and

81,Determinants Of Dividend Policy Of Family Firms In  Indonesia,"this study aims to determine the effect of firm growth, leverage, profitability, institutional ownership, board size, and inflation variables on dividend policy. the object of this research is family firms classified as manufacturing firms on the indonesia stock exchange (idx) in 2017-2020. selected by purposive random sampling technique, the study used 144 samples from 36 family firms that met the criteria. panel data regression results showed that, partially, leverage has a negative and significant effect on dividend policy while profitability has a positive and significant effect. furthermore, firm growth, inflation, institutional ownership, and board size have no significant effect on dividend policy. the implication is that if investors want to choose firms that pay out high dividends, they must choose firms with low leverage and high profitability. firms must be able to try to have lower leverage and continue to generate high profits to be able to distribute dividends.","dividend policy, family firm, inflation","This study examines the effect of firm growth, leverage, profitability, institutional ownership, board size, and inflation on dividend policy in family firms classified as manufacturing firms in Indonesia in 2017-2020. Statistical test results showed that, simultaneously, firm growth, leverage, profitability, institutional ownership, board size, and inflation have an effect on dividend policy. Partially, leverage has a significant and negative effect on dividend policy and profitability has a significant and positive effect on dividend policy. Furthermore, firm growth and inflation have no significant and negative effect on dividend policy. Meanwhile, institutional ownership and board size have no positive effect on dividend policy. The results of this study are expected to be beneficial for firms and investors. Firms that distribute low dividends need to pay attention to the interests of capital owners with the right level of leverage ratio for the use of profits for debt payments and dividend distribution. In this case, firms can do internal anticipation by identifying the financial conditions that must be maintained so that they can make wise decisions for the future. In addition, investors or potential investors in family firms can look through indicators of leverage ratios and profitability to assess high or low dividends. The results of this study indicate that family firms classified as manufacturing firms that pay high dividends have an indication of low leverage and high profitability. The determinants analyzed in this study are limited to the six variables of firm growth, leverage, profitability, institutional ownership, board size, and inflation. Many other factors can affect dividend policy. Therefore, it is suggested for further researchers to study more independent variables to provide additional findings and further discussions on the tendency of dividend policy expropriation in family firms.","farida titik kristanti faculty of economics and business telkom university, bandung, west java, indonesia faridatk@telkomuniversity.ac.id febiananda tasya wardani faculty of economics and business telkom university, bandung, west java, indonesia febiananda@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id",
82,A Comparative Study On Skill Development Between Male  And Female Expatriates In Taiwan,"due to the rising growth of international collaboration, organizations have a higher need to employ expatriates. both scholars and practitioners have acknowledged that skill development plays a crucial role in here to mitigate failures in the competitive international business environment. within this paradigm, studies have highlighted that skill development is somewhat connected to how satisfied an expatriate feels in their job. interestingly, there seems to be an interplay between the international experiences of males and females taking gender differences into consideration. within this context, we aim to examine how job satisfaction is linked to skill development among expatriates working in taiwan and do a gender-wise comparison. data was collected from 133 expatriates working in taiwan using an online questionnaire. results show that both men and women expatriates on average are rated quite differently in terms of both job satisfaction and skill development. the results for moderation analysis show that even if female expatriates felt very satisfied with their opportunities for acquiring new skills, they were not to able take full advantage of the opportunities around for developing new skills and knowledge. this study calls for more action to be taken from the human resources department at both the expatriate’s home as well as the host country to create better opportunities for women to participate in more international assignments.","expatriates, gender differences, skill development, satisfaction",,"somya agrawal college of informatics chaoyang university of technology, taichung, taiwan asomya@gm.cyut.edu.tw yindhika lawrence* college of humanities and social sciences chaoyang university of technology, taichung, taiwan jlawrance78@gmail.com","References

84,Analysis Of The Impact Of The Covid-19 Pandemic On Key  Supply Chain Processes Through System Dynamics,"the pandemic caused by the covid-19 virus has had negative effects on different industrial sectors, the world economy and especially on supply chains. the pandemic revealed the vulnerability of key logistics processes of companies and their supply chains as operational risks increased, causing breaks in inventories, production lines and the distribution process caused by increased customer demand. however, this pandemic makes it necessary to re- evaluate the models and strategies that companies had established as the standard, and more was needed to face the shortage of components, raw materials and inputs needed to keep the production processes active. therefore, this article proposes developing a conceptual model under the system dynamics methodology, which allows identifying the main impacts that the covid-19 pandemic had on the performance of the supply chain through the design of causal loop diagrams.","covid-19, supply chain, system dynamics","Causal Loop Diagrams are a System Dynamics tool that allows for identifying the causal relationships between the key variables of a system. In this article, it was possible to identify the impacts generated by COVID-19 on the key logistic processes of a Supply Chain, which are: procurement, production and distribution. 58 feedback loops were identified, of which 24 are reinforcing, and 34 are balancing. With the proposed causal diagram, a simulation model was developed using STELLA ARCHITECT ® software. The simulation model allowed us to analyze and evaluate some causal relationships, such as the impact that COVID-19 has on the employees' contagion and how their absence can affect the production process. Likewise, two scenarios were proposed; the first one evaluated what would happen in the production process if 50% of the employees had been vaccinated, with the result that this would have a positive impact on the production process since there would be less contagion and production would remain stable. The second scenario evaluated what would happen if 80% of the employees had been vaccinated; the simulator showed that although there would be contagions in at least 5 employees, these would not affect the company's operations, and the ethanol production process would remain continuous. 710","lucero ixmatlahua lópez and cuauhtémoc sánchez ramírez division of research and postgraduate studies tecnologico nacional de méxico/instituto tecnologico de orizaba, orizaba, veracruz, mexico l18010056@orizaba.tecnm.mx, cuauhtemoc.sr@orizaba.tecnm.mx jorge luis garcía alcaraz department of industrial engineering and manufacturing autonomous university of ciudad juárez, ciudad juárez, chihuahua, mexico jorge.garcia@uacj.mx arturo realyvazquez and karina cecilia arredondo soto departamento de ingeniería industrial tecnológico nacional de méxico/instituto tecnológico de tijuana, tijuana, mexico arturo.realyvazquez@tectijuana.edu.mx, karina.arredondo@tectijuana.edu.mx yara anahí jiménez nieto faculty of accounting and administration, universidad veracruzana campus ixtaczoquitlán, ixtaczoquitlán, veracruz, mexico yjimenez@uv.mx","References

85,Mining Process Systems In The Industry 4.0 Mandate  Towards The Plant Of Future,"the interplaying of advanced technologies of the industry 4.0 (i4) mandate towards the mines of the future creates a smart connected mining industry that transforms vast amounts of data into predictive and fully integrated intelligent systems. thus, additional safety, stability, and predictability can be achieved to maximize efficiency while minimizing operating and capital costs. in addition, the road to overcoming mining challenges is fundamentally human-centered and has inclusive socio-economic development or what is known as sustainable development (sd) at its core. throughout the production value chain, the mining sector faces various economic, geopolitical, social, and technological hurdles. innovative manufacturing methods are required to introduce the next digital generation into the raw material area all the way to the tailings area. in the realm of increasing process automation, i4 applications are currently trending in the mining industry. this paper explores and debates process systems and automation outlook focusing on future automation systems in the context of minerals engineering, where mines can be categorized into human-governed, semi-self-governed, self-governed, and virtual mines. the paper discusses mining field challenges and opportunities and concludes with a discussion and future research paths in process system engineering prompted by i4 innovative system architecture.","automation, industry 4.0, process, human-centered","Employing integrated advanced technologies into the mining industry unveils competitive advantages. Such as, first, greater accuracy and fast decision-making at which mining operations involve extensive processing of real-time data to share instant directives to the control units. Integrating BDA and ML can help mining companies collect data and deliver insightful on-site decisions to streamline processes by reducing the chances of errors. Second, health and safety where better and faster decision-making is a key factor in improving the health and safety of mineworkers as AI help them by reducing their exposure to dangerous situations in mining. Therefore, shifting the industry from a people- oriented to a process-oriented. Third, efficiency-boosting by deriving patterns from previously accumulated huge data sets can drive efficiency by increasing processes' consistency and quality and reducing the chances of human errors. Forth, reducing environment footprints by embedding AI and ML into the previously existing systems can help the mining industry to reduce energy demand by reducing the environmental footprints. Smart manufacturing is transforming industrial processes and communities into the so-called society 5.0, enabling the emergence of a new industry-society-environment nexus. Integrating sensing, calculating, and actuating innovative technologies enables data-driven setups and automated decision-making executions. In the meantime, humans operate mining operations substantially with the assistance of software to make decisions. However, in this field, the expanding use of autonomous robots is critical for dealing with risks and extreme conditions as no or little labour is required. Therefore, creative production systems require information and communication technology, advanced modelling and solving algorithms, and auxiliary mechatronics. Mining's changing progressive evolution and rising complexity can be divided into four main categories: economic effects with macroeconomic variables, technological obstacles, geopolitical impacts, and socio-ecological influences. The direction to overcoming mining difficulties is primarily human-centered, with comprehensive socioeconomic development, often known as sustainable development. Digital transformation, as an enabler solution for the next generation of mines, strives to provide a supportive environment for industry-wide transformation, bringing us closer to the mine of the future. Starting with existing mines nomenclature, the roadmap can be illustrated in four phases, including human-governed, semi-self- governed, self-governed, and virtual mines. 719","mohammed yaqot and brenno c. menezes division of engineering management & decision sciences, college of science and engineering hamad bin khalifa university, doha, qatar foundation, qatar myaqot@hbku.edu.qa, bmenezes@hbku.edu.qa","References

89,The Impact Of Production And Operations Within Transport  Management Supply Chain Industry.,"this research is based on the supply chain and covers operations management perspective. discussed below are how choices made at the primary level of organizations affect operations and production. this study further goes on to describe how transport management as one of the key factors in operations, aid in getting a continuous flow in operational processes and in turn an increase in production levels. factors such as communication, edi implementations, warehousing and order fulfillment are extensively discussed as constituents of transport management. the relevance and consequences of the aforementioned factors are discussed to show the reader why and how they relate to transport management and ultimately to operations and production. this paper has discussed supply chain processes necessary for success, namely: order fulfillment, warehousing, transportation, and edi implementations. our findings blended a list of causes, effects, and solutions to provide insight to organizations as to how production processes can be handled and how a unified system can be achieved. as aforementioned in today's rapidly increasing competitive markets, customers' expectations and demands, as well as an understanding of the organization’s current performance, can provide companies with an upper hand in their respective markets. the problem is not doing the wrong things, it is doing the right things the wrong way.","edi implementation, communication, order fulfillment",", keeping your business processes running smoothly is critical to the health of your organization. Think about the things your company needs to succeed and then implement a strategy that works for you. 5. Recommendations Upon analysing the importance of outbound logistics strategies that encompass transportation, operations and production, it is vital when delivering materials that shortfalls are recognised -and diagnosed. To improve the delivery accuracy on the supply of materials to companies, every activity directly contributing to the movement of materials needs to be managed. Distribution management is a dynamic tool that if executed properly-can greatly influence the supply of materials. Distribution management can include inventory, transportation, and warehousing management (Kalakota & Ricker 1999). Accuracy can make efficiency through planning, scheduling, and monitoring. Planning demands a combination of cycles of organising and collecting information and data about supply chains and strategies for product distribution (Astafieva et al. 2019). Assessing internal systems with a consumer’s perspective in mind is what creates a distinct variation in delivery offerings. Suppliers need to carefully investigate what methods send the materials send and deliver goods on time and at the right place-this encompasses planning your distribution channels. Price, quality, speed, safety, users’ budgets, and regular practices influence the decision of transport mode (Islam 2013). When it comes to delivering goods and improving this process, it is essential that suppliers consider all factors when selecting a transport mode or route. The transport mode chosen must be appropriate for not only the material/product type, but also the delivery specifications and customer’s expectations and standard. Scheduling looks at resource management and alignment (Simeunovic 2017). Optimising all the supplier’s resources to reach the customer and fulfil the order by sending the right product, at the right time and at the right place for right the price. Certain resources could include the improvement of information technology systems and software.

GHG emissions from the original 390 thousand tons CO2-eq decreased to 292 thousand tons CO2-eq with a decrease in GHG emissions per tons’ nickel in ferronickel by 3.79 CO2-eq (from 15.04 tons CO2-eq to 11.25 tons CO2-eq). Carbon tax from the original 1.95 million USD decreased to 1.46 million USD. The reduction in carbon tax per tons of nickel in ferronickel is 19 USD (from 75.2 USD to 56.2 USD).","company achmad gunawan wibisono student, faculty of industrial engineering university of indonesia achmad.gunawan11@ui.ac.id fajar marhaendra student, faculty of industrial engineering university of indonesia fajar.marhaendra@ui.ac.id immanuel roosevelt student, faculty of industrial engineering university of indonesia immanuel.roosevelt@ui.ac.id",
96,Comparison Of Porter’S Generic Strategies In Indonesia’S  Fashion Retail Companies: A Case Study,"indonesia's retail industry for the fashion sector continues to grow rapidly due to an increase in per capita income and an increase in the upper-middle class. the fast globalization has forced the fashion industry to grow rapidly to cope with global trends. the need for clothing as the basic need of human life makes the fashion industry remain a sustainable industry despite globalization. even though the fashion industry provides basic need such as clothing but fashion retailer needs a strategy to not just survive the fashion retail business but also lead the fashion retail market. the formulation of strategy is important for a company to withstand the market challenge and become the leader in the market. by using porter’s generic strategies, fashion retail companies are assessed and compared their financial performance. in this research, we analyze the financial performance of the company pt. ramayana lestari sentosa tbk, pt matahari department store tbk, and pt mitra adiperkasa tbk. the goal is to assess their financial performance based on porter’s generic strategies. this financial analysis is an encouragement either for the entrepreneurs to start fashion businesses or small businesses to continue developing since in the future fashion business is always tempting for investors and customers.",fashion retail,"The purpose of this study is to compare the implementation of Porter's generic strategy and analyze the impact of its implementation on the company's financial performance. Three Porter's generic strategies analyzed are cost leadership, differentiation strategy, and focus strategy. Three fashion retail companies in Indonesia, namely PT. Ramayana Lestari Sentosa Tbk, PT Matahari Department Store Tbk, and PT Mitra Adiperkasa Tbk were chosen to be the objects of this research. The results of this study indicate that these three fashion retail companies have successfully implemented Porter's generic strategy. Based on qualitative analysis, namely fashion brands, product price range, and market, Ramayana adopted a cost leadership strategy - low cost, Matahari adopted a cost leadership - best value strategy, while Mitra Adiperkasa adopted a differentiation strategy. Based on the company's financial performance (ROA, ROE, and Net Profit Margin), the order of the company's financial performance from highest to lowest is Matahari, Ramayana, and Mitra Adiperkasa. Because of the retail bifurcation trend, it can be stated that retailers who implemented a cost leadership strategy, which targets the low- income market, perform better than those who implemented a differentiation strategy, which targets the middle- income market. 833","aqil athalla reksoprodjo, hafizh rifqi, muthia khadijah industrial engineering department faculty of engineering universitas indonesia","References

A Proposal Based On A,"companies have been forced to adapt quickly to the industry 4.0 paradigm in order to obtain, or at least maintain, their competitiveness. digital transformation has been one of the ways that companies have found to adapt their processes, to make them as effective and efficient as possible. for this, there is an emerging need for methodologies that guide this digitalisation processes in companies that already operate with traditional management methodologies, capitalising on the effort that companies have already put into philosophies such as lean manufacturing. this article aims to propose a roadmap to monitor the digitalisation of processes based on traditional management methodologies (pdca, sdca and lean) and processes (bpm and bpmn), also presenting a tool that supports one of the steps of this methodology. aligned with this methodology and in this investigation context, a tool was also developed using microsoft excel, entitled diyd (do it yourself digitalization) which aims to help the digital transformation. this tool, based on a process-oriented language, was used to map the company's processes, facilitating the identification of their flaws and achieving opportunities for improvement. the construction of this roadmap (for the process of dematerialisation and digitalisation of processes) was based on a practical experience in the industrial context with the objective of contributing to the achievement of world class manufacturing status and operational excellence. in this way it is possible to fill the gap in the strategies for the development of digital transformation, integrating lean tools in its base.","bpmn2.0, lean manufacturing, sdca, pdca, digitization 845",,"practical case juliana basulo ribeiro department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) university of aveiro, 3010-193, aveiro, portugal basulojuliana@ua.pt juliana salvadorinho institute of electronics and informatics engineering of aveiro (ieeta), department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) university of aveiro, 3010-193, aveiro, portugal juliana.salvadorinho@ua.pt marlene amorim research unit on governance, competitiveness & public policies (govcopp) and department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) university of aveiro, 3010-193, aveiro, portugal mamorim@ua.pt leonor teixeira institute of electronics and informatics engineering of aveiro (ieeta), governance, competitiveness and public policies (govcopp), department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) university of aveiro, 3010-193, aveiro portugal lteixeira@ua.pt","References

Blue Bird Group performs geographic segmentation by selecting several cities with high mobility distribution to offer company services, as well as psychological segmentation by imaging itself as a ""good"" taxi service provider, so that consumers are influenced and give trust to the company. For the special passenger transportation business, Blue Bird categorizes its services into several subsidiaries for different target markets. In general, taxis that have a blue or metallic blue color target the general public segment. The main target of consumers with a background aged 25 years and over, as well as the target market for consumers who want a good quality, safe and comfortable trip. In the Executive segment, Blue Bird provides Silver Bird with its black fleet. The main concentration of Blue Bird company is to maintain the quality of service to customers.

102,A Structural Model For Adoption Of Omnichannel Apparel  Retailing In India,"omnichannel translates to an integrated sales experience that melds the advantages of physical stores with the information-rich experience of online shopping.omnichannel customers are unifying digital with the brick-and mortar enterprises for searching information and purchasing products. this study aims to identify motivating factors or determinantsfor adoption of omnichannel retailing amongst indian customers in the context of apparel industry. it also analyses contextual and hierarchicalinterrelationships amongst identified determinants for developing a structural (or conceptual) model for omnichannel adoption of apparel retailing(oaar) in india. the study is based on (a) descriptive research for identifying the determinants for adoption of omnichannel retailing, and (b)total interpretive structural modelling (tism) approach to understandthe relationship structure amongst theidentified determinants and to develop a structural model for adoption of omnichannel retailing. based on tism approach followed, out of various identified determinants for oaar, it appears that the determinants: technological development, improved shopping experience and integrated supply chain are crucial ones. these determinants also form underlying basisforhabit, personalization, and social influence. based on the proposed structural model for oaar, it is observed that practitioner should invest more resources to have integrated supply chain and technological capabilities such as customer analytics to support cross-channel fulfillments and personalization to aid adoption of omnichannel retailing amongst indian customers. further, this study positions the identified determinants in “driving”, “dependent” and “linkage” clusters based on the direction and intensity of their influence on other determinants using micmac analysis.","e-commerce, apparel industry","This study has identified unique 10 determinants for omnichannel adoption in general, particularly in a developing economy and specifically for apparel industry based on literature review and expert opinion. Based on the analysis of omnichannel literature and to the best of our knowledge, no study has considered all ‘10’ unique determinantsconsidered in this study for omnichannel adoption to find structural relationship amongst determinants. In order to build a theoretical framework, various methods exist from notionally connecting determinants to using ISM and TISM. Our research has focused on “what” and “how” and “why” questions by translating the feebly articulated relationships amongst determinants into a structured, well-defined model using combined TISM-MICMAC technique. The TISM approach placedthe considered determinants for OAAR in six–tier hierarchical model. The MICMAC analysis has positioned determinants in autonomous, dependent, independent and linkages clusters. The study has classified determinants according to their dependence and driving power; thus, helping decision-makers to understand the relative significance of each determinant. The hierarchical structural model developed using TISM approach gives a holistic picture about inherent nature and interrelationships amongst determinants for omnichannel retailing from customers perspective and can help retailers in formulating strategies for adoption of omnichannel.Out of different identified determinants for OAAR, the determinants: technological development, improved shopping experience and integrated supply chain are crucial ones according to our TISM – MICMAC analysis. As, it is impractical for practitioners to focus on all the determinants simultaneously, they can focus more on leading causes. Accordingly, based on the proposed structural model for OAAR and based on the MICMAC analysis the retailers should focus on building integrated supply chain, building cross-channel synergies to enable high speed integrated fulfillment. In addition, retailer should develop technological capabilities such as customer analytics to provide personalized offerings. Finally, retailers should also focus on e-fulfillment because of safety concerns around sporadic events like covid19. The contextual and hierarchical relationships developed in this study are yet to be statistically validated. To do that a large number of customer data considering different customer groups based on demographics and psychographics is required. Further, the identified determinants are not directly measurable. That is, for each of the determinant’swe need to identify measurement variables to measure each determinant. These are our immediate future research agenda. 883","kosha joshi and m mathirajan department of management studies, indian institute of science, bangalore, india koshajoshi@iisc.ac.in, msdmathi@iisc.ac.in","References

103,Emergent Strategies From Covid-19 Pandemic On  Indonesian Medical Equipment Manufacturer,"covid-19 pandemic has disrupted industrial sector activities. however, one of the sectors that recorded an increase in performance was the health sector. therefore, the study took the object of a company engaged in manufacturing medical devices located in indonesia. this study utilizes data from the company's annual report for 2017 to 2021. researchers also conducted interviews with the company's director of operations. with the background of different times and conditions with the aim of identifying strategies that are applied to different time conditions and also the impact of the strategy, first when the company was running operations before the covid-19 pandemic, namely in 2017 to 2019 where sales increased based on the annual report. then the second was during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 where the company reached a record high in sales and the third was in 2021 when the government entered a time when the government shifted priorities from handling the covid-19 pandemic to efforts to recover the economy. this incident caused an oversupply of medical equipment, resulting in an income of idr 35 billion. in 2022, the company is trying to adapt to the indonesian government's program to create a new campaign to prevent stunting in children under five years of age.","covid-19, manufacture, medical","From this study, it can be concluded that during the year 2017 to 2019 before the pandemic occurs, the company implemented a market development and diversification strategy as intended, there is no disrupting phenomenon that would force the company to change its strategy. The primary reason for the company to use these strategies are market demand and trends. The strategy they’re using provided to be useful because the company recorded a IDR16 Billion increase in revenue from 2017 to 2019. During the first year of COVID-19 in 2020 where most companies struggle to survive, PT BIPMED thrive because its product are much needed, and they able to adapt with the presented opportunities by implementing product development as an emergent strategy. This strategy is able to give a positive impact on the company’s performance, where they recorded an all-time high YoY revenue in 2020. The year after (2021), when the country’s economy is recovering. The shift in Indonesian government’s priority from COVID-19 pandemic relief to economic recovery attempt, had a negative implication on the company and Indonesian medical equipment sector as a whole. Because the state budget had to be allocated into other sector making the government will not buy any non-essential medical equipment. This event creates an oversupply of medical equipment, making the company suffer a decrease of IDR35 Billion in revenue. In 2022, the Indonesian governments made a new campaign in preventing a stunting in children under five years old. PT BIPMED adapt with this trend by developing a related product in its existing baby incubator. According to the comparative analysis, it can be concluded that different company have its own approach and strategy when addressing the evolving market and needs during COVID-19 pandemic. This research contributes to the scarce literature of emergent strategy. Lastly, the limitation of this research is that researchers only examine one company that produces and sells medical equipment in Indonesia only comparing with two other medical equipment company in Indonesia, but is very different is scale. PT Oksigen Medika Teknik is a smaller company than PT BIPMED, but IRRA is a much bigger company than PT BIPMED. Another limitation is that the methods used are limited to semi-structured interviews and descriptive statistics. Therefore, the recommendation for the next research is to examine more companies in the medical equipment industry on the same scale and size, and also preferably with the same types of main products (for example: in PT BIPMED’s case, their main line of products are medical beds and other furniture). Then an industrial analysis can also be carried out using Porter's five forces to further examine the condition of the medical equipment industry.","rifqi r prathama, daffa r kaiyandra and muhammad habiburrahman department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia, depok, west java, indonesia rifqi.rheza@ui.ac.id, daffa.reza@ui.ac.id, m.habiburrahman@ui.ac.id",

The words analysis showed that words which represent empowering (such as giving chance, opportunity, able), humility (such as humble, friendly, kind, good, nice, polite), authentic (such as responsible, fair), acceptance (such as accept, mistakes, forgive), direction (such as guidance, communication, discuss, feedback), and stewardship (such as giving, providing, support) are occurred frequently. Therefore, it can be concluded that the effective leadership for Gen Z is a servant leader. This study, however, did not see the relationship between servant leadership and work effectiveness. Therefore, further quantitative study is recommended to confirm the relationship. This study also only used questionnaire, therefore the deep understanding why Gen Z mentioned certain characteristic cannot be explored.

105,Promoting The Development Of Additive Symbiotic Networks  With The Adoption Of Blockchain Technology,"additive manufacturing has been recognized for its potential to support sustainable production. the literature shows that even though the additive manufacturing industry has proven disruptive potential regarding the incorporation of waste materials as material inputs for its processes, there is a lack of research when exploring industrial symbiosis networks within the additive manufacturing industry (ferreira et al. 2021) – designated in this research as additive symbiotic networks. this exploratory research intends to promote the development of additive symbiotic networks. considering the exchange of resources between the different stakeholders that form a symbiotic network, there is a need to find tools that support the implementation of transactions within the network. the blockchain technology has been acknowledged as an enabler to assure trust and transparency of entities and transactions, and thus, it can be used to boost the development of additive symbiotic networks (gonçalves et al. 2022). preliminary results from this research tend to confirm that this technology meets the requirements for developing additive symbiotic networks. despite its potential benefits, adopting the blockchain technology is expected to impact the supply chain structure of an additive symbiotic network, namely in the power distribution among the stakeholders of the network. future research work is suggested to explore the development of a blockchain-based architecture to support the implementation of an additive symbiotic network. by developing two case studies representing two additive symbiotic networks, this research seeks to revitalize global partnerships for the development and strengthening of global sustainability.",,,"inês a. ferreira phd student, industrial engineering nova school of science and technology, nova university of lisbon, 2829-519 caparica, portugal id.ferreira@campus.fct.unl.pt helena carvalho associate professor, industrial and management engineering unidemi – department of mechanical and industrial engineering, nova school of science and technology, 2829-519 caparica, portugal hmlc@fct.unl.pt",

107,The Implications Of Smart Tip Nudging: A Data-Driven  Behavioral Economic Study,"tipping phenomenon has been widely observed with broad social-economic impacts. digital nudging using ‘default tip options’ on ipad-like payment devices is increasingly adopted by the service providers, in order to increase the size of the tip that can greatly impact service industry worker’s income. the current practice is to use one set of standard ‘default tip options’ regardless of whatever kind of service to be delivered. this paper proposes a data-driven approach to designing smart tipping nudge that enables customized ‘default tip options’ tailored to varying tendency of different services for potentially high or low tip amounts. for a behavioral economic analysis of the tipping behavior, we apply prospect-theoretic value functions to model the tip amount as the consumer perceived value of service quality. a field experimental study in a fast-causal business is reported to demonstrate the potential of the proposed data-driven approach to smart tip nudging.","prospect theory, tipping behavior, incentive design","There are varying perspectives on the correlation between tipping and service quality in the literature. While some studies suggest the connection between service quality and tip sizes is tenuous at best (Lynn, 2001), other studies conclude the opposite (Bodvarsson and Gibson, 1999), or argue if it is because of a weak relationship or just weak measurement (Lynn, 2003). Our prospect-theoretic modeling finds out that the process of delivering a service results in fulfillment of service value added and this is perceived as the prevalence of tipping. In addition, the tip size is correlated to quality of service in line with a prospect theory value function. These behavioral economic findings shed light on developing insights into the underlying mechanism of the tipping behavior. The prevailing behavioral economic and experimental psychology studies on the tipping behavior are mainly empirical and focus on understanding human social factors that affect tipping.

109,Fleet Sizing Of Heterogeneous Fleet Of Trucks In A Material  Handling System Using Anylogic Simulation Modelling,"the focus of manufacturing organisations on their core competencies has placed third-party logistics service providers (3pl) in an ideal position to deal with supportive activities such as material handling, transportation, and storage using their expertise and economies of scale. this study considers the problem of determining the optimal fleet size of heterogeneous trucks to be outsourced from a 3pl to fulfil the demand of various raw materials requirements by a production facility while achieving a minimum total cost of these daily operations. trucks are deployed in an inter- facility material transportation system with different raw materials from designated storage areas to be transported to specified buffer locations per the production requirements. in a typical material forward flow, a truck undergoes many sub-processes with stochastic service times that vary with the type of material it carries and the type of the truck. each material encompasses different physical attributes and specific job routings. within this context, the inter-facility transportation process is modelled as a closed queueing network (cqn), and a mathematical model is developed to determine the optimal number of heterogeneous trucks to be outsourced from a 3pl while fulfilling the production requirements. a discrete event simulation model, using anylogic simulation software, is employed for solving the model to determine the optimal fleet size of trucks and their specific heterogeneous composition. moreover, the simulation model is used to determine the main performance measures of the system, such as sub-process response times, queue lengths, cycle times, resource utilisations and bottlenecks, to assist in the decision-making process.","fleet sizing, simulation","This study considers the fleet sizing problem of homogeneous trucks to be outsourced (or subcontracted) from a third- party logistics provider to be used daily to transport different types of raw materials from designated storage yards to intermediate buffer locations to be fed as inputs to a production facility for processing.Within this context, the problem is modelled as a closed queueing network (CQN).

110,A Novel Approach For Passenger Demand Forecasting  Of A New Railway Services,"forecasting for passenger demand in a new railway service is a challenging activity. there are many variables that could affect the number of passengers that will use railway services and many of those variables may be unique to each specific situation. in this study, we present a study that attempts to forecast railway passengers for a newly constructed railway line of makassar – parepare in south sulawesi, indonesia. we propose a combination of the system dynamics and artificial neural networks (ann). the system dynamics is a simulation method that is used to generate a set of training data for the ann. the initial data were collected through a survey of willingness to use 948",,"that tickets per day that are sold if only consist of 5 working days are effectively around 2280 - 4000 per day, along Makassar – Pare-Pare link, assuming that the number of passengers is spread evenly among different days 8. Conclusion This paper proposes a new approach for forecasting passenger demand by combining the system dynamics and artificial neural network. The system dynamics is used to generate initial data and this initial data can be used for training and testing purposes in the artificial neural network.The proposed approach is used to forecast passenger demand of a newly constructed railway that connects Makassar and Parepare in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. In order to run the model, we collect both secondary and primary data. We predict the passenger demand under different price scenario. We have used the survey results that predict the willingness to use and willingness to pay as input to the model. As a snapshot, the estimated passenger demand is in the range of 2000 to 11400 tickets sold in a week, depending on the ticket price.","i nyoman pujawan professor of supply chain engineering, department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its), surabaya, indonesia pujawan@ie.its.ac.id muhammad ainul yaqin research assistant, department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its), surabaya, indonesia ainul123yaqin@gmail.com amelia santoso research assistant department of industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember (its), surabaya, indonesia santosoameliaa@gmail.com muhammad isran ramli professor of transportation system engineering department of civil engineering, faculty of engineering universitas hasanuddin, makassar, indonesia isranramli@unhas.ac.id sakti adji adisasmita professor of transportation and aviation engineering department of civil engineering, faculty of engineering universitas hasanuddin, makassar, indonesia adjiadisasmita@unhas.ac.id rosmalina hanafi associate professor of industrial engineering department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas hasanuddin, makassar, indonesia rhanafi@unhas.ac.id",

Then based on the SWOT analysis obtained by DHL Supply Chain has great operating power, a combination of physical and digital supply chain, the use of technological innovation to increase efficiency, and the existence of value-added activity services as a competitive advantage. Based on the results of the analysis using the RBV approach and SWOT analysis, it can be concluded that the DHL Supply Chain business strategy applies the Porter's Differentiation strategy. Differentiation strategy at producing products and services considered unique industry-wide and directed at consumers who are relatively price-insensitive (David 2011). However, the researcher also argues that with all the operations and services offered, there seems to be a combination that leads to a focus strategy. This is arguably not good because the contract logistics industry is actually a large industry with many competitors, so DHL Supply Chain is also advised to maintain the price of its services. Then in the 2020-2021 pandemic, the increase in e-commerce has also led to an increase in market contract logistics in the technology sector, in the discussion of marketing and market share obtained by DHL Supply Chain, it is also known that DHL Supply Chain adopts intensive market penetration strategies.","sector luthfi azmaiza hadsyah, taufik rizkiandi, tody isfitazli department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia, jakarta, indonesia luthfi.azmaiza11@ui.ac.id , taufik.rizkiandi@ui.ac.id, tody.isfitazli@ui.ac.id",

115,Implementation Of Porter’S Generic Strategy In Indonesian  Mro Company Post Covid-19 Pandemic,"all industrial sectors have been affected by the covid-19 epidemic. it has a negative influence on the aircraft mro industry, notably in the aviation industry. the goal of this research is to determine the strategy of aviation mro companies in indonesia prior to the covid-19 epidemic, throughout the pandemic year, and when the pandemic cases started to fall, as well as to understand the influence of this strategy on corporate performance. this study was conducted by directly interviewing the company's director of operations. the analysis determined that the company employed a cost leadership strategy, and the company's success in winning tenders in 2015, 2018, and 2020 demonstrated that the approach was successful. due to the dramatic drop in the number of flights in the commercial sector during the early years of the covid-19 epidemic, the company's emphasis shifted changed from moving in both the commercial and government sectors to moving primarily in the government department. however, after the case of the covid-19 pandemic has subsided, — for example, after 2021, the company will gradually resume work in the commercial and government sectors.","covid-19, mro company, cost leadership, swot analysis","According to the findings of this study, the company developed a cost leadership strategy prior to the pandemic, and there was no disruption phenomenon that required the company to adjust its approach. Market demand and trends are the primary drivers of this strategy. PT PEAR survived the pandemic in the first year of COVID-19 in 2020, when other companies were struggling to live, by focusing solely on the government, and by executing this approach, the company was able to respond to the opportunities that presented itself. In 2021, PT Putra Elang Angkasaraya added maintenance and repair capabilities to Bell 429, AS 365 N Series, and Beechcraft 1900 D helicopters, demonstrating that this strategy can have a favorable impact on the company's business. The Indonesian government's priority shift from handling the COVID-19 pandemic to efforts to recover the economy in 2022, when COVID-19 cases began to decline and the country's economy began to recover, had positive implications for companies and the Indonesian aviation industry sector as a whole, so that the aviation MRO industry began to improve. As before the COVID-19 epidemic, this collection of enterprises will gradually refocus on the commercial and government sectors. This research adds to the existing knowledge base on developing strategies. Finally, this study's limitation is that it only looks at one firm in a group that works in the Indonesian aircraft MRO market. Another concern is that the method used only moderately interviews. As a result, more companies in the aviation MRO industry should be studied for future work.","aisha hafiza s., panji pratama hendra surya industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia , depok, 16424, indonesia aisha.hafiza@ui.ac.id, panji.pratama11@ui.ac.id",
116,Implementation Of Cost Leadership Strategy In Indonesian  Fertilizer Company,"the increasing global population drives up food demand which means crop production needs to increase. to achieve that, fertilizer is used. many industries, including the fertilizer industry, are feeling the impact of covid 19. this paper presents the implementation of cost leadership strategy in indonesia fertilizer company, the effect of covid 19 on the fertilizer industry, and how the strategy is used to achieve competitiveness. this paper also discusses the impact of the implementation of cost leadership strategy to the company's financial performance. based on the result, the five components of the cost leadership strategy can be fulfilled by the company. however, for the component that consumers have the power to bargain the price is not in accordance with the fertilizer industry. this is generally due to the fact that fertilizer prices in indonesia depend on and affect world fertilizer prices. the impact of the implementation of the cost leadership strategy is carrying out effectiveness such as operational costs, managing inventory, and the use of raw materials.","competitiveness, cost leadership, covid 19, fertilizer","This study aims to determine the implementation of a cost leadership strategy which is one of the generic porter strategies to gain a competitive advantage in the fertilizer industry. By using a case study approach to PT Pupuk Kaltim to represent the fertilizer industry. PT Pupuk Kalimantan Timur (PKT) is one of the largest producers of urea and NPK fertilizers in Asia. This study uses secondary data such as the annual report and sustainability report of PT Pupuk Kaltim from 2016 to 2020. This study aims to determine if the cost leadership strategy is an effective strategy used in the company and to determine the impact of implementing cost leadership on the company's financial performance. In determining an effective cost leadership strategy for the company, several requirements or conditions must be met. PT. Pupuk Kaltim can meet five of the seven component requirements, including numbers 1 to 5 on cost leadership conditions.PT. Pupuk Kaltim offers a lower price compared to its competitors who provide similar products. This can have an impact on consumers who tend to be loyal to the company's products. In addition, fertilizer prices in Indonesia depend on world fertilizer prices. This study also aims to analyze company’s strategy to increase their competitiveness during COVID 19. COVID 19 disrupted Diammonium Phosphate (DAP)’s supply chain and then causing its prices to keep increasing. PT Pupuk Kaltim implemented several initiatives to increase their competitiveness, such as increasing its raw material consumption efficiency and lowering its operating expenses. The limitation of this research is that the data used are only the annual report and sustainability report of PT. Pupuk Kaltim For further research, wider data and objects can be used.","arief nurdini, elsa wahyu harliana, lathifah karina putri department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia, kampus ui depok, 16424, indonesia arief.nurdini11@ui.ac.id, elsa.wahyu@ui.ac.id, lathifah.karina@ui.ac.id",

118,Risks And Opportunities Within Lean 4.0 Systems: Swot  Analysis,"nowadays, companies’ first target is to build an intelligent, flexible, integrated and efficient processes, for higher industrial performance. according to this, a new concept emerged within the industrial firms by the name of industry 4.0 (i4.0). this 4th industrial revolution covers four main aspects: intelligent factory, real-time communication, smart products and more satisfied customers. as strong as are the new technologies offered by this revolution, it is not entirely sufficient if not combined with lean principles. combining these two paradigms created what is known today as lean 4.0, a new concept presenting several opportunities for higher performance. nevertheless, this combination is far from being as simple as it seems. a deep and structured risk analysis is required to ensure a smooth implementation of lean 4.0 system within a company. the purpose of this paper is to discuss i4.0, lean manufacturing and lean 4.0 risks and opportunities through a systematic literature review, and to study the different barriers to its implementation through the modelling of a case study using sequence diagram and swot analysis. its contribution consists of being a reflection paper to the companies aiming to develop their digital maturity by exploiting lean 4.0 tools.","industry 4.0, lean 4.0","Based on the research held in the context of this paper, we can state that Lean Production is a people and organization- oriented approach, while I4.0 is a technology-oriented one enabling a fluid information and material flows along the value chain. But the target remains the same: less costs with higher performance. Researchers studying the integration of these two paradigms has found many complementarities, and stated that, on one hand, continuous improvement practices establishment and LM practices preliminary implementation in the company makes I4.0 technologies adoption more accessible, and on the other hand, I4.0 technologies enhance Lean manufacturing efficiency. Indeed, the case study proposed is a consistent example of Lean 4.0 application. This study can serve as a support to companies willing to implement Lean 4.0 concept. Eventually, results of the SWOT analysis have shown several treats to Lean 4.0 adoption such as cyber-security, social awareness, lack of financial support and lack of skills, but many opportunities as well. We are now talking about autonomous and flexible systems enabling the customization of products and services for higher competitiveness within the industrial firms and higher customer satisfaction due to quality increase and lead time decrease. In terms of perspectives, government and private sectors collaboration within the education sector is primordial. More programs and funds regarding Industry 4.0 technologies are highly needed to instore innovation culture within our society and encourage employers to engage more in the development of Industry 4.0. On the other hand, due to the lack of Lean 4.0 risk and opportunities studies, the analysis was based on authors’ personal knowledge and experience. In response to this, the next step is to prepare a survey in order to evaluate the barriers faced by companies while implementing lean 4.0, or the treats that stopped them from adopting this new concept. Finally, research must be held to study the possibility to overcome the weaknesses and threats identified during our analysis.

Angkasa Pura I & Angkasa Pura II try to strengthen their preparation for the new policy of COVID-19 situations handling that can affect their operational services. From the data obtained, we found that Angkasa Pura I declined revenue and service has a lower number compared to Angkasa Pura II, which is caused by the operation area of Angkasa Pura II being larger than Angkasa Pura I. To survive the uncertainty condition, both companies implement their initiatives such as Rebound Strategy implemented by Angkasa Pura I that consist of 5 step strategies from preparation about new normal behaviour, strengthening business portfolio, improvement of business process, organizational restructuring, and remapping business architecture that will adapt with current situation. On the other hand, Angkasa Pura II has implemented David's Alternative Strategy in 2019 and 2020 based on market penetration, market development, service development, and diversification. Based on both initiative strategies we can conclude that both companies agree to strengthen the preparation about new behaviour of market and user, strengthen the company’s assets and services, along with looking for new opportunities 3160","of angkasa pura i and angkasa pura ii zahrina zihni, rangga damar bagaskara and yoga satria industrial engineering department faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia zahrina.zihni@ui.ac.id, rangga.damar@ui.ac.id, yoga.satria12@ui.ac.id","References

125,An Analysis Of Sentiments Of Tweets About Patents  Alptekin Durmuşoğlu,"patents are documents about inventions that provide legal protection from which we can learn about technological development. firms hold the monopoly of producing the relevant technology for a certain period of time, and in order to protect their technological superiority, they prepare the invention notification forms and complete their official applications to the patent office. the number of patents is a strong indicator of the r&d activities of a firm, country or region. for this reason, it is possible to write a large number of scientific articles that specifically analyze a technology or a region. thus, what does society think of these official monopoly documents? one of the ways to find out what the society thinks about a subject is to follow the flow on the social media channel twitter. this study presents a partial analysis of what the public is talking about on twitter about patents. the tweets written in english, collected for a total of 2 months (106415 tweets), are subjected to a content analysis. when the hashtags of the tweets were examined, it was determined that the patents of some technologies (vr, crypto, blockchain, vaccine) were much trendy. in addition, sentiment analysis of tweet contents was also performed. it has been determined that while the emotional state is neutral in tweets about crypto patents, the average emotional intensity of tweets about vaccines is negative. in addition, it has been revealed through analyzes that these results differ according to countries and gender.","sentiment analysis, patents, tweets, technologies","Patents are official documents that provide information about the direction and pace of technological development. Although the analysis of these documents is frequently encountered in the literature, the issue of how these documents is perceived by the public has not yet been addressed. This study can be seen as the first demonstration of an initial effort in this regard. The study is based on the analysis of tweets that the society commonly prefers to communicate. The study showed that patents are topics that attract the attention of the public, but in particular, patents for some technologies seem to be more popular than others. Cryptosystems have often been the subject of tweets about patents. The sentimental charge of these tweets is generally positive. Similarly, vaccine patents were also frequently discussed in tweets. However, the sentimental load in vaccine patents is not as positive as in crypto systems. It essential to state that this research was conducted with limited data. It is not possible to generalize the results as it is not possible to represent the entire population. It is possible to improve this work with a deeper analysis and a more comprehensive data set.","associate professor department of industrial engineering gaziantep university, gaziantep, turkey durmusoglu@gantep.edu.tr zeynep didem unutmaz durmuşoğlu associate professor department of industrial engineering gaziantep university, gaziantep, turkey unutmaz@gantep.edu.tr",
126,An Analysis Soft Skills Required In The Academic Faculty  Positions,"in the business world, it is known that there is an increasing demand for basic/soft skills that are outside the profession and job-specific skills, but are required for all professions. among these soft skills, the most known and demanded social skills are: professional attitude, problem solving, critical thinking, business ethics, public speaking, professional writing, teamwork, digital literacy, leadership, and suitability for multicultural work environments. what the concept of soft skill should express precisely is one's ability to master controllable actions in certain subjects. the ambiguity of the definition of the concept also makes it difficult to use data-based methods to measure soft skills. there are studies in the scientific literature that see soft skills as a synergy of multiple competencies that can be acquired through experience and knowledge. this paper analyzed 718 academic job postings using the skillner software used to automatically extract soft skills from text and sought to identify social skills sought in academics. it was determined that there were 555 soft skills requests in 718 job postings. the most requested soft skills in these job postings were communication, leadership and suitability for teamwork, respectively.","faculty positions, soft skills, skillner","With the increasing competition, it is getting harder to work as a lecturer at universities. In addition to knowledge- based technical indicators (graduation school, published articles, number of citations received, etc.), it is revealed in this study that some personal soft skills are also expected from candidates. In this study, academic job postings were examined in terms of soft skills demands for a limited time. Key features sought were communication skills, leadership and suitability for teamwork. Although this study does not make any claims about the difference of the mentioned skills from other professional business areas, it can be stated that these social skills are valuable skills for all professions. Conditions within professors are not static, and to meet the educational demands of the global organization of the twenty-first century, individuals must strive towards professional development and training to continually update their skills. It is of course inevitable that the soft qualifications expected from graduates are expected from the faculty members who train them.","zeynep didem unutmaz durmuşoğlu associate professor department of industrial engineering gaziantep university, gaziantep, turkey unutmaz@gantep.edu.tr alptekin durmuşoğlu associate professor department of industrial engineering gaziantep university, gaziantep, turkey durmusoglu@gantep.edu.tr","References

127,Key Research Challenges Of Incorporating Official Statistics  With Big Data Analytics And Lean Six Sigma,"the amount of created and captured data has been increasing rapidly. since 2018, the amount of data generated and collected surpasses 90% of the data produced in the previous years. to meet the 2030 united nations economic commission for europe (unece) statistical agenda, national statistics organizations (nsos) must meet the required amount of data demanded through the modernization of statistics. relevant studies showed the implementation of official statistics with lean six sigma, resulting in a 5% operational budget reduction. moreover, integrating official statistics with big data analytics produced more efficient and timelier statistics. however, in this industry 4.0 era, there is a lack of practices in the integration of big data tools and technique with the official statistics. the reason might be the uncertainty on the challenges and potential solutions. therefore, this paper systematically reviews and analyses the critical challenges and potential solutions for the integration of big data analytics and lean six sigma into the processes of generating official statistics. a comprehensive and systematic literature review was conducted. findings showed that the challenges of integrating big data are lack of proper infrastructure, data quality and data privacy. on the other hand, challenges of integrating lean six sigma are lack of management support, lack of common goal and the hierarchical organization structure. this paper will contribute to future work by using the identified challenges of integrating official statistics with big data analytics and lean six sigma to develop and propose a framework which overcomes the critical challenges and maximize the benefits.","official statistics, gsbpm","and Future Work While facilitating the daily life activities and business processes, fast growing technology brings some challenges with itself. As it is very well-known, big data analytics can be utilized in many aspects now, including the official statistics processes. The benefits of using big data tools and lean six sigma are obvious in the literature, however, there is very limited research about a comprehensive list of the challenges. This paper identified these challenges by a systematic literature review technique. It appeared that the most critical challenges for integrating big data analytics with official statistics are lack of proper infrastructure, data quality, and data privacy. The most critical challenges for integrating official statistics with lean six sigma are the hierarchical organization structure, lack of management support, and lack of common goal. These findings show that the organizations need a systematic process to generate official statistics by using the advanced technological methods. Therefore, as a future work, it is suggested to develop a framework which may help organizations integrate the big data analytics and lean six sigma into the process of generating official statistics. This framework may also support organizations in overcoming the stated challenges in this paper and maximize the benefits to produce more efficient and timely statistics.","farah al jaghoub industrial engineering and engineering management, university of sharjah sharjah, uae u20103917@sharjah.ac.ae zehra canan araci assistant professor industrial engineering and engineering management, university of sharjah sharjah, uae zaraci@sharjah.ac.ae concetta semeraro assistant professor industrial engineering and engineering management, university of sharjah sharjah, uae csemeraro@sharjah.ac.ae",

129,"The Challenges Of Digitalisation – The Role Of Leadership,  Culture And Technology Based On A Systematic Review","many companies facing digitalisation lack a digital target model or transformation/implementation roadmap. multinational companies as well as smes have to deal with different global market trends. besides volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity [vuca], companies' business models are constantly being influenced by disruptive technologies and solutions. and all this comes along with industry 4.0 and digitalisation itself. yet i4.0 and digitalisation are in many companies still buzzwords and lack substance. assuming that the level of digitalisation of an enterprise has been defined, the main question is: ""what does the digitalisation journey look like, and what are the transformation roadmap and the interdependencies?"" this paper investigates whether, when and which of the independencies of company's functions are being neglected in the implementation of digitalisation. in a systematic literature review, gaps were identified especially in three previously defined categories that are directly related to the implementation of digitalisation, namely corporate culture, leadership and technology. after identification of these gaps, the missing link between these categories was discussed. in this way, the gaps revealed in the literature could be filled. the further scientific elaboration will primarily serve as a guide for smes to ensure a smooth implementation of digitalisation in the company.","smes, digitalisation, industry 4.0. 1076",,"thorsten schölver phd student universidade de aveiro, aveiro, portugal thorsten@schoelver.com leonor teixeira associate professor department of economics, management and industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) / institute of electronics and informatics engineering of aveiro (ieeta) university of aveiro, portugal lteixeira@ua.pt marco pimpão adjunct professor escola superior de tecnologia e gestão de águeda (estga) university of aveiro, portugal pimpao@ua.pt",
130,Strategy To Improve Quality Of Medical Certificate Of Cause  Of Death: An Analysis Of Mortality Surveillance Data Dki,"medical certificate cause of death (mccd) data is an important source of information for public health monitoring, priority setting, and planning. the completeness and accuracy of data on the cause of death affect the value of the policies adopted. poor-quality data can lead to missed opportunities to improve the health of the population. this study aims to obtain a strategy to improve the quality of data on mccd. we used dki jakarta province mortality surveillance data, which was collected from health facilities. the death cases from 2016 to 2019 and the deceased who lived in the dki jakarta area were selected. the analysis of national causes of death for action (anaconda) software 5.0 was used to determine the quality of the mccd data results: the number of health facilities sending data from 2016 to 2019 has increased. annual percentages garbage code (gc) tend not to change (more than 50%). gc in categories 3, 5, and 1 tend to be stable with an annual average of 34%, 26%, and 21%. meanwhile, category 4 tends to increase though it is small (from 5.7 to 14.4%). based on the potential impact that gc causes in guiding or misguiding public policy to prevent, more than 60% is identified as being in the very high-level category. conclusion: identifying the accuracy of cause of death data was needed to make the right strategy for improving the quality of data.","cause of death, garbage code, dki jakarta","DKI Jakarta MCCD data has poor quality and there is no significant change for 4 years. More than half of the MCCD data were identified as garbage codes and most of them were categorized as having serious impacts on public policy. The GC by age group also describes a serious problem. To avoid prolonged problems, in the future must have a better strategy. Evaluation of data quality needs to be done regularly, coordination is very important to improve data completeness. reduce GC and will ultimately improve MCCD data quality. Reducing GC can be done by improving the training system. The magnitude of the problem requires an evaluation of the training system as well as the implementation of cause of death certification. Re-evaluate the competence of the trainer, methods, materials, duration of the training, and also the trainees. The addition of GC material during training needs to be done to provide a better understanding of the accuracy of MCCD data.

The economic growth is negatively affected by the capital stock in the short run and positively and significantly (10 percent level of significance) in the long run. Total factor productivity contributes positively in economic growth. The insignificant result is in line with the findings of Qureshi and Liaqat, (2020) outlining the effect of debt threshold on economic performance. Accordingly, with a level of debt between 0 percent and 60 percent, the impact of public external debt on economic growth is insignificant in lower middle income countries. The major purpose behind foreign borrowing is to enhance economic growth. In case of morocco, the estimated results reveal an insignificant impact of external public debt on the economic performance. It should be expected that the external debt drugs the economic performance in the long run since the income is maintained at low levels, whereas the debt service is important.","fatima-ezzahra rafie and mostafa lekhal university research laboratory in instrumentation and organizational management (lurigor) faculty of law, economics and social sciences mohamed first university, oujda, morocco fatima-ezzahra.rafie@ump.ac.ma, mostafa.lekhal@ump.ac.ma",
133,A Proposed Factory Layout And Improved Process Time  Using Lean Tools For Fitco Detergent Factory In Qatar,,,"and Recommendations Lean thinking is applied in several industries, including the manufacturing industry due to its advantages in eliminating wastes to reduce process and lead times, increase productivity, reduce cost, and enhance the working environment. This is approached through utilizing the lean manufacturing tools such as the VSM and the 5S system as discussed in this paper. This paper analyzed FITCO Detergent Factory as the case study to implement lean manufacturing tools on. Precisely, the process of manufacturing one liter of the hand wash bottles was studied starting from receiving the customer’s order, raw materials sourcing and mixing, filling and labeling the bottles, and lastly packaging them prior to shipping them. It was observed that the current process time for one batch containing six bottles consumed 18 min, hence the customer's demand of 600 bottles cannot be satisfied in one day. Therefore, by applying lean tools, the process time is recommended to be reduced to 3 min to fulfill the demand in one day. Furthermore, it was observed that the factory layout forces the laborers to move for long distances and bend to reach out caps. Also, the laborers' safety is not considered in the Cartoon Stores due to clustered boxes. Therefore, it is recommended to move some stations in such a way where not a lot of transportation will be required between one step in the process and the one following it. For instance, the cartons should be moved and better placed next to the packaging station, the chemical raw materials should be moved next to the chemical mixers, and moving the bottle making machines towards the back of the factory to reduce the distance between it and the filling machine station. It is important to note that lean thinking is a continuous process that all employees in FITCO Detergent Factory need to constantly improve. This can be addressed through building an internal collaborative culture that accepts changes.",,
134,Improving Production Planning Strategy In Micro Business  By Using Forecasting And Master Production Scheduling:,"this study aims to implement the master production schedule (mps) method for the production process at soku bakery. the authors conducted an interview with the owner of soku bakery regarding information about current production planning which includes inventory records, bill of materials (bom), customer orders, production plans, and capacity. with the information, the soku bakery production process was optimized by making a master production schedule (mps) from the forecast that has been made. aside from the data collection, the authors also collect literature from books, journals, and research related to forecasting and the master production schedule. the result shows that the implementation of the master production schedule (mps) can help soku bakery to adjust fluctuations in demand, minimize waste, prevent shortages, and scheduling errors, and provide more effective cost control and more accurate estimates of material, also requirements, and delivery dates.","forecast, master production, master scheduling, production plan","Soku Bakery is a micro, small, and medium-sized enterprise (MSME) in the food industry based in Jakarta. Soku Bakery's business model is make-to-stock. However, the stock fluctuates based on customer orders, and the sales and production were not optimal. To optimize, Soku Bakery needs to discover a better production planning method to be implemented. With simple moving average methods, Soku Bakery can find the upcoming forecasted demand. The company can better determine the production quantity because it is based on forecasted demand while taking on-hand inventory and net requirements into account. Using empirical calculations, the company can avoid situations where the quantity of materials exceeds or falls short of the required amount. Then, implementation of Master Production Schedule (MPS) is performed as the proposed improvement method, according to the results, the average projected sales for the next six weeks 508 orders. If the owner of Soku Bakery sticks to their current routines, they will need to adjust their daily supply spending to avoid overstock inventory, which may result in extra spending. The use of this method also resulted in Soku Bakery being able to meet the customer demand schedule on time. With the result in Soku Bakery, It is essential for micro-businesses to implement this model because the implementation of the Master Production Schedule is still rarely used. Overall, the problem of purchasing raw materials and the amount of production by micro-businesses, which sometimes does not match the number of requests on a specific day, can impact the costs incurred, resulting in waste. By implementing forecasting methods and master production schedules, these small companies can forecast the number of requests and prepare better production plans to reduce waste. The forecast method and the Master Production Schedule can be the beginning of applying other methods in the production process that can help small businesses develop in the future. This study was completed with various constraints. These constraints are in the form of a post-pandemic that will be faced soon, and the types of SMEs circulating are very diverse. This indicates that in the future, SMEs will experience changes in demand with world conditions starting to enter a post-pandemic. In addition, Soku Bakery is one of the SMEs included in the type of food. Meanwhile, SMEs in circulation also consist of beverages, products, and other types. Thus, the solution offered is still unknown whether it will be effective against other types of SMEs. Future studies are needed to study whether the solutions offered can be implemented in other types of SMEs. 1128","soku bakery case study dendy rio casillas pratama, muhammad kafin nur, muhammad zaki fuadi, surya marthen, arief nurdini department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java 16424, indonesia dendy.rio@ui.ac.id, muhammad.kafin@ui.ac.id, muhammad.zaki03@ui.ac.id, surya.marthen@ui.ac.id, arief.nurdini11@ui.ac.id","References

135,Production Planning In Pharmacy Industry Using Double  Weighted Moving Average And Holt Linear Forecasting,"the covid-19 pandemic has brought a positive impact on increasing public awareness of health. this awareness can be seen from the increasing demand for health services and products. pt otsuka indonesia as one of the leading pharmaceuticals and medical product companies in indonesia aims to provide innovative solutions for the healthcare market. however, pt otsuka indonesia faced challenging problems in its product demand forecasting method. pt otsuka indonesia uses the same forecasting method for all products, resulting in inaccurate and less reliable forecasts. this paper aims to improve the forecasts done by the company by comparing forecasting methods and analyzing which method is best to use in terms of predicting pt otsuka indonesia demand in the future. actual demand, target, and sales product data was collected from pt otsuka indonesia’s historical data from 2020-2021. three different forecasting methods were compared, namely weighted moving average, double weighted moving average, and holt linear method. three of them were analyzed by using mad where each of the products in pt otsuka indonesia has its own best suited method.","production planning, forecasting","Based on the results of the study in choosing the most accurate forecasting method between 3 different forecasting demands to forecast demands in PT Otsuka Indonesia, it can be concluded that each of the products has a different forecasting method. Instead of using the same forecasting method on all products, PT Otsuka Indonesia should distinguish which forecasting method is suitable for which product. From the calculation above, it can be said that BFLUID 500 ML and ASERING 500 ML are more accurate when using Double WMA forecast. Meanwhile, AMINOLEBAN INJ 500 ML, PROTEN COKLAT, and INFUSION SET OI-24 are more accurate when using Holt Linear forecast.","method abdul rosyid, dewa ferrouzi diaz zhah pahlevi, marvin abhista rivaliano bya, and muhammad irsyad zharif, djoko nurprawito department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia abdul.rosyid01@ui.ac.id, dewa.ferrouzi@ui.ac.id, marvin.abhista@ui.ac.id, muhammad.irsyad03@ui.ac.id, djoko.nurprawito@ui.ac.id",
136,Optimizing Inventory Management In Micro Small Medium  Enterprise (Msme) Using Material Requirement Planning,"the current business climate of increasing competition implies that all companies need to be as efficient as possible at every level, which includes inventory management. to have adequate quantities of high quality inventory available is basically the goal of every company in running their business, this is why inventory management is crucial. in addition to it, a well inventory management is also able to help companies minimize the costs of carrying inventory which leads to the service and profit optimization. thus, the implementation of inventory management should be considered in every business scale, including micro, small and medium enterprise (msmes). investigating the effectiveness of inventory management in msmes is way important since the existence of msmes itself has a big contribution to the growth of indonesia’s national gross domestic product. the purpose of this study was to optimize inventory management in a msmes in indonesia, warung nasi uduk cani, by applying material requirement planning (mrp) method for the production process. the use of this mrp method is intended for increasing warung nasi uduk cani’s efficiency of its material procurement in order to fulfill the customer demand in the right amoung and at the right time. the mrp will be built based on the owner’s financial record and bill of material. the results of the discussion show that mrp can help adjust fluctuation in demand, reduce waste, prevent shortages, increase cost efficiency and more accurate estimates of material requirements and ordering schedule.","micro, mrp","Warung Nasi Uduk Cani is categorized as a Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) that produces many types of food. This MSME has not implemented the inventory management in determining the right quantity of raw materials to optimize the utilization of inventory and reduce procurement cost. Therefore, Material Requirement Planning (MRP) is the appropriate method to solve this problem. The MRP result is obtained from the Master Production Schedule (MPS). It contains the production forecast per week, actual order per week, and so on, which are essential to calculate the MRP. The MRP shows the quantity of raw materials and the total procurement cost per day for 5 weeks to be used as a comparison with the actual procurement cost. Based on the comparison result, it can be figured that Warung Nasi Uduk Cani can save the material procurement cost up to Rp909.000 or equal to increasing 8,09% efficiency using MRP Method. In its inventory capacity as MSME, the implementation of MRP in the purchasing of raw materials saves a lot of money to the company.","(mrp) naura diva atmika, tania marcella tarigan, yumi annisa, arief nurdini department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia naura.diva@ui.ac.id, tania.marcella@ui.ac.id, yumi.annisa@ui.ac.id, arief.nurdini11@ui.ac.id",
137,Optimizing Efficiency Through Application Of The Materials  Requirement Planning And Demand Forecasting: A Case,"planning and controlling material supply is vital for a company to support the production process. the tea industry is no exception; this industry requires material planning to optimize its company. thus, this paper explores the implementation of mrp and demand forecasting to increase the overall efficiency by focusing on the tea industry. the company studied for this paper is citratea, which uses a make-to-stock system to optimize inventory and minimize costs. for demand forecasting, we use holt-winter’s method to forecast the customer demand for the next 12 months. we also use the economic order quantity method in making the material requirements plan. as a result, the benefit-cost ratio of the 250 ml and 500 ml products before the improvement are 1.738 and 2.027, respectively. meanwhile, the benefit-cost ratio after improvement is 2.281 and 2.817, respectively. these results indicate that an increase in the benefit-cost ratio has occurred. the results of analysis, calculation and validation have shown that implementing the demand forecasting, and mrp in the company helps reduce the number of costs and increase the company's profit.","production planning, forecasting","and Remarks CitraTea is a tea company that makes tea drink menus for sale to consumers. In running the company, this company uses a make-to-stock system and a level strategy system in aggregate planning. However, CitraTea does not have a well-planned production scheduling and inventory control. This circumstance can result in companies losing opportunity costs to increase their profits. By forecasting demand using demand forecasting and MRP calculations as well as the EOQ method, companies can maximize their profits. This condition can be seen by comparing the cost-benefit ratio data before and after forecasting, which shows an increase in the cost-benefit ratio. In addition to the terms increase in profit, the application of this method also resulted in companies fulfilling the customer demand schedule. Other than that, this method implementation helps the company in minimizing the possibility of the production capacity not meeting the customer demand and ease in analyzing how many raw materials are to be purchased to meet the demand. In developing the material requirements plan, it is important to consider the variations in the demand and supply parameters and the robustness of the logistics chain when estimating the demand and economic order quantity. However, as the raw materials used by CitraTea to produce tea beverages are sourced directly, these variations can be minimized. The fluctuation in consumer demand, on the other hand, is handled by using the Holt-Winters forecasting method. Nevertheless, as a piece of research, we believe that this paper will be a beneficial contribution on the topic of the implementation of MRP in the tea beverage industry. 1160","study of a small and medium-sized enterprise in the tea beverage industry alivanza firdaus rhufyano, muhammad fawwaz robbani, hanif rahman arifin, jalaludin shofa mufti, and ardhy lazuardy department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia alivanza.firdaus@ui.ac.id, hanif.rahman01@ui.ac.id, jalaludin.shofa@ui.ac.id, muhammad.fawwaz01@ui.ac.id, ardhy.lazuardy@ui.ac.id","References

138,Demand Forecasting And Material Requirements  Planning To Improve Production Planning Of Small,"aggregate planning has been widely used by apparel manufacturers to gain maximum profit by finding the optimal solution between maximizing sales and minimizing production cost. commonly, small apparel companies use chase strategy, where production rates are varied for each time period to meet changes in demand. however, without an appropriate demand forecast and well-calculated production planning, this strategy might not accommodate the fluctuating demand. it can cause recurring product stock outs which increases the number of unmet customer demands. to improve the company’s production planning, the number of demands is forecasted using single moving average (sma) method for each week of the upcoming month. the forecasted demand is then used to plan the production quantity using material requirement planning which helps ensure that all the demands are met while avoiding over-production by taking on-hand inventory into account. comparison between the former and the improved production planning method shows an increase in the company’s sales, increasing profit by 37,33% or equal to rp3.360.000. this concludes that the method proposed in this paper can be used as a simple yet effective way to improve the apparel company’s production planning, hence increasing the company’s profit.","forecasting, fashion","PT. X is a small clothing firm that uses the chase approach as a strategy for product development. Due to a lack of well-planned generation scheduling and stock control, this organization frequently experiences out-of-stock situations (OOS). This problem arises due to a missed chance. This problem might cause the firm to stagnate or perhaps fail in the long run. Using the simple moving average (SMA) forecasting approach, it is discovered that the company's production capacity would be insufficient to fulfill consumer demand in the next month, April 2022, due to limited supply. This, of course, can have an impact on PT. X's profit margins.

139,Aggregate Planning To Minimize Cost Of Production Of Abc  Company With Forecasting And Master Production Schedule,"the rapid growth of the food and beverages industry leads to a very fierce competition between the companies in this industry. abc company is one of the players in the industry and to gain more competitive advantages to win the competition, the company needs a strategic movement. the company’s current condition is that most of the time, the demand is lower than the capacity which leads to an inventory and cost wasting. the objective of this study is to create a complete company’s production schedule and meet demand while spending as minimum money as possible on production factors. the data were gathered through literature review and secondary data gathered directly from the company itself. the sales data from the past 4 months are used to forecast upcoming 3 months' demand using smooth exponential forecasting and moving average method. furthermore, the data are also used to calculate the aggregate planning strategies, such as chase strategy, level strategy, and mixed strategy using the pom qm application. those three strategies then are validated using mps calculation to find which strategy has the least cost of production. the result of this study is that the mixed strategy has the least cost of production.","aggregate planning, cost of production, forecast","There are several critical points obtained. The results from POM QM show that it would be much better if ABC company used the Mixed Strategy seen from the lower cost compared to the other two strategies, which was Rp. 17,092,240. To support this argument, the researchers also calculated the Master Production Schedule and found that the order of alternatives from the best to the worst was Chase Strategy, Mixed Strategy, and Level Strategy.

140,Improving Inventory Management By Better Forecasting  Method For Healthcare Industry Company,"the healthcare industry is one of the most valuable industries today. its value is expected to continue to increase along with the increase of the world's population. in line with this, the number of requests for assistive devices related to services in the healthcare industry is expected to increase. that way, companies need to do good forecasting so that production results can be maximized. based on the research results, the weighted moving average method is the best forecasting method that can be used by manufacturing companies that focus on tools in the healthcare sector. this is due to the relatively smaller mean average percentage errors (mape) value compared to other forecast methods.","healthcare, forecasting, linear forecasting","The forecast results in 2022 show a decline which is not in line with the addition of the value of the healthcare industry. However, PT.X needs to enhance forecasting in its production activities. Through forecasting, the risk of the emergence of unmet demand can be reduced. As a company that offers goods that are medium-to-long term investment, PT.X needs to choose the right forecasting method. Some of the best known forecasting methods include linear forecasting and weighted moving average. Between the two, the better forecast method to use is the weighted moving average based on the mean absolute percentage error. This can happen because the method has taken into account the trend of the data provided.","atsalabi dimas fadillah, arif furqan wantuah, mahardhika hendra bramasta surya, muhammad zharfan ainun azka, and djoko nurprawito department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia atsalabi.dimas@ui.ac.id, arif.furqan@ui.ac.id, mahardhika.hendra@ui.ac.id, muhammad.zharfan01@ui.ac.id, djoko.nurprawito@ui.ac.id",

143,Improvement Analysis On Optimization Production  Management At Ginger Factory Using Forecasting And,"optimization production management is a crucial and important component which has a critical role for controlling and affecting the production comprehensively. process determining on each stage of production, mainly focused on production plans which start from demand and sales forecasting. subsequently, sales forecasts will be predicted and evaluated on the appropriate inventory supply and stock. this paper proposes to obtain and gain several ways for optimizing production management for maximizing the production process and system and also yielding less waste and defect","ginger, forecasting demand","In this research, after analyzing the graphic for the forecasted data and actual data, the errors were calculated to measure the difference between forecasted data and actual data. From the previous numerical results, we concluded that the graph for demand was inconsistent and had an irregular pattern and the pattern of production has decreased in the past 4 weeks. The factory is using the Make-To-Order (MTO) method and as a result, the production demand does not follow a predictable pattern. When using a moving average model, it works the best when the data has a reasonably linear trend and follows a definite pattern. However, in this particular company, our data does not reveal a significant pattern or any linear trend as moving average models simply smooths out the variation in the results. The accuracy of various statistical techniques and MAPE predictors were studied in this paper. For the purpose of researching that, we gather the data of 1 year sales and capacity of production at this company. Based on the number of MAPE, MAD, and MSD that have been calculated, we estimated that the number of MAPE is less than 5% for the demand and production of red ginger drink. The forecast accuracy was enough to show that the forecast was fairly accurate. According to our calculation in production planning, we can see that the company has a problem in stock management and has many occurances in out-of-stock situations. Using Material Requirement Planning (MRP), the company can decrease the chance the products stocks outs and ensure the materials are always available when needed. This strategy can increase the overall profit of the company and decrease the chance of having an ineffective production. 1217","production planning method defananda arya fadaldala, jihad bangsawan, naufal setiawan, rafindra afnan department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, 16424, indonesia defananda.arya@ui.ac.id, naufal.setiawan@ui.ac.id, rafindra.afnan@ui.ac.id, jihad.bangsawan@ui.ac.id","References

144,The Influence Of Scm Practices On Port Supply Chain  Performance: Moroccan Case Study,"the increasing complexity of international supply chains, the rise of consumer power and technological development have all brought about a clear change in the position and role of supply chain members. the port as a key factor in these international supply chains has been largely influenced by certain movements, including increased cooperation, mergers and integrations. in this context, the supply chain management organization appears to be an essential lever to improve the performance of ports. however, despite the increasing attention given to the study of port logistics chains, the contributions remain modest compared to those observed in other sectors, notably the automotive and aeronautical industries. most of the research on performance measures of port logistics chains actually focuses on measures of the internal performance of a terminal port. indeed, the lack of consensus on the definition of supply chain management (scm) and the complexity of the relationships between supply chain agents in general and the port supply chain in particular make it difficult to study the performance of the port supply chain. the objective of this paper is to contribute to the study of the influence of the scm organization on the performance of the port supply chain and on the elements of a tool for measuring the performance of port networks. this paper approaches port supply chain performance from a multidimensional view, integrating a financial dimension, a commercial dimension, an internal process, and learning and innovation. this article also has the advantage of integrating the perspectives of the different stakeholders.","port, supply chain, performance, collaboration",,"doha talkhokhet professor of economics research laboratory in theoretical and applied economics, faculty of economics and management of settat, morocco doha.talkhokhet@uhp.ac.ma mohamed-iliasse mahraz phd in supply chain amips team, mohammadia school of engineering, mohammed v university in rabat, morocco m.mahraz@hotmail.fr rachida el yamani and mohamed moutmihi professor of economics research laboratory in economics and logistics performance, faculty of law, economics and social sciences of mohammedia, hassan ii university of casablanca rachida.elyamani@univh2c.ma, mohamed.moutmihi@univh2c.ma",
145,Fuel Consumption Forecasting In A Mining Industry Using  Moving Average Forecasting Method And Single,"geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because of the heat continuously produced inside of the earth, the use of geothermal resources are utilized primarily for the use of electric power generation. pt. pertamina geothermal energy (pge) now manages 5 areas for extracting geothermal energy around the country. in carrying out energy extraction in those five areas, pt. pertamina geothermal energy (pge) requires a fuel supply. fuel receipts and fuel consumption that occur in those five areas at pt. pertamina geothermal energy (pge) often occurs in situations where supply acceptance and consumption are different. therefore, a forecasting method is needed that is in accordance with the characteristics of the pt. pertamina geothermal energy (pge) company data type in order to get the most accurate forecast results for supply planning in the next period. so, by analyzing the type of historical data of the company, we will do a forecast with 2 methods; single moving average and single exponential smoothing. by comparing the forecast results from both methods, it will be analyzed which method is more suitable and accurate for the type and trend of pt. pertamina geothermal energy (pge) company data.",forecasting,"From our analysis, we obtain the data for MAPE by using the Single Moving Average method in PT. Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) project area which includes Karaha, Lumut Balai, Lahendong, Kamojang (diesel), and Kamojang (pertalite) to be 40, 63, 24, 40,19 respectively, while using Single Exponential Smoothing we obtain the data to be 30, 39, 23, 23, 13 respectively. The verdict is that all of the area project fuel consumption has lower MAPE with the Single Exponential Smoothing method compared to the Single Moving Average method. It means that the Single Exponential Smoothing method has a lower rate of error than the Single Moving Average method, hence our conclusion is that the Single Exponential Smoothing method is the most accurate method of forecasting in PT.

148,Occupational Safety And Health Risk Assessment Of  Workers In The Hospitality Industry,"the hospitality industry encompasses various sectors such as tourism, gastronomy, entertainment, and accommodation, including restaurants, retail and grocery stores, bars, cruises, hotels, and other industries that provide service trades to their customers and visitors. as such, hospitality workers face particular challenges that can put their safety and health at risk. especially considering the current years of working amid a pandemic, workers could be more likely to pose a health risk from being exposed to a severe virus. hospitality is an important sector of the tourism industry. it employs millions of people and contributes hundreds of billions of dollars to the global economy due to the popularity of upscale restaurants and fast-food outlets.","risk, safety, health, hospitality","Based on the results and discussion, the researchers were able to do demographic profiling for the respondents in which the profile of the respondents were identified. It has been shown that 60 % of the respondents are male ages 21 to 30 years old, living in the city are most likely exposed to ergonomic hazards and biological hazards in hospitality industry. Most of the respondents were said to be exposed to static/stationary position, repetitive task, awkward posture, and exposed to bacteria/virus. In the study, the researchers found most respondents are male with age 21 to 30 years old residing in the city with a full time, rank or clerical job and single as their civil status. Since most respondents work in hotel and restaurants, it then shows that majority of worker are exposed to ergonomic hazards such exposure to stationary position, exposure to repetitive task and exposure to awkward posture. In addition workers are more exposure to virus/bacteria, biological hazards, especially this COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, the data calculated can be used as a model in assessing occupational safety of hospitality industry workers. The biological, chemical, physical and ergonomic are factors used and significantly shows and assess the level of safety of workers. 6. Recommendation The authors of this study suggest that the statistical analysis above can be used as a model or basis in assessing their workers safety and health risk. Their management then can improve and set a standard for the safety of their workers. The authors of this study also suggested to improve this study and/or my require another research as situation such as COVID-19 and other virus/bacteria may acquire another health risk for the workers.","alliah jane s. agunos, gilene ruth p. cruz, maria kathryne a. illescas, ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila, philippines ajsagunos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, grpcruz@mymail.mapua.edu.ph mkaillescas@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

149,Modeling Orthotic Insole For Flatfoot Using Finite Element  Analysis And 3D Scanning,"medical practices are greatly impacted by new engineering technologies. for those who suffer from disordered feet, several engineering tools are used in designing and manufacturing medical insoles. there is a significant percentage of people who need medical insoles due to flat feet, hollow feet, diabetes, etc. the advancement of engineering materials, computer aided design, and computer aided manufacturing gave podiatrists the ability to do their jobs better. two advanced engineering techniques were used to design and manufacture medical insoles in this study, one is 3d scanning, and the other is finite element analysis (fea). podiatrists can create a complete foot solid model using 3d scanning and cad software. using the same cad package, the insole could be designed from this model. different manufacturing techniques could be used to create a typical insole using the foot model. fea enables analysis of the disordered foot with different insole designs in order to optimize patient comfort. a statistical analysis was conducted in this paper to prove the unique needs of every foot, even for the same individual. a fea was conducted to examine the effect of the proposed insole on the plantar pressure of the disordered foot.","orthotic insoles, flatfoot, including walking, running","Nine subjects with flatfoot defects were randomly selected and tested. Their results showed notable differences. Statistics showed significant differences between the two feet of the same subject. The differences are affected by the subject's body characteristics. According to this study, a standard insole for flatfoot would not be a good choice for all subjects. A personally costumed insole should be used for every subject. Moreover, different insoles may be needed for each foot of the same subject. Based on the range of experiments and verifications conducted in the present work, the following conclusions could be drawn: 1.The decrease in pressure while using insole, give relief to patient as he can walk without pain. 2.Due to the increase in contact pressure the patient feels more comfort and the posture of the body is balanced and more stable. With respect to results of this research it is recommended to: 1.Use customized insoles for people with ill foot, particularly those who suffer severe syndromes, as commercial insoles may not match their needs. 2.Although FEA is a time consuming process, it might be needed in some cases to assure the comfort of ill foot under different conditions. FEA has the advantage to predict the stresses in foot structure under different conditions.","adham ragab associate professor industrial engineering department king saud university, riyadh, saudi arabia aragab@ksu.edu.sa",
150,Stress Factors Affecting The Motivation Of Senior High  School Stem Students At Mapua University In A Virtual,"due to the ongoing covid-19, the education industry was needed to adapt to an online setup. as a result of this restriction, the students began to bear more responsibility and exert greater effort, which had a significant impact on their motivation to learn in an engaging manner. this study aimed to investigate the relationship between physical and mental stress and motivation, compare motivation levels based on the attributes included in the study, identify significant factors that may affect stress, and offer suggestions and contingency plans to avoid such issues in the long run. the study falls on a non-experimental descriptive and cross-sectional (type 2) research design. the study used a convenience type of sampling and close-ended online questionnaires in the form of a likert scale with a sample of 65 mapua university shs stem students who currently participate in an online class. the gathered data were analyzed using pearson correlation, multiple linear regression, and kepner-tregoe analysis. the study's findings revealed that there was a significant relationship between body image perceptions and physical stress. for mental stress, the factors with significant relationships are anxiety, difficulty with change adaptation, and economic pressure. lastly, it was found that both types of stress- physical and mental, affect motivation.","education, physical stress, mental stress, motivation","The researchers have reached some conclusions based on the overall findings of this study in this chapter. The major goal of this study, as previously stated, was to determine the relationship between each type of stress and motivation. Except for heavy workload and environmental distractions, all factors were positively and significantly associated with the appropriate type of stress, owing to the nature of online classes possibly triggering both types. In other words, the levels of stress among senior high school STEM students were highly affected by negative body image perceptions, anxiety, difficulty with change adaptation, and economic pressure brought about by the pandemic. On the other hand, students' physical and mental stress levels may severely hinder their learning motivation through online classes. The researchers, therefore, conclude that while students' dedicated work in class was clear, the continual pattern, given the current set-up, may cause learners to feel demotivated and dissatisfied. Finally, the researchers concluded that body image perceptions significantly affect physical stress. All sub-factors of mental stress, including anxiety, difficulty with change adaptation, and economic pressure, significantly affect mental stress. Then, as seen in table 10, both types of stress, namely physical and mental stress, affect students’ motivation. However, it can also be seen from the results between the subfactors and their corresponding stress that mental stress was most likely the type of stress that greatly affected motivation since its three subfactors were revealed as significant predictors. Moreover, according to the Kentucky Counseling Center (2022), virtual learning exhaustion is real, and it may make students and educators anxious and stressed. 1291","learning set-up during covid-19 pandemic kaneesha ysabel b. rosales, marc andrei b. besana, derek patrick m. santos science, technology, engineering and mathematics mapua university manila, philippines kybrosales@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mabbesana@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, dpmsantos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph alma rose villapando department of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila, philippines acvillapando@mymail.mapua.edu.ph","References

151,Importance Of Same Day Delivery Of Fast-Moving  Consumer Goods For,"customer habits have changed with the rapid growth of e-commerce globally. it has become inevitable for companies to produce solutions according to the preferences of customers in fast moving consumer goods (fmcg) where competition is high. in this study, which looks at the fmcg sector from a broad perspective, how customer habits have changed over the years, the growth charts of e-commerce, their sales shares, their importance for fmcg products and the effects of same-day delivery on customer decisions are explained. how these global issues have changed for türkiye is also compared with global data. the development of the e-commerce sector in türkiye in recent years is presented. this study emphasizes the importance of e-commerce companies selling fmcg to switch to the same day delivery method. key words: fast-moving consumer goods, e-commerce, same-day delivery, consumer behavior. 1. introduction the fast-moving consumer goods (fmcg) industry has a proven track record of producing consistent growth across mass brands. however, as customer behavior changes and the channel ecosystem shifts, the structure that launched the industry to success seems to be under challenge. companies under this competition must satisfy their customer's need to survive in this environment. the fmcg industry is always evolving and becoming extremely fast-paced to respond to the quickly changing needs of the younger generation. companies are evolving and efficiently producing new solutions to expand or maintain market shares in the competitive fmcg sector. e-commerce is becoming one of the most significant channels for these products group. compared to the traditional channels and the total trade, e-commerce is growing much more. in addition, the sales share of e-commerce for the fmcg sector is also growing. in türkiye, the growth rate of e-commerce is also higher compared to the global sector because of the younger generation population. that's why both fmcg companies and e-commerce companies which sell fmcg products should be up to date to provide the needed solutions for the customer needs. for the e-commerce sector, customer satisfaction is also critical. every year, the number of online buyers grows, and customer behavior shifts tremendously. customers are making more demands when it comes to having their products delivered, with a pleasing service that is both free and fast. order delivery time has become an important aspect of the online purchasing experience and a decisive factor for many customers. customers might abandon their orders due to long delivery periods. one of the most crucial is same-day or next-day delivery, which has inspired plenty of new business models. 1294",,"The fast-moving consumer products market has a direct impact on the performance of growing mass-market brands. But the business is hard. In this atmosphere, businesses must satisfy needs of their customers to exist. Because of the number of younger populations, Türkiye's e-commerce growth rate is also higher than the worldwide sector. As a result, both FMCG companies and e-commerce enterprises that offer FMCG products should stay current to supply the necessary solutions for customer demand. Customer satisfaction is extremely crucial in the e-commerce industry. The number of online buyers expands every year, and customer behavior changes dramatically. To meet the rapidly changing needs of the current customer needs, the FMCG business is constantly expanding and shifting quickly. In the competitive FMCG sector, companies are evolving and efficiently generating innovative solutions to expand or preserve market share. E-commerce is increasingly becoming one of the most important channels. E-commerce is developing at a significantly faster rate than traditional channels and total trade. Furthermore, share of e-sales in the FMCG sector is increasing. Consumers are demanding that their products be delivered with a pleasant service that is both free and quick. For many customers, order delivery time has become a key element of the online purchase experience and a deciding element. Long delivery times may cause customers to abandon their orders. One of the most significant is same- day or next-day delivery, which has created several innovative business models. Conditions in the e-commerce logistics industry, which has undergone rapid growth in recent years, have also changed. Same-day delivery is a huge bonus for customers. As a result of this situation, the need for e-commerce logistics increased. 1300","e-commerce companies onur delikurt department of industrial engineering bahcesehir university istanbul, türkiye adnan corum department of industrial engineering bahcesehir university istanbul, türkiye","References

154,"Demand And Inventory Simulation Using Time Series.  Jhon Rodríguez Salsavilca, Ingrid Guevara Niño","the importance of implementing an adequate demand and inventory management process improves coordination in supply chain models. the purpose of this research is to analyze and propose the application of a forecasting technique and the implementation of a continuous inventory review policy by designing a simulation for a company in the veterinary commercial sector. currently, companies without this coordination obtains an inadequate inventory level generating losses in profits and a low demand level of service. this study presents as a result an optimization model based on the arima technique and an inventory model simulated in arena software.","time series, optimization","After the completion of this study, it is concluded that it is feasible to propose an optimization scenario in inventory management through the ARIMA forecasting technique based on programming language and the simulation technique. The results obtained from this study show that it is feasible to propose an optimization scenario where the net profit achieves an increase of 60.18%, which represents US$ 117,671.01 additional to the current situation. Likewise, it was possible to fulfill the main objective of the study to analyze and propose an efficient demand forecasting method and to propose an inventory policy suitable for the company to reduce uncertainty in both demand and inventory in search of a demand and inventory balance. For the above, it should be noted that it was necessary to apply a demand forecasting technique and a continuous review model based on a reorder point, adding, and proposing a defined economic lot quantity and a replenishment period. With respect to the practical implications of this study, the procedure developed in this study is presented as an improvement tool that encourages the correct practice of inventory management for other companies of the same characteristics, in terms of sector and size. Finally, the article presented is proposed as a first step for future scientific research related to the topics developed. Also, as a proposal for future research is to study the seasonality of veterinary pharmaceuticals and its impact on the current logistics model.","-*universidad de lima, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20163516@aloe.ulima.edu.pe , 20163157@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima, instituto de investigación científica, carrera de ingeniería industrial. lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",
155,Identifying Larg Relationships In Scm Through The House  Of Quality,"in the current context of such high uncertainty in which supply chains are operating, implementing something from the lean, agile, resilient, and green (larg) paradigms can promote competitive advantage in supply chain management (scm). however, the merge/mixture of paradigms implies trade-offs among the attributes of the supply chain, as some are positively related, generating synergies, while others are negatively related, generating divergences. the purpose of this paper is to identify the relationships between larg paradigms in scm. a decision-support tool regarding the larg paradigms is proposed based on the house of quality relationship matrix. to do so, a set of requirements to satisfy customer expectations as well as a set of performance measures must be identified. the two most appropriate sets, defined and ranked by a panel of experts, are used to build the relationship matrix, which is used to explore how each performance measure is related to each customer’s expectation. this work is an embryo of a new approach to the analysis of the interrelationships between the larg paradigms in scm. such an approach will help academics and managers to better identify the trade-offs between the larg paradigms, contributing to the development of more sustainable and competitive supply chains.","lean, resilient, green","The relationship between customers’ needs and performance measures is a challenging subject that this piece of research tried to address. The adopted approach, based on the principles of the QFD, proved to be promising regarding the ability to characterize complex relationships, notably those associated with Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green paradigms. This integration provides a framework for designing SCs that can cope with synergies and conflicts among those paradigms. The exploratory research presented will be further developed, aiming at a generalization that can support adjustments to specific SC contexts, such as those that characterize the automotive industry or healthcare systems.

156,Experimental Testing And Numerical Modelling Validation  For Ranque-Hilsch Vortex Cooling Tube Design,"space cooling has a long history of adopting unconventional ways. the vortex tube cooling system (vtcs), a non- traditional cooling system with no moving parts, is the subject of this research. it was designed using cad and parameters culled from the literature. this system's design includes a control valve, and a cold air orifice. to achieve the best cooling effect, unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (upvc) material was employed in the design. by employing the hot and cold ends of the tube, it was feasible to segregate warm and cold air. the amount of hot air discharged through the tube was varied to experiment a hot-air/cold-air mass fraction for the most cooling at different inlet pressures. in these two sets of testing, the inlet air pressure and mass percentage of hot air in the vortex tube were investigated. in the design of the vortex tube, abaqus finite element software was used (for simulation/visualization of properties such as pressure distribution, temperature distribution, and velocity) for both comparative and validation reasons. physical experimentation yielded a temperature of 22.3°c, which was 9.4°c lower than the entrance air temperature. the finite element simulation projected a lower temperature of 19°c. when the hot air mass percentage was set to 80%, both the simulated model and the prototype showed the best cooling performance. at maximum cooling with an 80 percent hot air mass fraction, the input air pressure for the prototype and simulated model was 4 bar and 2.6 bar, respectively.","simulation, cooling","and Future Work Here in this research, an attempt is to be made on building the Ranque-Hilsch Vortex Tube model using uPVC material. Analysis on the temperature separation as a function of the hot air mass fraction and the inlet air pressure were tested and the results proved satisfactory and showed agreement with similar works done previously by researchers. High noise and low thermal efficiency are the main limitations of industrial use of the vortex tube.(Eiamsa-ard & Promvonge, 2008)(Kurosaka M, 1982). The author in (Kurosaka M, 1982) found an acoustic streaming phenomenon involving a vortex tube, which produced noise levels of up to 125 dB from the vortex tube's noise source. Vortex tubes may be doomed if these issues continue to be present. A study found that the vortex tube's thermal efficiency peaked at 30%, which is significantly lower than that of other thermal devices. Since the vortex tube is less efficient, its industrial uses are more limited. The vortex tube is suitable for application where compactness, low cost and small areas of cooling are involved. The effect of material properties on the performance of the vortex tube could be examined and a comparison made with this work. The maximum mass flow rate of the air compressor of 120l/min (432 cubic meter per second) was maintained throughout this research. Examination of the effect of the mass flow rate on the temperature separation is highly recommended. Also, cascading the vortex tube like cascading compressor blade sets to obtain better performance could also be explored. While the study of vortex tube flow phenomenon is still a bit difficult to fully have a unified result with little or no discrepancies, despite multiple experiments and computer simulations, a research direction in undertaking a sensitivity analysis of results from vortex tube repeated experimental and simulation results can possibly provide a clear insight into the underlying reasons for the inconsistencies.","1joseph akpan, 2edwin effiong, 1oludolapo akanni, 2victor okorie 1department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban, sa 122176142@dut4life.ac.za, 1oludolapoo@dut.ac.za 2department of mechanical engineering university of uyo uyo, nigeria 2edwinumoeffiong@gmail.com, 2victorokorie24@gmail.com",
157,Abc Analysis And An Application In The Carpet Industry Bensu Müldür,"businesses must respond rapidly to client demand, withstand competitive conditions, and preserve their existence in today's competitive climate. stock management is one of the most important aspects of achieving these objectives. businesses must first classify the raw materials or replacement parts that must be in stock before implementing balanced stock management. one of these classifying approaches is abc analysis. the practice of reviewing inventory to determine how much stock to keep is known as abc inventory analysis. this study is critical for effective inventory management in businesses. abc analysis, one of the stock control methods, was used in this study in a carpet firm in gaziantep, and the results were compared. in this study, abc analysis, one of the stock control methods, was carried out in a carpet business operating in gaziantep, and the differences between the current situation and the situation after abc analysis were presented.",,"In the study, 10 types of yarn used as raw material in the carpet factory were classified according to ABC analysis. The classical ABC analysis results according to the usage amount and cost criteria are shown in Table 3. Considering the usage amounts and costs, it has been determined which yarn type is more critical and these parts should be considered as important parts. The study contributed to the process of examining the inventory in order to determine exactly how much stock to keep, and played an important role in the development of the inventory level of the enterprise. It is aimed that these results will also guide the raw material purchasing activities planned to be carried out in the future. In future studies several different stock classification approaches such as VED (Vital, Essential, and Desirable) can also be implemented. This study was carried out for the main yarn types. The inability to reach clear information about the amount of use of colors in the enterprise is a limitation of this study. In order to provide maximum benefit in the amount of stock in the enterprise, it would be beneficial to conduct a study on colors in addition to the main yarn types. ABC analysis work on colors will be efficient in business yarn purchases. In addition, some businesses collect their stocks in more than three groups or determine subgroups within the ABC system. This stock analysis method will also offer a different perspective to the study.","msc student, industrial engineering gaziantep university, gaziantep, turkey muldurbensu1@gmail.com devran aydoğan undergraduate student, industrial engineering gaziantep university, gaziantep, turkey devran3503@gmail.com alptekin durmuşoğlu associate professor, industrial engineering gaziantep university, gaziantep, turkey durmusoglu@gantep.edu.tr",
158,*3D Reconstruction And 3D Printing Of Sections Of The Aortic Arch,"the application of digital technologies such as 3d modeling, 3d printing, and virtual surgery implemented in the medical field makes it possible to improve the representation of the patient's anatomy and to analyze the clinical case in more detail than the two-dimensional visualization of images from ct, mri, and ultrasound. in particular, the use of technologies such as 3d printing in cardiac surgery is useful for studying patient-specific cardiac anatomy and manipulating the object of study preoperatively. the integration of a preoperative planning methodology integrated with the new advanced tools facilitates the cardiac surgeon in developing a more informed and precise surgical strategy. indeed, new technologies allow surgery to be designed and planned in a virtual environment before it is performed in the operating room. this study reports the application of advanced technologies for aortic arch reconstruction in a virtual and physical environment as a tool for the analysis of cardiac pathologies, e.g., aortic dissection. the process involves the use of software that can convert the patient's medical information into a three-dimensional digital model that can be imported into a virtual environment and then 3d printed.","3d modelling, 3d printing","The study provides a methodology for three-dimensional reconstruction from AngioCT and 3D printing of a case of aortic disease. In fact, the methodology allows a 3D model to be obtained first digitally and then physically through the use of advanced technologies such as CAD modeling and 3D printing. These technologies are accessible as they are open source, leading to a low-cost but quality result. The presented methodology resulted to be flexible respect to many medical applications from orthopedy to the presented cardiological case. This is very important since there is no need for different tools applied in different medical field. The most important fact remains the interaction between doctors and engineers that can accomplish great results.","gian maria santi, giulia alessandri, leonardo frizziero department of industrial engineering alma mater studiorum university of bologna bologna, 40136, italy giulia.alessandri5@unibo.it, gianmaria.santi@unibo.it, leonardo.frizziero@unibo.it antonio loforte, gianluca folesani, luca botta, davide pacini department of cardiac surgery s. orsola university hospital, irccs bologna alma mater studiorum university of bologna bologna, 40138, italy antonino.loforte@aosp.bo.it, gianluca.folesani@aosp.bo.it, luca.botta@aosp.bo.it, davide.pacini@unibo.it",

160,Electric Vehicle For Mobility Of Disabled People In Indoor  Public Environment,,,"The research area within which SIS operates is that of sustainable electric mobility for users with disabilities having particular attention to confined spaces (Figure 16). The design methodology used was the User Centered Design, which involves a design aimed at satisfying needs that derive from a survey on the users of the product / service, in order to understand its characteristics and real needs. The study was carried out on users attending Bari's Karol Wojtyla airport through interviews and focus groups. The design was therefore conducted keeping in mind the results of these surveys: different needs for users with different disabilities but a common goal: greater autonomy. SIS is therefore configured as an autonomous vehicle for users with reduced mobility available in airport, designed not for a small group of users with particular disabilities but for a large group of these, to give them greater autonomy and safety during their stay whithin the airport. In fact, SIS is studied in its functional elements such as ergonomics and sizing and uses existing technologies such as the level 4 autonomous driving system, voice control, drive wheel technology and that of the access ramp. The attention to the technological part continues with the study of the battery connected 1386",,"References

161,"Profiling Customers Using Their Credit Card Spending  Ma, Nang Laik","the banking industry is very competitive, and to improve their top lines, the bank wants to improve the services offered to their customers. therefore, the bank spends a lot of time understanding the customer's profile and developing relevant propositions and offers for each customer segment. given the richness of credit card transactional data, the authors propose how the bank can apply data analytics to profile the customers and understand their spending patterns. in this paper, the authors use rfm analysis to profile the bank customers into various segments, identify the most valuable customers segment, and understand their characteristics and purchasing patterns to promote relevant marketing strategies to increase bank revenue.","segmentation, customer profile, rfm analysis","To boost the merchant offering and ecosystem to attract the 'Long lost high-value customer'', 'Good value customer,' and ‘High Roller,' the bank needs to increase the recency and the frequency of their transactions. We can also include the customer's demographics information and run cluster analysis with RFM score, which will be the direction for our future research; we can further explore using association analysis or Market Basket Analysis (MBA) to explore the merchant categories and merchants that the bank can consider working with. We will recommend the following to the bank: A Generic Cash Back / Rewards Card, targeted at the certain customer segments mentioned above specifically to encourage them to spend larger amounts more frequently. Merchant Ecosystem: A seamless multi-brand, multi-category card promotion and rebate ecosystem integrated with the bank credit card. The merchant ecosystem is specifically catered to our target customer group, including partnerships with preferred merchant categories and merchants. Sign up perks to drive spending on the merchants in the merchant ecosystem and develop a stickiness towards these merchants. Promotional campaigns to encourage spending within the merchant ecosystem to drive up wallet-share, improve merchant loyalty and increase card utilization. The bank could look into acquiring more similar merchants to the currently identified merchants in the prime merchant categories, adjusting the merchant mix to keep up with changing and current spending trends, and work closely with these new and existing merchants for product and deal promotions for our target group. In light of the current COVID-19 situation, the bank can account for the geographical sensitivity, which was evident in our insight of transactions being highly location-dependent, predominantly within the residential regions where the cardholders live. There could be an introduction of a ""Buy Local"" Campaign where the users of the bank can benefit from better rewards and higher cashback by spending at merchants within their residential regions. Marketing Efforts: Targeted location-specific marketing campaigns, targeted advertisements on social media platforms, and online marketing campaigns leveraging on the recent e-commerce boom. Targeted at existing and new customer profiles that fit our targeted profiles. To further increase revenue from the larger pool of revolvers, the bank can focus on high spenders or occasional revolvers, or both. Increasing transaction volume and value from this group will have a significant impact on generating higher revenue for the bank. Through the profiling of these customers, the authors recommended that curating promotional/ marketing campaigns based on the identified profiles can help improve customer experience and, in turn, drive sales and revenue for the bank.

164,Characterizing Renewable Electricity Supply In Transitioning  Electricity Systems,"globally, electricity systems are transitioning from marginal to dominant renewable energy systems in terms of installed capacity and electricity generation shares. this transition has led to the situation of matching dynamic supply with dynamic demand. for effective management, electricity system planners and operators must have a clear understanding of the dynamics of the supply sources. knowing these would enable them to identify periods of constrained supply and manage resources optimally. studying 365 supply profiles for a year is a cumbersome exercise and it is impossible to observe the supply peculiarities from such a huge volume of data. therefore, there needs to be a mechanism in place to capture these patterns along with magnitude, span, temporal effects and influential factors of supply-side variabilities. in this research, we propose a methodology for characterizing variations in supply profiles of solar and wind energy technologies by deploying a simulation-based approach. first, a logical clustering method is employed to form a smaller groups of supply profiles. next, probability distribution-based monte carlo simulation is adopted to refine these groups of supply curves and arrive at a representative supply curve, which is called representative supply profile (rsp). this approach is validated using data from karnataka (a state in india) electricity system, and technology specific rsps are developed. with this, we could represent the 365 days’ hourly generation into 10 rsps for solar and 14 rsps for wind. the results show that solar and wind supply profiles represent different seasonal cycles.",,,"varun jyothiprakash and p balachandra department of management studies, indian institute of science, bangalore, india email: varunj@iisc.ac.in and patilb@iisc.ac.in",
165,A 3D Simulation Εnvironment For Αssessing Interactions  With Autonomous Vehicles,"self-driving passenger cars are already on public roads to support the vision of a sustainable city. the research community and academia should further support the human-machine symbiosis of autonomous vehicles, manually driven vehicles, and even pedestrians. at the time being, most vehicles operate at level 2 of the society of engineers (sae) autonomy scale as they only have partial automation. however, they are expected to escalate due to cost reduction of essential hardware components (sensors and actuators) and software advancements in deep neural networks (dnn). the main challenge is thoroughly testing self-driving behaviors and human-machine symbiosis scenarios for improving safety conditions and engaging citizens in this concept. video game simulators could provide a basis for testing and showcasing the innovative features of autonomous driving. unreal engine and unity are two prominent examples of software tools for creating photorealistic graphical environments. in addition, the scientific community and academia elaborate on open-source simulators due to their interoperability features for data exchange and their inherent connections with robotic frameworks. the proposed research work presents an integration framework for the carla simulator. the framework uses an integrated graphical user interface (gui) to facilitate the deployment of a fully functional simulation that enables users to include an environment for the passenger cars and several non-playable characters (npcs) that will participate in the simulation. the purpose of this study is to exploit the interactions of manually driven and autonomous vehicles in a 3d simulation environment and provide evidence that further supports human-machine symbiosis on public roads.",3d simulation,"In this study, the authors proposed a software tool for creating a network simulation environment that includes multiple autonomous vehicles. A GUI is introduced for the CARLA simulator that customizes the simulation environment (indicatively selecting a specific town layout, the introduction of manually controlled or autonomous vehicles) and initializes a connection with ROS for controlling the autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, Detectron 2 framework is utilized along with Faster RCNN DNN model to perform object detection inside the simulation. Experiments with the simulation provide evidence that a multi-client simulation environment can support the introduction of autonomous vehicles to the wider public while hiding the complexity of the details for the setting up of the command-line interfaces. Future work could also provide functions for configuring the autonomous vehicle’s behavior (indicatively slow or fast driving or the pedestrian behavior (indicatively passing only from the light of crossing).

166,Managing Projects Under Different Payment Schemes  Juan Zhao And Yinping Mu,"project management in practice has grown very fast in recent years, and the risks managers face become much more complexed. as project complexity increases, the randomness of project completion time makes it more difficult for manufacturers to incentivize suppliers. in this paper, we consider a situation when a manufacturer outsources two parallel tasks to two different suppliers, because of the randomness of the project completion time, one supplier will often complete the project earlier (faster) and one will complete the project later (slower). based on this, we propose two different dimensions of the incentive mechanism: one concerns the faster supplier and the other concerns the slower supplier. we obtain nine kinds of contracts that a manufacturer can offer to suppliers by combining these two dimensions, and different payment schemes manufacturer can offer to the suppliers are included in our analysis. suppliers’ optimal work rates are determined and compared among the nine contract types.","project management, parallel tasks","The goal of this study is to compare the effect of incentive mechanisms from two different dimensions: one is an incentive mechanism concerning the supplier who finishes earlier, and the other concerns the supplier who finishes later.

167,Optimization Of Consolidated Shipping In Cross‐Border Ecommerce Logistics,"this study is motivated by the optimal shipment problem of b-yol, an international 3pl company that specializes in cross-border ecommerce (cbec) logistics outsourcing services. traditional third-party logistics (3pl) cannot keep up with rapid development and requirements of cbec. b-yol collects outbound shipments from shippers and consolidates shipments in its cargo terminals. the consolidated shipments are subsequently shipped to international warehouses of e-retailers, for subsequent delivery throughout europe. in the volatile ecommerce markets, the 3pl has to adjust its traditional freight consolidation strategies to simultaneously meet service commitments and minimize transportation cost. stochastic arrival times of shipment orders makes the situation even more challenging. therefore, in this study we develop a model to optimize total cost for the company, which consolidates loads from various cross-border ecommerce shippers at its facility. the model’s output is the optimal timing of the shipment, namely how long should shipment orders be held and how much should be consolidated before a shipment is sent. shipment orders stochastically arrive and wait to be served, incurring a discount cost for waiting. we model this problem as a discrete- time markov decision process, defined over a finite horizon. using the monotonic properties of the optimal cost function, we developed a simulation algorithm to determine optimal consolidation strategies for the batch service of cbec customers. finally, we conducted numerical experiments to observe the results of the proposed approach under various parameter value scenarios.","consolidation, optimization, simulation. 1424",,"berk artuner international road freight - operations unit manager emaar square mall, ünalan district, libadiye street, no:82-f, 15th floor, üsküdar – i̇stanbul berk.artuner@borusan.com dilay çelebi professor south-east european research centre city college, university of york europe campus 24 proxenou koromila, thessaloniki, greece dgonidis@seerc.org özgül demir international road freight – partner network manager emaar square mall, ünalan district, libadiye street, no:82-f, 15th floor, üsküdar – i̇stanbul ozgul.demir@borusan.com i̇lker baltacı international road freight – process development & business analysis manager emaar square mall, ünalan district, libadiye street, no:82-f, 15th floor, üsküdar – i̇stanbul ilker.baltaci@borusan.com",
168,Extended Producer Responsibility: A Management Option  For E-Waste Management,"the management of e-waste by original equipment manufacturers (oem) in gauteng province was investigated by exploring their involvement in the management of the end-of-life electronics through the extended producer responsibility (epr) take back schemes. the study also investigated the general e-waste management situation in south africa by establishing and assessing the underlying aspects of epr in e-waste management in the information and communication technology (ict) sector. literature and applied information on e-waste and epr were used, and special focus was paid on end-of-life computers. despite the challenges in e-waste management, stakeholders strive towards holistic sustainable e-waste management. policy directions based on the gaps identified in the current e-waste management strategy were recommended. it is recommended that e-waste management policies and regulations guided by the epr principles as highlighted in the waste management legislation be implemented. in addition, knowledge transfers from developed (with working epr schemes) to developing nations is recommended. epr has been identified as an effective tool in the management of e-waste. the research outcomes will be instrumental in the identification of enhancement options for the implementation of the epr principle.",,"and future research E waste management is an imminent issue as specific legislation has just been promulgated hence enforcement challenges may be an issue. With the increase in the use of ICT equipment, e-waste generation rates is bound to increase at a rate faster than recycling and recovery. There is therefore a need for effective measures to be implemented so as to address the issue and prevent the risk posed by e-waste and the threat to the environment and human health. In the inadequate enforcement of specific legislation, some stakeholders have come on board to address the situation. Most of the strategies applied are on a voluntary basis. These include eWASA a non-profit organisation which works with stakeholders that include manufactures, informal traders, EEE distributors handlers to manage e-waste effectively. The organisation, in collaboration with the industry, developed guidelines to ensure safe and sustainable recycling processes of e-waste. However, there are some stakeholders, especially the informal recyclers, who are still involved in unsustainable e-waste processes. The producers agreed that e-waste had to be tackled in a holistic manner. Although this may increase production costs in the initial stages, the benefit of the environment far outweighs the negative impacts of not engaging in proper e-waste management. Though this study looked into specific group of stakeholders, it is imperative that management of e-waste should not be restricted to only the end-of-life but also consider the cradle-to-cradle approach in the quest for a Circular Economy in line with the Sustainable Development Goal number 12. Overall, there is need for the improvement of the waste management infrastructure and perceptions towards recycling through involving all stakeholders concerned to raise awareness on e- waste legislation as well as the harmful effects of e-waste. The government should also consider supporting the industry driven e-waste management approach. Thus, it can be concluded that EPR is the possible mechanism of managing e-waste and that all stakeholders should work in an integrated manner so as to ensure the challenges faced in managing e-waste are addressed.","petronella nyakudya, thea schoeman, nkosinathi madushele and daniel madyira university of johannesburg auckland park, 2006 johannesburg, south africa pettienyakusya@gmail.com, theas@uj.ac.za, nmadushele@uj.ac.za, dmadyira@uj.ac.za",

170,A Composite Dynamic Dispatching Rule For Scheduling Jobs  With Release Dates On A Single Workstation,"the sequencing of groups of jobs on a workstation, when each group is periodically released, is a common scheduling practice in manufacturing. when the objective is to minimize the sum of completion time, it becomes an np-hard problem. solution to small instances of this problem, and most np-hard problems, can be found using integer programming algorithms such as branch-and-bound or cutting plane strategies. however large instances must settle for an approximate algorithm using some heuristic or dispatch rule. in this paper, we present a composite dynamic dispatch rule named “gap or no gap” (gorng) for tight schedules of large instances of the 1 | rj | σ cj problem that performs better than other commonly used approaches. our approach is novel in that it is counter-intuitive to keep a machine idle sometimes when work is available. we prove that in some cases it is better to force idle time rather than to schedule the next available job when the goal is to minimize the sum of the completion times of all jobs. the proposed composite dynamic dispatching rule (gorng) was tested using four randomly generated datasets. the results prove that our rule consistently performed better than both the gap (g) and the no gap (ng) rule. in the four data sets, gorng was better 75.00%, 72.73%, 85.16%, and 71.88% of the time with reference to our objective of minimizing the completion time. since most scheduling scenarios involve future demand that is not always known in advance, our proposed dispatch rule “gap or no gap” (gorng) provides a better strategy with reference to the objective. our proposed algorithm has important applications in practice. operations managers should realize that scheduling all unfinished jobs on hand does not guarantee an optimal solution all the time as there are certain instances where it is better to force idle time rather than scheduling all the unfinished jobs.","release dates, single workstation, completion time",,"ahmed elmelegy contract professor assistant professor of operations management college of business administration gulf university for science and technology mishrif, kuwait elmelegy.a@gust.edu.kw",

172,Exploring Barriers And Facilitators To Lean Implementation  In Healthcare Organizations,"in the quest to improve the quality of health services and ensure more excellent patient safety, healthcare institutions look for alternatives that could help them achieve this goal. the lean methodology has been a solution found by these organizations. this study has explored through lean healthcare literature i) main barriers and facilitators to implementing the lean approach into healthcare service organizations, and ii) practices and tools of lean used to improve them continuously. one hundred two documents retrieved from scopus and web of science databases were analyzed to reach the search goals. through content analysis, the main barriers to lean program implementation within healthcare institutions are related to resistance to change, low level of staff involvement, firm commitment to a cultural change, departments working in a silo approach, and misunderstanding of lean concepts and its benefits. on the other hand, the main facilitators are support and engagement by leadership, training, and development of workers, and cross- functional collaboration. this study also contributes to labeling the most frequent lean practices and tools – value stream mapping, fishbone diagram, and sipoc. the findings of this research provide practical implications since the barriers and facilitators raised from the literature will support healthcare professionals in their lean healthcare journey in their organizations and consequently improve their competitiveness through a high level of efficiency, quality of care, and practitioner satisfaction.","lean production, healthcare, lean healthcare, barriers, facilitators. 1458",,"camila melo doctoral student university of sao paulo sao paulo, brazil camilacorreamelo@usp.br fernando berssaneti professor of industrial operations and industrial management university of sao paulo sao paulo, brazil fernando.berssaneti@usp.br gabriel rampini doctoral student university of sao paulo sao paulo, brazil gabrielrampini@usp.br izabelle martinez masters student university of sao paulo sao paulo, brazil martinez.izabelle@outlook.com",
173,Efficient Heuristic Methods For Minimizing The Cost Of City  Bus Operations Of Indian Urban Road Transportation,"the statistics on financial performances of indian-urban road transportation organizations (i-urtos) indicate that almost every i-urto is facing huge losses in operating city buses. considering monetary loss and increased fuel cost, there is a need to address decision problem(s) to minimize the cost of city bus operations (ccbo) without increasing bus fares. these buses traverse many non-revenue generating distances. one such distance is the 'dead kilometers' (dk) which is the summation of the distance traversed from the depot to starting point of first trip and ending point of last trip to the depot without carrying passengers. a report by the central institute of road transport (cirt) revealed more than 27 crores dk being incurred in 2016-2017. an efficient allocation of city buses to depots (acbd) not only reduces dk but also reduces ccbo. the problem of minimizing dk is addressed widely. however, since every bus has a different mileage per unit of fuel, minimizing dk cost (dkc) is more appropriate, which has not been considered in india. hence, this study considers this issue. since acbd can be viewed as a special type of transportation problem, 8 best initial basic feasible solution (ibfs) methods reported in the literature are considered to reduce ccbo. from the performance evaluation, the best-performing method is identified. as this is an ongoing ph.d. dissertation work, many future research activities like developing and/or including a greater number of ibfs methods, considering depot operating costs/cost due to co2 /etc. are in the pipeline as immediate future research issues.",heuristic methods,,"organizations rupkatha ghosh and m. mathirajan department of management studies indian institute of science bangalore 560012, india rupkathag@iisc.ac.in and msdmathi@iisc.ac.in",

Where that meets the requirements in making toothpaste is the result of sample 1 without NaOH and sample 4 with NaOH in semi-solid form. In the FTIR Spectrometry Test, there is a range of wavenumbers from 900 to 1250 cm-1 which is formed in all samples showing the PO4-3 group. Only sample 10 formed the OH group in the wave range of 3500 – 3600 cm-1. In samples 1 and 4 there is more noise or disturbance due to the presence of water than in sample 7 which tends to be less. Because the presence of water causes the thermal process to be not optimal in samples 1, 4, and 7.

175,Study On The Effect Of Video Conference On The Fatigue Of  Students Using One-Way Anova And Regression Analysis,"the covid-19 pandemic pushed for the sudden implementation of online classes; students were forced to work within a new adjustment to continue their education. the prolonged virtual life eventually led to the popularization of video conference fatigue, commonly known as zoom fatigue. however, literature on the relationship between video conferences and fatigue is lacking. the researchers conducted a one-way anova and regression analysis on data collected through a survey questionnaire in identifying the factors that has a significant effect over the fatigue of students attending online classes. in the failure, modes, and effect analysis, the results indicated that length of synchronous sessions, posture, and temperature are the factors that have a proven relationship with the types of fatigue, namely mental, physical, and physiological fatigue, are present during video conferences. risk mitigation for the priority failure modes is limited to what could be controlled by education institutions and the availability of immediate resources to students, such as class schedules and meditated breaks. future researchers should analyze fatigue quantitatively to understand the relationship between video conferences and fatigue.","fatigue, video conference, online class, covid-19 pandemic",,"abigail v. malang undergraduate student industrial engineering department of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university intramuros, metro manila malangabby29@gmail.com almarose c. villapando assistant professor industrial engineering department of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university intramuros, metro manila acvillapando@mapua.edu.ph",
176,A New Concept Of Central Mobility Management System  Within Moroccan Cities,"in the last decade, the transportation sector has experienced increased demand for transportation for several reasons, including rapid urbanization and the need for transportation. this demand has added another challenge to city challenges. morocco, as an african country, aims to improve its transport systems. this process has already begun with developing national road safety strategies (snsr1 and snsr2) and implementing several projects, such as tgv, electric buses, tramways, etc. for proposing a new idea of an intelligent transportation system (its), a comparison of morocco's transport systems (conventional and new) was made with those of some african countries (south africa, kenya, senegal, kenya, rwanda, and morocco). the moroccan mobility management center (3mc) project is a new vision of traffic management, and it acts as a software package that contains intelligent transport systems by default. for 3mc to promote sustainable mobility, it should include some default software like urban traffic management system (utms), intelligent parking management system (ipms), urban bus management system (ubms), and the intelligent taxi management system (itms).","smart mobility, comparison","The transport field is an indispensable element in the economic activity in different countries. However, the increased travel in the urban environment has led to several problems that hamper traffic (congestion, state of transport modes, pollution, rapid urbanization, Etc.). The idea of the 3MC system is to relieve urban traffic by exploiting the intelligent transportation systems integrated into or imported. The solutions in 3MC are UTMS, SGPI, UBMS, and ITMS. All these systems will promote sustainable mobility.","sohaib chengaou1 1 ia laboratory, faculty of sciences meknes moulay ismail university meknes, morocco sohaib.chengaou@gmail.com kenza oufaska2 2 ticlab laboratory, college of engineering & architecture international university of rabat rabat, morocco kenza.oufaska@uir.ac.ma achraf haibi1,2 1 ia laboratory, faculty of sciences meknes moulay ismail university meknes, morocco achraf.haibi@gmail.com khalid el yassini1 1 ia laboratory, faculty of sciences meknes moulay ismail university meknes, morocco khalid.elyassini@gmail.com",

179,5Th European Conference On Industrial Engineering & Operations Management  Determining The Factors Affecting The Work-Related,"the work-related musculoskeletal disorders have always been a significant health problem for nurses, especially during the covid-19 pandemic. they were expected to fight on the frontlines for an extensive time and sometimes without rest. the president of fnu, maristela abenojar, stated that the working conditions of the nurses were no longer humane. several nurses worked more than 12-hours shifts while taking care of as many as 20 patients, refraining from having their meals and going to the bathrooms to save ppes. in line with this, the current study utilized regression analysis to determine the risk factors that significantly affect the wmsds of the nurses. the survey results gathered 103 nurse respondents from different hospitals around the national capital region. the findings have shown that several significant risk factors were identified to influence the wmsds substantially. some of the risk factors mentioned and the body region that they affected were the following: working near physical limits and working while injured affected the hip/buttocks; safety or ergonomic training experience and work duration affected the lower back; an excessive number of patients affected the neck. the study also displayed a comprehensive and detailed proposed corrective action to confront the work-related risk factors present among the nurses. organizational intervention must be done to help the nurses reduce their wmsds and have a healthy work environment. finally, a deeper analysis of each task can help further improve the study results.","risk factors, nurses, covid-19","There were a significant amount of studies about Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders among nurses throughout the world. Despite its abundance, there is (limited to) no current published study about the WMSD prevalence among the nurses in the Philippines setting, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the identified risk factors from the related studies may or may not have been applicable to this study's setting. The absence of relevant studies motivated the researcher to examine the working conditions of the nurses amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and determine the work-related risk factors affecting their musculoskeletal disorder. One hundred and three nurses were able to answer the online survey questionnaire. The survey results were utilized in conducting statistical analysis to determine the significant risk factors that affect the WMSDs of the nurses. Several significant risk factors were identified to influence the WMSDs substantially. Furthermore, the significant risk factors were used to develop a predictive model and detailed proposed corrective actions. In the present study, several respondents had reported that they were treating an excessive number of patients (99.03%), having inadequate rest breaks (95.15%), and working near their physical limits (71.84%). Organizational intervention must help the nurses reduce their WMSDs and have a healthy work environment. The researcher recommends a deeper analysis for each task to improve the study further. Measuring the amount of time for each task, showing the specific tasks, activities, job descriptions, the specific training programs, duration and date of training, mental specific factors, and the comorbidity of musculoskeletal disorders could be an additional component study. Although proposed corrective actions were included in the study, details of the proposed actions, which will be covered in a Risk Mitigation Plan, are recommended for future studies.","musculoskeletal disorder of nurses amidst covid-19 in the national capital region vernin r. felix, engr. almarose c. villapando school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university 685 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines vrfelix@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, felix.vernin@gmail.com, acvillapando@mapua.edu.ph",

181,Identification Of Importance Criteria For Evaluating  Suppliers’ Performance During The Trial Production Stage:,"the major challenge for automotive manufacturers is to customize collaboration with vast supplier networks under uncertain conditions, such as unsatisfied quality, delivery shortage, and expensive costs during new product development (npd). to address this concern, identifying appropriate criteria is a primary step for defining the best supplier performance for new model car development. previous research has contributed to several criteria for performance evaluation with rating methods, but most focused on the mass production stage. however, few studies had done during the trial production stage. to bridge this gap, this study provides important criteria for evaluating supplier performance (esp) during the trial production stage by applying the multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) approach through the case study of a famous automaker in thailand. the eighteen criteria were developed from an intensive literature review and thirteen experts survey. then consistent fuzzy preference relationship (cfpr) approach is adopted to derive the relative importance weight of criteria through four perspectives; quality performance, delivery capability, cost compatibility, and management support. the objectives of this study provide appropriate criteria and prioritize the important criteria for esp during the trial production stage, which helps to improve automaker-supplier collaboration in the automotive supply chain.",,"With various requirements in the automotive supply chain and unpredictability during NPD. Automotive manufacturers are considering identifying good supplier performance during the trial production stage. This study presents the CFPR method for prioritizing appropriate criteria for ESP during the trial production stage through four perspectives, namely: Quality Performance, Delivery Capability, Cost Compatibility, and Management Support. Moreover, these findings provide practical implications for managerial collaboration with their suppliers during automakers’ new model car development. Correspondingly, suppliers will have a guide to focus on the tangible criteria validated by an automaker. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no prior automaker prioritized appropriate criteria in Thailand during the trial production stage. These findings are the primary step in ESP. Future research can contribute to other strategies of the automotive development cycle, such as supplier selection and supplier development, to find potential suppliers to customize development for segmentation and ranking suppliers' performance for any future business selection (Min et al. 2018). Moreover, future research can extend this preliminary methodology into other industries. The concept of priority nonconformity index (PNCI) proposed by (Vanichchinchai 2021b) may be applied to assess prioritization of supplier performance by comparing importance and performance criteria in future study.","case study in automotive manufacturer kamphon pingsusaen, detcharat sumrit, assadej vanichchinchai the cluster of logistics and rail engineering faculty of engineering, mahidol university nakhon pathom, thailand armkamphon@gmail.com, dettoy999@gmail.com, assadej_v@yahoo.com.",

188,Survival Analysis-Based Delay Prediction For Production  Line With Irregular Events,"production planning involves scheduling a series of operations in a factory to produce products on time. however, with the current increasing trend of customer demands for customisation where many variations are required, production scheduling is becoming increasingly difficult. high-mix low-volume (hmlv) manufacturing plays significant role to satisfy this trend since it has flexibility through automation to produce many different products in small quantities. yet, such automated factories are prone to irregular events (e.g. line stoppages, machine breakdowns), making it a challenge to keep production activities on schedule. it is therefore important to consider irregular events as early as possible in the production planning stage to mitigate their impact. this paper proposes a delay prediction based on survival analysis to predict irregular events and calculate the disruptions so that they can be anticipated through the generation of robust production plans which can be executed at any time. this approach can reduce production losses due to production delays caused by irregular events.","irregular events, delay prediction","and Recommendation The objective of this paper is to promote strategies for robust production planning in high-mix, low-volume production industries through data-based situational awareness of production variability. Robust production planning requires the prediction of irregular events and estimating the disturbances that can absorb their impact on the production process. This paper proposes a new method to predict production delays due to irregular events. The proposed idea consists of two main stages: predicting irregular events and calculating their impact on the original production plan. A simulation- based optimisation method using survival analysis is deployed to assess the predicted irregular events without increasing the complexity and execution time of the production plan. Through the various parameters tested during the experiments to predict production delays, several conclusions can be drawn about the use of the proposed method. First, the modelling of production line productivity is highly dependent on the type of statistical distribution assigned to each irregular event variable. When using conventional method, obtaining such dataset is very difficult in the High Mix Low Volume manufacturing industry due to data limitation. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution using time to event (TTE) distributions which is effective for modelling irregular events even when there are no data points in the historical data of the target product. This is because survival time analysis assumes that if products have similar characteristics, their impact functions will also be similar. Therefore, even if there are zero data items available from historical data, the Time to Event data distribution can be estimated from similar product data. Thus, the survival time analysis method can overcome the problem of data volume limitations. As a result, the proposed method is able to predict irregular events better than conventional methods, showing reasonable prediction accuracy. Experimental results also show that the proposed method is effective in reducing production delays caused by irregular events and reducing losses associated with production delays. Although the model can be further refined and evaluated when Actual comparison of producƟon delays 1626","irene erlyn wina rachmawan, issei suemitsu, matsuba hiroya intelligent information research department center for technology innovation hitachi, ltd japan irene.rachmawan.fv@hitachi.com, issei.suemitsu.rj@hitachi.com, hiroya.matsuba.do@hitachi.com","References

189,An Integrated Framework For Project Risk Assessment  Using The Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis,"risk quantification is an essential step in risk assessment and management, as it serves as a clear metric for project risk assessment. to quantify the risks of a project, weights for each risk item should be evaluated, which would serve as a percentage of importance of each risk. this study proposes a framework for assessing the weights of risks that might arise during the implementation of their projects. the paper first examines the literature, explains the proposed framework by tackling risk identification, data collection, initial risk ranking, and risk weight calculations, followed by an example applying the proposed framework. a newly designed survey asks the decision makers to provide their experience in their recent projects and losses in terms of total project value by this risk item. by doing so, rather than asking decision makers to evaluate alternative risk items in a comparative way, consequences by the questioned risk item is a dimensionless value. the proposed integrated method uses the stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (swara) method, which quantifies the weights/relative importance of the risks, which then allows for their ranking in order of importance and criticality. the main contribution of this paper is that its method of risk quantification solely uses percentages, representing the probability and consequence, rather than a monetary value, which cannot always be applicable, especially for critical cases related to risks on human life and other priceless potential losses.","risk management, risk assessment, project management",,"volkan çakir assistant professor of practice faculty of industrial and mechanical engineering lebanese american university, lebanon volkan.cakir@lau.edu.lb mariella mansour industrial engineering senior student faculty of industrial and mechanical engineering lebanese american university, lebanon mariella.mansour@lau.edu",

192,Investigating The Effect Of Seat Features And Cushion  Material On Seat Comfort Using Finite Element Analysis,"the need for comfortable seats rises as individuals spend more time sitting to perform various activities. the design and material used for cushioning the chairs play an important part in the overall comfort experienced by the human. traditional methods, like questionnaires, for evaluating seat comfort are not accurate since the interpretation of discomfort is subjective and varies from human to human. thus, this study proposes a system that models humans of different anthropometry and seats of different designs and cushion materials using computer aided design (cad) and then evaluates seat comfort by testing the contact pressure between them using finite element analysis (fea) at early design stages without the need for physical prototyping.",contact pressure,"Cushions, seat backs, armrests, headrests, and footrests are major parts of many seat designs that aim to provide more comfort to humans, but due to the frequent physical prototypes required to satisfy all customer needs the process of developing a new seat or modifying an existing one is an intricate, costly, and time-consuming task. In addition, measuring and evaluating comfort, particularly in the subjective area, is a difficult task for designers. This research proposes a system of seat comfort assessment that can replace the costly conventional comfort evaluation methods and expedite the design process with minimum consumption of resources by using CAD to model seats and human bodies with various anthropometric dimensions in different sitting postures and then detect the contact pressure using FEA, followed by a simple validation in the real-world utilizing pressure mapping. By varying the seat features and material of the cushion through built-in libraries in CAD, the system can explore different seat designs and propose the optimum combination for the best sitting comfort. Validations reveal a 98% correlation between the numerical and experimental techniques, broadening the comfort evaluation metrics and enhancing the efficiency of the design process. Using the proposed system, designers can simply test a variety of seat configurations virtually to find the best option for the diverse population of occupants they aim to satisfy in different industries without the need to build numerous prototypes and waste resources. This presented study was limited to the Asian-Indian population and analyzed seat comfort for two different cushion materials only. Future development of this work will consider a wider selection of cushion materials and study the influence of changing the parameters of seat features. The study shall also integrate human factors simulation to study the comfort of different human postures with respect to various seat designs. A motion capture system is to be used to validate the virtual environment by detecting the human body joints in diverse sitting postures and then assessing their posture comfort using a comfort assessment tool. This will pave the way for research on human factors simulation for assessing comfort of human body posture.","hala bermamet, shayaan syed, and saed amer department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university abu dhabi, united arab emirates 100058327@ku.ac.ae, 100059863@ku.ac.ae, saed.amer@ku.ac.ae",

Both the flow chart and the pseudocode of the 2D GA are provided. The required information, such as the flight engagement schedules and the preliminary resource planning, are also discussed in this paper. In summary, the method for selecting the parents is the truncation based on a preset threshold, for crossover is both the horizontal and vertical swap by generating random exchange points, and for mutation is the random resetting. The iteration for generating new offspring, or new solutions, will stop once the stop condition is met which means the optimal solution(s) is found.

The schedule is generated in MATLAB and used as input to the Simio model. The simulation results also suggested that the optimized schedule is feasible. For limitations and future works, although the optimal job generation uses real flight schedules from the MDT airport, assumptions have been made on the type and duration of turnaround tasks and also the number of resources. For future work, real operational information can be used as input for job schedule generating. Furthermore, the 2D-GA presented in this thesis does not take into consideration the travel time between tasks and resource utilization.

196,Optimization Of Hybrid Renewable Energy Microgrid  System With Considerations For Battery And Ammonia,"due to the need for rural electrification, recent studies on the optimization of hres has been conducted extensively to improve the planning process before microgrid implementation. improvement in recent literature and practice have enabled new systems of storage to store energies as chemicals that would not be affected by the self-discharge rate, among others, of battery energy systems, albeit having its own disadvantages. hence, this paper seeks to determine the applicability of an hres system to consider these two types of storages and how a choice between the two can be made. with this goal, a mixed-integer linear programming model was formulated that aims to minimize the economic costs of an hres microgrid implementation of a spv/wtg/diesel system with battery and ammonia storage systems. the model would identify the number of each component to be installed as well as their sizes for spv and wtg, being area and height, respectively. since ammonia is a chemical that can be sold as fertilizer or fuel to bolster the economic viability of the system, the amount of energy needed to produce this chemical and to be sold was also determined. moreover, the distribution of electricity from each source towards the demand loads would be determined to yield insights on the amount and proportion of energies generated, stored, and used throughout the planning horizon. through this model, this paper has successfully formulated a model that provides decision support on several possible configurations of hres microgrids to aid in its future developments.",microgrid,"Ultimately, through this endeavor, the study is believed to have successfully formulated and analyzed a hybrid renewable microgrid system using linear programming. It can be observed that the results are not intuitive for the microgrid planner, and quantitative methods like the one used in this paper can ease the problem of production and distribution of energies from the source to storage devices up until their respective demand points. Furthermore, by having considered newer technologies such as the ammonia storage system in its design, this paper has provided room for ideas on future microgrid implementation. 41.89% 27.79% 30.32% Proportions of Energy Delivered from Each Battery 1 2 3 33% 20% 20% 10% 17% 0% Proportions of Energy Delivered From Battery 1 14% 12% 11% 0% 18% 44% Proportions of Energy Delivered From Battery 2 0% 14% 13% 40% 13% 21% Proportions of Energy Delivered From Battery 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 1669","energy storage systems kent louie y. wong graduate student department of industrial and systems engineering de la salle university – manila, philippines kent_wong@dlsu.edu.ph jayne lois san juan assistant professor department of industrial and systems engineering de la salle university – manila, philippines jayne.sanjuan@dlsu.edu.ph","References

197,Smart Sensing And Dispatching For Optimal Fleet Route  Planning With Fuel Economy,"in this paper, a fleet dispatching system is proposed. the system is able to aquiring data like truck weight, traffic condition, and driver’s habit, and then use to modified fuel considered consumption rate considered vehicle routing problem (mfcvrp) for route planning of the fleet. doesn’t like the traditional capacitated vehicle routing proble(cvrp), the mfcvrp considered more factors so it will provides a more efficient route planning in practice. a simulation is done to compare the mfcvrp and the cvrp to verify the advantage of the new model.","smart sensing, optimization","The universal truck fleet dispatching system is proposed and be preliminary designed. It contains two parts, the onboard data acquisition / processing system obtains the truck weight, traffic condition, driver’s driving habit, and other data to estimate the range of the truck. This information is sent to the cloud-based dispatching system to assign the optimized tasks to each individual truck in the fleet. And then naturally, the operation efficiency of the whole fleet will be increased. This simulation proofs that the minimal traveling distance covered by the fleet does not always mean the minimal cost in the real world because there are a lot more factors that affect the cost other than distance. Considering and bringing in more factors usually can lead to a more accurate result. In this simulation specifically, traffic condition and fuel consumption were considered in addition to the distance. However, there are still a few things that can be improved in the future. 1) There are still some data left unused from the data acquisition subsystem like the driver’s driving style, dynamically changed traffic condition, and time window constraints. 2) Consumer location can be modeled based on the real-world map. 3) Parameters need to be fine-tuned to better represent the real word situation. 4) Better and more suitable solver or solving methods should be further researched.","jianyuan peng master’s student of mechanical engineering georgia institute of technology atlanta, usa pjy@gatech.edu mulang song ph.d. student of mechanical engineering georgia institute of technology atlanta, usa msong84@gatech.edu jianxin(roger) jiao associate professor of mechanical engineering georgia institute of technology atlanta, usa roger.jiao@me.gatech.edu",
198,Assessment Of 18-Seater Vans To Determine Seating  Comfortability Of Passengers For Uv Express Service Vans,"with a high population density in metro manila, and having most of the workforce traveling in and out of the metro, many transport methods are used to accommodate the commuters. the uv express vans are one of the most common modes of transportation in the philippines, 18-seater vans are commonly used for the uv-express. due to its popularity, makeshift seats are used to fit more passengers and have 4 passengers per row. this leads to comfortability problems as the passengers fit in a small space. the study was conducted to determine if the current measurements and number of passengers of the vans are suitable for public transport. the study focuses on the 18-seater vans which are the hi-ace fifth-generation vans. using statistical analysis such as regression, the determinants that affect the overall comfortability of the passengers were determined. the recommended improvements were proposed using relevant design tools. this can be concluded that the current measurements of the uv-express vans are not suited to the current number of passengers since the seat width are not enough to fit four in a row and the actual measurement for leg space are below the recommended measurement for the leg space.","uv-express vans, 18-seater vans",,"in philippines ryan mark r. silvestre and almarose c. villapando school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university 685 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines rmrsilvestre@mymail.mapua.edu.ph acvillapando@mapua.edu.ph","References

205,Iot Technology For Wildlife Conservation Based On Energy  Harvesting,"wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting wild plant and animal species. wildlife plays a vital role in balancing the ecosystem and stabilizing different natural processes. in order to enable real-time tracking and monitoring of animal movements, different tracking devices can be used. a collaboration work with a telecommunication industrial partner in senior capstone design projects considers enhancing animal tracking devices. in this work, iot-based tracking device is designed to be powered from animal’s motion by using build-in harvesting unit. the device will be used to monitor and track animal’s motions as well as biological signals such as temperature, pressure and heart rates in order to observe and study animal species in their natural habitat.","internet of things, tracking devices, energy harvesting, esp8266 controller","IoT can be utilized in wildlife conservation to track animal migration, especially for endangered animals. With IoT, data can be gathered, stored, and analyzed. The generated reports from these databases can be used to keep track of animals’ migrations as well as animals’ behaviors. In this work, the authors came up with a lightweight IoT tracking device for animals that can be operated in a very demanding and versatile environment. The reliable lightweight IoT tracking device operates under different weather conditions and requires little maintenance after long time usage. The special embedded energy harvesting unit converts animal motion into energy. This contributes to extending the life of the battery used to operate the tracking device and extending the operation of the device to continue gathering GPS information. Moreover, the GPS unit in the circuit adds an option to track animals’ locations and send gathered data to an IoT cloud using the ESP8266 controller. The IoT device is tested on cats and dogs, however, different animal species can also be used to test the device and to generalize the research findings. 1709","emad abd-elrady abu dhabi women’s college, higher colleges of technology abu dhabi, uae. emad.abdelrady@hct.ac.ae osama abuelkheir alliance communication systems abu dhabi, uae. ousamma@yahoo.com khalifa al-amer abu dhabi women’s college, higher colleges of technology abu dhabi, uae. kal-amer@hct.ac.ae","References

207,Women And Innovation: The Missing Link  Mariza Tsakalerou And Saltanat Akhmadi,"ethnic and gender diversity is purported to be critical for innovation success, yet scant empirical evidence exists to support this claim. surveys of executive perceptions, simulations under controlled conditions and field research through proxy metrics point to a positive relationship between diversity and innovation but suffer from significant limitations. the paucity of data-driven studies on the linkage between diversity and innovation is due to the fact that innovators are almost invisible in innovation research, in sharp contrast to entrepreneurs who figure prominently in entrepreneurship studies. the objective of this paper is to examine the issue of gender in innovation through an analysis of patent application data from geographical regions with intense innovative activity. (the issue of ethnicity is difficult to approach with publicly available data.) patent application data are a direct -although not fully complete- metric of innovation output as they (mostly) capture technological innovations. a comprehensive analysis of the 31 top innovation hotspots in the us reveals that the percentage of women innovators is weakly correlated with the total patent output of innovation hotspots. while the correlation does not appear to be statistically significant, further equivalency tests suggests that the admittedly small effect is not negligible. the results of this exploratory study thus set the stage for a more comprehensive one that will have to be designed with a richer set of data.","diversity, innovation, gender","Innovative businesses thrive by anticipating market trends and needs and responding in fashion with improved products or brand-new ones that meet and exceed customer expectations. Creating business growth through innovation is considered the most important business challenge today. In fact, in modern manufacturing intangible assets like inventions, designs and specialist knowledge are worth nearly twice as much as tangible assets such as raw materials (WIPO 2018). Putting together an innovation team is the most challenging job for an organization, but one that is often conducted in an ad hoc manner. Individual innovator profiling is still a puzzling issue in innovation, but gender diversity is certainly a desirable team characteristic. Yet women inventors are strongly under-represented in almost every country around the world. Recent research has focused on the challenges facing women in the IP system (Cutura 2019) and the policy interventions needed to close the gender gap (Brant et al. 2019). The consensus in the literature is that the underrepresentation of women in the IP system is due to reasons such as the lack of access to financial and knowledge resources; the lack of understanding of the value of IP rights; the limited exposure to female inventor role models; and the broad discriminatory socio-cultural norms and expectations. Further, the limited availability of gender-sensitive data in innovation, limits the ability of policy makers to develop and implement data-driven initiatives. In addition, the limited availability of sex-disaggregated data and other gender-sensitive indicators hampers the ability of policy makers and IP practitioners to better understand the breadth and depth of the IP gender gap. The exploratory study in this paper is an attempt to help in this direction. The results demonstrate that adding a gender perspective to the innovation milieu is directly related to innovation performance as measured by patent applications. The quite modest effect observed requires further study with an expanded dataset. There are two caveats in interpreting the results of this paper. First, the analysis concentrated on the innovation hotspots of the US, and the outcomes might be varied in different countries and cultures. Second, the use of patent filings as a proxy of innovation performance does not capture innovative activities that lead to journal publications and not necessarily patents (Shah, 2019). 1727","engineering management program school of engineering and digital sciences nazarbayev university nur-sultan, kazakhstan mariza.tsakalerou@nu.edu.kz, ssalpenova@nu.edu.kz","References

211,Natural Process Design And Optimization Method Based On  Triz/Eco-Innovation,"this article presents a workflow to solve multi-contradiction problems for natural processes, in an eco-friendly way, using the eco-innovation elements and triz (the theory of inventive problem solving). the suggested workflow is based on a mixture of the most popular triz tools and the elements of eco-innovation, it starts with a problem context analysis and scope definition, and it ends with a sequential brainstorming and evaluation of the solutions. the ideal final result (ifr) tool is used as a comparison element to assess the solution. the method handles all the contradictions in a prioritized way, giving more chances for the solution to converge toward the ifr. the method aims to bypass contradictions instead of finding consensus. indeed, as it is described, the workflow brings systematic step-by-step procedures to solve complex problems and differs from other toolsets that leave the choice to the solver’s convenience. 1767",,"This paper has first demonstrated the necessity of developing a method to solve complex multi-contradiction natural problems in an eco-efficient way, secondly it has developed a procedure to serve as a guideline for problem solver.

212,Performance Assessment Of A Technology Company Using  Decision Making Approach,"performance management aligns individual aims with organizational aims. it is to obtain better organizational outcomes managing and understanding performance within an agreed framework of planned objectives, standards and requirements. the main elements of performance management are agreement, measurement, feedback, positive reinforcement and dialogue. the data envelopment analysis (dea) model, also named as the ccr model, proposed by charnes et al. (1978), computes the relative efficiency of a decision-making unit (dmu) by maximizing the ratio of its total weighted outputs to its total weighted inputs subject to the condition that the output to input ratio of every dmu be less than or equal to unity. however, conventional dea model assigns unrealistic weights to the inputs and outputs to produce high efficiency score for the evaluated dmu and therefore the number of efficient dmus can be quite high. to overcome that issue, common-weight dea-based models are proposed by the scholars. in this study, performance evaluation of a technology company that performs in the retail sector is conducted and the results are analyzed.",decision making,"Customer needs vary daily in a globalizing environment because of the competition and rapid change. Companies' ability to survive in this complicated structure is dependent on their grasp of environmental changes and their ability to adjust to them. Employees' levels of knowledge and abilities, on the other hand, are rising, and they are expected to do more than just their duties; they are also expected to think and make decisions. The performance management system is regarded as one of the most significant management systems for achieving a company's objectives. In this work, performance assessment of a technology company that performs in the retail sector is conducted. First classical CCR method is employed to determine the efficient stores. Employee number, area of the store and total premium are considered as inputs whereas NPS, conversion rate and total turnover are supposed as outputs of the model. CCR model dichotomized stores as efficient and inefficient but it did not provide full ranking of the stores. Common-weight DEA-based model introduced by Jahanshahloo et al. (2010) and Toloo (2012) are utilized for ranking the stores. Future research will focus on including qualitative data into the decision framework.

213,Sustainable Municipal Service Delivery Through A Realtime Integrated Collaborative Model: A Case Study,"the provision of basic municipal services, such as water, sanitation, housing, and electricity is mandated upon all municipalities by the constitution of the republic of south africa, with the aim of ensuring that all citizens are afforded a dignified quality of life. however, an increase in population growth and unemployment rate has spiked dependency and demand of these services to an extent that most communities have been protesting over the lack of service delivery. as a result, most municipalities are currently battling to provide sustainable services in terms of quantity and quality to their communities because of the following challenges: non-compliance with procurement processes and municipal finance legislation, complexity of projects, inability to generate sustainable revenue and lack of consequence management. as a strategy to enable municipalities to provide sustainable services and improve on their annual organizational performance, this study analysed qualitative data obtained from government documents, websites, legislative frameworks, and research papers to compare key critical success factors for sustainable service delivery namely: institutional structures, service delivery needs, financial viability, and technology models between a category a (city of ekurhuleni) and category b (emfuleni local municipality). the gaps identified were then tailored using the open group architecture framework (togaf) and zachman framework to recommend a system of systems (sos) called the real-time integrated collaborative model (rticm). this rticm is expected to enable municipalities to achieve a level of sustainability and enhance real-time intergovernmental relations between all spheres of government and external stakeholders.",sanitation,"The main objective of conducting this research using such a methodology, was to outline how government institutions have progressed over the years in providing services and how they can improve their current project management approaches with the aim of providing sustainable services to their communities. In addition, the problem statement of this research was to establish the reasons why the operating procedures of various departments in most municipalities are still disintegrated and to understand the factors that contribute towards continuous non-compliance with the constitutional and government legislation, as both these guidelines are necessary for spheres of government to achieve optimum performance and clean audits while providing sustainable basic services to their respective communities without compromising job opportunities. As an emphasis, the data that was analyzed from both municipalities indicated that there is still a high dependance on manual processing of project documentation between various stakeholders, thereby indicating the lack of technology based standardized operating procedures (SOPs) and limiting the capabilities that are associated with the use of e-government systems. Furthermore, the latest municipal audit reports supported the need for a real-time collaboration model such as the proposed RTICM, to enable intergovernmental interaction that will speed up obtaining or sharing resources amongst municipalities and removing the stigma of spheres of government “competing’’ against each other. 6.1 Future Research The proposed RTICM framework is a standard operating tool that is recommended for adoption by government institutions to enable them to shift from traditional manual operating procedures to real-time online systems that can assist municipalities to deliver sustainable services while improving their performance and collaboration. Therefore, there are still opportunities for future research on developing, testing, and operating the actual system.","job katlego ditshego, jan harm c. pretorius faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa kditshego@ymail.com; jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za",

215,Corporate Social Responsibility And   Eco-Efficiency: Impact On Firm Value In The Indonesian,"climate change is one of the most widely debated issues in the world because of the rise in greenhouse gas emissions during the industrial revolution. corporations contribute to this to happen. they publish social and environmental responsibility report to indicate their responsibility to the environment. this study aims at exploring how corporate social responsibility (csr) reporting, carbon emissions disclosure, and eco-efficiency applications affect value of the corporation. multiple linear regression analysis using spss 26 was to analyse the data. this study found that csr has no relationship with firm value. meanwhile, disclosure of carbon emissions substantially gives adverse impact on firm value. the same applies for eco-efficiency which reduces the firm value. these findings demonstrates that csr, carbon emissions disclosure, and eco-efficiency have a significant negative effect on firm value computed by pbv. they evidently had little effect on especially the fluctuation of the company's stock price.",eco-efficiency,,"manufacturing sector anisa putri mutiara sicard, nadia talitha salsabila tanjung, holly deviarti accounting department, school of accounting bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia, ina anisa.sicard@binus.ac.id, nadia.tanjung@binus.ac.id, bunda_mustafa@binus.ac.id",
216,The Influence Of Pro-Environmental Behaviour On The  Leadership For Sustainability Among Employees In Jakarta,"green business has been a detrimental topic to the current industry in almost every sector. therefore, there need to be actions that help us transition into a more sustainable future. this research studies how pro-environmental behaviour (pe) might influence leadership for sustainability (ls) and how this could motivate others to have a more sustainable lifestyle. this study is carried out with questionnaires for employees in jakarta. it will be analyzed using the rasch measurement model and linear regression analysis. as for how it turned out, pe indeed proved to have a significant influence on ls. therefore, most people do have a high degree of pe and ls. most people who have a high degree of ls were also accompanied by a high degree of pe. this implies that most people have a vision for a better, more sustainable future and are actively working towards it. therefore, there should be help from businesses to help them achieve this. the questionnaires were filled out by 221 respondents, and a total of 191 were taken as valid responses.",green business,"that Pro-Environmental Behaviour have a signiciant influence on Leadership for Sustianbility. Additionally, the regression equation shows that PE have a positive influence on LS. The most important discovery of this study is that it is proven to be true that PE does have a significant influence on LS. Using this as a leverage, business could gain competitive advantage in implementing pro-environmental behaviours to achieve the leadership in the sustainability field. Not only businesses, this finding could also be used by governments to make regulations that is pressing more on sustainability. With the significant positive influence PE has, organizational culture should adopt sustainability in its processes to maintain its growth. These findings aid in the understanding of the preceding research done by (Pabian & Pabian 2022; Hammer & Pivo 2017) where they found that most sustainable leaders are equipped with the knowledge and behaviours of pro- environmental, and pro-environmental behaviour is also presence in making compliance on sustainability. This indicates that pro-environmental behaviour plays a role in making a leader considered as being sustainable and have a sustainability leadership style. The findings of this study has implications for raising self-awareness and developing programs or systems that encourage people to pick a more sustainable options that emphasize more on pro- environmental habits. 6. Conclusion The topic surrounding green business and sustainable options have increased over the year where companies need to take leadership in sustainability for achieving competitive advantage, however to do that, pro-environmental behaviours and habits are imminent. The study aims to find if there is an influence from Pro-Environmental Behaviour towards the Leadership for Sustainability. Usage of Rasch model analysis and Linear Regression analysis is done to prove the validity of the hypotheses. The wright map in Rasch model analysis was used to describe the phenomenon in this research. From the wright map we can draw some conclusions such as: most of the respondents have high degree of Pro-Environmental Behaviour (78,5%) and most of the respondents also have high degree of Leadership for Sustainability (83.2%), additionally, on the comparison, most respondents that have high degree of Leadership for Sustainability also have a high degree of Pro-Environmental Behaviour (94,59%). The study hypotheses were validated by two methods, Rasch model and Linear Regression. The Rasch model indicated that there is a significant difference on Leadership for Sustainability from high degree and low degree of Pro- Environmental Behaviour. Meanwhile, Linear Regression indicated that there is a significant influence on Leadership for Sustainability from Pro-Environmental Behaviour. According to the study’s findings, the employees in Jakarta that is considered as consumer market have been actively working towards a more sustainable future by implementing pro-environmental behaviours and making sustainable choices, even in their leadership style. This suggests that the shift to a sustainable future is prominent and businesses might acquired competitive advantage by taking leadership in sustainability. Furthermore, the findings should help raise the awareness from individual, businesses, and even governments to take action and to encourage more sustainable choices. There are still limitations to the research that can be suggestions for the future research and researchers. First, it would be preferable if the study were done on multiple variables instead of just between two variables, the presence of other variables helps us decide which variables are influencing the independent variable in the study, it also helps us 1813","maria grace herlina* senior lecturer, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 *corresponding author: herlina01@binus.edu rivaldo senior student, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 rivaldo001@binus.ac.id","References

221,Labseek: An Outpatient Medical Laboratory Testing  Information System Using Location Mapping,"locating available healthcare facilities and other medical services has been in demand since the covid-19 pandemic and post-pandemic. with technological advancement when it comes to location mapping, gis or geographic information systems are useful tools for locating hospitals and laboratory testing facilities other than hospitals. the remaining challenges in finding healthcare facilities were the absence of a referral system that prevents the opportunities from locating appropriate healthcare facilities and getting medical advice from hospitals regarding medical tests, and procedures. patients often skip the first level of facilities to seek care from level 2 and 3 facilities, which can lead to the increased cost to receive health care, as there is no effective referral system. the study aimed to benefit healthcare access in the philippines by providing accurate information gathered from outpatient care services. this study provides assistance to those who struggle with the accessibility to services for health-related issues. the system has the opportunity to aid citizens to gain region-wide information about available laboratory facilities. this study also aims to aid and benefit future research on the integration of at-location mapping technology in healthcare.","applied computing, location mapping, e-health","The main objective of the study is to develop a map locator using search feature for individuals looking for health facilities that offers laboratory testing with appointment scheduling based on the laboratory test they need and those who wanted to talk to health care providers through customer service and helpdesk. Based on the unit testing, all program bugs have been fixed and met all the requirements set in the study. Specifically, the study have done the following to achieve the objective of the study: gather multiple hospital services information in the Philippines’ national capital region (NCR); design a database for hospital services information such as doctors and facilities, patient profile, and appointment scheduling through customer service; and, to develop a web- based information system that utilizes GoogleMaps API for location mapping. The User Acceptance Test (UAT), resulted in respondents’ satisfaction. The result shows that majority of the respondents are satisfied with the appearance of LabSeek while there are some areas that we can improve on. The overall user experience results were mostly satisfactory while a small percentage of users experienced issues, the researchers have successfully fixed present issues. 100% of the respondents liked using the web application and 95.2% of the respondents found the web app necessary. The results show that LabSeek has done its intended purpose which includes easy navigation, user- friendliness, and successful transactions between the user and the facility. The study has concluded that the developed web application achieved its objective. The specific goal of locating and directing users to an outpatient laboratory testing facilities in national capital region (NCR) are successfully executed. The developed application provides accurate searching for laboratory testing facilities without finding hospitals one by one online. 6. Recommendations The researchers identified the following recommendations on future research that can help utilize the maximum potential of the system: expanding the scope of the system where the laboratory facilities in the system can be made available extensively and not limited in a region. Expanding the covered hospital and laboratory facilities are also highly recommended. And lastly, to include features like text-to-speech” and “speech-to-text” for the use of people with special needs and with disabilities.","mary jane samonte school of information technology mapua university, manila, philippines mjcsamonte@yahoo.com kiev baculi, raphael ramirez, aries santua, danielle c. samonte school of information technology, mapua university manila, philippines, kdbaculi@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rcramirez@ mymail.mapua.edu.ph, absantua@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, dcsamonte@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",

224,Supply Chain Resiliency In The Pharmaceutical Industry – A  Simulation-Based Approach,"the recent covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the key role of the pharmaceutical industry and its supply chain operations in society. like in many other sectors, this pandemic has unveiled important vulnerabilities and weaknesses across the pharmaceutical distribution network, calling the attention for the importance of resiliency, flexibility, and sustainability strategies. one of the key challenges regarding resiliency is the ability to understand and anticipate the supply chain behaviour under uncertainty and dynamically manage capacity. in order to address this challenge, this paper proposes a simulation-based approach with a twofold goal: i) to understand the pharmaceutical supply chain network dynamics, in order to fast-track vulnerabilities and anticipate risks propagation across the network; and ii) to support decision- making for enhancing resiliency and flexibility, through capacity management strategic decisions. the main contributions of this work are grounded on the integration and exploitation of different simulation paradigms, in order to understand the cause-effect relationships in complex systems, under several disruption scenarios. in this way, the disruption risks and their propagation are identified throughout the supply chain network, providing insights for the proactive and timely development of contingency and risk mitigation plans.","resiliency, decision-making","In this work, a new simulation-based approach was developed to support decision-making for the design and capacity management of the pharmaceutical Supply-Chain (SC), aiming to enhance its flexibility and resiliency. This approach integrates two simulation methods, not only allowing a strategic analysis of the SC (through System Dynamics) but also identifying its main vulnerabilities by evaluating the performance of each individual agent. In this context, the developed approach has proven to be effective in meeting the main specific goals defined for the research, namely: i) understanding the SC behavior under different operational scenarios; ii) identifying the SC vulnerabilities when disruptions occur; iii) quantifying the impacts of disruptions and their consequences; iv) predicting the propagation of the disruption impacts along the SC; and finally, v) easily adapting the model to test different proactive management strategies to contain the disruption risks. As part of a wider on-going project, future work is foreseen to enhance the model by implementing a “broker” agent capable of evaluating the SC performance and dynamically manage its capacity, by either increasing safety stock levels implementing outsourcing strategies, or investing in new capacity. Furthermore, the model will be extended to include the ability to manage and track product expiration dates, to effectively meet pharmaceutical industry requirements, and to enhance the overall SC sustainability.

225,Credit Scoring Model Construction Based On Linkedin  Social Media Data,"in the credit acceptance process, the financial institutions analyze the borrowers' creditworthiness through their demographic data based on the 5c principle; character, capacity, conditions, capital, and collateral. however, the legacy credit scoring methods have drawbacks, including not having an excellent credit reputation as it is limited to the structural nature of demographic data. we construct a credit scoring model by combining the demographic element and adding two social media elements; content and network. the content considers creditworthiness by assessing borrowers' posts, which consist of opinions and conversations on social media. in comparison, the network considers borrowers' connectivity to their social community. the paper proposes a new credit scoring model better to represent the quality of borrowers' characteristics and behavior. the data is collected from linkedin, which is suitable to represent the professional network. the proposed model has been verified through expert judgment, including the credit providers, and has been simulated through a machine learning approach to automate credit acceptance decisions.","credit scoring, socioeconomic data","Financial institutions have the freedom to implement various types of credit scoring models. Financial institutions can use data tools to build their model if they have abundant data. The model we show here could be generalized into generic; financial institutions can make modifications according to their personalized, domain-based needs. The model built is an initial model for credit scoring based on LinkedIn social media data. For us, the most important thing is how to combine various types of data to evaluate creditworthiness. We recommend using other possible features, data sources, and predictive models to get an advanced model.","dian puteri ramadhani, putri mentari wijaya and andry alamsyah school of economic and business telkom university bandung, indonesia dianpramadhani@telkomuniversity.ac.id, putrimntrw@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, andrya@telkomuniversity.ac.id",
226,Mitigating Biomass Supply Chain Uncertainty Through  Discrete Event Simulation,"forest management and forest operations planning are complex topics requiring a holistic approach combining knowledge of the domain, optimization and simulation approaches, weather forecasting models, and state-of-the-art technology. our research focuses on valuing biomass through more efficient management of its operations. removing forest residues from piles is essential to mitigate fire risk. on the other hand, it is a way of valuing a by-product which can be used for heating, energy production, and even the production of biomaterials. there is significant variability in the availability of forest residues, biomass demand, and the productivity of operations, particularly in the forest-to- bioenergy supply chain. this work proposes a simulation framework to support the decision-making by combining plans generated by a resource allocation model with the analysis of a set of disruptive scenarios generated by discrete event simulation. the model addresses uncertainty in demand and variability in supply, resulting from fires. the obtained results provide essential managerial insights for the case study of a biomass supplier in the central region of portugal and offer prescriptive recommendations to increase the efficiency and robustness of this chain in response to uncertainty. an extension of the methodology to other sectors appears, therefore, quite promising.",,"The main objective of this work was to develop a simulation-based methodology capable of estimating the impacts of disruptive events in a biomass supply chain (that forms, in fact, a network). After defining the main features of the network, a simulation model was built that includes dashboards to visualize KPIs and cost breakdowns, to support the analysis and decision-making processes. The implementation of “intermediate nodes” aims at facilitating the management of biomass stocks. Moreover, using these warehouses will help the biomass supply chain be more flexible to disruptive events. The dashboards added value to the system developed, providing supply chain managers with information about the cost structure and main KPIs in a visual format and easy to understand. The simulation model helped portray the results of the theoretical optimisation model by representing the system over time and evaluating stochastic scenarios with uncertainty, much representative of reality. In this work, three different plans (produced by a previously developed optimization model) are tested and compared in terms of the robustness of the supply chain. Regarding the plan performance, Plan 2 seems to be more prepared for the fire scenario justified by the usage of chipper 3 (higher processing power) instead of 2. Plan 3 has shown to be more suitable for the demand increase 1910","henrique piqueiro and jorge pinho de sousa faculty of engineering of the university of porto and inesc tec porto, portugal up201706919@edu.fe.up.pt, jorge.p.sousa@inesctec.pt romão santos and reinaldo gomes centre for enterprise systems engineering inesc tec porto, portugal romao.f.santos@inesctec.pt, reinaldo.s.gomes@inesctec.pt","References

227,Conceptual Model Of Integrated Lean-Green Practices And  Supply Chain Sustainability For Manufacturing Smes,"today, competition between supply chains occurs and the existence of smes as one of the players in the supply chain cannot be ruled out. in order to win the competition, all supply chain players must have the same direction and objectives. lean-green and sustainability practices have been applied to large companies and provide benefits. however, to the best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies have addressed lean-green and sustainability practices in the sme context. the literature review found that there is a lack of comprehensive empirical research studies investigating the impact of lean-green practices on the sustainability performance of sme supply chains. thus, this paper proposes a conceptual model that is expected to provide an overview of the lean-green concept and the sustainability of the sme supply chain for further empirical study in developing deeper knowledge about these two practices.","lean, green, sustainability, supply chain",,"wilson kosasih1,2,a, i nyoman pujawan1,b, putu dana karningsih1,c 1department of technology management school of interdisciplinary management and technology institut teknologi sepuluh nopember jl. cokroaminoto 12 a, surabaya 60264, indonesia bpujawan@ie.its.ac.id, cputukarningsih@gmail.com 2department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering universitas tarumanagara jl. letjen s. parman no 1, jakarta, 11440, indonesia awilsonk@ft.untar.ac.id",
228,Inventory Performance Development In Private Hospitals:   A Case Study In Thailand.,"the healthcare industry in thailand has two main sectors: the government and the private sector. the private hospitals focus on providing service quality; it makes the customer satisfaction at high level. as a result, it leads the number and income of private hospitals to increase continuously. therefore, private hospitals focus on improving both financial and non-financial strategies. for the products, they are the main drivers of the healthcare business which are medicines and medical supplies; both types of products have different handling complexities. for the safety of the patient's life and a competitive advantage, therefore, it is necessary to manage such products effectively and appropriately. this research aimed to develop operational guidelines and inventory strategies including the development and prioritization of indicators for measurement of product performance accurately. this research uses data from directly interview with private hospital experts. for the beginning, it started by reviewing scm indicators, applying them to the bsc perspective, then prioritizing the bsc perspective and sequence of the performance indicators within each viewpoint. the method of hierarchical analysis (ahp) is applied in both quantitative and qualitative integration which is under the complex context of the scm system to be able to bring conclusions or strategies to practices. it was conducted through a literature review and confirmed through questionnaires with experts from private hospitals in thailand. the study found that the most important management aspect is the financial perspective. the most important inventory management performance measurement indicators are medication error, inventory turnover, and management cost.",private hospital,"Private hospitals are business entities that are owned by individuals or groups by management budgets and expenses by themselves; there is no government budget to help support them. Therefore, private hospitals try to develop their potential to have the best medical care and service systems to be able to compete in the market, which is the main goal is profit and user safety. The main product is the driving force to achieve the goals of private hospitals which are medicine and medical supplies. However, there is a tendency to increase continuously both the number and revenue of the hospital which demonstrate the efficiency and value that customers choose to use the service. This paper surveys the top 10 private hospitals listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), which emphasizes the need to develop inventory management performance indicators to suit the context of each product category, e.g. medicines, pharmaceuticals, operation room, and x-rays in order to assess and manage to achieve the organization's goals effectively. This document is considered one of the priorities and practices of the BSC theory applied policy, which has developed and organized the prioritization of inventory management performance indicators in the medical supplies group to be practical on the policy of perspectives linked to a set of indicators. The results of the inventory management performance indicators focus on a financial perspective that follows the principle of BSC. However, the performance indicators focus on the customer, which emphasizes the highest safety of customers. From this point of view, this is consistent with the context and management practices of private hospitals that attach great importance to income and financial statements to increase the credibility of shareholders and customers. This set of inventory performance indicators can help government and non-governmental organizations interested in the development of SCM and Logistics to apply them to the real benefits and results in the form of financial and non- financial. However, it is important to realize the goals of the organization to be able to adjust the agency's strategy appropriately and another thing is effective cooperation and communication with external organizations. This research has the scope of the development of the indicator set in private hospitals only to get a more comprehensive view or to be able to analyze the results in practice. It would be better to apply it to both public and private hospitals. Therefore, it will be interesting for future research to develop a set of indicators for the healthcare industry at all levels, including the manufacturing industry and pharmaceutical distribution as well. Another important thing is that before applying the set of indicators from this research, the organization or agency must be a tool or channel in order to collect and retrieve data for analysis properly.","akaphong pansuwan the cluster of logistics and rail engineering, faculty of engineering, mahidol university nakhon pathom, thailand akaphong.pa1980@gmail.com duangpun kritchanchai department of industrial engineering, mahidol university nakhon pathom, thailand duangpun.skr@mahidol.edu",
229,Simulated Annealing Heuristic For Disposable Medical Face  Mask Production Scheduling Problem,"with the outbreak of the new coronavirus (covid-19), many countries adapted mandatory mask policies to curb the spread of the virus. even if some countries start to loosen the disposable mask requirements, mask policies are still mandatory at least during transportation and people are highly recommended to wear them in public spaces. due to all these preventive mask policies, the demand for medical face masks has increased tremendously, and mask manufacturers began to take orders for varying types of masks in large quantities that have to be fulfilled within a short response time. thus, it is significant for the manufacturer to schedule medical face mask production tasks as efficiently as possible. in this paper, disposable medical face mask production planning is studied when the orders have different release dates, due dates, and set-up times. the problem studied in this paper is motivated from a real- life mask manufacturer and a flow shop production scheduling problem is formulated with sequent two machines and set-up times while minimizing the total tardiness. a simulated annealing heuristic is proposed to solve this problem and we conclude that applying a simulated annealing heuristic results in a fast and efficient production plan.","scheduling, release dates, due dates","In this paper, the production scheduling problem of disposable medical face masks is studied. The manufacturer receives many orders with varying release dates and due dates. We formulate a flow shop production scheduling problem with sequent two machines while minimizing the total tardiness This problem is motivated from a real-life mask manufacturer. A constructive heuristic, first improvement heuristic, and Simulated Annealing (SA) heuristics are proposed, and computational analysis is performed over real-life instances that are generated from the real medical face mask manufacturer. According to our numerical results, SA outperformed other heuristic methods. We even try different parameters while applying SA and show a certain set of parameters results in better objective function values. The questions of whether negotiating with customers to divide their large orders into two equally sized, smaller orders are good or what happens when the due dates are decreased/increased are answered. Studying parallel machines during production, alternative objective functions, such as minimizing the makespan, and sequence-dependent setup times are possible future extensions. 1946","yagmur selenay selcuk, elvin coban, burcu balcik department of industrial engineering ozyegin university istanbul, turkey yagmur.selcuk@ozu.edu.tr, elvin.coban@ozyegin.edu.tr, burcu.balcik@ozyegin.edu.tr","References

230,Engineering Education 5.0: Model Curriculum For A  Postgraduate Master On Circular Economy,"the necessary focus on sustainability issues, especially concerning tertiary engineering education at universities, has increased massively in recent years. on the one hand, the european commission aims at a long-term examination of sustainability concepts and concrete implementation measures (e.g., agenda 2030) with concrete initiatives (e.g., green deal. on the other hand, there is also a need for reform in the education system to equip the engineers of tomorrow with the necessary competencies for the use and implementation of these measures. this paper presents a model curriculum for a postgraduate master's programme on circular economy in the extractive industry based on a curriculum search and primary data collection in the extractive industry.","circular economy, model curriculum","In a nutshell, it can be stated that the basic concepts and associated measures of the circular economy are indispensable for the sustainable use of resources, such as human capital or raw materials. The results of the primary data collection show how necessary the holistic integration of these topics is in current curricula and training at the tertiary education level. Here, the integration of the concepts and measures of the circular economy into all courses, as a multidisciplinary approach, seems to be successful to be able to further develop both the professional and the transversal competences of future engineers. This postgraduate model curriculum primarily serves as a model for the participating universities to implement such master's programmes in the university landscape. The implementation of this master's programme is planned for 2023 and will be implemented with the partner universities of the CIRCEXTIN project. For the long- term further development of the postgraduate master's programme, further studies or surveys in the knowledge triangle, education, research, and business are of course essential to be able to guarantee current topics and challenges as well as competence-oriented methods and techniques for successful teaching and learning. 1958","mariaelena murphy and manuel woschank, education portfolio manager, deputy head and senior researcher, resources innovation center, chair of industrial logistics, montanuniversität leoben, franz-josef-straße 18, 8700 leoben, austria mariaelena.murphy@unileoben.ac.at, manuel.woschank@unileoben.ac.at corina pacher education project manager life long learning graz university of technology rechbauerstraße 12, 8010 graz, austria corina.pacher@tugraz.at","References

231,Waste Identification And Reduction In A Retail Bank In  Kuwait Using Lean Principles,"the purpose of the study was to assess waste and propose countermeasures to simplify the account opening process at a bank in kuwait. the study uses a case study approach to analyze the process and therefore recommends some lean solutions to simplify the process. to solve this problem, five groups of five students were formed. these groups recommend various lean strategies and guidance that can help banks improve their processes. the study identified multiple sources of waste, including overproduction, overprocessing, excessive motions, underutilized skills and long wait times. to improve the process, the groups came up with several lean tools such as 5s, poka-yoke, andon, and visual management, that could reduce processing time by about 30 percent. these solutions were recently adopted by banks, which confirmed the applicability of lean tools in kuwait banks, and validated that the solutions proposed by the students also confirmed that lean is a sound approach, as long as they have the mindset. to the best of our knowledge, there are very few studies on lean systems in the suburbs of kuwait, and this is only the second study to use lean tools and techniques to analyze and improve banking processes in kuwait.","lean system, a3, kuwait, banks",,mohamad alnajem assistant professor of operations management college of business admirations gulf university for science & technology alnajem.m@gust.edu.kw,
232,Fire Hazards By Aluminum Composite Cladding In Highrise Buildings,"recent fire incidents have caught the attention of authorities, engineers, architects, and other stakeholders in the construction industry regarding the application of aluminum composite panels. major high-rise buildings worldwide have experienced fire incidents associated with aluminum composite panels necessitating research in regulatory requirements. the uk, the uae, france, australia, and south korea are countries whose high-rise buildings have experienced fire incidents associated with fire spreading through acps. an investigation of specific incidents revealed substantial fire spread by acps, leading to losses. aluminum composite panels are a group of sandwich panels that have hardwired applications in the construction industry in the last three decades. this research identifies glaring gaps in the regulatory framework for applying aluminum composite panels in the construction of high-rise buildings. it investigates the contribution of gaps in the regulatory framework today regarding safety and fire incidents associated with acps in different countries. after ascertaining the gaps, the research makes appropriate recommendations for the safe application of acps in the construction industry.",fire propagation,"Incidents of the Torch Tower (UAE), Grenfell Tower (UK) and others trigger the urge to review the existing regulatory framework in UAE's ACP materials and the fundamental safety requirements of the building and construction industry. A specific focus on the external facade system and ACP insulation is necessary for the UAE material requirements. The nature of fire spread with ACP cladding materials containing combustible core materials raises concern over the safety of building occupants and firefighters. Consequently, the UAE should implement new regulations in the fire and life safety code of 2018 to control ACP production quality and undertake tests and inspections during installation and maintenance.

233,Types Of Hr Analytics Used For The Prediction Of Employee  Turnover In Different Strategic Firms With The Use Of,"in the era of data science and big data analytics, hr analytics can help organizations and their human resources (hr) managers to predict reason behind the employee exits and reduce attrition rate and employee turnover at an early stage. organization invests lot of time and money in hiring and training their workforce. thus, when they leave the job, the reduction of cost of capital is borne by the company. in this context, employee turnover presents a serious problem and a big peril for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. to overcome this, hr analytics is the most important tool for organization to gain insights out of big data, collected from different sources (e.g. public social media, enterprise social media, internet of things etc.) to reduce employee turnover. from static to descriptive, descriptive to diagnostic, diagnostic to predictive, predictive to prescriptive type of hr analytics has come a long way. this research attempts to explore that organization apply different types of hr analytics in different business strategy firms, with/ without the use of social media / enterprise social media (esm) for the prediction of employee turnover. (porter 1980) competitive business strategy includes cost leadership (cl) strategy, differentiator (diff) strategy and focus. by using statistical test chi-square, we conclude that there is significant difference between various strategy types and types of hr analytics used in the organization for prediction of employee turnover with the use of esm.","business strategy, data analytics, employee turnover",,"enterprise social media sonal gupta department of industrial & management engineering, indian institute of technology kanpur, india sonalg@iitk.ac.in, phdsonalgupta@gmail.com r.r.k. sharma department of industrial & management engineering, indian institute of technology kanpur, india rrks@iitk.ac.in",
234,Barriers To Integrating Bim And Sustainable Practices In  Uae Construction Projects: Analytic Hierarchical Process,"the construction sector encounters significant obstacles in its shift to sustainable practices and the adoption of building information modeling (bim) technologies. in the context of the middle east, the united arab emirates has made significant efforts to integrate bim into sustainable construction, which is utilized to advance procedures and has gotten extensive action in the literature worldwide. however, some cases in the uae have taken advantage of this essential synergy between bim and sustainable practices, while many others have remained on the sidelines, unable to realize the potential of bim in sustainable initiatives fully. this paper aims to investigate the challenges and barriers faced in integrating bim and sustainable practice in the uae construction industry. an extensive literature review is conducted to define the main barriers that are used in designing the survey. the survey was distributed among different parties in the uae construction industry. after data collection, data analysis took place using the ahp (analytic hierarchy process) technique. statistical tests were exploited for data analysis and used to elaborate and validate results. this kind of analysis study has been conducted in other developed countries like uk and usa; however, no such study has been done in uae. the findings revealed that technological and financial factors are the main barriers to implementing bim in the uae. the research findings and suggested mitigation plan will facilitate the bim adoption and integration in sustainable construction projects, allowing decision-makers to address the critical problems and barriers outlined in this study.","bim, uae, sustainable, construction, ahp 1995",,"approach lama s.m abu moeilak graduate teaching assistant american university of sharjah, united arab emirates ph.d. engineering system management g00089403@aus.edu dania abuhalimeh graduate teaching assistant american university of sharjah, united arab emirates msc. construction management g00082768@aus.edu yara mattar student american university of sharjah, united arab emirates ph.d. engineering system management g00030960@alumni.aus.edu salwa beheiry associate professor faculty of civil engineering american university of sharjah, united arab emirates po box 26666, sharjah, united arab emirates sbeheiry@aus.edu","References

237,Business Process Optimization Using A Real-Time Locating  System,"assessing the performance of intralogistics operations and real-time process optimization in manufacturing and warehouse facilities are crucial for promoting lean manufacturing in the fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0) context. excessive travelling, out-of-schedule activities for picking, and inefficient routing are just shortfalls that should be optimized with the use of information and communication technology (ict) tools. the internet of things (iot) provides technical solutions for monitoring the movement of assets at the facilities, and the development of sophisticated software tools enables the monitoring of intralogistics operations. this research contributes to the digital transformation of intralogistics operations and the interconnection with the physical world using ict and business process management tools. specifically, the proposed framework analyzes how real-time locating systems can positively impact critical manufacturing flows: i) material; ii) process; and iii) information. furthermore, the framework enhances transparency and sustainability. from the perspective of transparency, it interconnects the physical world and the processes of the company while focusing on the sustainability of the social, environmental, and economic dimensions. the social dimension is enhanced by creating a safer working environment for the employees while the environmental and economical dimensions are enhanced by minimizing the travelling distance of the moving vehicles and therefore the total energy consumption.","rtls, bpmn redesign","The road map towards the smart factories of the future includes new challenges for industries as well as for young engineers. While the primary aim of Industry 4.0 is the development of fully automated processes this accomplishment is still a far-reaching target for most of the industries. Information Technology Tools provide a basis for enhancing industrial activities. This research work proposes an algorithm that extracts crucial information about the operational processes of assets in a facility layout. Through a simulation experiment we conclude that the algorithm can effectively use asset’s positioning data to extract information about resource utilization, total distance travelled, and the undertaken processes. Moreover, this tool prevents collisions and accidents between the tracking assets within the industrial area. As a conclusion, RTLS supports business process management on industries, especially by focusing on the business administration layer and by monitoring in real-time the ongoing activities in the industrial facility. As a future step, the authors will improve the classification capabilities of the proposed algorithm by including information about the layout of the facility. In this way, more information about the processes could be extracted as there is a connection among the positioning data and the industrial manufacturing cells. Moreover, an algorithm that creates metrics about the flows and the percentages that the asset spends in each one of them could be developed. 2053","athanasios sidiropoulos phd. student department of mechanical engineering, school of engineering, division of industrial management, aristotle university of thessaloniki, thessaloniki, greece athasidi@auth.gr dimitrios bechtsis assistant professor department of industrial engineering and management international hellenic university, thessaloniki, greece dimbec@ihu.gr dimitrios vlachos professor department of mechanical engineering, school of engineering, division of industrial management, aristotle university of thessaloniki, thessaloniki, greece vlachos1@auth.gr","References

239,Integration Between Star Model Components For Projectbased Organizations Design: A Network Analysis,"star model is a framework for organization design and has been highlighted for its completeness and holistic perspective. star model has also been adapted to project-based organizations' (pbo) design. some researchers have chosen this guideline considering the connections and interdependence between its five components: strategy, process, rewards, human resources and structure. however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no quantitative viewpoint about these connections in the literature yet. in this paper, the interconnections between the star models' components are modelled, measured, and analyzed using the network analysis (na) tool. na is a technique that predicts the structure of the relationships between entities and uses graph theory to deploy its connections through mathematical indicators. the results confirm that all star model components are linked effectively, although at different levels, and that some components are the bridge for maintaining their relationships. this research seeks to provide a management tool for project managers and organizational analysts, giving quantitative support for effective organizational design and implementation.","star model, project management","The main reason for the Star Model's choice as a framework for PBO is the wide coverage of dimensions (five components) and their interrelation. This framework has been modelled, measured and analyzed in this article. It has been verified that all components of the Star Model compose a network, and their components are connected. However, it can be seen that some components are not directly connected and are only linked through a bridge represented by the strategy component, which allows the whole network's interrelation. Moreover, the connections that allow the relationships between the strategy component and others were identified. The results of the present analysis reaffirm the importance of the strategy for this framework and how this component gives the guidelines for the whole organization. Studying the intrinsic relationships between all nodes, 16 clusters are formed, mainly as a subdivision of a Star Model component. Although the model obtained presents a similar form to the model with labelled components, it confirms the concepts' closeness with its main Star Model's component. It can also be verified that some clusters cross the components sharing concepts. In general, the network is completely connected but has no strong cohesion. Some specific nodes are important for maintaining the relationship between Star Model components and work as a bridge through the strategy component. Some of these nodes are, for instance, the international organizational structure (from structure Star Models' component), goals (rewards), customer processes (process) and people practice and competencies (people). This paper seeks to be useful for organizational analysts and designers to facilizing the use of the Star Model as a guideline. On the one hand, the main concepts of this framework were modelled, and it is possible to navigate with a simple query in the Kumu.io© application used. On the other hand, the key connections of the Star Model components were identified, providing insights to the analysts so that these connections are effectively embodied in the organizational design to ensure complete interrelationship.

240,An Ontology For Project-Based Organization Design: The  Star Model Case,"star model (sm) is a framework used for designing project-based organizations (pbo) with a wide acceptance. some researchers have chosen the sm considering its completeness, holistic perspective and the interdependence between its five components: strategy, process, behaviour, human resources and structure. for sm use and implementation, this framework is available as a text guideline. if the size and complexity of the designing and analyzing organization increases, this activity could be manual and difficult. ontologies are a means for describing domain models and provide computational inference useful for the analysis of these models. this paper proposes an ontology of the sm for pbo designing, describing its components and relationships in a high level of abstraction. the resulting model seeks to be helpful for understanding and managing the complexity of the designed organization and a tool for business analysis—the above considering the automatic analysis possibilities available through the computational inference of ontologies.","star model, project management","A Star Model framework ontology for organizational designing was developed in this research. Star Model has been highlighted in the literature for encompassing the main concerns of the organizational design: strategy, structure, processes, people and rewards. These components are displayed in a guideline in a text format, and computational tools and models could be useful for facilitating the designing process and analysis. Our proposal seeks to be a designing and managing tool for the Star Model implementation. The obtained ontology was developed using the METHONTOLOGY framework and displayed in the Protégé ontology editor. The modelling language using was evaluated using the Oops! Scanner tool and the Debugger tool of Protégé. The results show that the ontology has minor issues and, in general, the ontology is correctly modelled in terms of the language. Regarding the domain modelled, some statements of the Star Model were verified into the ontology with success. Future works can continue the modelling process, mapping other relationships that could be implicitly identifiable and with a domain's expert judgement. Also, the granularity of the ontology could be increased by identifying other subclasses. The modelling of a PBO with this ontology can be made as a practical application. Also, in a complex project environment, this ontology will be useful for establishing the projects' governance, standardizing roles, concerns, and competencies, and merging the ontology with other standards such as PMBOK or PRINCE.","edison atencio and mauro mancini department of management, economics and industrial engineering politecnico di milano via lambruschini 4b, bovisa, 20156 milan, italy department of industrial engineering pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso av. brasil 2241, 2340000, valparaíso, chile mauro mancini department of management, economics and industrial engineering politecnico di milano via lambruschini 4b, bovisa, 20156 milan, italy guillermo bustos department of industrial engineering pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso av. brasil 2241, 2340000, valparaíso, chile",
241,Work Productivity And Human Wellbeing In Offices Using  Natural Light Vs Artificial Light,"recent studies have proven that lighting conditions in the workplace play a vital role in employees’ satisfaction as well as their productivity, and health in general. natural light is the main source of lighting in the workplace, and it’s very important for the employees to be exposed to it to a certain level in addition to the artificial ones. this paper reviews the important role of lighting in the workplace with regard to shedding light on natural lighting, how employees feel about it and about lighting in their offices in general, and whether it causes a certain health issue or not. this was done by surveying several employees from different companies and was supported by a correlation analysis study to study the relationship between the different parameters. an experiment was conducted to check if the employees were exposed to healthy and safe lighting in different locations depending on different parameters and indications such as lighting steadiness and distribution, and whether they faced common issues such as glare, lighting contrast, and flickering. new and old buildings have to incorporate natural light more into their structure. a review of possible solutions has been created and made for both with some innovative solutions.","natural lighting, productivity, alertness","Studies have proven the importance of natural light and its effects on workers to increase productivity, and alertness, improving their mood, and overall mental and physical health. Our paper supported the high impacts of natural lighting on employees from various industries, with the survey results demonstrating a very good result in terms of studying the importance of having more access to natural lighting, its effects on employee satisfaction, and its impact on the overall performance of the workers. Moreover, lighting conditions, in general, have to be taken into companies' consideration in order to provide the best possible environment for their workers. The experiment was conducted to check if the lighting conditions in NPCC offices fall within the range of the recommended illuminance in office areas, and the results show that some areas such as the cubicle don’t have a good amount of lighting. They lack exposure to natural lighting. Our recommendations focus on providing the best possible lighting conditions using different tools and technologies in both the existing and new buildings. There were some constraints in the research that have been identified, they can be further addressed, and further actions can be taken in order to have more intensive and precise results.","asmaaalsereidi department of engineering in health, safety and environment khalifa university, abu dhabi, uae 100045687@ku.ac.ae hasan alhammadi department of engineering in health, safety and environment khalifa university, abu dhabi, uae 100036528@ku.ac.ae dr.saed talib amer department of industrial and systems engineering khalifa university, abu dhabi, uae saed.amer@ku.ac.ae",
242,Utilisation Of Life Cycle Assessment In Environmental  Management: Review,"many industries face the challenge of coalescing economic development with a decrease in environmental burden that has brought more stress on life support systems, pushing the environmental impacts closer to the threshold limits of tolerance. therefore, it is fundamental that the industrial system focuses on the consideration of the whole life cycle of the products, processes, infrastructures, and other industrial activities during the designing and restructuring of processes through life cycle thinking (lct). the theoretical and methodological aspects in research is reviewed in literature where life cycle assessment (lca) was applied to environmental management. lca is a useful (though labour intensive) tool in analysing environmental benefits of synergies in an industrial system. literature reveals that there is a need to research more on the possibility of lca methods that are less complex especially in inventory analysis (ia). the methods should be affordable but giving reliable data that can be used for decision making. another area of research is the development of a framework that is region specific especially in the african region considering that most tools used are european based.",industrial ecology,,"petronella nyakudya, daniel m. madyira and nkosinathi madushele university of johannesburg auckland park, 2006 johannesburg, south africa pettienyakudya@gmail.com, dmadyira@uj.ac.za, nmadushele@uj.ac.za","REFERENCES

243,Seeking Circularity: A Review Of Zimbabwe Waste  Management Policies Towards A Circular Economy,"sustainable waste management practices, resource efficiency (re) and circular economy (ce) strategies must be mainstreamed in policies to achieve sustainable development goals (sdgs). the zimbabwean constitution provides for environmental rights which include pollution and ecological degradation prevention, conservation promotion and encouraging ecologically sustainable development and use of natural resources while supporting economic and social development. it calls for the development of legislative and other measures for the protection of the environment. considering this, the legislative framework of zimbabwe includes the principal act which is the environmental management act and its ancillary regulations. regulations relevant to waste management include the effluent and solid waste disposal regulations (si 6, 2007). this instrument regulates the disposal of waste (solid waste and effluent), using the “polluter pays” principle but does not explicitly promote circularity as industry can budget for the disposal and not work towards circularity. hazardous waste management regulations (si 10 2007) provides for the issuing of licenses for the generation, storage, use, recycling, treatment, transportation, or disposal of hazardous waste for waste generators and waste handlers. in addition, the country also has the integrated waste management plan published in 2014 that promotes integration of waste management practices. the legislative framework (policies, acts, regulations, and ancillary legislations) needs to be aligned to fully encompass sustainable practices in the management of industrial waste towards the transition to a ce. the policies were evaluated, analysed and interpreted for their implications on stakeholders by conducting a swot analysis. the review revealed that environmental risks from industrial waste management are complex and need to be managed in a holistic approach. this requires the implementation and enforcement of policies encompassing industrial ecology, economic instruments, regulations, and strategies that create value through the closed-loop systems, internalising the environmental costs and providing incentives for efficient resource use towards a circular economy and achieving sustainable production and consumption patterns. most of the policies did not explicitly provide for the implementation of ce strategies from a regulatory point of view as industry felt the policies use the stick rather than the carrot approach. nevertheless, there is voluntary implementation of the strategies as industry strive to achieve a ce.","circularity, circular economy, waste management","The concept of CE is about sustainable resource management and unlocking the opportunity of a CE requires interfacing with the implementation of policies that provide for the implementation of strategies like IS. Transitioning to a circular economy will require a systems approach combined with a depth of sector. The circular economy requires a change in mindset as all stakeholders do not participate in policy formulation therefore leading to the ineffectiveness of waste management regulations in implementing CE strategies. Furthermore, application of awareness Programmes on CE should not highlight more on the penalties but the incentives that come with employing CE strategies like IS. Moreover, the gaps in the existing waste management regulations can be closed by developing inventories of synergies so that industry may adopt IS. 2119","petronella nyakudya, daniel m. madyira and nkosinathi madushele university of johannesburg auckland park, 2006 johannesburg, south africa pettienyakudya@gmail.com , dmadyira@uj.ac.za , nmadushele@uj.ac.za","References

244,Contribution Of Weather Conditions On The Spread Of  Wildfires With Management System For Preparedness,"natural or human-caused wildfires happen in different parts of the world. its harmful effects have increased over the past few years in all aspects. this paper aims to study one of the main important factors affecting both the initiation and propagation of wildfires. a root cause analysis was done to study the most dominant weather conditions across the five largest wildfires that took place in california in the last few years. another analysis was performed using the iftdss software to investigate and determine which of the fire weather conditions had the greatest impact on the wildfire's various parameters. a preparedness management system for wildfires has been created, focusing on the main areas that need to be taken care of.","fire weather, climate change, fuel buildup, burning index","The increase in the intensity of wildfires has become a concern to the public due to their drastic environmental, economic, and health impacts. Preventing wildfires might not be the best option for such natural phenomena. However, preparedness and predicting the behavior of wildfires by studying the major contributors in terms of weather provide the tools necessary to avoid wildfires from propagating beyond control. Analyzing the root causes of major wildfires’ and studying weather patterns is essential and more efforts need to be placed in this area of study to provide a platform of actionable plans that can be implemented to communicate with the people in charge, as well as inform the public of the latest efforts in combating wildfires. Efforts such as simulation software are highly effective in predicting the behavior of wildfires in terms of ignition probability, spread and intensity. Moreover, wind speed can be a driving factor in the growth of a wildfire. Predicting mega wildfires can be further enhanced by studying wind patterns over the years to ensure the best preparedness and staffing plans are in place, which will crucially minimize the catastrophic impacts of such destructive fires. Wildfire preparedness is considered to be one of the most critical issues in dealing with fires. Having a well-prepared plan that tackles the main areas can contribute massively to the way we fight fires in the most efficient way. Figure 14.

249,Optimum Bio-Digester Design And Operations,"biogas is competitive, viable and generally sustainable energy resource due to abundant supply of cheap feedstock and availability of a wide range of biogas applications in heating, power generation, fuel, and raw material for further processing and production of sustainable chemicals including hydrogen and carbon dioxide and biofuels. the capacity of biogas power has been growing rapidly for the past decade with global biogas generation capacity increasing from 65 gw in 2010 to 120 gw in 2019 representing a 90% growth. the study showed that digester design, operation and maintenance is a very important aspect of biogas energy and technology development. it was established that there are three basic digester designs i.e. fixed dome, floating dome and fixed dome with expansion chamber. the main challenges facing digesters is silting, poor serviceability and limited mixing ability. design improvements suggested are manual and motorised mixing and provision of access manhole to facilitate maintenance and service without stopping the entire process. key words: biogas applications; biogas production; digester design; digester operations. introduction a vast number of countries particularly in the developing world are facing an energy crisis(kabeyi 2022; m. j. b. kabeyi & o. olanrewaju 2022). the national energy drivers of all countries globally are energy security, environmental protection, and economic growth (m. kabeyi & o. olanrewaju 2022). additionally, international treaties like agenda 21, kyoto protocol and the paris agreement of 2015 advocated for a transition to renewable and low carbon sources of energy due to high greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuel and the related climate change caused(abanades et al., 2021; sahota et al. 2018). biogas has significant potential as a renewable energy source for industrial as well as domestic applications and is therefore an efficient solution to the global energy crisis (achinas et al. 2017; kumar et al. 2018). the increasing use of fossil fuels and environmental concerns over greenhouse gas emissions and climate change has generated interest in biogas as an alternative renewable energy resource as a substitute(m. kabeyi & o. olanrewaju 2022; moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi & oludolapo akanni olanrewaju 2022a; pasternak 2021). increasing environmental and policy concerns and measures have generated increasing interest in the use of biomass resources as renewable feedstock for electricity generation, fuels production, chemicals processing and hydrogen production. this has been further compounded by depletion of fossil reserves, growing organic waste production and global warming threats which combined have increase interest in anaerobic digestion and biogas fuel resources(tagne et al. 2021). the main application for biogas is electricity generation, thermal applications like cooking, heating, and lighting, and production of biofuels. over 7000 mw of electric power is generated from biogas annually(herz et al. 2017). bio-digestion in digesters can be used to address energy, environmental, and health issues among rural communities. bio-waste i.e. plant waste, animal and human excrement, are placed in the digester to decompose under controlled conditions for optimum production of biogas for use as fuel and to heat homes while the remaining waste can be used as organic for local farms and gardens. biogas can be used to reduce the amount of plant waste used as fuel thereby",,,"moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi * mkabeyi@yahoo.com industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa *corresponding author, contacts: 22064693@dut4life.ac.za; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
250,Diesel Power Plants: Design And Operation And  Performance Enhancement,"diesel power plants are widely used in stationary and mobile power applications ranging from emergency power plants, standby plants, peak power plants and black start plants. the main elements are an internal combustion engine and an electric generator for power generation. the main challenges facing diesel power generation are high greenhouse gas emissions, high cost of power and high fuel cost. improvements on performance applied include use of supercharging, turbocharging, dual fuel conversion, and use of low carbon and renewable fuel sources in place of fossil fuels like biogas, biomethane, biofuels and natural gas. key words: diesel engines; power generation; internal combustion engines; sustainable electricity 1.introduction diesel electric power plants generally range from few 1 mw to 50 mw capacity or multiples of such based on installed capacity for power supply in central power stations, off grid stations, and are also universally applied to supplement hydro and thermal power plants as standby generators used for starting and emergency supply(nag, 2008). diesel power plants are generally installed in areas with no coal or natural gas supply with smaller and often discontinuous electricity demand like remote areas or off grid market or urban centers(rajput 2021). many developing countries rely heavily on diesel power which accounts for both grid and off grid. this introduced the main challenges of high greenhouse gas emissions and extremely high electricity cost as customers pay for both energy and the fuel used in electricity generation besides other related direct and indirect costs(moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi & oludolapo akanni olanrewaju, 2022b). the technical challenges of diesel power generation include frequent breakdowns hence less reliability and power plant availability which attracts penalties in most power purchase agreements(moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi & oludolapo akanni olanrewaju 2022d). continued reliance on fossil fuels and in particular diesel and heavy fuel oil for power generation is a leading source of high unit cost of power and growing greenhouse gas emissions(kabeyi & olanrewaju, 2021b; kabeyi & olanrewaju, 2021b). this high unit cost of power from diesel power plants is attributed to high cost of maintenance, high fuel costs, and engine related running costs like cot of lubrication which are high for typical of diesel engine power plant(kabeyi & olanrewaju, 2021a). unlike renewable sources of power like solar, hydro power and geothermal, the consumers of power pay for both electricity used and the cost of fuel used in power plants. additionally, frequent breakdowns experienced in many diesel power plants reduce the reliability of diesel power plants in supply of grid connected power(moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi & oludolapo akanni olanrewaju, 2022a 2022b) . diesel power plants are easy to design and install and they require lower capital costs. they can respond to load changes with ease and are easy to start and stop which makes them suitable for use as peak load power",,"Diesel power plants have wide applications in power generation as emergency power plants, nursery plants, peak power plants, standby plants, black starts and other applications. The plants have a thermal efficiency of between 30 to 40%, generate high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and the electricity from diesel power plants has energy and fuel costs making it more expensive than many other power pants. The efficiency of the diesel power plants can be increased by developing cogeneration plants to use exhaust heat to generate steam for operation of a steam turbine to generate extra power. The fuel cost and emissions can be reduced by use of biofuels and natural gas which is a cleaner fuel or biomethane which is a renewable fuel. The engine power output can be increased by use turbochargers and superchargers to compress the charge air which effectively increase engine power output while emissions from diesel power plants can be reduced by use of cleaner fuels like biogas, biomethane, natural gas and biofuels.","moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi * mkabeyi@yahoo.com industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa *corresponding author, contacts: 22064693@dut4life.ac.za; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
251,The Role Of Electrification Of Transport In The Energy  Transition,"electric vehicles (evs) have undergone tremendous advancement as a result of battery technology advancement and reduction in the cost of batteries. few years ago, electric vehicles were much expensive compared to the conventional vehicles. the current development is redesign of the infrastructure and further advances in battery technology in terms of charging and charge storage and cost reduction. the transport sector is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and measures have to be put in place to reduce these emissions. measures being undertaken in the energy sector include development of alternative electric and/or hydrogen powertrains and replacement of the hydrocarbon fuels and internal combustion engine (ice) designs. to realise large scale penetration of electric vehicles (ev), there is need for adequate charging infrastructure. road transport is a large emitter of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions and therefore electric mobility provides huge potential to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. the various v2x technologies are v2g, g2v, v2h, v2v. these technologies enable the electric cars to play a grid role not just as power consumers, but as decentralised power sources as well. the vehicle to grid (v2g) and grid to vehicle (g2v) technology be used to have evs may clustered via aggregator to offer grid power services like load leveling, voltage regulation, and peak shaving, at a lower cost and with less environmental impact. therefore, smart grid technology deployment will enhance the operation and control of electric vehicles making them important energy transition facility key words: energy transition, electric cars; electrification of transport; energy transition 1.introduction road and rail transport is the a principle mode of transport for people and cargo most of which are driven by fossil fuel powered internal combustion engineers(oladunni et al. 2022). the use of electric vehicles can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce dependency on fossil fuel sources, promote deployment of renewable energy sources, the dependency on fossil fuel and mitigate the release of ozone depleting substances. other than provision of motive force for transport applications, the development of new concept of vehicle-to-grid creates an import opportunity for vehicle owners to supply power to the grid and generate some revenue and a key pathway for the energy transition (goel et al. 2021). passenger transportation accounts for 50 to 60% of energy consumed by the transport sector with private cars being the dominant mode of passenger transport (rodrigue 2022). the freight transport accounts for 40 to 50% of transport sector energy consumption. for most economies globally, the road transport accounts for 80% of domestic energy consumption. rail and maritime shipping, are more energy- efficient modes with greater marginal energy consumption levels. domestic waterways provide energy-efficient means of transport for both cargoes and passengers (rodrigue 2022). the transport sector activities account for between 25 and 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions globally (rodrigue 2022). after some period of low sales, 2020 saw a boom in sales for electric vehicles. germany realised a 263%, growth, france, 202% and the uk 140% rise in sales of plug-in electric passenger cars. the us and china which have largest ev market realised smaller growth of 4% for u.s. and 15% for china. china is the world leader in sale of plug-in electric vehicles (pevs), but europe dominate plug-in car sales in 2020 with norway, iceland, and sweden leading at 74.8%, 28 45%, and 32.3% shares, respectively(agarwala & das 2021; li & loo 2014). the global stock of electric cars hit the 10 million mark, or 43% increase over the previous year in the year 2020. electric vehicles accounted for two thirds of new electric car registrations in 2020 with china having the largest fleet of h",,,"moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi * mkabeyi@yahoo.com industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa *corresponding author, contacts: 22064693@dut4life.ac.za; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
252,Energy And Emissions: Opportunities And Challenges For  The Energy Transition,"the purpose of this study is to review the role of energy in sustainable development by ensuring sustainability in electricity generation, supply, and consumption. global electricity generation remains dominated by fossil fuels with renewable energy sources contributing a smaller proportion. sustainable development needs sustainable energy which should be reliable, stable, good quality, affordable non-polluting and socially acceptable. various measures can be put in place to limit emissions from various sectors. new technology should be developed and exploited for to maximize use of abundant but intermittent renewable sources a sustainable mix with limited non- renewable sources optimized to minimize cost and environmental impact but maintained quality, stability, and flexibility of an electricity supply system. other measures that can limit emissions include electrification of transport and industrial activities with electricity coming from renewable and low carbon sources. this review recommends the use of the three main strategies to minimize carbon emissions in the energy transition. these are conventional mitigation, negative emissions technologies which capture and sequester carbon emissions and finally technologies which alter the global atmospheric radiative energy budget to stabilize and reduce global average temperature. key words: energy security; energy transition; energy and electricity sustainability; greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable electricity; renewable energy. 1.introduction energy is a critical requirement for sustainable development and therefore optimum selection of low carbon and green energy sources remains a serious challenge for all developing and developed countries(bhowmik et al. 2020). to realize green power generation, environmental, technical social, institutional, and economic dimensions should be used as a selection and development criterion for sustainable energy and grid electricity planning. electricity and other energy resources are very important inputs from the economical aspect and human well- being to develop a good framework of sustainability for cleaner and stable global environment and economies. while choosing or selecting energy sources for development or exploitation, technology and cost play a crucial role in modern economies and societies (bhowmik et al. 2020; kabeyi & o. a. olanrewaju 2020). with continuous increase in global population and socio-economic activities leading to increased urbanization, and industrialization around the world, demand for natural resources and energy is gradually increasing(ebrahimi & rahman 2019). it is notable that the world’s population has grown 2.5 times since 1950, while energy demand for energy has grown 7 times(şengül et al. 2015). these increasing energy demand is mostly met by fossil fuel combustion and nuclear power(tunc et al. 2012).apart from rapid growth increase in the global energy demand, other challenges are depletion of fossil fuel reserves, their price volatility , and global climate change have attracted much attention to renewable energy sources. as a result, many countries have adopted policies to support the growth of renewable energy sources and other sustainable energy measures in the energy transition (ebrahimi & rahman 2019). climate change is real and is here with us hence the need to pay serious attention to mitigation measures. in the year 2018, the world encountered 315 incidents of climate change related disasters that affected 68,500,000 million people , causing an economic loss of us$ 131.7 billion (fawzy et al. 2020). the climate related disasters are mainly in form of drought, floods, wildfires, and storms. these disasters are a threat to humanity as they affect",,,"moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa correspondence to: moses jeremiah barasa kabey: mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
253,Managing Electrical Fire Risks In Substations:   A Framework To Protect Lives And Assets,"substations, which are part of electric power systems are ubiquitous, versatile and serve virtually all sectors and industries. these are essential high voltage units utilized to power and reliably operate facilities in the oil and gas industry. however, this available electricity also poses several electrical hazards to personnel and assets such as arc flashes, electric shocks, fires and explosions. managing electrical fire risks is of growing significance since as per nfpa it is the leading cause of fire accidents costing personnel to suffer from severe injuries to fatalities and asset damages in a multi-million-dollar business. this study examines the numerous substation electrical fire risks. in addition, it explores the current management practices within adnoc by conducting a gap assessment to identify the major gaps for managing these risks and in turn, benchmark to adopt the best practices being implemented internationally (such as nfpa and ieee). therefore, assisting in developing a framework that will outdo and optimize the current management practices. the designed framework primarily proposes establishing an electrical safety committee and conducting a failure mode and effect analysis to manage these emerging electrical fires risks within the organization.","fire protection, electrical fires, arc flash fires",,"saed amer assistant professor, faculty of industrial & systems engineering khalifa university, abu dhabi, uae saed.amer@ku.ac.ae jumana rashed, waleed elayan, khaled almazrouei and abdulla alshabibi graduate student industrial & systems engineering, khalifa university abu dhabi, uae 100051793@ku.ac.ae, 100057762@ku.ac.ae, 100057583@ku.ac.ae, 100059670@ku.ac.ae","References

254,Goods-To-Person Picking Strategies Human Factor  Simulation And Validation,"typical actions performed by order pickers in e-commerce warehouses include retrieving, scanning, grabbing, lifting, etc. making the human order-picker the spine of such warehouse operation. for an order picking system based on a goods-to-person (gtp) strategy, the repetitive motions raise many concerns. this increased frequency of actions may lead to the development of musculoskeletal diseases in the order picker’s body. many methodologies, like human factors simulation, are available and can be utilized to assess the impact of the working environment on the human body. however, the evaluation of human factors in a simulated environment might differ from the actual case in real life since the interpretations of fatigue and discomfort can be subjective. therefore, the objective of this paper is to validate the results obtained from the human factors simulation, by constructing a physical order picking environment and comparing the output through evaluating responses from volunteers who are subjected to similar to the simulated order picking environments and tasks. three matrices of human factors were evaluated in this study. the study concludes that the results obtained from human factors simulation are in line with the subjective interpretation of the discomfort and fatigue experienced by the volunteers. as well as rula ratings are similar in both cases. 2182",,"After collecting the data and analyzing it, the team developed conclusions that summarize the findings of this project. The simulation software results were pretty accurate. As a result, using simulation to study the human factors of workers in warehouses is advisable. It will optimize the cost of studying the worker’s human factors as well as finding the best mitigations to avoid fatigue and injury risk. On the other hand, the simulation software has some limitations as it is very time-consuming, not user-friendly, and requires a high amount of accuracy to get good results. Furthermore, some postures are not supported in the simulation software. For instance, the volunteers used a squatting position to reach the lower shelf items, but the team couldn’t simulate it as the software does not support the squatting position. Additionally, training is essential for volunteers to make them understand the task accurately. The number of volunteers was based on their availability when the experiment was conducted, and it was not mathematically calculated since the team did not have enough expertise and knowledge to calculate it. 2194","fatma almazrouei student of college of engineering khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, uae 100049440@ku.ac.ae alreem almansoori student of college of engineering khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, uae 100049632@ku.ac.ae maryam aldhamani student of college of engineering khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, uae 100049622@ku.ac.ae sara alhosani student of college of engineering khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, uae 100049537@ku.ac.ae saed t. amer faculty of college of engineering khalifa university of science and technology abu dhabi, uae saed.amer@ku.ac.ae","References

255,Security Issues In Uav-Based Infrastructure Monitoring  Francesco Buccafurri,"infrastructures can be monitored by using complex it architectures involving also the usage of uavs. uavs may operate by forming ad-hoc networks and may be integrated with advances sensors, like lidar (light detection and ranging) to build a digital model of the infrastructure. starting from a previous experience of application of this approach to monitoring road infrastructures, in this paper, we analyze the security issues of such approaches, by identifying three categories of attacks, namely (1) attacks on routing, (2) attacks on measurements, and (3) uav impersonation. for all these attacks, we identify a possible trust-based approach to mitigate the risk. this kind of approach allows us to improve the resilience of the system and can be combined with standard cybersecurity protection mechanisms.","cybersecurity, uavs, trust, blockchain","In this paper, we highlight a number of possible security issues and innovative countermeasures in a UAV-based infrastructure monitoring system. In particular, we considered attacks on routing, attacks on measurements, and UAV impersonation. For each attack, we identity a strategy to contrast and mitigate the corresponding risk. The proposed strategies are trust and blockchain based. Due to the vastness of the topic, and by considering the aim of this paper, we chose to provide a horizontal view of issues and countermeasures, instead of focusing on some vertical problems. As a consequence, solutions are only sketched, and a deep implementation and validation of them is left to future work. As a conclusive consideration, we highlight two important aspects. The first is that the threat model we consider is very realistic, by considering the specific application domain. Indeed, infrastructures may be typically critical infrastructures of a country. Therefore, they can be target for attacks coming from state-sponsored, criminal or terroristic hacking organizations. Suppose for example that the infrastructure we are monitoring is a road infrastructure (like the case by which this paper takes inspiration). In this case, a cyberattack might be launched in coordination with a physical attack to the infrastructure (a bridge, for example), to masquerade the physical attack and then maximize 2202","full professor diies dept., university mediterranea of reggio calabria bucca@unirc.it francesca scoleri master graduate at diies dept., university mediterranea of reggio calabria francesca.scoleri1@gmail.com","References

256,Analyzing The Co2 Emissions And Fuel Consumption Of  Light-Duty Vehicles,"on-road emissions data for different types of vehicles are needed for estimating the co2 emissions and fuel consumption which can affect the car-buying behavior of the citizens with the goal of helping to mitigate the consequences of global warming and achieving sustainable development. the government of canada presents a dataset that provides model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light- duty vehicles for retail sale in canada. citizens can check the vehicles with the best fuel consumption ratings and lowest estimated annual fuel cost to save money and help to enhance the carbon emission issues. the data covers all the vehicle models from 1995 to 2022, including more than 1000 models from more than 50 companies. this paper focuses on the vehicle classes prevalent in the market (such as suv, compact, and two-seater) to analyze their emissions factor and fuel consumption considering the average performance of the vehicle classes during previous years. the output shows that in different vehicle classes, the range of the carbon emissions varies significantly. the new vehicle models presented to the market do not necessarily have a better performance in sustainability aspects and car buyers should pay more attention to the scores of the vehicles considering various environmental indexes.","co2 emissions, fuel consumption","In this paper, a dataset of different vehicle models that were available in the market in different years from 1995 to 2022 is analyzed to compare various vehicle classes and engine types in terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The dataset is provided on a government website in Canada to be used by the citizens before deciding to buy a specific vehicle model considering their carbon footprint. After analyzing the dataset using different plots and graphs, the following points can be mentioned as the main outputs of the research. • The maximum number of vehicle models is related to 2015 and the minimum number of the models is perceived in 1998. • The vehicle classes that have more than 50% of the market in terms of the number of models include SUVs: small, Mid-size, and Compact classes. • Companies always provided more models for four, six, eight, and three-cylinder engine vehicles respectively. • The mean, median, minimum, and maximum amount of fuel consumption has increased for the new models of vehicles (the models that are provided to the market in the last few years) considering four, six, eight, and three-cylinder engine vehicles from 2011 to 2022. • Except for the four, six, and eight-cylinder engine vehicles the variety of the models in other types is reduced from 2011 to 2022. • On average the current models of vehicles with eight cylinders are more similar in terms of fuel consumption compared to 10 years ago. • For vehicles with more than eight cylinders, the difference in fuel consumption in the city and on the highway is more significant compared to the vehicles with three and four cylinders. • In 2022, all the models of three-cylinder engine vehicles have an average fuel consumption between zero and 8.33 L/km. This is the same for most the four-cylinder vehicles except for some models that have an engine size between 1.4 and 2.5 L. • The fuel consumption rate becomes more significant for most of the models with more than six cylinders and with the size of the engine of more than 3.5 liters. • Regarding the four, six, eight, and three-cylinder engine vehicles, on average the performance in carbon emissions (grams per kilometer) of all types of vehicles with the different numbers of cylinders has improved from 2011 to 2022. • In 2022, the average CO2 rate of the vehicle models with three-cylinder engines is lower than the other engine types but all the three-cylinder engine models do not have necessarily a better performance in this indicator compared to other vehicle models with a higher number of cylinders. • Car buyers should consider that all three-cylinder vehicles do not have always a better efficiency compared to four-cylinder engine models. Some vehicle models with four-cylinder engines have identical performance compared with some three-cylinder models with the same engine size in terms of CO2 rating score. • In 2022, the vehicle models with four cylinders and 1.8 or 1.6 L engine size have the maximum average CO2 rating which equals 7.3. • In 2022, considering vehicle classes SUV: small, Mid-size, Compact, Subcompact, Full-size, Station wagon: small, SUV: standard, and Two seaters, various models of every class have different performances in consuming fuel and emitting CO2. The models with a 1.8 L engine size in the mid- size class and some models with a 1.6 L engine size from the ""Station wagon: small"" class have the best performance regarding carbon emissions and fuel consumption. The compact class with three cylinders on average has the least carbon emission and fuel consumption.","behzad maleki vishkaei a, pietro de giovanni b department of business and management luiss university rome, italy a bmalekivishkaei@luiss.it b pdegiovanni@luiss.it",

In addition, any logistical plan should always have several alternatives or options that help the process to be optimized. It was also possible to determine the ideal location of these mobile vaccination centers and their capacity to meet the demand. This can be seen in the scenarios that were proposed to determine whether it is possible to meet the district's demand and how the implementation of vaccination trucks can have a significant impact on economic and logistical issues. The scope of the positive impact of the vaccination campaign extends to more indirect aspects such as the motivation people must go to vaccination centers due to the ease with which they can travel and obtain vaccines. Different incentives that facilitate vaccination, such as the low cost of transportation or the speed of the process, can make a significant difference in protecting the population.","miguel angel arellano alcaide, hugo fabrizzio cobos valdez universidad de lima, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20162832@aloe.ulima.edu.pe , 20162984@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima, instituto de investigación científica, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",

266,Challenges In The Lng Industry: Megaproject Management Of Qatar’S Lng Value Chain Expansion  Salman Hussain Ashkanani,"megaprojects have been increasingly developed during the last decades. megaprojects have unique particularities in the liquefied natural gas (lng) industry. they are significantly different from projects in other industry types since lng requires a precise match of production, processing, transportation, and consumption, from strategic to operational decision-making. this introduces additional difficulties, risks, and challenges for proper and efficient project development and management. these challenges are mostly related to the highly complex, risky, and uncertain environment of the lng value chain, particularities and complexities of lng processes and projects, contractual and spot market trends, novel business models in the lng industry, and the transition to renewable energy sources. they demand to identify opportunities for improvement, trends, challenges, and gaps for achieving breakthroughs towards improved and more successful management of lng megaprojects, which is especially important given the current expansion of the lng value chain in qatar. the information and discussion provided herein are fundamental for adequately understanding and handling the complex, challenging environment within the lng industry towards enhanced megaproject management capabilities. this work aims to provide information on the current scenario of the lng expansion, discuss the importance of megaproject management within the lng industry and the main challenges faced within this environment, and stimulate further studies on the topic.","megaproject, lng, natural gas, value chain","and Future Work Due to the dynamic and complex environment, LNG megaprojects often face multiple challenges and risks throughout their lifetime and even after completion. Moreover, they are challenging to be efficiently planned, managed, implemented, and controlled towards providing the expected outcomes and accomplishing the desired targets and objectives. LNG megaproject management challenges are mostly related to accomplishing the project goals given multiple requirements, expectations, and desired objectives within a highly complex, risky, and uncertain environment. Such challenges demand identifying opportunities for improvement, trends, challenges, and gaps for achieving breakthroughs towards improved and more successful management of LNG megaprojects. This work addresses the main challenges currently faced in the LNG industry, affecting the development and management of LNG megaprojects, which is especially important given the current expansion of the LNG value chain in Qatar. That includes the supply and demand in the LNG value chain, particularities and complexities of LNG processes and projects, contractual and spot market trends, novel business models in the LNG industry, and the transition to renewable energy sources. Many of these features significantly impact the economic feasibility of LNG megaprojects and should be carefully considered. An inimitability in LNG megaprojects is the uniqueness of the LNG contracting structure. The current changes in the worldwide supply and demand of LNG lead to the transformation of market conditions with new trends and business models that focus on duration (short, medium, and long), price mechanism, cargo size, and an integrated value chain of LNG. Increased availability and reduced price of renewable energy sources is one of the main challenges of LNG producers as it leads to a reduction in the LNG price and impacts the decision to pursue new LNG projects (especially given that the project execution takes a large amount of time and huge investment), and leads to hesitation in such investments from the financial institutions. The information and discussion provided herein are fundamental for adequately understanding and handling the LNG megaproject's complex, challenging environment towards enhanced management capabilities. This work intends to highlight the importance of such topics and stimulate further studies.","division of engineering management and decision sciences, college of science and engineering, hamad bin khalifa university, doha, qatar salshkanani@hbku.edu.qa dr. robert eduard franzoi division of engineering management and decision sciences, college of science and engineering, hamad bin khalifa university, doha, qatar robertfranzoijr@gmail.com professor dr. laoucine kerbache division of engineering management and decision sciences, college of science and engineering, hamad bin khalifa university and hec paris, doha, qatar lakerbache@hbku.edu.qa",
267,Management  Analysis Of Restaurant Ratings And Prices In Beijing,"this project investigates the relationship between restaurant ratings and prices and compares these statistics between two cities: beijing and los angeles. the purpose of this investigation is to aid customers in restaurant selection and inform them what cuisine prices to expect when browsing restaurant ratings. 50 restaurants from each city were selected through stratified and systematic sampling. in the first part of the study, spearman rank correlation coefficient tests were conducted to test the correlation between restaurant ratings and prices. the tests show a significant positive relationship. moreover, regression lines were constructed to display the correlation between the two variables. customers may use these regression lines to estimate the average prices of a meal given the restaurant’s rating. in the second part of the project, two-sample t-tests were used to make comparisons between beijing and los angeles. these two cities were selected due to their similar urbanization, modernization, and income levels. results show significant discrepancies, indicating that restaurants in los angeles have higher ratings and prices than those in beijing. this difference can be attributed to several factors, including labor cost, food culture, and consumption.","restaurants, prices, rates, srcc","In the first part of the project, two Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient tests were conducted for the samples in Beijing and Los Angeles, and both were statistically significant. This result suggests that there is a positive, moderate to strong, relationship between restaurants’ ratings and their cuisine prices. A potential explanation is that higher ratings are accompanied by increases in customer demand, which in turn boosts prices and profit. In the second part of the project, two 2-sample t-tests were carried out to compare the statistics between the two cities. Both t-tests yield significant results, indicating that restaurants in Los Angeles have higher ratings and prices than in Beijing. There are a wide variety of reasons behind this gap, including differences in consumption, food culture, and labor costs. 5. Future Research For this study, differences between restaurant rates and prices in Beijing and Los Angeles were proved significant. However, several factors might have influenced the accuracy of the result. Firstly, DianPing is a Chinese app used solely by Chinese subscribers.

268,Impact Of The Preschool Program On The Socio-Connective  Variables Developed By The Beneficiary Children: The Case,"currently, governments recognize the importance of investing in early childhood education programs. since entry into elementary school is a critical transition period, it is useful to measure children's development before entry. the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of the national preschool promotion program on the socio-connective variables acquired by the children who benefit from the program. the context chosen is that of moroccan preschools located in rural areas. this work proposes a sequential methodology based on a conceptual analysis based on the sor paradigm ""stimulus-organization-response"", and an empirical methodology based on the estimation structural equations. the results of this work confirm the existence of a positive and significant relationship between the different components of the external and internal environment of the preschool program, and the skills acquired by the preschool children. consequently, the results argue for the generalization of preschool education, particularly in rural areas, with support for public or community provision. providing preschool education to those who are currently excluded is considered an efficient and equitable investment.","public policy, preschool","As a conclusion, and through the research within the SOR paradigm, we have accepted that there is a positive and significant relationship between the internal and external environment of the programme and the skills acquired by the preschool children. This relationship is significant for each individual construct. That is, the variables measuring the internal and external environment are significant. The results argue for the widespread provision of preschool education, particularly in rural areas, with support for public or community provision. Offering preschool education to those currently excluded is considered an efficient and equitable investment. In this regard, it should be noted that policies to improve equitable access to quality preschool education in rural areas, particularly for girls aged 4-6 years, are very limited and, if they exist, are most often offered in traditional structures. To remedy these shortcomings, government policies must expand the provision of quality preschool education services 3According to the authors, the shorter the duration of exposure to the program (between six and eleven months), the less significant the impact on child development. 4According to the results of the study: the level of training of educational staff is positively correlated with program effectiveness. 2325","of rural morocco soumia ettahri phd student faculty of law, economics and social sciences ibn toufail university kénitra, morocco laboratory of economics and management of organizations soualae@gmail.com rachid hasnaoui professor faculty of law, economics and social sciences ibn toufail university, kénitra laboratory of economics and management of organizations rachid3c@gmail.com","References

273,Website Quality For E-Commerce Using Sentiment  Analysis (Case Studies In Tokopedia And Shopee),"rapid development makes various activities easy to do, such as online transactions. tokopedia and shopee are e- commerce which have dominated the market in indonesia in recent years by becoming the top e-commerce ranking based on high website visits. the competition is quite competitive, so companies must be able to increase customer trust by providing the best service. one form of building a customer trust model is a factor that must be considered, one of which is the quality of the website. therefore, the tokopedia and shopee websites require analysis for website quality based on the user's point of view whether the website has fulfilled the wishes and is satisfactory or not. the purpose of this study is to find out the sentiment or feedback given by users regarding the quality of the tokopedia and shopee websites based on the webqual dimensions obtained from user generated content (ugc) in the form of tweets and reviews on the google play store. the results obtained based on sentiment analysis and the word cloud method to find out the dominant words that appear show that the quality of the websites from tokopedia and shopee is dominated by positive sentiment which according to data from users on twitter social media and overall google play store reviews are good. but still need improvement so that the quality can be maximized such as usability or ease of use of the website and information quality or the quality of the website information submitted is still not good.","e-commerce, sentiment analysis, webqual","and Future Research Based on the analysis results from research on the quality of the Tokopedia and Shopee websites using the sentiment analysis method and doing a word cloud to get the dominant word that appears, it can be concluded that the answer to the problem formulation is as follows: The results of sentiment analysis on the quality of the e-commerce websites of Tokopedia and Shopee show that Tokopedia gets a percentage of 58% positive sentiment and 42% negative sentiment from a total of 400 datasets that have been processed previously. Meanwhile, Shopee gets a percentage of 60% positive sentiment and 40% negative sentiment from a total of 332 datasets that have been processed. The results of sentiment on the quality of the Tokopedia e-commerce website based on the webqual dimension show that the dimension that dominates the highest positive sentiment is the Interaction Quality dimension with a percentage of 40%, while the dimension that dominates the highest negative sentiment is the Usability dimension with a percentage of 50%. Therefore, it can be interpreted that Tokopedia has a website quality with Interaction Quality or good website interaction quality with users where this Interaction Quality includes security in transactions on the website, security in maintaining users' personal data to ease of communicating on Tokopedia. However, Tokopedia has a quality website with poor usability or ease of use on a website. This is in line with Meyliana research in 2018 which stated that the quality of the Tokopedia website had a slow access speed. The results of the sentiment on the quality of the Shopee e-commerce website based on the webqual dimension show that the dimension that dominates the highest positive sentiment is the Usability dimension with a percentage of 51%, while the dimension that dominates the highest negative sentiment is also the Usability dimension with a percentage of 64%. Therefore, it can be interpreted that Shopee has a quality website with good Usability or ease of use on the Shopee website but still needs to be improved because there are still many reviews with negative sentiments. This is also in line with Abdu'a & Wasiyanti's research in 2019 which stated that there are still users who are not accustomed to using the Shopee website because the operation is not very easy to use and the display also needs to be improved. Based on points A and B above, it can be concluded that from the two e-commerce sites that have better website quality, namely Shopee, the percentage of Shopee's positive sentiment is higher than Tokopedia. In addition, in each dimension, the positive percentage is also more dominated by Shopee compared to Tokopedia. Based on the word cloud that has been carried out, it is found that the dominant words that appear in each dimension are divided based on positive and negative sentiments on Tokopedia and Shopee indicating that the positive dominant words that appear in all dimensions are ""mudah"", ""menarik"", ""jelas"", ""sesuai"", ""aman"" which interprets that the quality of the website is quite good. While the dominant negative words that appear are ""update"", ""penipu"", ""gk"", ""mengecewakan"" which can be interpreted that there are also dimensions that need improvement and improvement so that the quality of the Tokopedia and Shopee websites can be better.","triyulia annisa department of faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia triyuliaannisa@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id krishna kusumahadi department of faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia kusumahadi@telkomuniversity.ac.id eva nurhazizah department of faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia evanurhazizah@telkomuniversity.ac.id","References

276,"Business Strategy, Asset Management, Capital Structure  And Financial Performance Of Food And Beverage Industry","the food and beverage business is one of the world's most rapidly developing industries, including in indonesia. this research was carried out to test the influence of business strategy, asset management and capital structure on financial performance in food and beverage firms recorded on the indonesia stock exchange (idx) in 2018-2020. this research used a quantitative approach with panel data regression analysis method. the independent variables in this study are business strategy (metsr), asset management (tato) and capital structure (der). while the dependent variable in this study is financial performance (roa). the results showed that simultaneously business strategy (metsr), asset management (tato), and capital structure (der) had a significant effect on financial performance. partially, business strategy (metsr) and asset management (tato) have no effect on financial performance, while der, on the other hand, has a favorable and considerable impact on financial performance.","asset management, business strategy, capital structure","This study analyzes the effect of business strategy, asset management, and capital structure on the financial performance of food and beverage companies recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2018-2020. The results found in this study are that business strategy, asset management, and capital structure simultaneously affect the financial performance of the food and beverage industry recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2018-2020, while partially business strategy and asset management have no effect on financial performance, capital structure has a favorable impact on financial performance. This research is anticipated to add to the existing literature. The authors suggest subsequent studies to add other variables not used in the study as well as select other sectors. Companies should pay attention to the factors that influence their financial performance, such as lowering the capital structure's value to increase financial performance to the utmost extent possible. For investors, the results of this study can be a consideration for investing their capital. Researchers suggest that investors can pay attention to the low Capital Structure so that the company’s value becomes large and in good condition. This is based on the study's results that capital structure affects financial performance so that potential investors can consider it in making decisions. 2422","in indonesia leny suzan, anisa ramadhanti faculty of business and economics telkom university dayeuhkolot, 40257, kabupaten bandung, indonesia lenysuzan@telkomuniversity.ac.id annisaraahmi@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id","References

277,The Effect Of Performance On Dividend Policy Case Study  On Indonesian Mining Sector Companies,"dividend policy refers to a company's choice to distribute a portion of its profits to shareholders as a return on invested equity. the distribution of dividends to investors by company management has a significant effect on the company's value. this study seeks to determine the effect of the independent variables, namely leverage (der), liquidity (cr), investment opportunity set (mbve), free cash flow (fcf), and asset growth (ag) on the dependent variable, namely dividend policy (dpr) on mining sector companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange in 2017-2020. the population in this study includes mining sector companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange (idx) from 2017 to 2020 using a purposive sampling technique. the samples obtained were ten samples with a study period of four years and obtained the results of 40 research data. the method used was panel data regression analysis. the results reveal that leverage (der) had a significant negative effect on dividend policy. whereas liquidity (cr), free cash flow (fcf), and asset growth (ag) did not have a significant negative effect on dividend policy as well as investment opportunity set (mbve) but in a positive direction.","asset growth, dividend policy, free cash flow, leverage","This study has examined the factors that influence the dividend policy on mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017-2020. Based on ten mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange that have passed the research sample criteria, this study discovered that leverage, liquidity, investment opportunity set, free cash flow, and asset growth had a simultaneous effect on dividend policy. Partially, leverage had a significant positive effect on dividend policy, while liquidity, free cash flow, and asset growth did not have a significant negative effect on dividend policy. Likewise, the investment opportunity set did not have a significant positive effect on dividend policy. In particular, the results of the study show that companies with high income and investment opportunities but have low debt tended to pay higher dividends to shareholders. This study are expected to assist the board of directors in developing and/or improving the company's dividend policy by considering factors that have been proven to have a significant effect on dividend payments. In particular, if the board of directors is considering increasing dividend payments to shareholders, the leverage factor needs to be considered more carefully. This is vital since dividend policy is one of the most important factors in maintaining current investors and attracting new investors to invest in the company. In addition to paying high dividends to the management team, it is also crucial to seek more income and investment opportunities, as well as reduce debt levels, in order to satisfy the shareholders' goal of increasing wealth through higher dividends. Since dividend payments are a form of reward or return to shareholders, the results of this study also provide insight to existing and potential shareholders in making investment decisions. If they expect to receive more dividends from their investments, shareholders may invest in large companies with better profitability and lower debt, as well as a higher proportion of investment by major shareholders. This research has several limitations. First, it merely focuses on mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2017-2020, which consistently paid dividends to their shareholders annually during the study. Future research could include companies from sectors other than mining listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange with a longer research period in order to generalize the findings and represent the determinants of dividends on mining sector companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Second, this study relies solely on secondary data, such as financial statements and annual reports from companies, as well as literary studies from books and previous research publications. The use of questionnaires or qualitative studies, such as interviews, is suggested to provide more complete data about the factors that influence a company's dividend policy. It can also be done by combining quantitative and qualitative research methods to obtain more comprehensive results. Despite its limitations, this study 2432","farida titik kristanti faculty of business and economic telkom university dayeuhkolot, 40257, kabupaten bandung, indonesia faridatk@telkomuniversity.ac.id ni made swasti mega putri faculty of business and economic telkom university dayeuhkolot, 40257, kabupaten bandung, indonesia nswastimegaputri@gmail.com","References

278,"Analysis Of Work-Related Accidents In Italian Landfills  Mara Lombardi, Francesca Mauro, Quintilio Napoleoni","despite the international efforts to promote the circular economy and waste recycling, landfilling is still a common practice for waste disposal around the world, with considerable impacts on the environment and public health. however, while such a sector was addressed in many countries through a consistent environmental legislative framework, safety management for workers in landfills has not been sufficiently considered by policymakers. moreover, in the scientific literature ohs issues related to landfill management were not deeply addressed through the elaboration of specific procedures. hence, with the goal to evaluate the existence of specific risk profiles in such working contexts, the paper provides a contribution through a data-driven approach. in fact, the study contains a detailed investigation of the biggest italian occupational accident database (powered by inail) with reference to the landfill management sector, according to a methodology specifically designed to employ the european statistics on accidents at work (esaw) codes as data filters. after selecting a sample of n.78 accidents, likely to have occurred in italian landfills in the period 2008/2019, accidents’ dynamics were assessed for each event with reference to the use of work equipment. the results achieved allowed us to bring to light the potential risks related to this determinant. thus, potential risk management measures were defined in order to improve the safety management of work equipment in this specific context.","accident analysis, esaw, data mining",,"sapienza - university of rome, italy mara.lombardi@uniroma1.it; francesca.mauro@uniroma1.it; quintilio.napoleoni@uniroma1.it mario fargnoli universitas mercatorum, rome, italy mario.fargnoli@unimercatorum.it simona berardi italian institute for insurance against accidents at work (inail), rome, italy s.berardi@inail.it","References

However, the continuous use of raw materials can also result in wastage of natural resources. In addition, the impact of burning bricks can also interfere with human respiratory health which causes shortness of breath. Sales of bricks also need a strategy to increase sales profits and reduce the risk of loss. Traditional brick production strategies are generally through direct marketing involving producers and consumers. customers, such as promotions to large projects and to homes. (d).

285,Clustering Of Workers Based On The Effect Of Downward  Social Comparison,"although many companies have applied the social comparison theory to motivate the workers for improving their performance, the reason why social comparison sometimes is successful and other times not, is still not fully understood. recently, we have built a structural equation model to clarify the psychological mechanism that the workers’ personality traits, mediated by their social comparison orientations, affect their response to the downward social comparison, and consequently have a significant influence on the workers’ motivation and performance. in this paper, we extend our previous research and conduct a clustering analysis of the workers based on the factor scores of personality traits, social comparison orientations, motivation and efficiency. this paper places our emphasis on offering more detailed insight into the workers’ proportion that how many workers respond positively or negatively to the downward social comparison, and providing some key points for practitioners to enhance the effect of downward social comparison.","social comparison, motivation","According to the results of section 6, we can give the following evidences on how the workers respond the downward social comparison. (1) Thirty-one (39.2%) workers of 79 (cluster A) responded significantly and positively to the downward comparison. These workers have the highest scores on both extraversion and playfulness. (2) There were 22 (27.8%) workers of 79 (cluster B) who are negatively motivated through the downward comparison, and their efficiency was decreased significantly. These workers don’t have very high or very low score on the three personality traits (emotionality, extraversion and playfulness). (3) Fifteen (19.0%) workers of 79 (cluster C) have a very weak tendency to engage in social comparison. These workers almost mode no response to the downward comparison. These workers are characterized by low scores on all of the three personality traits: emotionality, extraversion and playfulness. (4) The downward comparison has both positive and negative effect on the efficiency for a small number (14.0%) of the workers (11 out of 79 workers, cluster D). They have the highest scores on emotionality. From these evidences, we can provide the following key points for practitioners to conduct social comparisons more effectively (1) The downward comparison described in section 3.1 is suitable to motivate the workers who have the higher scores on both extraversion and playfulness. (2) There are 27.8% of the workers who respond negatively to the downward comparison. Therefore, the downward comparison described in section 3.1 is not appropriate to motivate these workers. However, these workers have average scores on the three personality traits (emotionality, extraversion and playfulness), it may be not easy to identify them. Table 3.

286,Safety And Ergonomics Enhancement Of The Foldable  Rollover Protective Structures,"for the agricultural tractors, the risk of loss of stability is limited when passive safety devices, the so-called rollover protective structures (ropss), are installed. in the case of limited height coltures, such as vineyards or orchards, the tractor is often equipped with a two-posts foldable and front-monuted roll-bar rops (frb). the main advantage of frbs consists in the possibility to use the tractor with a low operative overall height, keeping the rollbar folded down. however, frb’s conventional solutions underestimate the operators’ risk-taking behavior and their widespread misuse due to the efforts needed to operate them. this study aims at reducing the problem by providing the frb with aided systems to facilitate the frb raising and locking. in particular, the ergonomics issues related to the raising and lowering phase were investigated and the technical characteristics of aided systems were detected. this led to the development of a novel automatic system to lock the frb in a safety configuration to support the tractor’s operator.","machinery safety, ergonomics",,"gattamelata davide, puri daniele, vita leonardo department of technological innovations and safety of plants, products and anthropic settlements national institute for insurance against accidents at work (inail) via di fontana candida, 1, 00078 monte porzio catone, italy d.gattamelata@inail.it, d.puri@inail.it, l.vita@inail.it mario fargnoli universitas mercatorum piazza mattei, 10, 00186 - rome, italy mario.fargnoli@unimercatorum.it","References

The test results found that the frequency of board of commissioners' meetings and foreign ownership positively affected corporate social responsibility. In contrast, gender diversity did not affect corporate social responsibility disclosure. This study concludes that the higher the foreign ownership and the frequency of board of commissioners’ meetings, the higher the corporate social responsibility disclosure carried out by the company so that it can help the company to get a good reputation from stakeholders. Companies with relatively low corporate social responsibility are expected to increase social and environmental awareness. The company is also expected to increase the proportion of women's boards to manage and advance the company jointly. This study can only prove that the frequency of board of commissioners' meetings and foreign ownership positively affects CSR disclosure. The gender diversity of the board of directors does not affect the level of CSR disclosure. Future researchers can make some improvements. First, further research can use different objects, namely non- manufacturing companies or banking companies. Second, the next researcher can use other indicators of gender diversity, such as the gender diversity of the board of commissioners or the gender diversity of the board of directors and the board of commissioners. Third, future research may use different CSR disclosure criteria, such as the Global Reporting Initiative.","corporate social responsibility disclosure cahyaningsih and nathasya nabilla putri soleh school of economics and business telkom university, bandung, west java, indonesia cahyaningsih@telkomuniversity.ac.id; nathasyanabilla@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id",

298,Nature Of Industry And Financial Stability   As Indications Of Fraudulent Financial Statements,"in this globalization era, the risk of fraudulent financial statements is increasing. fraudulent financial statements were due to opportunities, pressures, and political relations from several ranks of the board of directors and commissioners. countries often experience economic instability, so companies must maintain financial performance to remain in good condition. economic instability and less than optimal supervision trigger companies to commit fraudulent actions in financial statements, like manipulation of financial statements, misappropriation of assets, or other matters that are not under applicable accounting standards. this study aims to examine the effect of the nature of industry, financial stability, and political connection on fraudulent financial statements. this study uses 58 manufacturing companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange from 2018 to 2020. fraudulent financial statements are measured using the fraud score model. this study finds that the nature of industry negatively affects fraudulent financial statements. companies with a high ratio of changes in receivables need to be supported by strong supervision so that management does not have the opportunity to manipulate financial statements. this study also found that financial stability positively affects fraudulent financial statements. when a company experiences growth below the industry average, management manipulates financial statements to improve the company's prospects. however, this study did not find any influence of political connections on fraudulent financial statements.",financial stability,"This study investigates the effect of the nature of the industry, financial stability, and political connection on fraudulent financial statements. This study found that the nature of the industry has a negative effect, whereas financial stability has a positive effect on fraudulent financial statements. Different results found that political connection does not affect fraudulent financial statements. The company's management is expected to carry out more substantial supervision and internal control to prevent fraud in the financial statements. The company is expected to be more intensive in socializing anti-fraud activities to minimize the risk of fraudulent financial statements. This study did not find any influence of political connections on fraudulent financial statements. The next researcher can investigate political connections by measuring political relations only for directors or commissioners. Further researchers can also measure political connections with other indicators, such as the presence of shareholders who control at least 10% of the total shares with voting rights and have ties to politicians or political parties.","cahyaningsih1 and febrina niki ayu lestari2 school of economics and business telkom university, bandung, west java, indonesia 1cahyaningsih@telkomuniversity.ac.id, 2febrinaniki@student.telkomuniversity",
299,The Effects Of Ambiguity On Evaluations Of Multiple  Prospects,"this paper examines whether individuals perceive benefits from diversification when prospects are ambiguous and how those benefits compare to analogous situations under risk. based on gilboa and schmeidler’s (1989) maxmin expected utility model, the hypothesis is that only risk-seeking individuals would receive non-zero diversification benefits. in particular, these decision-makers would receive negative benefits from diversification that would increase in the gains domain and further decrease in the losses domain as the degree of ambiguity increases. results from a series of experiments suggest that people may perceive less benefit from diversification under ambiguity than under risk. however, individuals tend to diversify over a greater number of prospects when the prospects are ambiguous than when they are risky. this may be due to people’s attempt to compensate for the lower marginal benefit of diversifying under ambiguity than under risk. it also implies a decrease in tolerance toward aleatory uncertainty in presence of epistemic uncertainty.","ambiguity, uncertainty","Recall from Section 3, that we had expected that only people who are risk-seeking in both domains would be affected by diversification under ambiguity. For these individuals, we had predicted that the negative benefits from diversification in the gains domain would decrease, while the negative benefits from diversification in the losses domain would increase with increasing degree of ambiguity. We did not anticipate that risk-averse and risk-neutral individuals would receive any positive or negative benefits from diversification in any domains according to MEU. Results from Experiment 1 seem to contradict our predictions with regards to pricing of prospects in both the gains and losses domain. As the predominant attitudes were risk-averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses, we should expect no effects in the former and decreasing diversification benefits in the latter. However, there seems to be a general benefit to diversification in the gains domain that decreases with increasing degree of ambiguity (Figure 1). In addition, there seems to be no significant disadvantages to diversification in the losses domain at any level of ambiguity (Figure 2). Results from Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 are particularly interesting in comparison to the findings from Experiment 1. In particular, even though individuals perceive less benefit from diversification under ambiguity than under risk in the gains domain from Experiment 1, the results in Experiments 2 and 3 imply that people may tend to diversify to an even greater extent under ambiguity than under risk. More specifically, the percentage of people preferring the double set of gambles in Experiment 2 (Figure 3) and the average number of prospects chosen in Experiment 3 were somewhat higher under ambiguity than under risk (Figure 5). Although it is not uncommon to observe distinct ambiguity preferences under different tasks (see Du and Budescu 2005), the findings from the Experiments 1-3 may have plausible explanations. First, it may be more difficult for individuals to determine the value of diversification under ambiguity than under risk, especially when prospect concern potential losses. This may have lead to under-valuations of multiple ambiguous prospects in the gains domain and no effect of diversification in the losses domain as is found in Experiment 1. Second, if the marginal benefit from diversifying over an additional prospect is indeed higher under risk than under ambiguity, this may actually lead to individuals choosing a larger number of prospects to compensate in the latter condition. This implies that the results all the three experiments, at least in the gains domain, may in fact be consistent. More specifically, in presence of epistemic risk or the imprecisely known probability of outcomes, people may be less tolerant toward aleatory risk or the uncertainty of the resulting outcome. One of the strongest and most interesting results from the experiments in this paper is the fact that people tend to diversify over potential losses and to an even greater extent than over potential gains. This is surprising as we had expected from the predictions that the predominantly risk-averse individuals in the gains domain would receive no benefits from diversification, while the predominantly risk-seeking individuals in the losses domain would actually receive disbenefits from the same process. In examining reasons subjects had given for their choices in Experiment 2, wehave found that most subjects who chose the double gamble set over their single counterpart gave some variations of diversification to reduce the uncertainty as the reason in both domains. However, it appeared that many participants were concerned about the maximum payoff in the losses domain. Thus, their preference to diversify may be in fact be driven by greater influence of loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) in face of increasing ambiguity. There are many aspects that warrant further investigation on the topic of decisions that involve multiple ambiguous prospects. For example, it is not clear how subjects perceive the relationship between two ambiguous prospects and how they may hedge against ambiguity or epistemic risk in comparison to aleatory risk or the uncertain outcomes.

It also attempts to explore the interrelationship between the current and future factors for developing an effective guideline for future engineers in designing sustainable buildings by adopting a unified approach in the decision-making step. The findings from this research will provide a new dimension to an integrated approach to the problem. This study contributes significantly to the current literature by identifying the gaps in literature. The research methodology comprises more than one phase of the decision-making process. Starting with identifying the problem, reviewing the literature, applying the Delphi technique, and ending with implementing the MCDM by doing the ISM-MICMAC analysis. This methodology allows for flexibility in structuring the research problem by merging the academic and industrial fields in exploring the interrelationship between the factors. For future studies,they can be used in other countries to create a more general guideline, other MCDM tools can be applied to validate the results of this research, other factors will be more important for the future, or new factors may appear forwards.","perspective rasha mdkhana master student, department of industrial engineering & engineering management university of sharjah, sharjah, uae u19104235@sharjah.ac.ae ahmed al-shamma’a professor, dean college of engineering university of sharjah, sharjah, uae alshammaa@sharjah.ac.ae sharfuddin khan assistant professor, university of regina regina, canada sharfuddin.khan@uregina.ca",

An empirical study was shown to illustrate the methodology's efficacy, and the outcomes of this examination were presented. The most appropriate factor was found as ""F41. Risk Planning and Control,"" and the first ranked action plan was determined as ""ACT1. Planning & Organization"". As mentioned in paper (Adiguzel, 2019), all management activities, including planning, organizing, coordinating, communicating, ordering, supervising/evaluation, and so on, are critical in disaster management. For future investigation, different aggregation operators can be used to aggregate DMs' evaluations in group decision- making.

303,Wrist Deviation Influence On Initial Hand Force Before  Wheelchair Propulsion Using Digital Human Modeling,"manual wheelchair users face many difficulties during their daily activities. these users demand a high amount of force from their upper extremities to move or turn. due to exerting these forces over time, more pressure on the wrist’s median nerve is applied, and the users suffer from severe pain in their arm muscles. in general, manual wheelchair users provide repetitive motion for an extended time leading to cts. this study uses digital human modeling to investigate wrist deviation in radial and extension positions, body dimension, and gender on the maximum hand force. three wrist radial deviation (i.e., 10°, 15°, and 20°), three extension wrist degrees (i.e., 25°, 35°, and 50°), both genders (i.e., male and female), and three percentiles (i.e., 5th, 50th, 95th) are involved. jack digital human modeling software was used to simulate the wrist's deviation and test different body sizes. force solver in jack software calculates the amount of maximum hand force for 54 combination runs. analysis of variance was used to determine the significant factors. the results show that radial deviation has no significant impact on the maximum hand force, while other factors have a considerable impact. the male, in general, provides more strength than the female. a person with the 95th percentile has less force than 50th, and both are less than 5th (62, 68, and 74, respectively). wrist extension on 25° provides 95 neuton force which is the maximum between another extension angel.","wrist deviation, manual wheelchair","As conclusion, female who use manual wheelchair can provide less force than male, that is important factor when designing wheelchair for female, if there is an incline in the road, they move in then they need support if the wheelchair has no extra support system. Usually, the person who use manual wheelchair and not exercising regularly will be overweighed soon, they should be informed that when they reach high body mass index, they will be able to provide enough force to the wheel to move the chair as they want. Another important fact concluded from this project is the wrist deviation, most of the users will not notice the changes in their wrist extension, which may lead to less force and may cause pain in the hand due that awkward posture of wrist, when they trained to use the manual wheelchair, they should inform about the best posture to use. Small deviation in the wrist degree will significantly influence the amount of force they can provide to the wheels. In future, more wrist posture should be tested with should elevation angle as some studies indicates that deviation should also influence the force exerted to move the wheelchair. In addition, the result in this study is based on simulation run should be verified with real experiment after getting IRB acceptance.

304,Assessment Of Success Factors For Ai Application In Supply  Chain Management With Fuzzy Saw-Moora Methods,"artificial intelligence (ai) offers a promising solution for fostering agile and resilient supply chains. machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics are all potential enablers of supply chain transformation. such ai technologies can be applied in different supply chain activities. however, selecting the most suitable ai technology is challenging since the features of supply chains changes for different organizations from various sectors. accordingly, this study aims to present a fuzzy simple additive weighting (saw)-multi-objective optimization on the basis of ratio analysis (moora) methodology for assessing thesuccess factors of ai application in supply chain management (scm). fuzzy sets approach is applied to represent assessments of experts by handling uncertainty. the combined fuzzy saw-moora methodology offers many benefits such as simplicity, usability, ability to overcome complex situations, flexibility, and simultaneously optimizing two or more conflicting attributes. the criteria, consisting of ai success factors, are weighted with the fuzzy saw method. then, ai technologies such as machine learning, autonomous systems, natural language processing, multi-agent systems, etc. are evaluated with the fuzzy moora method. to illustrate the effectiveness of the research methodology, an application is also provided.","fuzzy sets, moora","AI praises the existing process, impulses the analytics and technology as well as supplements the talent within the supply chain. Applying AI results in continuous development, occasionally self-improved. AI canbe considered as an aid tool fororganizations to become more smart, agile, resilient, constructa customer-focused supply chain, and be demand-sensitive. This paper aimed to present the fuzzy SAW-MOORA methodology for assessing AI critical success factors and AI technologies in SCM concept. The critical success factors were weighted with the fuzzy SAW method. Then, technologies such as machine learning, autonomous systems, natural language processing, etc., were assessedby applying the fuzzy MOORA method. The most importantfactor was found as “Support consumer-driven objectives (CSF3)” and the first ranked AI technology was determined as “Machine Learning (A1)”. For future studies, it can be interesting to implement other fuzzy MCDM methods and compare the results with the existing methodology. Besides, other fuzzy set extensions (e.g. intuitionistic fuzzy sets, type-2 fuzzy sets, interval valued fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets etc.) may be preferred in future research.

305,Evaluation Of Digital Solutions For Sustainable Cities With  Fuzzy Ahp-Edas Methods,"cities, the main living space of people, are one of the focal points of the concept of sustainability. sustainable cities, which are of great importance in sustainable development goals (sdgs), aim to create the nests of our future and to support this approach with digital solutions. the sustainable city concept aims to define many different needs of a city from a macro perspective and to make that city more environmentally friendly and more livable with the planning and investments to be made based on this definition. at this point, digital solutions are needed to meet all the needs of the residents of the city and to ensure their welfare in a sustainable way. in this context, the evaluation of digital solutions for sustainable cities is considered a multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) problem due to its mixed structure and many different criteria. however, it becomes difficult for experts to evaluate and make decisions about the system when the information is insufficient and uncertain. therefore, in this study, the fuzzy approach is used to evaluate the mcdm problem more realistically and flexibly. the aim of the study is to propose an evaluation model and integrated analytic methods for the evaluation of digital solutions for sustainable cities. the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (ahp) method is used to calculate the weights of the criteria and fuzzy evaluation based on distance from average solution (edas) is used to prioritize the digital solutions. finally, an application is provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology.","digital solutions, fuzzy anp, such as poverty","of the fuzzy EDAS method, the most appropriate digital solution is “Digital government services and civic-engagement tools (DS2)”, while digital transportation management and e-hailing (DS1), digital healthcare services and health wearable devices (DS3), digital meters for real-time tracking apps in water and electricity consumption (DS5), and digital reskilling and learning programs (DS4) have positioned at the second, third, fourth, and fifth ranks as the final performance values, respectively. 5. Conclusion This paper aimed to propose an evaluation model for sustainable cities and prioritize digital solutions using an integrated fuzzy MCDM approach. The weights of the criteria were obtained with the fuzzyAHP method, and the fuzzy EDAS method was used to prioritize digital solutions. An application was shown to demonstrate the methodology's efficacy, and the outcomes of this examination were presented. The most appropriate criteriawere found as “Land use accessibility (C23)”, “Safety, security and privacy (C52)” and “Digital education (C33)”, and the first ranked digital solution was determined as “Digital government services and civic-engagement tools (DS2)”. In the digital state process, information and communication technologies can be used to make public organizations more effective and efficient and strengthen democracy, as well as to enable citizens to access certain information over the internet, and facilitate certain transactions. Thus, it makes the political system and public administration more transparent, democratic, sensitive, and effective. 2659","esin mukul, merve güler and gülçin büyüközkan research assistant, research assistant, professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and technology galatasaray university, ortaköy, i̇stanbul, turkey emukul@gsu.edu.tr, mguler@gsu.edu.tr, gbuyukozkan@gsu.edu.tr","References

309,Evaluating The Safety And Health Risk Of Logistics  Workers During The Pandemic,"the pandemic has severely affected the way people do things. necessary rules and regulations have been implemented to ensure the virus would not further spread. the logistics industry is one of the sectors greatly affected by the pandemic since some industries are required to perform their respective work in a face-to-face setting. meaning the workers have a high chance of being exposed to the virus. the study aims to identify whether workers from various logistics companies have experienced any risks during the pandemic regarding the physical, chemical, ergonomic, and biological extent. moreover, surveying 250 logistics workers found that most have been experiencing ergonomic risk factors, which has made them perceive their health and safety risks as mild, given the current situation.","risk, safety, health, logistics","The logistics sector has thrived exponentially in the Philippines, forecasting a growth of 8.8%. This increase shows that logistics benefits the economy since it focuses on providing services such as warehousing, inventory management, freight forwarding, and multimodal transportation. Being the most crucial sector in the market, the continuous growth of employees and workers within the work environment is beneficial for a quick and smooth operation and transportation flow. However, as we are in a pandemic sector, the logistics operation makes it their priority to establish protocols and sanitation systems and utilize protective gear to ensure the safety of their employees. Furthermore, workers must also recognize these types of hazards to protect themselves from injuries and accidents. In addition to aiding workers and establishments in the importance of safety and health, this study targets to specify and assess the risk of employees working in a logistics industry within the Philippines during the pandemic. This will ensure that workers will be protected, and establishments can create plans and safety guidelines to guarantee the well-being of their workers. Results were gathered from different logistics companies using an online survey and printed questionnaire. The gathered results show that ergonomic and chemical hazards are the most significant factors contributing to workers' safety and health risks. Since most of the workers in the logistics sector are delivery riders utilizing motorcycles, they are exposed to awkward posture and repetitive tasks in their arms, hands, and risk. Furthermore, since motorcycles are rear-wheel vehicles, delivery personnel are exposed to bacteria, chemicals from smoke, and environmental factors. Additionally, when workers were asked about their working conditions, they considered them tolerable. Though, once they are exposed to these types of hazards, workers become mindful of their safety and make it their priority to protect themselves from these kinds of risks. These results and findings show that safety and health assessment is crucial as it prevents not only minor health problems but also long-term medical issues. Results show that factors under ergonomic hazards have a high correlation based on the workers' activities, followed by biological hazards, especially in exposure to virus or disease, given that COVID-19 is still a threat. The respondents perceive their work under mild risk in terms of safety and health, this may seem moderate, but this can significantly affect one's work performance and productivity. Safety management must be taken seriously by employers, and 2692","julianne mikhaella c. delos reyes, louis miguel c. dural, julia sofie d. mangaoang, gaea marithe w. victor, and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university manila, philippines jmcdelosreyes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jsdmangaoang@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, lmcdural@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gmwvictor@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

It should be considered that the sample size for the respondents is relatively small because of the time constraints, and it should be noted that this might have contributed to the results of the study.","jeunise a. piamonte, eunice gabrielle a. reyes, krizia ein z. saguibo, clarice ann m. verdeflor, and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university intramuros, manila, philippines 1002 jpiamonte@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, eareyes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kezsaguibo@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, camverdeflor@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",
312,"E-Roadmap To Support The Digital Transformation: Study, Design And Development Of A Tool To Accelerate","digitalization is increasingly imperative for companies that want to achieve a competitive advantage, which represents the transformation of traditional processes into digital processes by incorporating industry 4.0 technologies. it is also known that to move towards this digital transformation it is necessary that the company already presents a good level of maturity in terms of lean philosophy, so the latter can be seen almost as a prerequisite. for a company to be successful in this digital transformation journey, it must develop a roadmap for digitalization, which guides it until it reaches the final goal, and there are already some guidelines to develop them. therefore, by analyzing the literature it is possible to notice that there are not many technological tools that support this roadmap yet. this work contributes to filling the gap in the literature by describing a tool developed through the microsoft power platform software that supports the roadmap for digital transformation in the collection and selection of processes, to develop an action plan aligned with the company's long-term strategy. this tool was then tested by the potential users, to validate the model, know the level of receptivity of the application by users, and understand the usefulness of the tool.","industry 4.0, lean","of which processes should be digitized.

Furthermore, it enables the evaluation of indicators (KPIs) which are also defined in accordance with the organization's strategy, to understand the current state of the company compared to what it intends to achieve. Even though this study fills a literature gap, it also has limitations, namely the fact that the case study was carried out in a company of a specific context of industry, so there is no guarantee that it can be applied to organizations operating in different contexts. For the reason stated above, it would be interesting, as future work, to validate the tool in other types of industry sectors since it was only created considering a single organization from a single sector.","digitalization in lean companies juliana basulo ribeiro department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) universityof aveiro, 3010-193, aveiro, portugal basulojuliana@ua.pt marlene amorim research unit on governance, competitiveness and public policies (govcopp) department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) universityof aveiro, 3010-193, aveiro, portugal mamorim@ua.pt leonor teixeira institute of electronics and informatics engineering of aveiro (ieeta), governance, competitiveness and public policies (govcopp), department of economics, management, industrial engineering and tourism (degeit) universityof aveiro, 3010-193, aveiro portugal lteixeira@ua.pt",

Taxpayer compliance is related to tax revenue because the increasing compliance of taxpayers will indirectly affect state or regional revenues. However, there are cases of tax evasion that make taxpayers think that the tax revenue collected by the government is mostly used for personal interests, not for public interests or regional development. It takes taxpayer trust in the government so transparency is needed to increase that trust. If the government provides clear information regarding the use of tax revenue funds, it can improve taxpayer compliance. Tax transparency is the openness of the government in allocating or using funds from tax revenues for regional development or other needs of local governments. The existence of transparency carried out by the government creates trust so that with transparency carried out the government can increase the trust of taxpayers who have been paid by taxpayers used as well as possible by applicable regulations. Tax transparency affects taxpayer compliance. The more transparent the information managed by the government, the more compliant the taxpayer will be to his tax obligations and the avoidance carried out by the taxpayer will also decrease. Thus transparent tax governance will increase trust and trust will increase taxpayer compliance.","palembang city sylvia martha mozi master students of management, postgraduate program’s universitas bina darma palembang, indonesia sylvia_marthamozi@yahoo.co.id muji gunarto*) management department of economics and business faculty universitas bina darma palembang, indonesia *) corresponding author: mgunarto@binadarma.ac.id",

Partially VAHU and VACA have a significant effect on the company's ROA. VAHU is a measure in assessing the contribution of the workforce in the form of knowledge, skills, innovation, and creative ideas. To support this capability, companies need to spend funds to create added value. The more company spends on employee funds, the more value of the benefits obtained by the company will increase the asset turnover value of the company's income. So the company's employees are able to carry out their work well. Then, VACA is a measure of the value added of tangible assets, which is one of the company's resources that has a linear relationship with the probability of the company. The greater capital issued by banks to increase their equity, it will improve the company's financial performance. while STVA and CSR have no significant effect on the company's ROA.

A Study Of Consumers’,"beauty and femininity are the main selling points of the cosmetic industry centering on women. however, due to the covid 19 pandemic, the demand for man cosmetic products significantly increases. thus, this study intends to identify the behaviors of male consumers towards the interest in buying skincare products. to address the issue, the present study deployed a quantitative method embracing sem using lisrel application. through this framework, the study which involved 381 kahf's instagram followers as the sample analyzed the consumer’s behaviors under which eleven hypotheses were broken down and examined. the results showed that perceived value, brand image, religious belief, halal certification, trust, and attitude affect men's purchasing behaviors. in contrast to these seven factors, the religious belief aspect has the lower effect on the consumer’s halal awareness. of these three mediator variables, attitude is found to be the main driving factor. the findings signify that brand image, religious belief, trust and halal awareness built in consumers are reflected in their attitude. further research is expected to analyze the role of women, the main target of the skincare market, towards the men’s preference in purchasing skincare products.","marketing, consumer behavior, purchase intention","The present study set out to investigate the factors that may contributes to the men’s buying interest. Taking all the results together, the study generates several important conclusions. First, men's buying interests are strongly influenced by their attitude, halal awareness and trust in the brand. Of these three variables, attitude is found to be the main driving factor. The findings signify that brand image, religious belief, trust and halal awareness built in consumers are reflected in their attitude. The positive attitude can be maintained by the provision of the programs that involve the costumers. Therefore, it is expected that the companies provide programs that can be a place to nurture consumers’ positive attitude towards the brand. Second which relates to Halal awareness, the findings have shown that the costumers are well aware of the importance of halal status in the products they consume. This means that consumers will be more receptive to products that have guarantee on their page. Kahf and similar companies may take the findings into consideration by providing products that have been certified as halal both in the materials used and in the manufacturing process. In addition, the halal awareness owned by the respondents can be treated as a foundation for halal policy makers and other relevant parties to always prioritize product guarantees.","behavior aisyah khoerunnisa nurjamin and maya ariyanti faculty of economics and business telkom university, indonesia aisyahkhnurjam@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, ariyanti@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

A Maturity and Readiness Model (MRM) was developed with six constructs (latent variables), namely: Search for Inter-Regional Balance (IRB), Added Value to Production (AVP), Achievement of Macro Goals Contained in Government Policies (MGP), Increment of the Employment Offer (IJO), Promotion of Sustainable Use of Biodiversity (ASB) and Maintenance of Fiscal Balance (MEF). These constructs were evaluated based on 29 indicators (observable variables), organized in the form of a structured research questionnaire using the five-point Likert Scale. This questionnaire had 33 respondents distributed among the seven local manufacturers of the television product and the Global Average of the survey pointed to a Maturity and Readiness index of 3.58 on a maximum scale of 5, denoting an optimistic view of the BPP as a public policy instrument, highlighting the attendance of the latent variable increase in jobs offer with the highest value (4.23) while the achievement of inter-regional balance had the lowest score (2.68). Since this research was limited to television producers, a perspective for future studies, aiming to evaluate the IPM as a whole, would be to apply the developed MRM to other products with significant revenue. Another important improvement, since all respondents are industry representatives, would be the extension of the research to other stakeholders, especially governments (federal, state and municipal), research and development institutions and universities. The builted MRM was adjusted and validated using the methodology of partial least squares in structural equations modeling (PLS-SEM), using SmartPLS® 3.0 software, being necessary to eliminate four observable variables to obtain the convergence of all the constructs of the Model. As a unique result of this article, we can point out the construction of a specific MRM for the BPP, a public policy instrument used in the IPM, validated through the application in a case study for the television product and PLS-SEM methodology, contributing to the advancement of knowledge about the MFZ, a public policy model that has been proven to induce socioeconomic development and environmental conservation in the Amazon.","flavio de barros e azevedo ramos master´s student postgraduate program in production engineering, federal university of amazonas manaus, brazil. flavio.ramos@suframa.gov.br sandro breval santiago teacher advisor postgraduate program in production engineering, federal university of amazonas manaus, brazil. sbreval@gmail.com armando araújo de souza junior professor postgraduate programe in production engineering, federal university of amazonas manaus, brazil. armandoaraujo@ufam.edu.br roberto higino pereira da silva professor state university of amazonas manaus, brazil higino98@gmail.com",

This is due to the absence of financial reporting in micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs' lack of fundamental knowledge of financial standards and reports. If we were to determine the level of IFRS implementation, we can conclude that, from 2012 to the present day, the development of IFRS in MSMEs has not increased nor is optimal. Obviously, this is not a matter to be handled lightly. This study resulted in important implications and contribution for academics, realization of practice, and policy. From which is conferred that it is due time for the government to pay genuine attention to the actual state of SMEs. This study discovered that financial reports are important not only as a means of controlling and monitoring businesses but also as a means of achieving greater objectives, such as the ability to use IFRS in their business to compete in global markets. In addition, this research cannot emphasize enough the significance of being aware of your business as a whole and paying attention to the circumstances and demands. On the basis of its conclusions, this paper can assist the government and relevant parties in understanding the actual state of micro, small, and medium enterprises in the nation. As an additional avenue, future research within this scope is able expand and compare the realization of IFRS in SMEs throughout Indonesia as the scope of analysis in this research was limited only to SMEs in Palembang.

332,The Effect Of Board Diversity And Audit Quality On  Earnings Quality (Study On Non-Financial State-Owned,"earnings quality is the ability of earnings to describe the actual state of the company's profits, able to estimate future profits, and as a review when making decisions. there is several factors that affect earnings quality, namely board diversity (presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of members of the board of directors, proportion of independent commissioners) and audit quality. this study aims to determine how the influence of the presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of members of the board of directors, the proportion of independent commissioners and audit quality on earnings quality. this study uses quantitative methods. non-financial state-owned enterprises listed on the indonesia stock exchange for the 2016-2020 period are the population in this study. there are 16 companies that are used as research samples through a purposive sampling method. in this study, panel data regression analysis was used as a data analysis method and used eviews 12 software. results showed that the presence of female directors, the diversity of the age of the board of directors, the educational background of the members of the board of directors, the proportion of independent commissioners and the quality of the audit simultaneously affected earnings quality. partially, the educational background of the board of directors and audit quality affect earnings quality, while the presence of female directors, the age diversity of the board of directors and the proportion of independent commissioners have no effect on earnings quality.","audit quality, board diversity, earnings quality, female directors","This study aims to analyze the effect of the variables that affect earnings quality, namely the presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of members of the board of directors, proportion of independent commissioners and audit quality in non-financial State-Owned Enterprises listed on the Stock Exchange. Indonesian Securities 2016-2020. The sample in this study was 16 companies with a research period of 5 years and a total of 78 samples of data processed due to the presence of 2 samples which were outlier data so that they were removed during the data processing. This study uses Microsoft Excel 2019 and Eviews 12 in processing the data. Based on the results of research conducted by researchers, the following conclusions are obtained. Based on the results of panel data regression testing, it is known that simultaneously the independent variables, namely the presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of the board of directors, the proportion of independent commissioners and audit quality have an influence on the dependent variable, namely earnings quality. Based on the coefficient of determination obtained by 0.137102, it means that the variables of the presence of female directors, age diversity of the board of directors, educational background of the board of directors, the proportion of independent commissioners and audit quality have the ability to explain earnings quality by 13.7% and the remaining 86.3% is explained by other variables outside of this study. Partial testing to find out each independent variable on the dependent variable, namely earnings quality, is as follows. a) The presence of female directors does not affect the quality of earnings in non-financial State-Owned Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. b) The age diversity of the board of directors has no effect on the earnings quality of non-financial State- Owned Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. c) The educational background of the directors affects the earnings quality of non-financial State-Owned Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. d) The proportion of independent commissioners has no effect on earnings quality in non-financial State- Owned Enterprises listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange for the 2016-2020 period. 2962","enterprises listed on the indonesia stock exchange for the 2016-2020 period) dudi pratomo faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia dudipratomo@telkomuniversity.ac.id tri utami lestari faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia triutamilestari@telkomuniversity.ac.id rekha fakhriyah pebriyanti faculty of economics and business telkom university bandung, indonesia fakhriyahrekha@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id","References

333,Sequencing Problems In Flow Shop Production Systems  Mario Hoffelner,"nowadays, customers are increasingly demanding more from products in terms of quality, flexibility, and delivery performance, while the price may hardly change due to many competitors. these requirements create a certain pressure on individual companies if they would like to hold their own in the competitive environment. due to the constantly changing requirements, it is important for companies to identify certain potentials at an early stage and to adjust production accordingly. in the area of production, sequence planning is an important optimization tool that can be used for different objectives. it forms the foundation for detailed planning in companies and specifies the sequence of products to be processed. this paper deals with the topic of sequence planning in flow shop production. in the context of this, production planning and control are first discussed, as well as the areas of application of sequence planning. subsequently, the basic models and the currently used methods are explained in more detail. to be able to give an outlook on future research directions in this area, an investigation of several current publications is carried out at the end. the knowledge gained from this work is intended to provide a quick overview of sequence planning and its application in flow shop production systems.","sequencing problem, smart logistics","The constantly increasing market pressure requires companies to constantly change and adapt to the market. Due to the changes that occur, good production planning and control is necessary In-house production planning and control form a part of production planning and control. A subarea of this is, in turn, sequence planning. Sequence planning determines the sequence in which orders are processed. It can also serve as the basis for detailed scheduling. This paper investigated sequencing problems in flow shop production systems. In this context, Johnson algorithm, simulated annealing (SA), and genetic algorithm (GA) were determined as the basic models. Moreover, by conducting a systematic literature review the authors identified a total of 54 state-of-the-art papers which were assigned to seven clusters, namely “algorithms”, “mixed-integer linear programming models”, “ranking of dispatching rules”, “decision support systems”, “frameworks,” and “others”. Nowadays, research is mainly concerned with heuristic methods since the results of these are often sufficient. Moreover, the increasing work performances of computer systems make the calculation of the different possibilities easier and faster. From an economic point of view, it is recommended to use priority rules for the first implementation phase if sequencing has not been done yet. If initial approaches are already available, it is recommended to deal with heuristics. There are different approaches, which are more recommendable depending on the objective are more recommendable. The research is already in a very good way with the heuristic procedures. This should be further explored in the future to make it easier for companies to use the algorithms and approaches they have designed.

334,Analysis Of E-Commerce Adoption For Msmes In The Food  And Beverage Sector In Garut Regency,"micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes) play a very important role in the national economy, as well as the go digital 2024 program launched by the government. the covid-19 pandemic factor that poses a big challenge for msmes to immediately digitize, plus the potential that is expected in the future from digitizing msmes.while the government is intensively socializing msmes for digitization, msme actors in the food sector in garut regency still feel that they do not have sufficient knowledge and have difficulty understanding the benefits of using e- commerce. this study bridges by integrating the two models to determine the factors that influence msmes to adopt e-commerce. to examine the factors that influence the adoption of e-commerce, the study was conducted by collecting data from msmes in the food sector in garut regency using an online survey. the sample size is 130 msme respondents who have adopted e-commerce. the data collected were analyzed using structural equation modeling (sem) and analyzed by lisrel. the results of this study indicate that usage behavior is significantly and positively influenced by behavioral intention, e-commerce knowledge, and social influence. in addition, this study shows that behavioral intentions are not significantly influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, price value, social influence, facilitating condition, and e-commerce knowledge. this study is also expected to provide tangible benefits both theoretically and practically in effective e-commerce adoption. furthermore, the limitations of the study and suggestions for future research will be discussed further in the last section.","go digital, covid-19",,"muhammad awaluddin, luthfie hadie nugraha, siska noviaristanti faculty of management and business telkom university, indonesia awaluddin@telkomuniversity.ac.idluthfiehadienugraha@student.telkomuniversity.ac.idsiskamar hen@telkomuniversity.ac.id",
335,Analysis Of E-Wallet’S Factor Adoption In Food And  Beverage Business,"the presence of digitalization makes all activities carried out by individuals and companies easier because of the assistance of the latest technology. the whole world has been digitizing, and indonesia has become one of the countries that have participated in digitizing. this made the government take one concrete step by creating the program named ‘making indonesia 4.0’ by choosing five priority sectors, including the textile, automotive, electronic, chemical, and food and beverage sectors. the result of the indonesia industry 4.0 readiness index (indi 4.0) survey shows that the readiness of an entrepreneur to adopt technology is at a value of 2.47, with the optimal value of 3.51 – 4.00. this is in contrast to data on e-wallet users in indonesia, which tends to increase every year with an estimate of 202 million users by 2025. the purpose of this study is to find out about the factors that influence the adoption of the use of e-wallets for the food and beverage sector to an entrepreneur in bandung using the utaut-2 model and the addition of the trust variable. data was collected by conducting a field survey questionnaire completed by 385 participants. the study found that performance expectancy has no positive effect and has no significant effect on intention behavior. effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating condition has positive effect but has no significant effect on intention behavior. hedonic motivation, price value, habit and trust has positive and significant effect on intention behavior. this study also found intention behavior has positive and significant effect on actual use.","e-wallet, utaut, utaut 2","and Future Research The study was conducted to see what factors influence the acceptance of the use of e-wallet towards an entrepreneur in food and beverage sector in Bandung City. This study uses the UTAUT2 model and the additional Trust variable. The results show that the variables in the UTAUT model namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating condition do not significantly affect the intention of using the application. However, the variables in the UTAUT 2 model namely hedonic motivation, habit, price value have a significant effect on the intention to use e-wallet. The Trust variable as novelty from this study shows a positive and significant relationship to the intention to use, as for the intention behavior variable which shows a significant positive relationship to the actual use of the e-wallet. The results of this study are expected to provide benefits and contribute to the development of science, especially in the field of technology.

339,"The Influence Of Company Size, Institutional Ownership,  Financial Distress,And Implementation Of Ifrs On","the financial statements describe the results of the economic activities of an enterprise over a certain period and show how the management of the company performs its managerial responsibilities.therefore, its financial statements have beneficial information for its users internally and externally.thus, companies must submit their financial statements promptly to avoid losing the benefits they contain.this research aims to determine the impact of company size, institutional ownership, financial distress, and the application of ifrs on the timeliness of financial reporting by mining companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange between 2017 and 2020, either partially or simultaneously.this study's population is the annual reports of mining sector companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange from 2017 to 2020.purposive sampling was used in this study, which yielded 29 research samples in four years.this research uses the logistic regression analysis method using spss 26 software.this study found that firm size, institutional ownership, financial distress, and the simultaneous application of ifrs impact the timeliness of financial statement submission. if only partially, company size and institutional ownership positively impact financial statement submission timeliness, while implementing ifrs has a negative impact. meanwhile, financial distressdoes not affect reporting timeliness.","company size, financial distress","of Welly Salipadang et al. (2017) and Darmawati and Noor (2018),who found that institutional ownership influences the timeliness with which financial reports are submitted. The Influence of Financial Distress on Timeliness of Financial Report Submission The results of this test indicate that financial distress has no effect on the accuracy of financial reporting or is not in line with the hypothesis in this study.Furthermore, the leverage ratio with the DER proxy has no effect because the leverage ratio cannot be used as a guide in determining the amount of financial statement disclosure obligations.These results follow research by Arniman Zebua, Selfie Gultom(2020),which states that the debt to equity ratio does not influence timeliness.This study also supports the current theoretical basis, arguing that the company's debt exceeds its existing capital, causing financial distress due to high liabilities. Research by (Ningsih et al. (2020)finds that DER does not affect the timeliness of submitting the company's financial statements. The Influence of IFRS Implementation on Timeliness of Financial Report Submission This follows the research hypothesis that the application of IFRS has a negative effect.With the results of this research, the authors have not found the same research related to the effect of the application of IFRS in a negative direction, but the theory which states that IFRS affects accuracy is supported by Fitria (2021), which states that the application of IFRS affects the timeliness of financial reporting.This study also supports the existing theoretical basis, which says that the complexity of IFRS and accounting procedures also lies in the difficulty of complying with detailed reporting, which results in delays in the submission of financial statements. This is supported by research conducted bySucipto and Noor(2019);the application of IFRS influences the timely submission of financial statements. 6. Conclusion The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of independent variables, the size of the company, institutional ownership, financial distress, and the application of IFRS, on the variable dependent on the timeliness of the presentation of financial statements. The author's research subjects are mining companies listed on the IDX from 2017 to 2020. The sample in this study was 29 companies for four years, so the total model in this study was 116 companies. Based on the findings of analyses and tests conducted using Microsoft Excel 2013 and SPSS version 26.0, it is possible to conclude that the size of the company, institutional ownership, financial distress, and IFRS application all impact the timeliness of financial statements presentation. Therefore, for the 2017-2020 period, the company size variable positively affects the timeliness of financial reporting for mining companies listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. Furthermore, for the period 2017-2020, the variable of institutional shareholding has a positive effect on the timeliness of the presentation of the financial statements of the mining companies listed on the IDX. In addition, for the period 2017-2020, the economic distress variable does not affect the timeliness of the presentation of financial statements for mining companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. On the other hand, the IFRS implementation variable negatively affects the timeliness of financial statement presentation for companies listed on the IDX for the mining sector for the 2017-2020 period.","timeliness of financial statement submission: a study on mining companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange for the 2017-2020 period desianaworopawestri and kurnia faculty of economics and business telkom university, bandung, west java, indonesia desianaworo@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id, akukurnia@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

357,Freight Transportation And Service Personnel Allocation In  Humanitarian Logistics,"efficient transportation logistics of humanitarian supplies and service providers are a crucial success factor in preparing for the operations. the aftermath of a humanitarian crisis requires quicker responses to the affected people. the disaster response plan includes enormous transportation planning and logistics to move service personnel, and emergency freight to the affected region. transportation models serve as critical decision-making tools to obtain the best possible resource allocation and cost optimization objectives to provide quick responses to a disaster situation. based on an example case, the paper formulizes a multi- objective transportation model to optimize the logistics cost of moving service personnel, and emergency freights for a long distance. the result shows the proposed models provide the delivery given the capacity constraints while reducing the costs.","emergency freight, service personnel","Generally, in disaster management, the transportation of emergency freight and service personnel reallocation planning needs to be improved. Transportation models serve as critical decision-making tools for quick responses and bringing necessary supplies to a disaster region. This paper's transportation model has two primary operations objectives: transportation of humanitarian relief and supporting staff. The minimization of the transportation cost model identified the optimal quantity of TUEs and humanitarian support personnel to reallocate in the disaster area, given the capacity constraints at the supply source and intermediary hubs. The process includes four supply sources (ports of embarkations), intermediary debarkation hubs, and four regions as the destination. Among the intermediary hubs were two airports for support personnel and high-value cargo and three seaports of debarkation for TUE's supplies. The main reason to apply the transshipment model is that it may be cheaper to ship through intermediate or transient nodes before reaching the destination. The model is primarily to support the rebuilding of war-devastated regions. However, the model is easily adjustable to any humanitarian mission and disaster support operations. Further research could, e.g., include intermodal transportation considering the cost structure of the different modes. Another possible extension could be the requirements of capacity uncertainty in developing the distribution model for disaster situations and developing a more comprehensive humanitarian activity that incorporates several more tasks and delays. 3238","wallace a. burns, jr. and mohammad a rahman school of engineering, science, and technology central connecticut state university new britain, ct 06053, usa gotechnical@yahoo.com, rahman@ccsu.edu","References
