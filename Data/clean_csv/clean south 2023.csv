0,Prospective Analysis Of Water Supply Through Analytical  Methods For A High Andean Population,"the main objective of this article is to find an adequate hydrological development plan worldwide, taking into account the resources that peru has, through different databases such as scientific articles, magazines, and national and international theses, demonstrating that various countries have a relative abundance of water resources that represent a large percentage of the world's water capital. the methodology presents four methods for the calculation of the future population and later the calculation of the necessary flow to supply the high andean population. the results are presented using two methods: graphic and numerical. based on the results, an interpretation of the data obtained was made. finally, this paper provides conclusions that are based on the decrease in water supply in the high andean areas, for which it was possible to estimate the demand for water for the development of the high andean areas and an improvement in the quality of life for their population. in summary, it has finished analyzing the approximation between the years 2022 and 2037 as well as the data collected for the investigation.","water management, hidric resource, shortage","• The methods presented have been updated and corrected over time (1993, 2007, and 2017); as a result, the method that behaves most appropriately with the data provided by the INEI is the simple interest method, because finding a population in rural areas is more feasible. • The future population obtained and benefited, which makes us notice that it is possible to reduce the water supply deficit in our country. Only in Huamanga would the gap be reduced by 7% of the non-beneficiary population. • The research carried out shows us the reality that Peruvians live in the high Andean (rural) areas without access to drinking water. In the particular case of the Rancha Town Center, it was possible to estimate the demand for water for the development of the Town Center and an improvement in the quality of life for its population. • The maximum daily flows and maximum hourly flows have been calculated for the town of La Rancha, for its subsequent conduit and distribution design. • According to the article, we have a future population in which there is a slight increase, and with this, we have already found the population intercensal rate using the formulas with which the reserve volume that will supply the population will be determined.","jair gómez, keren guzmán, paulo huanaco, leonardo porras y ladhy sierra escuela de ingeniería civil universidad ricardo palma santiago de surco 15039, lima, perú jair.gomez@urp.edu.pe, keren.guzman@urp.edu.pe, paulocesar.huanaco @urp.edu.pe, leonarpo.porras@urp.edu.pe, ladhy.sierra@urp.edu.pe",
1,Crowdsourced Local Delivery In Developing And Developed  Countries: A Comparison Of Stakeholder Expectations,"crowdsourced delivery is a potential solution for last-mile challenges. it requires a critical mass of both customers and couriers, whose expectations need to be matched. this proves to be difficult in developed countries, but might be easier in developing ones. thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether matching stakeholder expectations for crowdsourced local delivery is easier to achieve in developing than in developed countries. a framework with six expectations is designed and tested with an online survey conducted with potential customers and couriers in sri lanka and germany. results show that matching stakeholder expectations is easier in sri lanka than in germany. out of the six expectations, three were better aligned in sri lanka and three were equally well aligned.","crowdshipping, crowd logistics, sharing economy","The alignment of customers’ and curriers’ expectations for crowdsourced local delivery in Sri Lanka (developing country) and Germany (developed country) were investigated for six expectations. The results showed that matching stakeholder expectations is easier in developing than in developed countries. Out of the six expectations, three were better aligned in Sri Lanka (product specifications, payment amount, and payment terms) and three were equally well aligned (delivery time, GPS usage, and environmental impact). This paper has two main limitations. (1) Only one developing and one developed country were studied. Further research should verify the findings in other countries. (2) The participants were potential customers and couriers; thus, their actual behavior might differ from their survey answers. Future research can study actual crowdsourced delivery stakeholders. This paper showed that crowdsourced local delivery can be successfully implemented in the developing world. Thus, logistics and E-commerce companies in developing countries can benefit from its findings.","aiyoob jaward mohamed and stanislav chankov jacobs university bremen, germany aiyoobjawardmohamed@gmail.com, s.chankov@jacobs-university.de",
2,"Production Model Based On Lean Manufacturing, Mrp,  Mps And Tpm To Reduce Losses In A Mse In The Bakery","currently, the bakery sector has been growing exponentially, which is why most customers are more demanding and seek higher quality products. a large percentage of bakery companies in peru are small or medium, most of which are induced to informality. due to this, the processes have inefficiencies in there that decrease directly to the final product, causing deficiencies of these. that is why this research is based on reducing defective products by applying the lean manufacturing philosophy. the tools that were applied are the 5s, improvement of order and cleanliness within the plant; followed by this, the mrp was applied to be able to manage the stock of materials and then the mps, to be able to determine the quantity of products to be produced and at what time they should be produced. finally, the tpm which is responsible for each operator to maintain the machines they use. this proposal was carried out through a pilot test to be able to develop each tool in a bakery mype. in this way, the result was obtained: the reduction of finished products from 10% to 5%, reduction of production costs.","5s, mrp, mps, tpm","It can be concluded that the application of Lean (5S) tools can improve the order and cleanliness of the plant. This is extremely important because it can improve production, reduce waste, avoid accidents, have all the tools and machines more organized, have documents that help feedback on the 5s philosophy. Finally, this influences the reduction of defective products and losses. In addition, it is important that the operators have knowledge of the machines that they use in order that they can do maintenance after using them to avoid finding continuous failures. Likewise, it can be concluded that the application of the MRP helped significantly to be able to plan the materials, and how many of them were needed and in this way not run out of stock, since this delayed the preparation of ciabatta bread by not Have the necessary materials to make it. On the other hand, it was possible to conclude that the implementation of the MPS helped significantly to reduce losses and waste, because it was planned how many loaves should be manufactured and at what time, and in this way an overproduction was not produced.","sector marcela garay-rimarachin, diego eduardo mejia-espinoza facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú 20182637@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20181161@aloe.ulima.edu.pe martín fidel collao-diaz research professor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura, universidad de lima, perú mcollao@ulima.edu.pe",
3,Characterization Of Energy Efficiency In Lighting Systems  Using Solar Panels By Light Self-Regulation Applied To,"the purpose of this document is to provide environments with optimal lighting levels, obtain efficient energy savings and avoid discontent regarding the sensation of light intensity. the use of energy that keeps light energy emission costs linear and how to optimize it in high-demand areas such as higher education centers has become one of the most questioned puzzles in recent years. this is followed by the poor regulation of lighting present inside the classrooms, which means that the students present in the various houses of study (whether they have natural lighting during the day) are affected by the opaque visibility generated by the contrasts of light in the different parts of a room. the application of new technologies such as the management of buildings with photovoltaic panels together with automated sensors for the regulation of light intensity has become one of the most viable and successful solutions in terms of improving the comfort of students and reducing budgeted costs.","photovoltaic panels, smart lighting","In higher education centers it is important to consider the potential for savings with respect to energy consumption, which is emphasized for proper energy management. As seen in Table No. 6, for a certain number of luminaires in each classroom, it is considered 9, therefore, according to formulas No. 2 and 3, a favorable result of 4.68KW was obtained, which can be compared with the amount of power of a building of an education center resulting in 6.47 KW, it can be concluded that there was a saving of 1.79KW thus demonstrating an efficient energy saving. After having carried out the analysis of the systematization of the automated electrical circuits through an Arduino microcontroller device, it can be concluded that there is an efficient saving in the building. During the day there is less demand for energy which implies a reduction in costs. The Arduino microcontroller system had an efficient optimization in the control of energy use. With the use of solar panels, an energy use of 31.5 kW/h per month is obtained, which contributes to considerable savings in consumption expenses that arrive by receipt at the end of the month.","higher education centers heder portocarrero, nayelly parra, mauricio lúcar, alonso lópez, juan reyes, mario chauca school of civil engineering ricardo palma university santiago de surco, lima, perú heder.portocarrero@urp.edu.pe, nayelly.lizeth@urp.edu.pe, 201810491@urp.edu.pe, carlos.lopez@urp.edu.pe, 201811367@urp.edu.pe, mario.chauca@urp.edu.pe",
4,Enhancing Academic Performance In Operations Research  Through Cooperative Pbl In A Distance Learning,"professors have had academic performance problems during the pandemic associated with their learning models. primarily due to lack of preparation in distance learning resulting from the suddenness of the transition. one of the areas most affected were stem subjects, which had advantages in a traditional face-to-face environment. the pandemic presented a challenge, especially for the teaching of operations research. at the beginning this subject was taught using a model of the physical environment with some digital tools, however the performance was not as expected. the study focuses on demonstrating the improvement of academic performance in the operations research subject using cooperative project based learning. method: for the research, the cooperative pbl learning model was applied on measurement indicators based on the quality assurance model from icacit accreditation, both within a distance learning environment during the pandemic. performance data were taken from one semester of traditional distance learning and then from 2 semesters applying cooperative pbl by observing and measuring student outcome performance. after the study, performance indicators were compared and an evolution was found by applying cooperative pbl. academic performance was more promising over time, finding a difference between the first experience versus the later application of the model. as for quantitative results, the academic performance of the student's increased up to 3.00%, 100% of students passed the subject. as qualitative results, the students obtained recognition in university contests, generating a better intrinsic motivation, improved their critical thinking and gave value and meaning to their learning.","cooperative pbl, pbl, pjbl",,"environment vanessa maribel choque-soto, victor dario sosa-jauregui and lauro enciso rodas escuela profesional de ingeniería informática y de sistemas universidad nacional de san antonio abad del cusco cusco, cusco, perú vanessa.choque@unsaac.edu.pe, victor.sosa@unsaac.edu.pe, lauro.enciso@unsaac.edu.pe","References

5,Improvement Of Clean-In-Place (Cip) In The Evaporation  Process Of A Dairy Company Using Six Sigma,"the semi-automated cleaning-in-place (cip) integrated cleaning technique is very common in food manufacturing companies. it consists of removing residues and cleaning equipment without the need to disassemble the production line. however, there have been problems with high ph levels after cleaning in the dairy company under study. this situation can represent the risk of contamination of the products with chemical agents used in cleaning and cause production delays. this research aims to improve the cip process of the company. the six sigma methodology based on the dmaic cycle was used. 70.1% of the problems related to cip are non-compliance with the conductivity limits during the soda and acid stages. the data was collected directly from the software used in the company to monitor the activity, and the 33 cleanings carried out in the evaporator for 3 months were considered. the capacity analysis indicates problems of both variation and compliance with the objective, with values cp=0.71 and cpk=0.03 for the soda stage, and cp=0.53 and cpk=0.09 for the acid stage. through multiple regression analysis and anova, the root causes of the conductivity problem were found: the work shift, cip cycle duration, temperature, outlet flow, and dsi pressure. the improvement proposals are mainly focused on establishing and monitoring standardized protocols for different tasks of the cip, which include determining the concentration of chemical solutions, removing mud from caustic soda solution, and cleaning inside the tubes. it is estimated that these measures can reduce the problem by 33.5%.","six sigma, dairy, standardization","The improvement proposals presented manage to explain 51.96% and 43.72% of the causes that originate the instability of conductivity during the acid and soda stages, respectively; the remaining percentage can be explained by the qualitative analysis and, in addition, by variables for which there are no records. It is estimated that approximately 47.8% of the conductivity problem can be solved with the proposals presented, which represents about 33.5% (47.8% of the 70.1%) of the CIP cycle problems. These results are significant for the organization since they are related to the activities of the operators and the management of the critical variables during the CIP sequence and imply a contribution to the development of the company's strategic plan through a common knowledge base and a learning experience within the area. The use of the DMAIC methodology and the Six Sigma approach was a success as it allowed to efficiently address the problems related to the standardization of production, allowed to focus from the beginning on the critical variables from the point of view of time loss and execution errors, which is a fundamental factor in the instability of the conductivity that impacts the removal of organic and chemical matter. The methodology proved to be effective in terms of achieving in a short time some of the most important root causes of the problem presented and seeking customized solutions in improving the quality and efficiency of the cleaning process. 73","diego gonzález and mervyn márquez industrial and systems engineering institute, faculty of engineering sciences universidad austral de chile valdivia, chile diego.gonzalez03@alumnos.uach.cl, mervyn.marquez@uach.cl","References

6,Analysis Of The Performance Of A Private Entity As Agent Of  Governance In A Local Productive Arrangement Of,"this paper analyzes the performance of a private nonprofit entity, called serratec, a member of the local productive arrangement (lpa) of information technology (it) in the mountainous region in rio de janeiro state, brazil, which exercises the governance of it. this article shows a single case study based on bibliographical research and unstructured interviews with managers of serratec. the geographic region of this lpa involves four cities and around four hundred companies of software development, mostly small and medium sized. sixty-three of those companies are associated with serratec, contributing financially and benefiting from it. besides economical results, this lpa acts an important social role, training and offering first job opportunities to young people or people under social vulnerability conditions. these cities and companies of this lpa are officially part of another productive arrangement of it that involves nineteen cities in a large geographic area, including the capital of the state, which makes this arrangement unable to meet the demands of companies and society of the mountain region. despite being just three years old and did not take part of the genesis of the lpa, serratec inherited and reactivated a thirty-year history of alternating expansion and contraction phases, motivated by planned actions by the government and business representation bodies, promoting technology and innovation in the region. the lpa is classified as “in development” and the governance is called “soft”. serratec is focused on creating conditions for companies and society to develop themselves in economic and social aspects with low environmental impact.","petrópolis, brazil",,"information technology flávio d’angelo pereira da silva, gabriel da silva martins, tainah delfino artieri, yuri do rosario de araújo industrial engineering school of petrópolis federal fluminense university flaviod@id.uff.br, martins_gabriel@id.uff.br, tainahartieri@id.uff.br, yuriaraujo@id.uff.br",
7,Increasing The Potential Of Bolivian Manufacturing  Systems Through Factory Physics And The Theory Of,"companies in bolivia and other developing countries face challenges in staying competitive in the global market. one issue is the lack of defined work methodologies, leading to disorganization and waste of resources. this paper proposes to address this problem by combining two theories, factory physics and the theory of constraints (toc), to improve production processes in bolivian manufacturing firms. factory physics looks at relationships between quantities and performance, while toc focuses on identifying and addressing constraints preventing desired performance levels. by combining both methodologies, we developed an improvement strategy and evaluated it through computational simulation models for a bolivian furniture manufacturing firm. the results suggest that combining these methodologies can significantly increase productivity for bolivian manufacturing firms.","factory physics, simulation, productivity","This article examines the impact of implementing improvement methodologies on manufacturing systems in developing countries. We conducted a case study on a small furniture manufacturing company in Bolivia to achieve this goal, focusing on proposing ways to enhance its production system. We began the study by identifying the firm's characteristics and the production line under investigation, and then we determined the production rates of the various processes in the production line through a time study. Next, we formulated improvement strategies using factory physics and TOC. As factory physics provides a scientific basis for understanding manufacturing system performance, TOC gives us a management framework for identifying and managing constraints within the system. By calculating the production rate of each operation in the line, we identified the bottlenecks: machining, edging, cleaning, and selection. We formulated an improvement proposal for each of these operations to reduce the utilization and increase the production rates. After implementing the proposed improvements and recalculating the production rates, significant improvements were observed: the machining process increased its production rate by 48.57%, edging by 47.37%, cleaning by 16.67%, and selection by 36.36%. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed improvements, we constructed the production benchmarking graph for both the current and proposed models, this provided us with greater visibility of the system's state and the improvement achieved for every iteration. Furthermore, we developed two virtual simulation models to replicate the current production line and one incorporating the proposed improvements. Both simulations enabled us to extract information about the time distribution of workstations and operators and the values of the study variables: production rate, number of goods-in-process, and cycle time. In conclusion, the case study demonstrates that implementing improvement methodologies can significantly improve the production process of small companies in developing countries. Additionally, we proved that applying factory physics tools and the TOC produces positive results and provides a broader view of the system, allowing us to formulate better improvement plans. The proposed improvements resulted in an increase in throughput by 30.32%, a reduction of 36.78% in the number of products in process, and a decrease in cycle time by 11.65%.

8,Understanding Electric Vehicle Adoption In Bolivia: An  Examination Of Consumer Attitudes And Influential,"the increasing adoption of environmentally-friendly technology, such as electric vehicles (evs), is a topic of global interest. however, in less developed regions like bolivia, it remains a challenge. the successful adoption of evs in bolivia depends on understanding the factors influencing consumer adoption intentions. this research aims to identify these factors by examining the impact of evs' functional, non-functional and attitudinal factors on consumer adoption intentions in bolivia. the study found that adoption intentions depend on factors such as gender, perceived utility, ease of use, perception of the environment, social influence, perceived behavioral control, emotional value, monetary value, and attitudes. the findings of this study provide valuable insights for marketing strategies and open the door for further research on the acceptance of evs in developing countries like bolivia. additionally, different business strategies are discussed to ease electric vehicle adoption in bolivia. the research highlights that understanding the factors that drive electric vehicle adoption in developing countries is essential for successfully implementing electric vehicles in bolivia.","electric vehicle, consumer attitudes","The study in Bolivia revealed a multiple linear regression model that explains the influence of specific functional and non-functional variables of electric cars on the intention to adopt this technology. The variables with the most significant impact on adoption intention were emotional value, social influence, perceived usefulness of the car, perceived behavioral control, attitude, gender, and positive environmental perception, supporting seven of the nine hypotheses proposed at the beginning of the study. However, we did not find statistically significant evidence to support hypotheses 2 and 6. Specifically, it was determined that a positive perception of usefulness, social acceptance, and pleasure in driving an electric car are reasons that would increase the intention to adopt the technology, which is in line with studies conducted by Jaiswal et al. (2021) and Schuitema et al. (2013). Similarly, we found that women in Bolivia would have a higher intention to adopt this technology, a finding that is consistent with other research, such as the one conducted by Sovacool et al. (2018). Another critical study result relates to the non-significant impact of the perception of an economic benefit in using an electric car. In the particular case of Bolivia, the savings represented by switching from a petroleum-dependent mode of transportation to an EV are less critical than in other countries where fuel prices are not subsidized. Similarly, it is important to note that a study by Ng et al. (2018) identifies the importance of the perception of an economic benefit in encouraging the adoption of an electric car. The study also found the significant importance of emotional value in the intention to adopt, consistent with the findings of a study conducted by Moons & de Pelsmacker (2012), which indicates that reflective emotions toward driving play an essential role in the formation of the intention to use. Marketing proposals provided by companies should highlight the specific attributes that electric cars have compared to conventional ones. This study identified that social influence and emotional value play an important role in incentivizing adoption, emphasizing the characteristics of self-image, social identity, and the feelings that will be achieved when using this type of car. This statement is consistent with the study conducted by Noppers et al. (2015), which states that sustainable innovations' symbolic and social influence attributes reflect the perceived outcomes of ownership and use of sustainable innovation 95","factors boris christian herbas-torrico and anelisse andrea cardozo-cortez exact sciences and engineering research center (cicei) bolivian catholic university cochabamba, bolivia bherbas@ucb.edu.bo, anelissecardozo.c@gmail.com","References

9,Influencing Variables And Scenarios For The Frozen Fruit  Agro-Export Sector: The Peruvian Case,"in recent years, the agro-export sector in peru has undergone constant changes caused by the political context, technological advances, among others, which affect the market share of peruvian producers compared to other countries producers in this sector. this research focuses on identifying the most influential variables to determine future scenarios in the peruvian agro-export sector of frozen fruits. the study analyses mango, blueberry and strawberry exports in peru, in order to promote the development and growth of this sector. it has a mixed approach and follows godet's prospective strategy as a research methodology. to this end, interviews were conducted with experts to find the most influential variables and factors were identified for the analysis of key variables using the multiplicative cross impact matrix applied to a classification (micmac) method and the construction of scenarios using the system of cross impact matrices (smic) method. the conclusions of the study indicate that the variables with the greatest impact are exogenous, such as the implementation of agricultural technologies and adequate cold chain logistics. these results allow us to propose possible scenarios that can be used to develop improvement proposals for the future development of the sector.","frozen fruits, export, peru","Once the strategic variables were identified and validated, it was concluded that there are exogenous variables that are fundamental for the sector, such as the implementation of freezing and agricultural technologies, cold chain logistics, price variations in the sector, free trade agreements, the political situation and transport, among others. In addition, there is also the presence of endogenous variables such as greater availability of fresh fruit, costly entry barriers, variety of suppliers (raw material, inputs and technology). It should be noted that the weights of the variables are important for their distribution in the strategic matrix. 107","ariana mariell alvarez-gallegos, césar andré soto-tipacti and martín fidel collao- diaz facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima, perú 20170056@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20171505@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, mcollao@ulima.edu.pe","References

10,Systematic Review Of The Literature On Data Governance In  Healthcare Institutions,"in recent years, data governance has become a topic of great interest for organizations since it defines power relationships between the actors involved in management and the socio-technical guidelines that are established in order to generate value for the company. organization by understanding the data that reflects evidence of performance. for this reason, data governance refers more than to data management, to the decisions that are made with respect to them, establishing those responsible for decisions, the methodology for processing, the guidelines for access, distribution, storage and control of data in the organization. although there is no evidence that data governance adds value to organizations, data governance provides guidelines for exploiting the potential value of data in pursuit of organizational objectives, under the premise that good administration of data produces well-informed decisions, optimizes healthcare processes, and reduces the risk of privacy breaches this article presents a systematic review of recent literature on the subject in healthcare institutions in order to identify the main trends which are; disease diagnosis and prediction, patient relationship management, and resource management. the main challenges in data management in the sector were also identified, which are; technological, legal and business.","gobernanza de datos, servicios de salud, flujo de trabajo, therefore","Data management and analysis in the health sector is used either with a focus on the optimization of clinical processes such as the diagnosis and prediction of diseases, or of an administrative nature such as customer management or resource management ( temporary, economic, supplies and human), whose main purpose is the transformation of the data collected in the care processes offered by hospitals into knowledge, for decision-making that can improve patient outcomes and the operational efficiency of the hospital. organization. The main challenges found for the analysis of data in the health sector are of a technological, legal and business nature, with the most delicate being of the legal nature when dealing with the processing of personal data and confidential information pertaining to the state of health of patients, which has limited research on many occasions precisely to preserve your privacy by restricting use and dissemination. On the technological side, large volumes of data represent a challenge when it is processed and stored, although technological advances have increasingly allowed data storage to be greater, the amount of data generated is abysmal, for Therefore, the data management cycle must be very precise so as not to exhaust the storage capacity with data that is not relevant or does not add greater value to the organization. The healthcare sector processes and generates a large amount of data through its normal operation. If these data are well managed, they can be used for the continuous improvement of both clinical and administrative processes. Therefore, the implementation of a data governance model promises generates added value to companies by applying the guidelines and policies established for the correct handling of data, which are developed through the analysis of the processes that make up the health service in the institution, allowing decision-making based on data that accurately describe the reality of the company or the state of health of a patient.","helien parra riveros facultad de ingeniería industrial universidad santo tomás bogotá, cundinamarca, colombia helienparra@usantotomas.edu.co diana yomali ospina lópez, ibeth yasney amaya rueda and luis zambrano facultad de ingeniería universidad autónoma de manizales manizales, caldas, colombia facultad de ingeniería universidad ricardo palma lima, perú dianaospina@autonoma.edu.co, ibeth.amaya@ustabuca.edu.co, luis.zambrano@urp.edu.pe",

13,Production Management Model Based On Lean  Manufacturing And Slp To Optimize Unproductive Times In,"in recent years, there has been a considerable increase in the demand of the plastics industry; therefore, many smes have not been able to cover their demands due to production problems, since there is a high number of unproductive hours in unnecessary movements, machine stoppage, and poor machinery maintenance planning, among others. the problem that could be identified and that occurs in most smes in the plastics sector is low availability due to unproductive times. the purpose of this article is to reduce downtime in production and consequently increase the oee, since this represents a loss of money for the company, especially in the injection process. therefore, the idea is to implement the lean manufacturing model, which is validated with its tpm, 5s, ergosmed and poka yoke tools, in addition to the slp implementation. to validate this improvement proposal, the arena simulation software was used in a company in the plastics sector, since it will be possible to obtain a reduction of unproductive times by 20%, reduce travel times by 25%, reduce labor disorder in jobs by 15%, and in general increase availability by 12%, thus increasing the oee indicator by 20%.","lean manufacturing, 5s, ergosmed, tpm, poka yoke","The purpose of this research guides us to have a greater knowledge of the context in SMEs in the plastic sector in Peru. The specific indicators that were improved by this study are mentioned below. The improvement in the plant distribution guaranteed a better movement of resources within it, and with the implementation of SLP the other tools were implemented in the most appropriate way because with the SLP the order of all the elements that are in the plant was optimized. Autonomous and planned maintenance is relevant for the optimization of processes in machines and could be evidenced in a significant way: the average MTTR went from 0.7 hours to 0.58, while the MTBF before had an average of 29.08 hours, and now 51 hours. About defective products, the processing of the raw material in the machines, especially in the injected, has been improved through the Poka Yoke through continuous improvement devices. The application of the 5s and ErgoSMED helped to have a better production, since the spaces were better ordered, better distribution of the tools, the disorder of the environment low from 40% to 24% 145","smes in the plastics industry jhordy edinson burga-dominguez, faculty of engineering and architecture, university of lima, perú 20151679@aloe.ulima.edu.pe oscar jofre seminario-mallqui, faculty of engineering and architecture, university of lima, perú 20183263@aloe.ulima.edu.pe martín fidel collao-diaz and juan carlos quiroz-flores faculty of engineering and architecture university of lima, peru mcollao@ulima.edu.pe, jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe","References

In this sense, a methodological route is proposed which will determine the direction of future research: 1. Apply the maturity models found in Mexican SMEs in order to analyze their relevance and applicability in the Mexican context. 2. Define a theoretical model for the evaluation and implementation of Mexican SME 4.0, considering the previous results. 3. Validate the proposed model in a representative sample that allows quantitative analyzes that can be comparable to longitudinal studies. The statistical analysis tools that will be used are Factor Analysis, Correlational Analysis, and Structural Equations, through which relationships and weights between variables of different natures can be determined. This is one of the weaknesses found in the models, where no importance is established between factors or dimensions.

19,Students' Perceptions Of Information Security In Online  Platforms,"in academic institutions, e-learning platforms are widely used to manage learning contents, assessments, and student communication and act as a primary system for all learning needs. during covid-19, online learning was the only medium of instruction used to teach students due to public health concerns. the world noticed the increased activity of identity theft, individual and institutional content theft, and ransom attacks in many educational institutions since most students were using digital technologies to learn, and information, including personal and intellectual content, was being shared online. e-learning platform providers often prioritize speedy delivery and deployment of learning solutions, which may result in inadequate attention to the security and privacy of personal information. the study aims to identify college students' perceptions of information security regarding online learning platforms. the global covid-19 pandemic accelerated online learning methods, making it more critical for institutions to pay more attention to cybersecurity and ransom attacks. the results from this study will facilitate an understanding of students’ confidence in the learning platforms and their level of knowledge related to information security while using the internet. the result of this study can help e-learning platform providers with insight into perceptions of their solutions, which ultimately can help them to create safer and more secure solutions that protect the integrity of information shared.","e-learning, covid-19, pandemic, information",,thiru pandian university of texas at dallas,
20,Replacing Complex Models For Health Decision Making With  Metamodels: Three Examples,"models used to inform decisions in health are often complex, data- and computation-intensive, and difficult to interpret. for this reason, many models developed by operations researchers to support clinical, operational, and public health decision making are never used by decision makers. this talk focuses on the use of metamodels – that is, a statistical approximation of an original model – to replace complex models for health-related decision making. we describe three metamodels focused, respectively, on personalization of drug treatment for schizophrenia, control of hepatitis c in prisons, and use of mass prophylaxis for controlling disease outbreaks. we show how machine learning methods can be used to develop approximate models that can perform nearly as well as the original model, but with fewer data requirements, less computational burden, and often greater interpretability. although each metamodel is specific to the original model, these examples illustrate general principles for creating simple yet useful models to support health decision making. more broadly, these examples suggest ways in which complex models used to support decisions relating to the production and provision of manufactured products and services can in some cases be replaced with simpler metamodels.","health, simulation, machine learning, complex models",,"margaret brandeau department of management science and engineering stanford university, stanford, california usa brandeau@stanford.edu",
21,Patient Monitoring Over The Internet  Nicholas Bambos,"with modern wearable sensor and networking technologies improving, it is becoming possible to continuously monitor patients remotely over the internet, while they go about their everyday lives, and call them into the hospital only when their conditions deteriorate to the point where hospital intervention is needed. such is, for example, the case with continuous glucose monitoring of pediatric diabetes patients. we discuss two key complementary problems involved in remote patient monitoring over the internet. the first is about which wearable sensors to activate (and when) in order to remotely estimate the patient’s health state, given that sensors are typically battery constrained; activating all sensors too frequently will simply run them out of battery sooner than normal. the second is about when to call a patient into the hospital for medical intervention, given an observed deteriorating health state and, subsequently, when to discharge the patient from the hospital as the health state improves. we design and analyze two formal stochastic optimization models capturing the tradeoffs in these two complementary problems and glean insights about such novel service operations.","stanford, california",,"department of electrical engineering and department of management science and engineering stanford university, stanford, california usa bambos@stanford.edu",
22,Fintech In The Entrepreneurial Ecosystem: Analysis Of The  Relationship Of Variables In Smes In The State Of Mexico,"small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) generate a significant boost in the national economy; however, the permanence in the market of these companies is relatively short due to the various problems they face, among which the lack of access to financing stands out. the entrepreneurial ecosystem is a gear that moves the economy through the participation of all the actors, and, without a doubt, financing is part of this gear; therefore, the new ways of financing smes are a point of discussion since fintech are companies that promote certain benefits for these businesses. therefore, the research objective of this paper is to analyze the relationship between fintech services and the financial characteristics of smes in two municipalities. the type of research is quantitative, diagnostic, and correlational. the research method is deductive. the study subjects are smes in the northern zone of the state of mexico. the results show that the entrepreneurs of these smes surveyed perceive fintech as a handy technological tool to finance themselves through crowdfunding platforms. in conclusion, using the fintech tool as a financing alternative can be used by entrepreneurs who need help obtaining financing due to the high-interest rates they must pay when applying for a loan.","fintech, financing","Fintech financial services detect the use of this technological tool as a source of financing in SMEs in two municipalities in the north of the State of Mexico. Therefore, the following is concluded:Of the SMEs surveyed, they resort to internal financing, while they only resort to external financing. Internal financing comes from the partners' contributions and the retention of profits. External financing comes from requests for lines of credit, informal financing, and bank loans. The financing is used for working capital and investment and covering contingencies and expenses.SMEs turn to financial intermediaries such as Fintech companies, lenders, and cooperatives of the SMEs surveyed if they would use financial services from Fintech companies and are not interested in going to a Fintech to obtain financial services. SMEs would not use Fintech services because they need to learn how they work, do not trust them, and prefer traditional banking.For SMEs, it is beneficial to hire financial services through Fintech companies. At the same time, it is not very useful to request financial services from these companies, and Fintech companies do not represent any use.SMEs find it more interesting to contract Fintech services due to the flexibility of this business model, while others are interested in cost reduction, accessibility, and time savings. Of course, SMEs would request 182","zugaide escamilla-salazar universidad autónoma del estado de méxico centro universitario atlacomulco estado de méxico, méxico zescamillas@uaemex.mx lila margarita bada-carbajal senior lecturer of management instituto tecnológico superior de álamo temapache tecnólogico nacional de méxico veracruz, mexico lila.bc@alamo.tecnm.mx anahí hernandez-botellodel universidad autónoma del estado de méxico centro universitario atlacomulco estado de méxico, méxico ahernandezb004@alumno.uaemex.mx","References

23,Multi-Criteria Index Clustering Method With Mean-Variance  Optimization In Pse Amidst Covid-19 Pandemic,"this work intends to combine technical analysis and the k-means clustering algorithm in portfolio selection. to choose the appropriate number of clusters, this study suggested the elbow method and multi-criteria index model from the most reputable index, including silhouette, calinski-harabasz, and davies-bouldin. we formed the clusters using the annual average risk data for the years 2019 and 2020, and we evaluated the stocks based on the technical analysis used by investors, such as moving average convergence/divergence (macd) and hybrid macd with arnaud legoux moving average (alma). in the empirical experiment, we used the mean-variance portfolio optimization model to solve the risk minimization issue on a subset of the companies' shares in order to choose the most effective portfolio. the philippine stock market lists 234 and 239 businesses for 2019 and 2020, respectively. all simulations were carried out using the matlab environment platform. the covid-19 condition is significantly riskier than the pre-covid-19 condition, according to the results. the macd approach dominates the macd-alma strategy in terms of the number of assets with a positive annual rate of return.","k-means, technical analysis, stock market","and Future Works A major global health disaster has been caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Global pandemic COVID-19 has a significant negative impact on the Philippine stock market. In the damaged market, retail investors are still looking for outstanding investments. In this study, the potential portfolio based on annual average risk is determined using the K-means clustering technique. The Elbow Method and the suggested Multi-criteria Index Model were used to estimate the ideal cluster size. The Silhouette Score, the Calinski-Harabasz Score, and the Davie-Bouldin Score were merged in the Multi-criteria Index Model. In all, 234 assets/companies for 2019 (pre-COVID-19 situation) and 239 assets/companies for 2020 (during COVID-19 condition) were utilised. The performance of MACD and the hybrid method (MACD-ALMA) under both typical and COVID-19 settings was compared and examined. The findings indicate that the COVID-19 condition is considerably riskier than the pre-COVID-19 state. The COVID-19 has a significant impact on the Philippine market environment. The MACD approach outperforms the MACD- ALMA strategy in terms of assets with positive annual rates of return. No matter how many assets have a positive annual rate of return, the MACD performs well in the pre-COVID-19 state while the MACD-ALMA performs well in the COVID-19 condition. The outcomes further demonstrate that utilizing the MACD in the pre-COVID-19 condition and MACD-ALMA in the COVID-19 condition, the maximum expected return (RP) may be attained. The MACD-ALMA exhibits a benefit in high-risk market circumstances and can also offer maximal RP. In pre-COVID- 19 settings, the Elbow Method performs well for clustering, while the Multi-criteria Index Model well suited during- COVID-19 conditions. Theoretical Contribution In order to use the proposed Multi-criteria Index Model and the K-means Algorithm to determine the ideal number of clusters, this work contributes theoretically to the body of literature already in existence. In cluster determination, it includes the three well-known model criteria. This Multi-criteria Index model has the highest predicted return, making it ideal for the COVID-19 condition in 2020. The clustering technique will assist the investor in deciding which portfolio to concentrate on in order to achieve the best return. In addition, compared to the traditional MACD (12, 26,9) during-COVID-19 situation (2020), where the market is at high risk, the hybrid MACD-ALMA with a window of (12,26,9) and (4,22,3) (investment strategy) offers a benefit. since the buying/selling transaction points were more than the usual approach (See Figure 1) Proceedings of the 4th South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Conference, Lima, Peru, May 9-11, 2023 195",maricar m. navarro industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao quezon city mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph bryan b. navarro electrical engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao quezon city bryanbnavaro@tip.edu.ph,"References

24,Flp Optimization Problem Using Multi-Point Swapped  Crossover,"one important choice in manufacturing and service systems is the facility layout problem (flp). the proper architecture of the equipment is essential for achieving optimal use. having the best facility configuration is crucial for lowering product costs and enhancing the efficiency of the manufacturing process. in order to reduce the cost of material handling, this research suggests a genetic approach for resolving the equal area facility layout problem. to answer the problem of facility layout, numerous optimizations and heuristic algorithms have been presented and published in the literature. the effectiveness of the suggested approach is assessed and contrasted with other methods. the proposed method's main benefit over competing strategies is that ga's coding is straightforward and it produces the majority of the optimal value compared to other approaches.","multi-point, swapped crossover, optimization","and Future works In this study, we created a method and modify the genetic algorithm process to reduce overall material handling expenses. Multipoint Swapped cross over was applied. In a comparison utilizing a benchmark numerical example, the proposed method is significantly more effective than the other methods in the literature. The solution demonstrates that an increase in generation has a positive impact on objective value more so than an increase in individual. Despite being simple, the coding is robust and produces good results. Genetic Algorithm perform better compared to other solutions for several reasons. First, the performance of the GA might be significantly impacted by the standards of the initial population. Finding high-quality solutions is more likely if the initial population is good because it can serve as a better starting point for the search process, Second, the genetic operators used, such as swapped-crossover and mutation, can have an impact on how well the GA performs. The population's variety can be preserved and early convergence to less-than-ideal solutions can be avoided with the proper application of crossover and mutation operators. Third, the process utilized to choose individuals for the next generation may also have an effect on the standard of the solutions produced. Better outcomes may result from appropriate selection processes that give the fittest candidates priority. And Lastly, the fitness function's design, which is how the solutions are evaluated, is also very important. The goals of the facility layout problem should be accurately captured by a well-designed fitness function, which should also give an indication of how effectively each solution is working. Regarding the proposed technique of swapped crossover and mutation in the context of facility layout problem using genetic algorithms, The effectiveness of the swapped crossover and mutation technique may vary depending on the specific instance of the facility layout problem being solved. It may work well for some instances but not for others. The technique may not scale well to larger problem instances with a higher number of facilities or constraints. There is a risk of the algorithm converging prematurely to suboptimal solutions due to the limited exploration of the search space. The technique may require a large number of fitness function evaluations and can become computationally expensive for complex problems. The effectiveness of the swapped crossover and mutation technique may also depend on the selection of appropriate crossover and mutation operators, which can be challenging and require domain expertise. The methodology outlined in this research may be applied and tested in future work to a wide number of facilities and case studies from the real world applications considering multiple constraints and objectives.",maricar m. navarro industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao quezon city mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph bryan b. navarro electrical engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao quezon city bryanbnavaro@tip.edu.ph jennifer l. camino civil engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao quezon city jcamino.ce@tip.edu.ph,
25,Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm In A Low Voltage  Distribution Network,"distribution utilities are under pressure to attain high efficiency and minimize system loss and because to the current trend in distribution regulation, distribution transformer relocation, network splitting, incorporating distributed generation and altering secondary line and service drop size, are some of the different ways to reduce secondary system loss (dg). the genetic algorithm is used in this study to properly position and size rooftop solar photovoltaic (pv) generation systems, minimizing secondary system loss (ga). the technique relies on a single, ideal installation to prevent voltage profile issues. this study uses thorough modeling to take into consideration various loads, client attributes, and solar pv generation systems. power flow based forward and backward sweep methodology was employed because of the unique characteristics of low voltage secondary distribution network. to demonstrate the robustness of the suggested strategy, secondary line features were used.","genetic algorithm, optimization","and Future works Using a genetic algorithm, we created a way in this paper to reduce secondary system loss (GA). To prevent voltage profile issues, the procedure is based on optimal single installation. Test examples based on actual secondary distribution network features are used to show how resilient the suggested solution is. The answer demonstrates that by dispersing the ideal single installation capacity to various system nodes, it is possible to achieve a considerably more optimal reduction of secondary system loss and voltage profile. Future research may use the approach outlined in this paper by accurately modeling the solar PV inverter based on real-world geographic characteristics, considering factors like temperature, irradiance, shading, position, tilt angle, etc. To reduce annual energy loss, time- varying loads may be adopted.","bryan b. navarro electrical engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao, quezon city bryan.navarro@tip.edu.ph maricar m. navarro industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines cubao, quezon city mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph",
26,Application Of The Abc Methodology To Reduce The Delay Of  Sales Orders In A Company Warehouse In Barranca City,"inventory management becomes more important as companies grow; therefore, it is important to improve its internal processes by seeking efficient storage methods. the processes were analyzed using problem diagnosis tools and it was observed that more than 15% of the total orders are delayed, and more than 80% are due to the fact that there is no specific location of the products in the warehouse. under this problem, the implementation of the abc methodology is proposed, which allowed dividing the large number of products that the company sells into families and classifying them into groups a, b and c. subsequently, the entire company warehouse was divided into zones. arena software was used to compare the results between the current situation and the improvement implemented. according to the results obtained, it was shown that from a reduction in picking times of 20% or more, the improvements implemented would be significant, and so it was. a reduction in picking time of approximately 33% was achieved, and late orders per day decreased on average from [5.03 ± 1.5] to [1.83 ± 0.56] orders.","abc methodology, warehouse, picking time, backorders","The results obtained after simulating the order preparation process in the warehouse of a company located in the province of Barranca, show that it is possible to obtain reductions in the delay of orders by relocating the family groups according to criteria based on the ABC methodology. In addition, the reduction in the time in which an order is attended from [93.18 ± 19.68] minutes to [46.98 ± 6.15] minutes increases the productivity of the work performed in the warehouse, which allows a greater number of orders to be covered. This was achieved thanks to the fact that each family of items was analyzed and placed, according to rotation criteria, in groups A, B and C; of which the first group 225","carlos abel santa cruz puente faculty of engineering and architecture universidad de lima, peru 20171444@aloe.ulima.edu.pe joe pui lo wu gamarra faculty of engineering and architecture universidad de lima, peru 20172812@aloe.ulima.edu.pe rafael mauricio villanueva flores faculty of engineering and architecture universidad de lima, peru rvillan@ulima.edu.pe","References

33,A New Probability Distribution With Applications To  Pandemic Data,"in this paper, a new probability distribution called generalized continuous uniform distribution (gcud) is presented, which is based on the standard uniform distribution. in this new distribution, a parameter is introduced in the probability density function that is associated with the power of the values of the random variable. the shape properties, the higher order moments, the moment generating function, the failure and survival function, and the model that simulates the gcud are derived. in addition, this approach allows us to generalize the generalized uniform distribution of jayakumar and sankaran (2019), which generates another new distribution that we call 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(j−s). to demonstrate the proposed model’s potential, we used a set of real data related to the covid-19 pandemic was obtained, which were adjusted to the new distribution 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺(j−s). the maximum likelihood method was used to calculate the parameter estimators applying the maxlik package in r language. the results show that the new model is more flexible and appropriate than other models already known in the literature.",probability density,"This article introduced a new family of the standard uniform distribution with three parameters, called Generalized Continuous Uniform Distribution (GCUD). The method used in this proposal incorporates a parameter 𝒌𝒌 to the power of the values of the continuous random variable, which favors a greater diversity of the probability density and failure functions. Also, some properties are derived from the new distribution. On the other hand, this approach allowed us to generalize the model presented by Jayakumar and Sankaran (2016), which allowed us to generate a new family of distributions, called 𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮(𝐉𝐉−𝐒𝐒), which presents excellent flexibility in the cumulative distribution function due to the presence of the parameter 𝒌𝒌. To demonstrate the above, a set of real data related to Covid-19 was adjusted, the maxLik package in R-language was used to find the parameter estimators. The results obtained show that the 𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮𝑮(𝐉𝐉−𝐒𝐒). It can be considered as a valid alternative to known distributions, such as the Weibull, Exponential Weibull, New Marshall-Olkin Weibull distributions, among others, with the advantage that it provides the flexibility of working with the parameter in the values of the variable. random.","isidro jesús gonzález-hernández, rafael granillo-macías, manuel de jesús martínez- téllez, aidee domínguez-islas, francisca santana-robles escuela de superior de ciudad sahagún-ingeniería industrial universidad autónoma del estado de hidalgo tepeapulco, hidalgo, méxico igonzalez@uaeh.edu.mx, rafaelgm@uaeh.edu.mx, ma448934@uaeh.edu.mx, do338910@uaeh.edu.mx, profe_7739@uaeh.edu.mx",

35,Asynchronous Team For Flow Shop Scheduling Problem: A  Case Study,"mining companies that carry out material movement activities for the heap leaching process maintain a constant sequence of operations. properly scheduling these operations is crucial to reduce operating costs. the scheduling of mining activities can be modeled as a flow shop problem. the efficient scheduling of mine operations must be continuously monitored to ensure positive impacts. implementing technologies such as digital twin for process planning and control in industries such as mining is now expected. this paper presents a methodology based on an asynchronous team of metaheuristics to solve the flow shop problem resulting from a case study of a chilean mining company. tabu search algorithms were used as team members. an asynchronous team was selected because it maximizes the use of computational resources, thus providing the digital twin with a sophisticated optimization algorithm for operation scheduling. the performance of the asynchronous team was validated by benchmarking against the best works published in the literature. a set of classical instances was used due to the company's limitations in using their information. as future work, it is expected to contrast the improvements in planning and control of mining activities with the asynchronous team embedded in the digital twin.","asynchronous team, digital twin, flow shop problem, mining activities","A methodology using an asynchronous team architecture to solve the flow shop scheduling problem was developed for the case study of a Chilean mining company. The asynchronous team architecture of tabu search algorithms achieved the most optimums reported for classical instances in the literature, proving its excellent performance for cases with few machines. The distribution of the asynchronous team across multiple processors allows us to exploit the computational architecture hosted by the Digital Twin. No singularities evidence the robustness of the asynchronous team in the execution. The simultaneity and randomness of the tabu search algorithm offer the possibility to explore a much larger solution space, increasing the probabilities of the metaheuristic to find excellent quality solutions. As future work, it is expected to contrast the improvements in the planning and control of material movement activities for the heap leaching process of the Chilean company with the asynchronous team integrated into the Digital Twin. 290","luis enrique tarazona torres department of industrial engineering universidad de los andes bogota, colombia le.tarazona@uniandes.edu.co ciro alberto amaya guio department of industrial engineering universidad de los andes ca.amaya@uniandes.edu.co david álvarez-martínez department of industrial engineering universidad de los andes d.alvarezm@uniandes.edu.co","References

36,Legal Research On Decision-Making In Artificial Intelligence  And Corporate Management,"in this paper, if artificial intelligence affects the company's management decision-making process, it assists human decision-making in the decision-making process (shareholders' meeting, audit, information disclosure, etc.), and artificial intelligence makes its own decisions. (artificial intelligence makes management decisions without human intervention in the board of directors, etc.) first of all, at the general shareholders' meeting, which can be said to help in decision-making, it uses artificial intelligence to convene a general meeting of shareholders, publicize the general meeting of shareholders, and perform accounting audits and work audits rather than playing a key role in decision-making. therefore, a more comprehensive and immediate audit is possible through real-time feedback of information through artificial intelligence. artificial intelligence can also be used as a tool for corporate information disclosure. on the other hand, artificial intelligence can learn on its own and play a key role in the management decision-making process of the board of directors because it can make altruistic and quick judgments if the input information is fair. since the board of directors is an important decision-making body for the company, artificial intelligence can provide advice during the company's management decision-making process, unlike tasks such as shareholders' meetings or audits, and furthermore, provide advice when making important company decisions. can on their own without human intervention. in addition, if management decision-making using artificial intelligence or artificial intelligence itself is wrong, legal problem solving can be a problem. and as our society develops, those problems will only get bigger and bigger. in short, legal proceedings become very important when companies are harmed by ai-enabled decision-making. however, it is difficult to find the cause of errors caused by artificial intelligence due to the black box problem of artificial intelligence. therefore, as a countermeasure against these errors, it has recently been suggested that the cause of errors caused by artificial intelligence can be identified by introducing and operating white box ai and xai (explainable artificial intelligence). and with these solutions, it is said that it is possible to determine whether there was a serious negligence in the decision-making using artificial intelligence, whether there was no conflict of interest, and whether the decision-making was carried out according to the principles. however, as many physicists and mechanists claim, the development of artificial intelligence has outpaced all human intelligence combined. in this paper, we assume various cases that may occur when companies apply and operate slightly strong artificial intelligence (level 4) that can be fully recognized in reality, and there are legal and institutional problems to solve them. and i'm looking for a solution for that.",decision-making,"Artificial intelligence will become an indispensable part of company management. Prior to the development and introduction of artificial intelligence, we will first understand this artificial intelligence and identify the good and bad points that may appear in the future, and the introduction of a legal system accordingly will be urgent. In other words, we are at a stage where we have to judge what role this artificial intelligence will play, what results the work performed by artificial intelligence will have and how it will affect the world, and how these things will be done within the framework of the law. Whether to recognize artificial intelligence as a legal personality will be judged according to what role artificial intelligence will play and influence in the human world in the future. This is because the issue of granting legal personality is a matter of artificial expansion of the historically changing, variable and relative concept of personality, and is only a matter of securing legitimacy from the point of view of legal policy. If artificial intelligence technology is further developed and it is possible to create algorithms and select input values by itself, such artificial intelligence (step 45) may recognize these laws and regulations on its own and take measures against violations in advance so that the law cannot be applied. . In addition, if the opponent of artificial intelligence is also a robot of artificial intelligence, there is a possibility that unity can occur with each other, so there is room for 301","kim see you, shin dong ho student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim student, department of economics, college of economics, nihon university, 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan eavatar@hanmail.net","References

37,Factors Affecting Intention To Accept Artificial Intelligencebased Smart Aquaculture System,"currently, in the fishery industry, production of traditional fisheries is decreasing due to ① limitations in fish resources, ② pollution of the marine environment, ③ illegal overfishing, and ④ weakening of the foundation due to hollowing out and aging of fishing villages. as a result, aquaculture has been proposed as an alternative to traditional fishing methods. in this paper, by identifying the factors that people interested in existing conventional fish farming, new fishermen who want to enter aquaculture, and fishermen who want to retire in a fishing village to spend their old age accepting ai-based smart aquaculture systems, it was intended to derive the direction of advancement and contribute to the development of the aquaculture industry. to this end, the following three research questions were set. first, a research model was established to identify the acceptance intention of the artificial intelligence-based smart aquaculture system. second, factors that directly or indirectly affect the acceptance intention of the ai-based smart farm system were set as independent variables and parameters, and measurement items were derived. third, in order to find out the effect of demographic characteristics such as education, career, and age on acceptance intention, the study was conducted focusing on the relationship between independent and dependent variables. the study was conducted in 5 stages. in the first stage, the overall direction of the thesis, such as the purpose of the study and the procedure for the factors affecting the acceptance intention of the ai-based smart farm system, was presented. in the second step, previous studies were divided into three areas and analyzed. ① analysis of preceding studies on the definition, configuration and theoretical background of ai-based smart aquaculture systems, environmental characteristics in terms of policy, economy, society, and technology through pest technique, and future development direction, ② acceptance intention of preceding studies related to artificial intelligence services analysis ③ prior to constructing the research model, previous research models such as tam, utaut, is success model, and servqual were analyzed to derive measurement items such as independent variables, parameters, and dependent variables. in the third step, the research model construction step, a model was constructed to conduct this study, hypotheses were established, and operational definitions and measurement items for direct, indirect, and moderating effects were derived. in the 4th stage of empirical analysis, a questionnaire was constructed based on the measurement items derived in advance, and a total of 457 people were surveyed from december 2020 to february 2021. using spss 26 and amos 26, the influence of parameters and the moderating effect of demographic characteristics were analyzed as follows. checked the result. ① reliability, expertise, and availability were analyzed to have a positive (+) effect on perceived ease. along with this, responsiveness and security had a positive effect on usability. investment value and social influence had a positive (+) effect on acceptance intention. ② reliability-perceived ease-acceptance-intention path, expertise-perceived ease-acceptance-intention path, and usability-perceived ease-perceived usefulness path had a complete mediating effect, and the perceived ease-acceptance-intention path it was analyzed that there was a partial 304",,"In the 2000s, the fast-growing consumption of fishery products, global warming, marine pollution, illegal overfishing, and other traditional methods of producing fishery products, such as fishing, showed limitations. It became. As a result, the production method of aquatic products is being transformed from the existing fishing industry to the aquaculture industry. In particular, the 4th industrial revolution technology, which has recently been spreading across all industries, has promoted convergence in the aquaculture industry, and accordingly, the smart aquaculture system has emerged and entered the diffusion phase. However, there are matters to be considered in terms of policy, economy, society, and technology for the full-fledged spread and development of smart aquaculture systems. First, in terms of policy, it is necessary to improve the relevant legal system surrounding the aquaculture industry. Accordingly, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries enacted the negative-based Aquaculture Industry Development Act in 2019 to overcome the limitations of the positive-based Fisheries Act, and accordingly, individuals or companies that have promoted the aquaculture industry so far can do business in a realistic and non-restrictive legal system environment. The basis for the full-fledged development of the aquaculture industry was formed. In particular, for special aquaculture species that require large-scale capital, it is possible to restrict the participation of large companies, making it possible to scale and commercialize the smart aquaculture industry. Second, in terms of economy, 40% of total seafood consumption is imported from abroad according to the annual per capita consumption of seafood in Korea, which is currently ranked first in the world. Accordingly, a public-private joint project to create a large-scale smart aquaculture cluster complex of 20,000 pyeong is being promoted in three 311","jung ji-seok, shin dong ho student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net jeongwon kim student, department of economics, college of economics, nihon university, 3-2 kanda-misakicho, 1-chome, chiyoda-ku, tokyo, japan eavatar@hanmail.net","References

39,Inventory Policy For The Demand Of Main Products: The  Case Of A Peruvian Grocery Store,"the study proposed an inventory policy for its products with the highest demand based on the analysis of the application of three planning techniques, which were the silver meal method, the minimum unit cost method and the eoq. in addition, forecasting techniques were applied with a bimonthly historical data from the sales record that helped identify the products with the highest demand according to the abc classification. the methodology carried out in a grocery store in peru found that the demand behavior differed in each product; so, the standard deviation was analyzed. then, the application of the three planning techniques was compared where a similarity in the frequency of orders and quantity between the silver meal and mcu was observed; on the other hand, the eoq functioned as a preliminary step to identify a reorder point.","planning, inventory policy, demand forecasting, abc method, grocery store","The inventory policy was satisfactorily constructed; when applying the techniques presented after applying the techniques such as Silver Meal or the MCU in an annual range or in a time ballast, the minimum cost indicator can extend or reduce the number of days, this can happen on holidays or holidays, also, the EOQ technique indicates a high volume of sales, which prevents accumulating the purchase quantity since there is a storage limit due to the space of the warehouse, in conclusion, the inventory policy must be carried out with a monthly or quarterly anticipation for the products sold. Likewise, the application of an inventory policy generates a growth potential in the volume of sales, being the cost of this method accessible to the winemakers, in addition, the methodology used in the study can be replicated, to carry out the inventory policy of all products and build a systematized network for food inventory.","joshep delfín mauricio espinoza facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú 20172341@aloe.ulima.edu.pe emilio huaynate ricaldi facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú 20173478@aloe.ulima.edu.pe marcos fernando ruiz-ruiz associate professor universidad de lima lima, perú mruiz@ulima.edu.pe",
40,"Intention To Harvest Of Rainwater For Household  Consumption In Jakarta, Indonesia","flooding in the city of dki jakarta is a problem that always comes every year and always causes huge financial losses for its residents. not only that, but the problem of flooding in the capital city of jakarta has also tarnished the good image of the city of jakarta as the center of the government sector. the cause of flooding in the capital city of jakarta has many factors, one of which is the relatively high rainfall rate in the city of jakarta. the second thing that causes flooding in jakarta is land subsidence in dki jakarta and one of the causes of land subsidence in dki jakarta is excessive groundwater extraction. because most jakarta residents use groundwater as a source of clean water, groundwater extraction occurs on a large scale and is almost uncontrollable. as a result of this massive groundwater extraction, the groundwater system bears a very heavy burden. one method to achieve alternative clean water resources is rainwater harvesting. therefore, if there is a need for alternative water resources, they can help restore groundwater naturally and can help reduce land subsidence in dki jakarta. however, the community's interest in harvesting rainwater is very small. therefore, it is necessary to know what factors influence the community's acceptance of rainwater harvesting. primary data processing uses the structural equation modeling (sem) method to determine the relationship between the acceptance factors of rainwater harvesting.",acceptance model,"The factors influencing consumers in accepting household rainwater harvesting implementation are influenced by Rainwater Harvesting Intention.

Talking about agile methodologies should not be a topic without relevance in the company strategies, because it provides a better understanding about how to operate in a fast-changing environment such as the 21st century, specifically on the meat industry, where there are a lot of companies that have a better experience and performance in the current market. On the same way, digital marketing it’s a relevant topic to be considered on the business development, where using a group of technological tools and key indicators, organizations could get propose better strategies to reach the customer. It’s important to remark that strategies followed by the company and their efficient use of digital tools available would be determinant to differentiate the new product of the competitors, catch the customer's attention and loyalty them. To materialize that business idea and reach the entrepreneurs goals, it’s going to be necessary to have a general perspective and knowledge of the customer and the market where people are going to be involved (considering demographic characteristics such as age or gender), then determine the product features, which could be improved by small and iterative tests with the customer’s experience (MVP), and finally manage the digital customer experiences through the digital tools that are available for all enterprises such as social media and web pages. Once this all aspects are integrated, and the company counts with all relevant information to operate, the agile business model is when it could start to work with all this data articulated. If an entrepreneur wants to start a small business, specially related to the meat industry, a lot of factors should be considered, to predict future economic or financial situations of the company and improve their strategies on the market where they are involved. The main ingredients of the proposed product are Guinea Pig, which is a special meat, with healthier benefits compared to their closest competitors (such as chicken, pork and turkey), and quinoa, a healthy and interesting complement which differentiate even more from the closest competitors. In order to improve a product with this attractive and alternative ingredient, there are several factors of the business market to improve, because with the numeric predictions and software evaluation, having a Financial of NPV 278,995 PEN and an Economic NPV of 139,969 PEN is low compared to other previous investigations, but their explanation is mainly because having this product as an important input on the following investigation to produce nuggets is expensive, but with digital improvements and efficient election of the business strategies, better results could be generated, considering that nowadays more people prefer to buy healthier products than the usual ones.","alexandro manuel gutierrez-posadas and renzo leonardo vargas-castillo bachelor of science in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima 20160660@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20162610@aloe.ulima.edu.pe juan carlos quiroz-flores research professor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima, perú jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe ruth vasquez-rivas-plata research professor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima, perú rvasquez@ulima.edu.pe martin fidel collao-diaz research professor facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima, perú mcollao@ulima.edu.pe",

The study brings the importance of understanding that the subjectivity of the tasters have no influence on the duration of the fragrances and the improvement of the perfume quality or the development of new fragrances in the market from basic chemical components such as denatured ethanol (C2H6O) , essence or fragrance, fixative, propylene glycol (C3H8O2) and distilled water (H2O) including the exclusive perfume components that have a longer duration of ESSENCIAL fragrance and other new components. ● Understanding the variability of the fragrance duration of perfumes is one of the essential requirements for every consumer, to select the type of perfume that can provide the best experience when using it. Recommendations ● It is recommended to perform the experiment with more types of perfume of the same brand, in order to get to know and have a more exhaustive record of the durations of these perfumes. ● Due to the limitations of the experimenters, 2 perfumes for men and 2 perfumes for women were used, so it is suggested to separate the types of perfume according to the gender to which they are aimed. ● Due to the limitations of the experimenters, the application of these perfumes was directly to a piece of paper of 15.96 cm2; not knowing if the duration time may vary according to the surface applied; this is why it is recommended to perform it on different material surfaces, or to apply it on human skin. ● To better distinguish the perfume being tasted, it is recommended to smell cinnamon or coffee between each sample. ● In the experiment performed, a bond paper was used, but for greater precision it is recommended to use olfactory paper, which is specifically made to enable a more adequate sensory analysis. ● Apply the design of experiments of mixtures in Fragrances, based on the results obtained to optimize the composition of new combinations of components to obtain the best results in terms of quality, performance, and cost.","experiments: efficiency of natura perfume brand maria e. puelles bulnes school of industrial engineering ricardo palma university santiago de surco, lima, peru maria.puellesb@urp.edu.pe adrian barriga, alvaro juarez, henry segura, kiara gutierrez and nicolle trigueros students of industrial engineering ricardo palma university santiago de surco, lima, peru 202010576@urp.edu.pe, 202010563@urp.edu.pe, 202011605@urp.edu.pe, 202010574@urp.edu.pe, 201810567@urp.edu.pe resumen el objetivo del presente estudio es describir un experimento práctico que puede emplearse para enseñar los conceptos importantes relacionados con el curso de diseño de experimentos utilizando el lenguaje r y spss. se seleccionó el modelo del diseño de experimentos de bloques completamente al azar con el fin de determinar si existe o no diferencias significativas en las duraciones de las fragancias de cuatro tipos de perfumes con cuatro catadores, de la marca de perfume natura. luego para que los resultados sean confiables, se verificó el cumplimiento de las pruebas de normalidad, homocedasticidad de varianzas e independencia de residuos. tras haber realizado el experimento, en el anova se concluyó que sí existe diferencia significativa en las duraciones de las fragancias de los tipos de perfume al 95% de confianza y también la evidencia que no existe diferencia significativa en la evaluación sensorial de los catadores. luego se procedió a realizar un análisis post hoc: dms, tukey y bonferroni con α=0.05, el cual ayudó a determinar los pares de medias distintos entre sí, detectando el perfume essencial de mayor duración de fragancia. el estudio aporta la importancia de saber que la subjetividad de los catadores no influye en la duración de las fragancias y la mejora de la calidad del perfume o en la elaboración de nuevas fragancias en el mercado a partir de componentes químicos básicos como etanol desnaturalizado (c2h6o), esencia o fragancia, fijador, propilenglicol (c3h8o2) y agua destilada (h2o) incluyendo los componentes exclusivos del perfume essencial que tienen una mayor duración de fragancia más otros nuevos componentes. palabras clave: diseño de bloques completos al azar, análisis post hoc, análisis de varianza, eficiencia de los perfumes.",
48,Agile Course Planning In Educational Programs  Manohar S. Madan,"an approach to course planning in educational programs was presented in madan and gnanendran (2020). there, each student’s journey through a degree program was viewed as a “project” requiring completion of a set of tasks (courses) with each task having a specific duration (semester) and, possibly, precedence requirements (prerequisites). the institution is expected to offer courses in an appropriate sequence and timing so that students may progress toward graduation efficiently. given the large number of students that could matriculate every semester, the institution needs to manage myriad individual degree pathways. to make this problem tractable, madan and gnanendran (2020) considered cohorts of students, rather than individuals, according to when each entered the program. the institution then only needs to manage a limited number of simultaneous projects with outcomes that are measured on the typical criteria of time and cost. recently, researchers (e.g., rigby et. al., 2016) have espoused the “agile” approach over the traditional “waterfall” approach to managing projects in environments where changes to requirements are to be expected, the work can be modularized, and there are avenues to collaborate with end-users. since degree programs possess all of these characteristics, we propose heuristics based on agile methodology to address course planning and demonstrate their application via numerical examples.","project management, agile, heuristics",,"information technology and supply chain management department university of wisconsin-whitewater whitewater, wisconsin, usa madanm@uww.edu kingsley gnanendran operations and analytics department university of scranton scranton, pennsylvania, usa skingsley.gnanendran@scranton.edu",
49,Evaluation Of The Effects Of A Center Of Excellence Support  Program On National Technology-Based Strategic Goals Of A,"in recent years, significant technological developments have been recorded in the republic of türkiye, especially in the field of the defense industry. incentive and support policies have been developed and some strategic goals to be achieved have been determined in order to sustain these developments in the defense industry and other areas. within this context, the national scientific and technological research council started a program in order to support the development of manufacturing technologies for the defense industry under the collaboration of leading defense industry companies and experienced universities on manufacturing processes. while the technical work within this research has important contributions to the economic and technical development in the country, it also has some effects on the national technology-based strategic goals of the country. in this study, the evaluation of the effects of the program on these targets is modeled as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. benefits-costs-opportunities-risks (bocr) based analytic hierarchy process (ahp) method is applied to evaluate the effects of the program on national technology-based strategic goals and the contribution of the program to each goal is calculated.",bocr analysis,"In this study, BOCR – AHP analysis is made to evaluate the effects of a research program supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye on Türkiye’s technology-based national strategic goals. Within the research program, it is aimed to develop additive manufacturing technologies in the aviation and space industry. To measure the effects of the program on national strategic goals, a literature review was conducted to determine the social effects of additive manufacturing technologies. Then, a series of meetings was performed with program stakeholders to collect their opinions about the program’s effect on the national strategic goals and criteria evaluation. Collected data were used to calculate the importance degree of evaluation criteria and the contribution of each goal was calculated by the additive formula of BOCR analysis. The social effects of additive manufacturing may have some interactions. Not taking this issue into account can be seen as the main limitation of this study. For this reason, an ANP-based BOCR analysis will be conducted in further studies. Moreover, the utilization of linguistic terms for the evaluation of criteria and goals can be modeled by using fuzzy methodologies in further studies.","country: a case study mehmet kabak, hafsa nur ozturk, ezgi aktas potur, aylin adem department of industrial engineering gazi university ankara, türkiye mkabak@gazi.edu.tr, hnurozturk@gazi.edu.tr, ezgiaktas@gazi.edu.tr, aylinadem@gazi.edu.tr ahmet aktas department of industrial engineering university of turkish aeronautical association ankara, türkiye aaktas@thk.edu.tr",
50,Optimization Of Multimodal Dial-A-Ride Systems With  Fixed-Line Flexible Time Schedules,"this paper investigates a multimodal system that integrates the general dial-a-ride problem with a set of fixed-line vehicles having a flexible schedule. the passenger trips are made in a three-stage journey using a dial-a-ride vehicle and a fixed-line bus. passengers are picked up from an origin point and transferred to a collecting point via a dial-a- ride vehicle. then, fixed-route buses transfer passengers to a second collecting point where another dial-a-ride vehicle will pick up and transfer them to their requested destination. the main objective of this integration is to reduce the total trip cost by carrying part of it through cheaper fixed-route service while maximizing the utilization of seats in the fixed-route vehicle. the model provides each fixed line with a suggested start time. a mixed-integer linear programming model was developed for the problem, and computational testing on small-size instances has been carried out to demonstrate the viability of the proposed system.","transfer points, scheduled lines",and Future Work 424,"mai elgazzar and m. nashat fors industrial engineering, production engineering department alexandria university, egypt mai.elgazzar@alexu.edu.eg, nashat.fors@alexu.edu.eg islam ali industrial and manufacturing engineering department egypt-japan university of science and technology, borg el-arab, egypt industrial engineering, production engineering department alexandria university, egypt islam.ali@ejust.edu.eg, islam.ali@alexu.edu.eg","References

52,"9-11, 2023 Assessing And Furthering Technology Transfer In The Gulf","in this study, we assess the gulf cooperation council countries’ technology transfer (tt) framework to determine whether gcc has the foundation and structure necessary for a successful technology transfer. this study describes the challenges and obstacles facing the gcc countries in implementing tt. in addition to providing suggestions to maximize community benefits, promote tt locally to increase local self-sufficiency, and provide the necessary recommendations to increase its effectiveness and value.","turnkey method, fdi, joint ventures","In recent decades, technology has been the primary factor defining a nation's scientific capacity and, as a result, its capacity to maintain national security. The mere transfer of technology represents only the transfer and use of particular machines; the transfer of technology goes beyond that and involves the possession of technology by influencing its constituent elements. The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council have adopted a range of technology development strategies, from turnkey projects to industries that depend on imported raw materials like iron, steel, aluminum, cement, steel, and rebar. The market required petrochemical projects and production disposal, known as technology-free transportation. If the GCC countries benefited from the joint venture method, it seemed to be marginally superior to the first method due to the foreign partner marketing half of the product, the quick setup of the project, which in the best cases did not take longer than three years, and the training of local human cadres to be able to manage projects, but this is not necessarily the case. The GCC nations have not developed their scientific and technological capacities despite more than four decades of technological warfare, at least in producing spare parts and using alternative production techniques. The GCC countries have been and will continue to rely on foreign expertise because they relied on importing the best Western technology rather than adapting and developing their industries. External dependency can be seen in the promotion of a product, the use of foreign checks to fund projects, and the acquisition of organizational skills, experience, and knowledge. Multinational firms were able to impose their terms and reap enormous profits through direct investment, regardless of the capabilities of the recipient countries to do so. The ability to breed and adapt technology in a manner that makes foreign investment react to disparities in marginal productivity, i.e., capital flows from abundant to scarce locations. 5. Recommendations 1. Launching a Gulf Center for Technology Transfer. The function of this center is to be an information base for all types of technology, such as providing the center studies on the nature of technology suitable for economic sectors. The center can also conduct future studies on energy and its alternatives, especially in light of fluctuating oil prices and instability. Studies of investment plans projects setting up a system for exchanging information with governmental and non-governmental institutions. 2. Establishing a separate organization to coordinate science and technology at the level of the GCC nations and fostering collaboration between funding sources and those who will benefit from the research necessitates an efficient administrative framework at every level of scientific policy.

The developed system can supervise and record employees’ time log-in and the human resource or payroll master can use it as basis in payroll of the employees by showing their daily time record with calculated total hours, overtime hours, and under time hours worked. 2. The developed system can monitor the range of body temperature of the employees through a temperature scanner according to the normal body temperature indicator of 37°C based on clinical methods to assess a person with fever as a symptom of Covid-19 infection which is automatically displayed in the monitor and can be checked and recorded easily. Also, it can detect if the person is wearing face-mask for protection. 3. Based on the responses of the respondents interpreted as “Highly Acceptable” through descriptive surveys in line with ISO/IEC25010, the performance of the developed system is highly effective and recommended to use to a larger group of people.","starlord delivery services ralph louise canlas, justine gabriel, s. abria, reginald, s. bruehwiler, and sharon wendy t. mallari college of computer studies, angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines professor benedict m. guarin faculty of college of computer studies, angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines",
55,Manpower Planning And Allocation In Warehousing Area: A  Multi-Objective Optimization Approach Using Goal,"the shortage of warehouse labor has long been a thorn in the global supply chain, and it impacts the entire company as well as its customers. to meet unpredictable demand, companies have been heavily reliant on daily workers, but the high percentage of their use need to calculate again because of the difference skill with contractual worker. this research aims to create an optimization model using goal programming and particle swarm optimization (pso) approach that can determine the required number of contract and daily workers and optimize the cost of labor, while ensuring that the number of daily workers does not exceed 10% of the total number of contract workers also to improve productivity and optimize resources in the warehouse. the results show that the model can significantly reduce the use of daily workers and optimize the distribution of manpower, resulting in a reduction of total manpower needed in the warehouse by around 25%. moreover, the model optimization also leads to a cost savings of approximately 19% compared to the previous labor allocation system.","optimization, daily worker, contract worker, goal programming","This research optimization model using goal programming to formulated the model with all of the constraint and computational experiment conducted in this study showed that Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) implemented in Microsoft Excel can effectively and efficiently solve multi-objective problems and provide significant reductions in cost and workers needed for the project. The PSO algorithm was able to find the optimal solution within a reasonable number of iterations, and the results were found to be consistent and robust to changes in input parameters. The reduction in total cost and workers needed for the project highlights the potential benefits of using GP and PSO for multi-objective optimization problems, and can provide valuable insights and the impact of resource allocation on project outcomes.

58,"Netblk: Network Adblocker Using Raspberry Pi  John Ezekiel Dunglao, Sean Deniel Agustin, Jay Tanglao, Vraelle Velarde","advertisement blocking refers to the practice of using software or browser extensions to prevent advertisements from displaying on web pages or mobile applications. it is a growing trend among internet users, with an increasing number of people opting to block ads online. the use of adblockers has become a significant concern for businesses and advertisers who rely on online advertising to generate revenue. this study aims to design a dns server that will have a similar function as a firewall. a small board computer called raspberry pi will be used to connect to a network where websites with ads will be filtered. a small open-source networking tool called pi-hole will be used for configuring the raspberry pi. the device will now be the location of network traffic traveling through the network. this system is applied through the use of waterfall methodology which is a linear, sequential approach to project development, where the development process is divided into distinct phases. these phases typically include requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. the results of the survey show that the system has been accommodating to the evaluators. while adblocking software can improve the user experience by blocking annoying and intrusive ads, adblocking can be effective in mitigating certain information threats particularly those that originate from malicious ads. malicious advertisements can contain malware or lead users to phishing sites, and adblocking can prevent them from being displayed on a user's device. it is very important to protect such information from being stolen by attackers within a network.","dns, firewall","Network Security is an important feature to be considered today. The proponents and at the same time the users of the internet know that it is a duty to be vigilant against attackers within network. Cybersecurity is not something to be overlooked, it can somehow be challenging to manage but it will ensure that no entities will be able to infiltrate any system. The goal of this study was to be able to prevent unwanted contents to be accessed by a user and deliver a safe networking environment. It is quite difficult to assume whether a site is safe to visit or not. It is not advised to believe on anything that we see in the internet, whether it is in a form of a post, a message or even an advertisement that will try to persuade anyone into looking through it. It is better to protect important information that a user possesses from being stolen by attackers. The Raspberry Pi is a small computer device yet there are countless of possible projects can be developed using this device especially in regards to security. 497","college of computer studies angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines mr. ray a. nicolas - adviser faculty - college of computer studies angeles university foundation angeles city, philippines","References

78,Ecopacaya 4.0: An Innovation Augmented Reality Based  Application For Ecotourism And Scientific Tourism In The,"ecopacaya 4.0 is a tourism 4.0 project carried out by an eco-lodge located in the peruvian amazon. the eco- lodge has been on the market for more than fifteen years and owns a private reserve of one hundred and thirty hectares that shelters great biodiversity of flora and fauna. the project's objective was to facilitate the entry of the ecolodge into the “experience economy” by the creation of memorable experiences for its visitors through focused and innovative tourism products and services. in this sense, five themed routes called eco trails (ethnobotanical, mythological, fauna, worldview, and an interactive game) were developed to provide visitors with expert knowledge about the biodiversity and culture of the area. for this purpose, an intelligent platform was designed and implemented using industry 4.0 technologies such as augmented reality (ar), the internet of things (iot), and cloud computing. this platform allows visitors to experience the following through mobile devices: 1.) get automatic assistance on positioning while touring each eco trail. 2.) get an integrated view of digital information (virtual guides and characters) with the eco-lodge private reserve´s physical environment in real time. 3.) online connection of visitors with their social networks. this posed the great challenge of implementing a complex and efficient communications system to make it possible for such a remote and previously unconnected area to finally get integrated into the digital world. another achievement of the project is the biodiversity portal, a collaborative site that allows researchers, students, and academics to access qualified scientific information on the biodiversity of the area, thus facilitating their research efforts. finally, we highlight that we are currently in the process of packaging this experience not only to optimize its use in the ecolodge but also to expand its use to other environments.","tourism 4.0, industry 4.0, pacaya samiria, amazon jungle, augmented reality","ECOPACAYA 4.0 is the first platform of Tourism 4.0 in the Amazon jungle of Peru that includes an AR application, and a Biodiversity Portal, all supported by telecommunications infrastructure sustainable. It is an innovative and sustainable initiative that has the potential to revolutionize tourism in the region with a forward-thinking approach to tourism that prioritizes both the visitor experience and environmental conservation. The AR application provides visitors with an interactive and immersive experience of the Amazon jungle, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of the region's unique biodiversity. The Biodiversity Portal serves as a valuable resource for visitors, providing information about the region's flora and fauna and promoting sustainable tourism practices. The sustainable telecommunications infrastructure is an essential component of the platform, ensuring that visitors can stay connected and engaged while minimizing the environmental impact of their stay. By providing sustainable infrastructure, the platform helps to promote responsible tourism and minimize the negative impacts on the local environment. There are many exciting opportunities related to the implementation of the other Industry 4.0 technologies to enhance the tourist experience and develop new and engaging content with the creation of new AR experiences specifically designed for the unique environment and culture of the Amazon jungle of Peru. Always involving collaborations with local communities and stakeholders to ensure that the content is culturally appropriate and respectful. ECOPACAYA 4.0 can be integrated with other technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR), artificial intelligence, and machine learning to enhance the tourist experience. For example, tourists could use AR technology to scan plants and animals and receive real-time information about them using machine learning algorithms to create even more immersive and educational experiences. This could involve the development of long-term monitoring programs that track the impact of the technology over time and identify any potential negative effects that need to be addressed and could serve as a model for other regions that are interested in promoting sustainable tourism practices to reach a wider audience.

80,Factors Affecting The Level Of Trust Of Msmes In Using  Fintech Using The Technology Acceptance Model (Tam),"this study was conducted to determine the interest in using financial technology (fintech) peer to peer lending (p2p lending) in msmes. the model used is the technology acceptance model (tam) which is to see the successful application of information technology and the variables used are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust, and attitudes towards user interest in using financial technology (fintech) peer to peer lending (p2p lending). the data used in this study are primary data with the data collection method using a questionnaire. then the data analysis method used is sempls with the help of smartpls software. in this study, the number of samples or respondents who filled out and returned the questionnaire were 64 respondents. the results of this study indicate that perceived ease of use has a significant effect on perceived usefulness, perceived usefulness has a significant effect on trust, trust has a significant effect on attitude, and attitude has a significant effect on user interest. the finding in this study is that perceived ease of use does not have a significant effect on trust. suggestions for further research are to add variables not examined in this study such as security, risk, etc. and the findings in this study can be reviewed so that it can be seen whether they get the same or different results from this study.",,"Based on the results of the discussion regarding the factors that influence the level of MSME confidence in using fintech using the technology acceptance model (TAM), in this case it can be concluded that: 1. Hypothesis 1 testing shows that perceived ease of use has a positive effect on the perceived usefulness of p2p Lending Fintech. This shows that MSME users or activists view that Fintech which is easy to use will provide benefits or benefits to them as MSME actors. 2. Hypothesis 2 testing shows that perceived ease of use has a negative effect on trust in P2p Lending Fintech. This shows that MSME users or activists view that even though P2p Lending Fintech is easy to use, they have not been able to fully trust P2p Lending Fintech. 3. Hypothesis 3 testing shows that perceived usefulness has a positive effect on p2p Lending Fintech trust. This shows that MSME users or activists view that P2p Lending Fintech has provided benefits or benefits to them as MSME actors which also makes them believe in P2p Lending Fintech. 4. Hypothesis 4 testing shows that perceived ease of use has an effect on P2p Lending Fintech attitudes. This shows that MSME users or activists in P2p Lending Fintech feel the ease of using the system the first time they use it, so it creates a positive attitude towards the system. 5. Hypothesis 5 testing shows that trust has a positive effect on the attitude of P2P Lending Fintech. This shows that the trust of MSME users or activists in P2P Lending Fintech makes their behavior also change in a positive direction towards the existence of P2P Lending Fintech. The positive attitude in question is that they show a good attitude towards the presence of P2P Lending Fintech. 6. Hypothesis 6 testing shows that perceived usefulness has a negative effect on p2p Lending Fintech attitudes. This shows that MSME users or activists in P2p Lending Fintech do not want to use a technology because they feel that a system is not able to provide benefits and value for them. 7. Hypothesis 7 testing shows that perceived ease of use has a negative effect on interest in users of p2p Lending FinTech. This shows that MSME users or activists find it difficult to use the system so that users are reluctant to use the technology system, because they feel preoccupied with learning and it is difficult to use it. 8. Hypothesis 8 testing shows that attitude has a positive effect on interest in users of p2p Lending FinTech. This shows that the good attitude shown by MSME users or activists towards the presence of P2p Lending Fintech affects their interest. They become interested in continuing to use p2p Lending Fintech in the future. 9. Hypothesis 9 testing shows that perceived usefulness has a positive effect on interest in users of p2p Lending FinTech. This shows that MSME users or activists will have p2p Lending Fintech not provide benefits to them so that it will also affect the number of people who use the technology system.","suci ayu putri faculty of social humanities universitas bina darma, palembang, indonesia suciayuputri.43@gmail.com dewi sartika faculty of social humanities universitas bina darma, palembang, indonesia dewi.sartika@binadarma.ac.id muji gunarto faculty of social humanities universitas bina darma, palembang, indonesia mgunarto@binadarma.ac.id sulaiman helmi faculty of social humanities universitas bina darma, palembang, indonesia sulaimanhelmi@binadarma.ac.id",

84,Title: Gamification In Occupational Safety Training: A  Systematic Literature Review,"gamification is a new methodology that is used mainly in education and marketing, however, in recent years it has become more relevant in the training of personnel at a professional level. the objective of this literature review was to make a synthesis and analyze the cases of gamification implementation in training both at a professional level and at a level of student practices. the following review was based on the prisma model, studies were delimited by inclusion criteria, and finally, after discarding articles, 39 studies remained for analysis. the results of this investigation determined that gamification is an innovative way of training that promotes growth, the development of competences and teamwork. likewise, it was evidenced that gamification was implemented more in the field of medicine and there is a gap of knowledge of the implementation of gamification in other professional areas.","gamification, staff training, security, serious game","In conclusion, the proposed methodology allowed for the most relevant studies to be analyzed with the VOSviewer bibliometric manager. The analysis of key terms and their occurrence through bibliometric visualization enabled initial conclusions to be made on the main topics being addressed by research, such as nursing and medical practitioners. Conversely, it also revealed a knowledge gap in the area of industrial safety and risk at work that could be explored in future empirical research. Moreover, this study highlights the main tools currently used in the implementation of security gamification, indicating that virtual tools such as computer software or the use of virtual reality instruments predominate. Finally, the synthesis of the context and results of the literature determined which topics are currently covered by gamification. The study showed that gamification offers a new teaching modality that is more interactive and entertaining, encouraging the improvement and development of job skills through games and rewards. However, it was also noted that gamification does not always produce a good result and further research is needed. Studies suggest that gamification is a more attractive learning method that guarantees at least the same results as traditional training, but it is necessary to identify the staff to be tested, determine the most motivating incentives for this population, and design a plot that is didactic and intuitive. Overall, this research can serve as a basis for future studies on the implementation of gamification, its benefits, and limitations in personnel training.","cesar condori colan, daniel barco peralta, rafael villanueva flores, juan carlos morales gomero facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima, perú 20152856@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20160132@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, rvillan@ulima.edu.pe, jcmorale@ulima.edu.pe",
85,Prioritizing Fire Risk Criteria In Ready-Made Garments  Factories Of Bangladesh By Applying Critic Method,"the ready-made garments (rmg) industry of bangladesh is one of the renowned export-oriented garment industries in the world. several hazardous fire incidents at rmg factories in recent decades became a matter of concern for national and international policymakers as well as stakeholders. therefore, this study has been conducted to determine a prioritizing order of the fire risk factors of the rmg industry to assist decision-makers while implementing mitigation strategies. for this study, fire risk factors have been clustered into six criteria- causative factors, fire separation, egress obstruction, fire detection, fire protection, and egress lighting. then the fire safety inspection reports of randomly selected 50 rmg factories have been analyzed with a multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) approach, the criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (critic) method, to determine the objective weights of the selected criteria. the number of risk factors observed in each criterion during fire safety inspections at the rmg factories has been considered as the numerical input for the critic method. prioritization has been obtained with the descending order of the computed weights for the risk criteria. this study finds that ‘egress obstruction’, ‘causative factors’, and ‘fire separation’ are the most three weighted risk criteria by applying the critic method. this prioritization will be helpful for decision-makers when the hierarchical implementation of mitigation actions is necessary due to various managerial constraints. the result of this study is expected to aid the managers of rmg factories to be more specific and accurate in case of deciding in a challenging situation.","ready-made garment, fire risk criteria",,"md. mehedi hasan, md kamrul hasan chowdhury boiler safety engineering department, rmg sustainability council, dhaka, bangladesh email: mehedi.hasan@rsc-bd.org, kamrul.chowdhury@rsc-bd.org md. tanvir siraj, s.m. faysal ahmed, spandan basak payel department of mechanical engineering, bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka, bangladesh email: tanvir25392@gmail.com, smfaysalahmed@gmail.com, spandanbasak@gmail.com nazrul islam department of mechanical engineering, rajshahi university of engineering and technology, rajshahi, bangladesh email: shakilnazrul67@gmail.com debashis biswas department of electrical engineering, national institute of technology, silchar, india email: iitpeterson736@gmail.com",

89,Evaluation Of Indicators For Developing Supply Chain  Resilient In The Healthcare Industry Of Indonesia,"since covid-19 had been declared a global pandemic by the world health organization (who) on march 12, 2020, various policies have been made by governments around the world, one of which is a lockdown. this policy interrupts companies from being able to manufacture and distribute their products causing supply chain disruptions. the healthcare industry is one of the supply chains that has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. there are severe shortages of personal protective equipment (ppe) and other medical supplies for covid-19 treatment in hospitals around the world. one of the countries that experienced a disruption in the healthcare supply chain was indonesia, due to its dependence on medical supplies from other countries, there was a ban on exports during the lockdown. it is important to adopt supply chain resilience (scr) because of the dependencies in the supply chain. when scr is adopted, a key performance indicator (kpi) is required as a tool to monitor and measure supply chain resilience performance. in this study, the indicators collected from the literature review, there are 9 indicators which are: security, knowledge management, visibility, risk management, collaboration, agility, flexibility, redundancy, market position, and 42 sub-indicators for supply chain resilience. afterward, the indicators and sub-indicators were validated by several experts by filling out questionnaires. using modified kappa (k*) for validation, eight healthcare experts validated 41 sub-indicators with a value of k* is more than 0.60.","indicator, modified kappa, healthcare","Studies on supply chain resilience have grown over the years, with stakeholders showing interest in the concept because of its impact on business continuity and competitiveness. Designing supply chain resilience to cope with long- term disruptions, such as a pandemic, is essential because it can maintain demand fulfillment performance and costs. This research shows that the healthcare industry in Indonesia is still vulnerable to disruptions, this can be shown when there is a pandemic, the healthcare industry in Indonesia it is difficult to meet the demand for medical supplies such as PPE and medical devices (ventilators, tensimeters, and thermometers). Therefore, indicators are needed as performance measures to build a resilient supply chain. In this study, 9 indicators and 41 indicators were validated by healthcare industry experts using modified kappa, with the results shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. This research aims to enable stakeholders in their field to monitor and measure supply chain performance in developing supply chain resilience. Clearly, this study has some limitations. While this research only discusses SCR indicators collected from previous research and relevant to the healthcare industry in Indonesia, there is no research to determine the level of importance between indicators and the relationship between indicators. In addition, this study only focuses on medical supplies such as consumables and medical equipment, not pharmaceuticals. Future research should be aimed at determining the level of importance between indicators and the relationship between indicators, and this research should also focus on the pharmaceutical sector.","meitreya taris department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, jawa barat 16424, indonesia meitreya.taris11@ui.ac.id romadhani ardi faculty member, department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, university of indonesia depok, jawa barat 16424, indonesia romadhani.ardi@ui.ac.id",

The three types of processes were identified: operational, strategic, and support, through interviews, the PMBOK model, adapted to a project management company. Likewise, the stakeholders of ADEICS association were identified. The As-Is diagram of the identified processes was mapped and designed, using the SIPOC matrix, the DLN, and the FMEA. The processes to be improved were identified using the QFD Matrix, selecting the three processes to be improved: Execution, Ideation and Design, and Permission Management. Finally, improvement actions were proposed for the three selected processes, remaining their scheduling and prioritization with management. Likewise, we recommended including the Quality Management and Internal Review process to the current Process Map of the organization. We recommend implementing these improvement actions in the short term to measure the positive impact in the control phase of the satisfaction level expressed through the CTQs, achieving that all gaps are less than 5%. Lastly, we recommend that all companies and associations in the civil construction sector adopt these best practices of quality management in their organizations. 796","alberto julian, fabiana retamozo, kendra bernal, jean pierre santillan, carmen alvarez and alejandro gallegos department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of engineering and technology barranco, lima, perú alberto.julian@utec.edu.pe, fabiana.retamozo@utec.edu.pe, kendra.bernal@utec.edu.pe, jean.santillan@utec.edu.pe, carmen.alvarez@utec.edu.pe, agallegos@utec.edu.pe","References
