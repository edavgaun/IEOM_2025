7,Warehouse Selection In Supply Chain Network Design  Based On Multi Cog Clustering And Mcdm,"when it comes to improving logistic operations, the placement of a warehouse is generally one of the most important and strategic considerations. a single warehouse site will not be able to match the requirements of rapid delivery for customers distributed across a large area. as a result, the multi-cog model (multiple warehouse locations) is necessary. a warehouse's location is a long-term choice based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors. to account for a variety of considerations in warehouse selection, a two-stage strategy is provided. the first part of this work involves doing macro analysis for various warehouse locations using clustering methods, with the number of warehouses determined based on the within cluster sum of squares (wcss). in the second stage for phase-by-phase dissertation planning of warehouse are selected based on two multiple criteria decision making (mcdm) methods, weighted aggregated sum product assessment (waspas) and analytical hierarchical process (ahp), has been compared on five criteria: warehouse cost per m2, infrastructure access, number of customers, delivery time, quantity of sales. with over 650 delivery sites, four warehouses were chosen and a two-phase warehouse implementation strategy outlined.","warehouse location, multi–cog, wcss","In this study, we suggested a two-stage macro and micro analysis technique that incorporates both data-driven judgments and many criteria to evaluate; the core goal of quick delivery may also be reached using this methodology. K Means clustering and WCSS methods aid in mapping which customers should be serviced from which warehouse, resulting in faster delivery and lower transportation costs. In this process, not only sales locations are selected for analysis, but the weights of the quantity of product to be delivered are also attached, allowing warehouse locations to be set closer to the higher density of quantity sold and a shorter distance to be travelled. The applicability of the MCDM methodology was also demonstrated in the second stage of microanalysis, AHP and WASPAS methods were used for phase-wise implementation of warehouse site selection based on the warehouses identified in stage 1 of macro analysis. This stage has aided decision-makers to take an account for customer preferences in order to accomplish express delivery as soon as feasible when implementing the chosen warehouses. The further scope of research is possible in selecting the number of warehouses in terms of cost as well i.e., as supply chain consist of Primary transportation cost which is the cost needed to transport goods to warehouses, warehousing cost which is the, cost needed to run warehouse, a storing cost and capital expenditure needed to start warehouses and secondary transportation cost which is the cost to deliver to the customer.","smit parekh and dr. d. n. raut masters of technology research scholar, production engineering veermata jijabai technological institute, mumbai, india smitparekh502@gmail.com, dnraut@pe.vjti.ac.in",

17,Development Of Risk Assessment Framework Based On  Perspectives Of Technical Staff In Power Distribution,"the fundamental goal of this article, which investigates the working circumstances of technical personnel at a power distribution company, is to determine the level of danger they face when working in various conditions. the multi- grade fuzzy technique was used in this investigation. the assessment will assist the distribution company in determining the level of risk that their technical personnel face, identifying strong and weak traits, and making appropriate improvement recommendations. the final risk index is calculated as 7.01, which indicates that the risk level of the case electric power distribution company is “high risk”. the study was further extended to identify the weaker attributes using importance performance analysis (ipa). medical support provided by the organization and financial aid to the employees in case of an accident are considered weaker attributes of the case power distribution company. the results of the study would help the managers of the company to analyze the current risk level of the company and to focus on their weaker attributes to make necessary improvements in the working pattern and implement new innovative methods that help to reduce the risk level of workers and provide them with a safer environment.","risk assessment, risk perception, multi-grade fuzzy",Power distribution is an integral part of modern society and its use and application will be increasing in the near future. This is also a field that has workplace risks that lead to many accidents that cause casualties and injuries. The proposed study would help the top-level management of the distribution company to analyze their position in providing safety to workers and identify those fields in which they are lacking proper attention and need improvement. The study uses an approach named the multi-grade fuzzy approach and the case study was conducted at ABC Distribution Company. It has been found that the risk level of the firm comes under the category of “High Risk”. The study also included an IPA which helps to identify the weaker attributes of the firm.,"companies: a case study ajay prakash and m. suresh amrita school of business, coimbatore amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, india ajayprakashajay1996@gmail.com; m_suresh@cb.amrita.edu; drsureshcontact@gmail.com",
18,Effect Of Public Financial Management On Foreign Debt  Accumulation: An Empirical Investigation Into The,"emerging markets developing economies (emde) rely on sovereign external debt to meet their financial needs and to enhance the economic growth. however, a high level of external indebtedness and its mismanagement can harm the economic performance, which outlines the importance of the objective of any operation of fund raising. these countries tend to accumulate significant levels of debts. this paper investigates the factors contributing in debt accumulation in case of morocco, which is an emerging economy, using annual data over the last two decades. a certain determinants of external debt buildup identified by the literature are examined using ardl approach to co- integration. the findings affirm the relationship between the level of external debt and the explanatory variables both in long and short run. nevertheless, the nexuses are statistically insignificant. the granger causality test that was conducted on the model variables reveals a bidirectional cause between external debt and exchange rate. furthermore, the regulatory quality is the only variable among institutional variables which is caused by foreign borrowing.","foreign debt, debt threshold, exchange rate","This paper investigates the factors contributing in public external debt buildup in case of Morocco from 2000 to 2020. The study utilized the ARDL bounds test approach to co-integration. The results reveal that public external debt accumulation in Morocco is determined in long run by domestic savings, exchange rate, public expenses, debt service, current account balances, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and voice and accountability. The empirical results show that debt service, exchange rate, expenses, governance effectiveness and regulatory quality have an insignificant and positive impact on external debt buildup in long run. The insignificant and negative effect is depicted in the relationships of debt surge with savings, current account balances, voice and accountability and rule of law in the long term. These findings suggest that the sovereign external debt is maintained at low levels and government’s policies do not rely mainly on external debt, which can prevent the economy from the vulnerabilities associated to international fund raising. This study is limited to the interaction between government policies and external debt accumulation, without assessing the impact of financing the public sector through overseas borrowing and its costs on the Moroccan economic performance which can be investigated in another study.","determinants of moroccan indebtedness fatima-ezzahra rafie and mostafa lekhal university research laboratory in instrumentation and organizational management (lurigor) faculty of law, economics and social sciences mohamed first university, oujda, morocco fatima-ezzahra.rafie@ump.ac.ma, mostafa.lekhal@ump.ac.ma",

The level of enthusiasm and involvement the employee has towards his/her work is called employee engagement. The employee engagement assessment is constructed by using a multi-grade fuzzy approach, and IPA is used to identify the weak attributes. In order to improve weaker attributes and to gain a competitive advantage, suggestions are provided as well. This study categorizes the case-SDP organization as “moderately engaged” but there are chances to achieve the “extremely engaged” category level. The assessment framework can be further explored by incorporating additional employee engagement attributes specific to the project's location and work environment.","vaisali k.s and m. suresh amrita school of business coimbatore, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, india vaisaliksmi@gmail.com; m_suresh@cb.amrita.edu; drsureshcontact@gmail.com",

Charith","nowadays parking of a car has become a great issue in these metropolitan cities. smart parking systems, when implemented correctly, can significantly alleviate many of the difficulties associated with traffic congestion in urban areas. many modern parking systems will have a fundamental section of empty parking slot detection. this paper mainly concentrates on smart parking system based on image processing which is developed for open parking plots and many more. it is proposed as an acquisition to new evolving technology by using python programming and opencv tools library such as haar classifier. using edge detention and coordinate constrained pixel portions, it is possible to detect unoccupied parking spaces using photos of the parking lot. edge detection helps in many ways in processing the image by noise reduction, locating the intensity gradient in the image, non-maximum suppression and hysteresis threshold. in the other section, a digital image consists of columns and rows of pixels. a pixel in a particular image can be identified by determining which column and row it belongs to. the graphic system would then transform the image coordinates into pixel coordinates.","smart parking, edge detection, threshold, open cv","The parking spot identification is the primary section of the smart parking system. This can be accomplished by placing sensors throughout the parking lot. However, this is an extremely expensive system with numerous flaws. The technology is simple and inexpensive thanks to image processing-based vacant parking lot recognition. For empty slot recognition, all that can be done now is use the photographs from the parking lot CCTV camera. An OpenCV-based solution will power future smart parking systems. The accuracy of detection can be increased by using appropriate image processing methods.","department of electronics and communication engineering, velagapudi ramakrishna siddhartha engineering college, vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india, yenigalla.neha805@gmail.com , vsaritha@vrsiddhartha.ac.in, samyukthanaga1@gmail.com, gayathribanavathu999@gmail.com , annecharith20@gmail.com",

26,Designing And Computing The Generalized Process  Capability Indices Under Neutrosophic Set,"process capability indices (pcis) such as p c and pk c are commonly used measures to evaluate a manufacturing processes performance. the validity of these measures is based on that quality characteristics data under evaluation is normality distributed and the manufacturing process in under statistical control. the p c measure considers the process data is centering the specification band. however, it lacks to evaluate a process off-centering the given specification band. the pk c measure which is 2nd generation considers the off-centering issue of any process being evaluated for its performance. addressing the indeterminate and incomplete information about the different specification limits (sls), the process capability indices p c and pk c is designed under the neutrosophic fuzzy environment. the neutrosophic fuzzy sls contains three different aspects of membership degrees such as truth, indeterminacy, and falsity degrees which is more flexible to the fuzzy based approaches. furthermore, the proposed neutrosophic pcis p c and pk c is implemented on the rubber parts manufacturing company. the results show the more reliable values of pcis while dealing with the indeterminacy degree present in the sls. the wide range of getting different sls is also benchmark findings of the proposed neutrosophic pcis study. the conclusions and future work scope is also furnished in an efficient manner.",process monitoring,"Process capability analysis (PCA) is very important and integral part of the manufacturing system to timely monitor the processes. For the PCA, various statistical based measures are available which are capable to analyze the processes. The PCIs such as p C and pk C are the most commonly used methods which are available in the literature. The presented study discusses the PCIs under the NSs environment dealing with the uncertainty and incomplete information more accurately and efficiently. The NSs is the generalization and extension of the traditional fuzzy sets. It contains the three different forms of assessing the uncertainty such as independency truth, indeterminacy and falsity functions that enhance the capability of the processes related to the uncertain model. Most often, it seems that the quality engineer may not have the enough ideas or complete information for making the perfect and fruitful decisions. For instance, if the quality engineer shares the views or opinion with 0.4, 0.8, 0.2 as true, indeterminacy, and falsity value, respectively then only the NSs can be successfully used to tackle this situation. On analyzing the literature on PCAs, it is found that the use of the conventional fuzzy set is discussed tremendously and a narrow part of the literature or the research work is dedicated to the NSs uncertainty. Therefore, this research fills this gap and led to a concrete base for PCAs under NSs. 1.05 1.1 1.15 1.2 Case - I Case II Case - I Case II PCIs Proposed Approach Yalcin S. & Kaya I.

27,Adaptive Real-Time Scheduler For Embedded Operating  System,"in cpu scheduling the classical problem of real-time and time-sharing operating systems is to schedule a sequence of jobs; the only given information, in this case, is the processing and completion time of the particular processes. all the previous scheduling algorithms focused on the system-level abstraction for the scheduling decision functions or the functions which implement them. in this research, a new scheduling algorithm, an adaptive multi-level queue scheduling, will maximise the cpu utilisation and cater to the energy efficiency of the embedded system. this scheduling algorithm can adapt to the environment. the scheduling algorithm will be helpful in the embedded devices which are using a fixed battery. the scheduler combines various types of well-established scheduling algorithms like – round-robin, priority (pre-emptive) and multi-level queue feedback algorithms. the adaptive feature incorporates a sleeping function in the scheduling algorithm which helps in the system energy optimisation.","scheduling, round-robin","The main contributions made in this study are - A detailed survey of the domain and various scheduling algorithms related to the field has been done. Proposing a novel adaptive scheduling algorithm which not only efficient in scheduling but also battery and power-efficient. Algorithms of the following implementations are stated under section 3.4. The implementation of the Algorithm developed was done and compared with the existing Algorithm, Early Deadline First. It has been observed that the CPU utilisation was less in the proposed algorithm of the Adaptive Real-time Scheduling algorithm compared to EDF. Also, the sleep function successfully helped delay the lower priority processes, which increased the average waiting time and average turnaround time.

28,Lddnet: An Efficient Neural Network Model For Plant Leaf  Diseases Detection,"the agricultural sector has a prominent role in contributing to the economy of many countries. over the decades, production in the agricultural sector has decreased due to various factors such as leaf diseases, an overdose of chemical medication, natural disasters, and climatic changes. majorly, the impact of plant diseases set a huge loss to the farmers compared to other kinds. consulting an expert is a time taking and expensive process. many machine learning and advanced deep learning algorithms are being implemented to identify diseases, more accurately, using the infected plant leaf image. the objective of this paper is to introduce a lightweight leaf disease detection neural network (lddnet) that should be able to distinguish between diseased and healthy plants. the dataset contains 33 classes of different diseased and healthy plant leaves images, where each class has 1,680 training and 420 validating images. the accuracy obtained by the proposed lddnet model is 99.30%. since the performance of the model is high, it can be implemented in daily life to monitor plant diseases to have a healthy crop yielding.","classification, data augmentation, fungi","Accurate classification of plant leaf disease is very essential to look for plants and soil health. The proposed novel architecture, LDDNet, can identify 24 different plant leaf diseases and 9 healthy plants with an accuracy of 99.30%. The model performs better than many other existing deep neural networks in the area of plant leaf disease detection in terms of accurate detection. LDDNet is extended further by developing a web application so users can access it easily at any time. This project can further be expanded by adding different diagnosis techniques along with the authorized purchasing links in the web application to buy organic products that slow down the rapid spread. Since the study on LDDNet shows that it is efficient enough to detect unseen data successfully, farmers can implement this model in daily life for monitoring crop health, thereby reducing unnecessary costs for detecting plant diseases.","neelesh janga, l. uma maheswari, n. n. v. d nikitha and harshith posani department of electronics and communication engineering velagapudi ramakrishna siddhartha engineering college, vijayawada, india janganeelesh7@gmail.com, lakkojuu@gmail.com, nikithanerella459@gmail.com, harshithposani16@gmail.com m. bhagya lakshmi department of electronics and communication engineering vallurupalli nageswara rao vignana jyothi institute of engineering and technology bhagyalakshmi_m@vnrvjiet.in",
29,Application For Stochastic Net Present Value (Npv)  Estimation And Sensitivity Analysis,"net present value (npv) is an important financial metric for the purposes of accepting or rejecting projects in the corporate environment. the authors advocate limited free npv applications available to the management and commerce student or the corporate finance practitioner. the proposed application enables the analysis of npv when factors such as cost of goods sold to sales ratio; capital expenditure to sales ratio; selling, general and administrative expense to sales ratio; sales growth rate, depreciation to sales ratio are available as inputs. further, the parameters like corporate tax rate with number of years until constant growth and firm risk level proxied by the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) are deemed available as inputs for the simulation. the approximate run-time for 5,000 simulations is less than one minute. several useful outputs can be derived by the simulation of the proposed application. first, a graph of each of the distributions pertaining to the input variables is displayed. the user can select the type of distribution for each input variables, namely: normal distribution, triangular distribution and uniform distribution. in addition, a base case npv is also computed for a set of base case input variables. by virtue of the attained cumulative probability npv diagram, user can determine the probability whether npv is less than or equal to a certain value. in addition, a sensitivity table is provided in the proposed application which displays the impact of input variables in the descending order based on the attained stochastic npv results.","corporate finance, wacc","The NPV pdf is a normal distributional though the underlying Input Variables have different types of distributions, ranging from Normal to Triangular to Uniform. Our paper is different from prior work in NPV calculation under Uncertainty e.g., Gaspars-Wieloch, H. (2019), who modeled NPV under Scenario based optimistic and pessimistic coefficients. The Ranges of the Input Variable are selected by the user, and future development should focus on the detection of the type of distribution from historical information. From Table 2 and Figure 9, it is clear that the WACC % has the highest impact on the NPV fluctuation while the CA-CL to Sales % has the least impact on NPV fluctuation. Sales growth%, TY Growth % have high impact while COGS/Sales %, Depr/Sales % and Capex to Sales % have lower impact on NPV fluctuation.","uday k. jagannathan and k.m. sharath kumar faculty of management and commerce m.s. ramaiah university of applied sciences, bangalore, india ujagannathan.ms.mc@msruas.ac.in, dean.mc@msruas.ac.in",
30,Improving Order Quantity Of Retailers In Rural Market A  Case Of Bit Haat,"“haat” is a periodic rural market in india that often occurs once or twice a week. since time, haat has fulfilled the daily basic requirements of rural india. indian haats have been facing several challenges over the years. this study first aimed at understanding the primary challenges faced by the rural retailers in haat. this is done by surveying a local haat, famous as “bit haat” located at the mesra village near ranchi, jharkhand, india. initial discussion with the retailers revealed that significant portions of the retailers are poor and do not have high buying capacity. their profit margin fluctuates with the increased demand variability of the market. thus, often it became difficult for them to estimate the order quantity of various perishable items. in this work, the optimal order quantity of various perishable vegetables are first calculated by using newsvendor model. however, the market restrictions often does not allow the retailers to buy the exact amount suggested by the newsvendor model. hence, a sensitivity analysis procedure is applied to compare among the newsvendor model based demand profit, present profit, and a profit on the next feasible order quantity based upon the suggestion of the newsvendor model. it is observed that, the change in order quantity provides beneficial result in increasing the average profit of the retailer in many of the items.","newsvendor model, rural market, haat","This study identifies suitable order quantities of various items, which stabilizes the profit for a retailer who sells perishable items, a significant challenge in the rural market. It considers the case of a local Haat, where rural retailers sell vegetables and other household necessary items. The rural vegetable seller considered in this study has low buying power. Hence, the order quantity of various vegetables is limited. Thus, arbitrary increments of order quantities are not feasible and suitable for these sellers. This study thoroughly examines the demand variation and order quantities of a local vegetable seller in Haat and tries to develop a methodology to determine a suitable order quantity for each item sold by a rural vegetable seller. At first newsvendor model is applied to identify which item requires possible increment or decrement in order quantity. Then the next possible order quantity is selected as a candidate for the modified order quantity. Then several random demands are generated to compare the average profit for the present order quantity and adjusted order quantity to justify if the modified order quantity is feasible in increasing profit for the retailer. The result based on the case study suggests that, in some cases, though the newsvendor model suggested a change in order quantity, the sensitivity analysis does not guarantee a possible profit increment, whereas in some cases sensitivity analysis confirms the result direction of the newsvendor model. It is worthwhile to discuss here that the study was performed under a certain seasonal period, and hence the study is limited by the available vegetables and their demands during that season only. In addition, it is observed that the quality of the vegetables, which they buy in bulk quantity from the wholesale market, varies each day. This study considers this variability as constant. There are several possibilities of future studies found while observing the rural market. Firstly, it was observed that the demand of many vegetables depend upon the selling price. It will be interesting study if the demand can be represented as function of selling price of a vegetable, and then calculate the optimal order quantity of the vegetables. Secondly, the price change of a vegetable highly depends upon quality. More or less each retailers provide price discounts if purchased at higher quantity. Thus determining selling price as a stochastic function rather than a simple variable would also be a very interesting future scope of this study. Thirdly, this paper only depicts as a the condition of a single retailer within the “Haat”. It will be very interesting to carry out a complete study considering total selling of various vegetables by most (if not all) of the retailers to understand the buying behavior of the people of the entire population who avails the market.","suman samanta, ajay bansal, devansh kumar, rishi raj, sushant raj and joyjeet ghose associate professor and head, department of production and industrial engineering birla institute of technology mesra, ranchi, jharkhand, india suman_samanta2003@yahoo.com, joyjeet@bitmesra.ac.in",

This shows that academics have started to recognize the importance of artificial intelligence in the development of start-up operations. The advantages are especially rewarding for a start- up because they typically have scarce resources, so any chance to digitize, enhance, standardize, and relieve the work process is greatly appreciated. Artificial intelligence-powered inventive remedies offer precise, insightful information about customer wants and needs, enabling these rapidly growing start-ups to rapidly make transformations to their established portfolio of products and services or create new ones that meet customer anticipations. Evidently, wiser start-ups that adopt artificial intelligence-led advancement will be able to react to upcoming events in a fast and effective manner while not impeding their expansion procedure. The discovery of numerous viewpoints linked to the phenomenon, as well as the application of AI to other service sectors, are two potential research paths that will necessitate creative effort from relevant study practitioners and academicians.

34,Corporate Social Responsibility As A Customer Retention  Strategy In The Coffee Shop Industry In India,"this study investigates the impact of customers' perceptions of multidimensional corporate social responsibility (philanthropic, ethical, legal, and economic) on coffee shop customer retention, which examines the case of starbucks in india. the findings show that economic csr, ethical csr, and philanthropic csr are all important contributors to enhanced brand attitude and service quality, according to pls structural equation modelling of 300 survey responses. client retention improved as a result of the relationships. the current study contributes to a broader understanding of csr strategy in the coffee shop business, as well as valuable insights into the same, by revealing how various csr actions impact customers' views of brand attitude, service quality, and customer retention.",customer retention,"In this research, we attempted to make sense of the impact of coffeehouse industry CSR on consumer retention. Other important perspectives in developing customer retention (such as brand attitude, service quality, and consumer happiness) were also incorporated as intervening elements into the proposed hypothetical framework. On account of café chains, scholarly writing has for the most part disregarded experimental exploration on CSR and its connection to development factors affecting visitors' post-buy conduct. The reasonable system used in this study provides useful insight into the influence of CSR on the customer retention process in the coffeehouse industry. Our applied model properly depicted the variability of client retention in the café industry. As a bridge, the effect of brand attitude, service quality, and consumer enjoyment was evaluated. The current study goes above and beyond by integrating the several components of corporate social responsibility, brand attitude, service quality, and customer pleasure in the coffeehouse business into a single applicable system.","richa goel and tilottama singh amity international business school amity university uttar pradesh, india rgoel@amity.edu, tsingh6@amity.edu supriya lamba sahdev assistant professor, amity international business school amity university uttar pradesh, india lamba.supriya9@gmail.com sukanta kumar baral professor, department of commerce, faculty of commerce & management indra gandhi national tribal university, madhya pradesh, india sukanta.baral@igntu.ac.in miranda saikia and vansh garg graduate student, amity international business school amity university uttar pradesh, india mirandasaika@gmail.com, vansh.garg1@s.amity.edu",
35,Using Deep Learning For Protecting Security On Online  Social Network: A Comprehensive Study And New,"online social networks (osns) have gained a lot of popularity in the past few years. the capacity of osns to provide a way for users to interact with their peers is the driving force behind this phenomenon. social media sites like facebook, twitter, and instagram have recently become an inextricable part of our everyday lives. information sharing raises many security and privacy problems, in cases where users upload personal material such as photographs, videos, and audio. an attacker can take advantage of shared data for malevolent purposes. in the case of children, the risks are much higher. this study examines numerous risks associated with osn and also possible ways that can secure social network users to address these issues. the research will also prove that dl is a viable and scalable approach for osn's state-of-the-art pps by using a deep neural network for identifying potential threats. the framework proposed in the chapter helps identify features related to attacks on online social networks, determine the relevant policies, scan networks, and create subnetwork anomaly nodes. it’s a continuous process to perform retrospective analysis and help improve models by adjusting parameters. using deep learning algorithms, attributes are classified and stored in a secure database. this repository is used in detecting attacks on online social networks and taking the most appropriate actions. finally, it identifies several unresolved concerns and obstacles that now impede real-world implementation and suggests future paths for achieving trustworthiness in online social networks along this dimension. 270",,,"perspectives tilottama singh assistant professor, amity international business school amity university uttar pradesh, india tsingh6@amity.edu sukanta kumar baral professor, department of commerce, faculty of commerce & management indra gandhi national tribal university, madhya pradesh, india sukanta.baral@igntu.ac.in richa goel assistant professor, amity international business school amity university uttar pradesh, india rgoel@amity.edu supriya lamba sahdev assistant professor, amity international business school amity university uttar pradesh, india lamba.supriya9@gmail.com yashika garg graduate student, amity international business school amity university uttar pradesh, india yashika.garg@s.amity.edu","References

So, by choosing Aluminium Alloy 2024 and Phosphor Bronze as material for the manufacturing of piston the life span and efficiency of piston can be improved. The total deformation occurred for a phosphor bronze piston is very less i.e., 0.35mm and the deformation for Aluminium Alloy 2024 is 0.52mm. The factor of safety of Phosphor Bronze piston obtained is 7.28 and the factor of safety of Aluminium Alloy 2024 is 7.20. Hence by using Phosphor Bronze or Aluminium Alloy 2024 the efficiency of piston can be improved.

38,Design And Analysis Of Subsea Skid For Component  Deployment Under Various Loading Conditions,"when subsea equipment (meg filter and back pressure regulator) is damaged, the overall system is need to retrieved and taken to the offshore rig platform for replacement of subsea equipment. this process usually takes 72-96 hours. during the removal of subsea equipment, the process is disrupted and removal of subsea equipment using conventional retrieval tools is difficult due to absence of lifting arrangements and the tools may damage. moreover, the process is need to stopped during retrieval. to get the better of these difficulties and reduce the breakdown time of production, a special subsea skid for component deployment frame is designed. the sscd frame carries the subsea components like back pressure regulator and meg filter from offshore rig to the sea bed where the production process is going on. the main aim of this study is to analyze the sscd frame for structural stability under various loading conditions. the time required to replace the damaged component with new component is 3 to 4 hours by this sscd frame. the components are manipulated with the help of remote operated vehicles (rovs). thus, with the help of this frame the components can be safely deployed to the production system with minimum time, cost & damage.","subsea, offshore rig, meg filter","The study on the SSCD frame which is used for deploying the Subsea Equipment led to the following conclusions:  The SSCD frame is checked for Structural stability under various loading conditions. In each case, the stress induced is less than the material strength which is indicated with the bottom colours in the coloured bar in analysis figures. Hence the design of SSCD frame is safe.  Since, the stresses induced are within the safe limit, we conclude that the SSCD frame can safely carry the two components from the Offshore rig to the Production system under the sea.  As discussed before conventional retrieval process usually takes 74 to 92 hours. Now, by using the SSCD Frame the retrieval process takes 4 to 5 hours.  The production process needs to be stopped until the maintenance work is completed, this increases the production cost. As the retrieval process time is less with the help of SSCD Frame, the cost can be reduced.","mindi jagadeesh mouli, patimeeda kumar swamy, mylapilli manohar, chevvakula lokesh and k. leela kumar department of mechanical engineering vignan’s institute of information technology, visakhapatnam, india mouli7332@gmail.com, kumarachary55555@gmail.com, myllapillimanohar@gmail.com, lokeshchevvakula7995@gmail.com, leelamech36@gmail.com",

Also, the stepwise solution of the present work would be beneficial as per an aspect of time and reducing complexity for designing the gearbox. The ray diagrams are used to make the design more feasible concerning the number of teeth used in gearbox and transmission ratio. The analysis shows that the gearbox can carry maximum stresses and deformation under the safety zone.

45,Static Structural Analysis Of Composite Leaf Spring Under  Dynamic Loads,"due to the excellent strength and stiffness to weight ratio, composite materials are widely used in many technical applications. the goal is to compare the stresses, deformations, and weight savings of steel and composite leaf springs. stiffness is a design restriction. because composite materials have a high strength-to-weight ratio and strong corrosion resistance, the automobile industry is very interested in replacing steel leaf springs with composite leaf springs. when compared to standard steel, the material chosen was glass fibre reinforced polymer (e-glass/epoxy). the design parameters were chosen and examined with the goal of reducing the composite leaf spring's weight in comparison to the steel leaf spring. steel replacement is a hot topic in the automotive industry.and also glass fibre reinforced polymer (e- glass/epoxy) was chosen as a replacement for traditional steel. the design parameters were chosen and examined with the goal of reducing the composite leaf spring's weight in comparison to the steel leaf spring. the automobile industry is very interested in steel replacement.","automobile, compositematerial, e-glass epoxy, stiffness","1. Total deformation,equivalent elastic strain,equivalentstress,strainenergy,and mass results have been analysed for various material combinations in various leaf spring design cases. 2. For each design case, a static analysis of the leaf spring was performed using different material combinations under similar loading conditions. 3. For all leaf spring design cases, results for selected parameters are obtained. 4. The results are examined for the five parameters listed above. Design case D2 has been determined to be optimal for total deformation, equivalent elastic strain, equivalent (Von-Mises) stress, strain energy, and mass optimization. 5. For meshing and analysis of leaf springs, ANSYS 14.0 is used.

46,Design And Analysis Of Reinforcement Pad At Nozzle  Junction On Pressure Vessel,"the goal is to learn more about how a geometric gap between a cylindrical or spherical shell and a reinforcing pad influences stress intensity at the nozzle penetration while the pressure vessel is under internal pressure. in a number of tanks, pressure vessels, and other vessels, nozzles serve as the input and outflow for process and cooling fluid. various applications such as heat exchangers to make the nozzle hole in the shell, the shell strength may be lowered. to boost strength and prevent failure, a reinforcement pad is used at the nozzle junction. as a result, the shell nozzle. a multitude of factors are considered when determining whether or not a pad is necessary at the junction. if a pad is needed, the thickness and diameter are estimated using asme standards. the stress created at the junction is also calculated using a finite element analysis (fea) of the junction. the magnitudes and distributions of the local stresses induced by the geometric discontinuity and internal pressure loading are thus uncertain. for a variety of reasons, perfect contact between the shell and the pad cannot be maintained, resulting in a gap. the effect of the gap on the stresses in the nozzle reinforcement region is of interest to both designers and manufacturers.","shell, pressure vessel, reinforcement pad","A pressure vessel's Design Pressure, Design Temperature and component dimension are all designed according to ASME pressure vessel specifications. Under various loads, the pressure vessel's Reinforcement pads, shell, Blind Flange and Shell junction area were examined using FEA and ASME methodologies. The material's allowable stress is less than the stress equivalent and pressure vessel component stress classification lines. The analysis conclusions for the normal operating state were within acceptable bounds. As a consequence, the current Reinforcement pads, shell, Blind Flange and Shell junction area designs are capable of sustaining the desired load conditions. The pressure vessels are designed to be safe. The level of safety that we consider acceptable and by which we judge the design to be safe. The bursting pressure is below the design's permissible stress, ensuring that it does not fail. And because the analysis is so near to the analytical design, both the data and the design are regarded safe. In addition, no pressure vessel failures have occurred. By incorporating the RF pad the von-mises stresses are reduced by 27.49%, Total deformation are reduced by 6.17%, Equivalent elastic strain has been reduced by 29.66%.","ajay teja denduluri, sivasai varunraj dunna, harsha chandan prasada, sai chandu kuncha and sundara ramam rapeta department of mechanical engineering vignan’s institute of information technology, visakhapatnam, india ajayteja2000@gmail.com, sivasaivarunrajdunna@gmail.com, harshachandan06@gmail.com, saichandukuncha1@gmail.com, sundar.ramam@gmail.com",

The aluminium alloy and egg-shell powder composites were successfully fabricated by stir casting with different compositions like (0%, 3%, 5% , 7%, 9%, 11%, 13%) of egg- shell powder. The rise in impact strength value upon increasing the percentage quality of egg-shell shell powder upto 5% and decreases if further egg-shell powder is added. Increment in the tensile strength has been observed but only up to a certain extent i.e, beyond 5% egg-shell Shell powder, there is a substantial reduction in the tensile strength. The hardness of composite depends upon the hardness of the reinforcement and matrix. The mixing of egg-shell powder less than 5% attains more tensile strength and hardness values. On comparing the impact strength from it shows that 3% - 5% of reinforcement of egg-shell powder has good effectiveness of impact strength. In the density there is constant decrease in the density as the wt% of egg-shell powder increases. Even though the trends in the various tests suggest that Al6061 alloy reinforced with egg-shell is not the way forward, its still serves as a better replacement that non reinforced Al6061 alloy. Egg-shell powder can thus be said to have a bright future to function as a supplementing reinforcement for the production of low-cost high performance aluminium hybrid composites.","shajed ali department of mechanical engineering, vignan’s institute of information technology, visakhapatnam, india mbhanup.123@gmail.com, bhargavmadisa2000@gmail.com, ratnaprasadpampana@gmail.com, shajedali236@gmail.com",

53,Exploring The Critical Success Factors (Csfs) And Barriers  To Adoption Of Icts In Corporate Financial Services,"information and communication technologies (icts) are extensively being incorporated by financial institutions, operating in both the public and private sectors. icts refer to a wide range of it-enabled technologies to manage electronic information quickly and effectively, thus giving a competitive edge to the organizations to compete in the global markets. however, proper implementation of icts in corporate financial services is still challenging with different barriers. the paper attempts to develop a theoretical model by identifying the various critical success factors (csfs) and barriers through an exhaustive and state-of-the-art review of the existing literature to adopt icts in corporate financial services successfully. the developed theoretical model is empirically investigated using in- depth interviews with employees working in corporate financial services. the regression results showed that social influence, effort expectancy, risk-taking, and top management support significantly influence the ict adoption. alternatively, lack of it skills, lack of socio-economic conditions with ict adoption, and the lack of environmental exposures are barriers to successful ict adoption.","icts adoption, retrieval","The goal of this research was to assist corporate IT practitioners in understanding how to use and manage information and communications technology to revitalise business processes, improve business decision-making, and achieve a competitive advantage through ICT adoption. The identifying of four important CSFs that influence ICT adoption in corporate finance services is the main finding of the above-mentioned study. Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Risk-Taking, and Top Management Support are the four components. And there are three major barriers to ICT adoption in corporate financial services. Lack of IT skills, Lack of Socio-Economic Conditions, and Lack of Environmental Exposure are the three variables. This implies that adequate information technology planning, as well as suitable staff and team management competence, are required. The findings of this research demonstrated that the maturity process produces more consistent and predictable outcomes. By 69.5 percent of the variation in the Employee's Behavioural Intention to the adoption of ICTs in corporate financial services, the major statistical results supported the predictive validity of the conceptual model 1. Throughout the study, it was determined that Social Influence, Effort Expectancy, Risk-Taking, and Top Management Support all had a good impact on ICT adoption in corporate financial services, with the remainder of the factors having a little impact. In the variance of the Employee's Behavioural intention to affect the adoption of ICT in corporate financial services, model 2 outperformed model 1 by 61.7 percent. Throughout the research, it was discovered that a lack of IT skills, Lack of socioeconomic conditions, and Lack of environmental exposures all had favorable impacts on the adoption of ICT in corporate financial services, while the rest of the factors had little effect. Limitation Even though this study represents a fruitful attempt in the area of adoption of ICT in corporate financial services, it is restricted by limitations. Because this research data was gathered from a small sample of corporate sector employees from a few states, people respond differently backed on the different education levels. This study was conducted in the Indian context; however, if it was conducted in the global context, the results would be different. Because India is a developing country, respondents in India are more accurate than in other developing countries. The majority of the respondents in this survey were young, educated, and well versed with computers and the internet; the findings apply to other segments of the present population with varying characteristics.

The changing taste of customers and mass customization demands greater research in the area of ergonomically designed tools for comfort and ease at work. Using QFD methodology, tool design incorporates the ideas, thoughts, and technical views of experts in product design, which are directly and indirectly related to the customers’ requirements for products. Research may be taken up to incorporate such changes in order to accomplish effectiveness and efficiency (Akbar et al. 2010)","department of family resource management chaudhary charan singh haryana agricultural university, hisar promilakrishnachahal@hau.ac.in, mm1964@gmail.com",

58,An Interpretive Structural Modelling Approach To  Analyse Interaction Between Performance Management,"this paper presents an overview on the change in the dynamics of the performance management process in the current business ecosystem which is majorly by technology in the post pandemic era. be it work from home or hybrid work options at the work place, every factor of performance management structure is critically analysed in this study and inter-dependencies of these factors in today’s virtual business ecosystem is highlighted too. a total of 7 critical elements of performance management were identified basis the critical literature review and through discussion and brainstorming sessions with managers and employee representatives and structured using pair-wise comparison. structural and reachability matrices were formed and yielded a level of influence of each factor through interpretive structural modelling (ism) approach. micmac analysis was conducted to determine the dependency and driving power of these elements. the present study can be differentiated from the past studies on identified performance management as factors like biasness of manager and relatable past performance which do play a critical role in evaluation but has not been extensively categorised in the framework earlier. this will help the managers, researchers and organizational specialists to encompass overall factors in assessing the performance of their teams without any biasness.","feedback, skills, incentives, bias","and Discussions Through this paper, researchers wanted to emphasise that the above-mentioned seven parts of performance management are dynamic and simple to execute, either via the use of a PMS tool or manually. Performance Management programmes with the above characteristics and tool functionality can be implemented by organisations with capital expenditure feasibility. A user-friendly interface and appropriate training to gauge the functionality of the tool can bring in more accessibility and adaption. However, in mid-sized or small organisations where it is tough for PMS application implementation of top-line/bottom-line pressures if the framework‘s elements are put to use and implemented effectively even manually but with proper records, it can generate a lot of value and bring in productive changes for both employees and organisation. This ISM model was developed based on inputs from academicians and practicing managers. The iterative process of the proposed ISM model helps the managers to identify the interrelationship between the Performance Managements’ factors and frame strategies for effective implementation. This has enormous feasibility of strategic decision for policy formulation of the organisation. In addition to that, the proposed ISM model acts as an ideal guide for a future investment decision. The results are more generic and can be duplicated to other specific industries also shortly have to be considered as future scope of the study. Also, the factors of the performance management used in this study identified through the inputs from the literature and expert opinions can get impacted in the times to come basis the external environment changes like government policy alterations and even working environment changes pertaining to the pandemic situation.","factors in the current business ecosystem dhruv chopra research scholar, dayalbagh educational institute (dei), agra dhruvch11@gmail.com d.k. banwet professor emeritus & visiting professor, department of management studies, iit delhi dbanwet@gmail.com shalini nigam professor, department of management, dayalbagh educational institute (dei), agra shalini@dei.ac.in",

60,"A Study On Start-Up India: A Governmental Initiative  To Boost Entrepreneurship, Growth And Employment","the age range of 15 to 59 accounts for more than 60% of indians, a group dubbed as the ""demographic dividend"" in that country. india is now going through a demographic change. before india to take advantage of this dividend, the labour market needs to be capable of producing enough jobs to effectively absorb this economically engaged population. the indian government has put in place a number of initiatives to create jobs, such as ""skill india,"" which seeks to train over 40 crore people by 2022, whether through self-employment or paid work. the indian government has introduced ""start-up india,"" a programme intended to aid start-ups, in order to inspire young people to build their own enterprises and jobs. young people offer a rich supply of potential employees for firms since they are frequently the driving force behind innovative concepts and technologies. in order to support the growth and development of tribal youth in the tsp region of southern rajasthan, the indian government has created several flagship programmes, including start-up india and make in india, digital india, skill india, and others. this study evaluates these programmes.","start-up, tribal youth, skill, entrepreneurship","Opportunities cannot be guaranteed by the former role of government, which was to control all economic resources. Instead, it ought to act as a facilitator to guarantee the most efficient use of resources. The role of the government should be to help the populace make better decisions by offering a targeted policy environment and knowledge. Start- up India and the other major initiatives stated earlier have been adopted by the government in an effort to create an environment of ""maximum governance and least government."" These initiatives have helped to create a start-up- friendly environment in the TSP region of Southern Rajasthan. The fundamental objective of start-ups is to change people's mentality in order to turn India from a nation of job seekers into a nation of job producers. Without a doubt, start-ups have proven to be a useful tool for encouraging people to establish their own businesses, but a lot of people have been abandoning their jobs to take advantage of the start-up programme in the hopes of earning more money as a self-employed person. Many start-ups have failed because they were unable to compete in the cutthroat market, but some have been successful and are expanding gradually. According to India's labour ministry, this is terrible news for the nation's expanding economy. Even while this initiative hasn't yet had any noteworthy positive effects, in the long run, it could be more effective at giving young people in Southern Rajasthan's TSP region work. Prospective business owners should thus pay close attention to the objectives and rules of the launch plan. By establishing start-up incubators in remote areas, it is more likely that new firms will succeed there and that the problem of seasonal employment and unemployment will be resolved.","generation of tribal youth of tsp region of southern rajasthan sachin gupta and biswajit satpathy department of business administration sambalpur university, odisha, india sachinguptabusadm@gmail.com, satpathybulu@gmail.com sukanta kumar baral professor, department of commerce, faculty of commerce & management, indira gandhi national tribal university (a central university), amarkantak, madhya pradesh, india sukanta.baral@igntu.ac.in",

63,Real Time Analytics Dashboard For Machine Maintenance  In Legacy Machines Using Deep Transfer Learning And,"productivity losses in the manufacturing industry have to be minimized to perform at total capacity consistently. if productivity losses are neglected, a reduction in overall revenue results from an underperforming manufacturing plant. deep learning (dl) and computer vision (cv) can serve as an automated surveillance system for continuous monitoring. the combination of dl and cv, which act as eyes and brain, can capture the activities in the manufacturing plant and convert such visual data into meaningful information in the form of object detections. the requirement is to detect the status of maintenance, operator and machines and their interactions based on user-defined thresholds. metrics such as machine utilization, mean-time to repair, mean-time to failure, operator in position and maintenance behavior are derived from these detections. this paper compares two approaches using data for a real-time analytics dashboard to track productivity losses in a manufacturing setup. the results are compared to select a better performing approach regarding their contribution to productivity analytics accuracy. the first approach uses weights of the yolov4 model to detect maintenance and operator as a person in combination with hsv colour filtering for machine status and maintenance operator classification. later uses transfer learning on yolov4 to detect machine status, maintenance and operator. literature shows that transfer learning is significantly faster and consumes less data than conventional model training, so an approach to compare conventionally trained models was unnecessary. the results from the experiment show that the second approach using transfer learning was accurate compared to the first approach.","yolov4, analytics","4.1 Summary From the results, it is clear that there are low precision and recall values for individual classes in the HSV method when compared to the Transfer Learning method. This indicates that the Transfer learning approach would be accurate for detection than the HSV colour filtering method. The weights of the Transfer learning method were used to obtain the dashboard results. The transfer learning method consumes fewer data compared to traditional deep learning methods. But HSV colour filtering required even fewer data. It is important to note that the results of the HSV method are not inaccurate because of using lesser data compared to the Transfer learning method. It is worthy to note that transfer learning approach results can be improved by improving the quality of data we supply. The reason for the poor performance of the HSV method lies in the colour filtering method itself. When we filter unnecessary colours from the region of interest, certain elements creep into the region of interest as the subject moves. When they are in the same colour as that of the person of interest, these elements affect the result, causing the model to perform poorly. For example, in Figure 26, the bounding box indicating the person marked in white when in front of the machine has the machine's blue colour making its way into the bounding box, which will cause the person in the white-coloured box also to be classified as an orange class due to domination by blue colour over the brown colour within ROI. 4.2 Conclusions We compared two methods and concluded that the transfer learning approach is better to generate data for dashboards to monitor productivity losses in a manufacturing setup. The Transfer learning method is faster to train and lighter in computation with the perks of consuming less data than traditional Deep Learning methods. Transfer learning performs better consistently throughout the testing for each class, as shown in the results. From the dashboards generated, strict monitoring can be done on the processes in the manufacturing, and processes contributing to a loss in productivity can be rectified by conducting a root cause analysis.","computer vision venkata sai kumar reddy aavula and dr v. vasu department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology (nit), warangal, india venkatasaiaavula@gmail.com, vasu@nitw.ac.in, vasuapplepc@gmail.com",
64,Productivity Enhancement Through Green Supply Chain  Initiativesan Investigative Study,"this study will examine the impact of economic, environmental, social, and technical factors in reverse logistics, as well as present a summary of significant drivers and barriers that have the potential to stimulate or deter enterprises from implementing reverse logistics methods. in the last half century, msme sector has grown as a tremendously lively and competitive segment of the indian economy. however, most research does not focus on this sector. to bridge this gap, this study identifies and evaluates the critical factors of reverse logistics in the indian msme’s. from a systematic literature review a list of critical factors in reverse logistics were identified and a questionnaire was developed to conduct a survey in 36 indian msme’s to assess their efficiency in reverse logistics. data envelopment analysis (dea) methodology was applied to the data collected to identify the important reverse logistics enablers and barriers. this methodology can also be used to assess the efficiency of the reverse logistics model, as well as to increase efficiency by altering critical factors. key performance areas such as performance management system, latest technologies, volume of products, financial investment are the key performance inputs to be given more importance for the inefficient companies to become efficient. awareness of reverse logistics, complexity of operation and third-party logistics are the output variables to be concentrated for the inefficient companies to match the benchmark companies. it can be further extended to other states and countries so as to make cumulative study among the region.","reverse logistics, green supply chain, climate change","and Future work Among 36 companies surveyed and studied, 25 of them were found to be efficient and the rest 11 was inefficient. 14 of the companies were pump manufacturers and 6 of them can improve their reverse logistics practises to match the benchmark companies. Other sectors like foundries, battery manufacturing and spare parts manufacturing practise reverse logistics in an optimised way and function as benchmark DMU’s. Key performance Areas such as Performance management system, Latest technologies, Volume of products, Financial investment are the key performance inputs to be given more importance for the inefficient companies to become efficient. Awareness of Reverse logistics, Complexity of operation and third party logistics are the output variables to be concentrated for the inefficient companies to match the benchmark companies. Sectors like valve manufacturing, and industrial equipment manufacturers can concentrate on the above mentioned factors and gain a competitive edge in the market. This study was conducted and limited to around 36 Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs) in Tamil Nadu. It can be further extended to other states and countries so as to make cumulative study among the region. It should be emphasised that this research had a restricted amount of time for data collection, hence the survey had a minimal number of respondents. Because this is a preliminary study, it aims to learn more about MSMEs' reverse logistics methods. In recent times we find that there is a rapid growth in electric mode of transportation, so focus on battery manufacturing and electric vehicles segment would be good extension to this study. With the limited time available we limited our study to only 36 companies, increasing the number of companies would more precise and yield better results.","dr. saleeshya pg, naresh viswaraj m, hari varshan a and lokeshvaran cr department of mechanical engineering, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, coimbatore, india pg_saleeshya@cb.amrita.edu, nareshviswaraj@gmail.com, harivarshanac@gmail.com, lokeshvarancr@gmail.com",

Without lean and sustainable practices, the organization is identified to have many losses and is not capable of meeting the market fluctuations or demands. Small- scale industry units have generally not implemented lean and sustainability practices in their respective organizations and these organizations are stuck when unexpected events occur. However, these organizations provide a source of income for many daily wage workers and should not be put on hold because they may have an impact on the livelihood of many workers. Halting these types of industries can also mean losing many traditional products in which the employees are skilled. In today’s business world, lean-sustainability practices are of utmost importance to cope with the rising demands and increasing competition.

66,Consumer’S Preference Towards Drugs Generic V/S  Branded Drugs A Cross-Sectional Study,"the idea of using generic pharmaceuticals is generally acknowledged around the world. nonetheless, it has struggled to acquire traction in india due to a lack of awareness, information and faith in the product's quality. therefore, keeping in line with this idea a study was conducted to assess consumer knowledge and attitudes concerning generic drug usage and distribution, as well as to raise awareness among survey participants. a cross- sectional questionnaire survey was done with 208 consumers, 65 retailers and 15 pmbjak. in our study, 78% of consumers were aware of generic medicines, 13% believed that generic medicines had higher quality, 76% knew about pmbjak, 93% of retailers believed that branded medicines were of higher quality, 83% of them were aware of pmbjak and 34% believed that branded medicines were prescribed the most in their area through the prescription process. our findings imply that participants' knowledge and attitudes about generic drugs were lacking. doctors' recommendations and drug company advantages have been demonstrated to influence retailers. the findings highlight the need of raising public awareness and understanding of generic drugs, pmbjak, and sensible drug usage.","consumer, retailer, jan aushadi kendra","Despite policymakers' encouragement, generic medicine usage in India has struggled to garner general acceptance. The use of generic drugs has mostly been limited to government facilities in our nation. The fact that generic drugs can save money is well-known and acknowledged. It is generally recognized that ideas about medications, as well as beliefs about the condition, impact prescription decisions, and studies have found unfavorable connections between low adherence and particular worries about medicine. The lack of information, expertise, and education about pharmaceuticals in terms of consumption, prescription, and dispensing is the major reason why most participants choose branded medicines over generic medicines. The core factors forming consumer’s opinion and expectations for generic medicines are medical professional’s recommendations and previous experience. The main advantage of generic medicines according to the participants in the study are the lower price. Retailers are found to be influenced by doctor’s recommendation and benefits of drug companies. The results raise the issue of the awareness and knowledge about generic medicines, Pradhana Manthri Bharthiya PMBJAK and the rational drug use in the general population.

Comparative analysis of installed RE capacity development in these states shall help in planning the expansion of RE projects by identifying the development trends in states that are performing better than others and pinpointing areas of concern for the states that are lagging behind on a relative scale. This study proposes and empirically validates a quantitative evaluation model for assessing the same. The combination of modified CRITIC and VIKOR methods is used for getting the compromised rankings for the selected states. The yearly trends of performance scores for five PIs of RE capacity development included in the evaluation index are compared with yearly trend of performance rank for all the selected states. This is critical for obtaining meaningful insights to identify weaker performance areas among state(s) considering relative performance ranks. Finally, the suggested framework, a combination of modified CRITIC, VIKOR, acts as an effective tool for the evaluation of RE development status in various geographical alternatives. We conclude by highlighting possible extensions of the study. First, while the study has been undertaken based on secondary data from north-eastern states of India, the proposed framework can be easily generalized using RE development data from other geographical alternatives. Second, a more robust evaluation index system can be developed by including a larger number of input parameters and PIs. This will help in creating a region-specific evaluation index system. Thus, the governments and policymakers can use the insights for enhancing the utilization of RE potential through proper planning of RE development.","pratik rai and sasadhar bera department of operations management indian institute of management ranchi ranchi, india - 834008 pratik.rai19ph@iimranchi.ac.in, sbera@iimranchi.ac.in",

Arguments between BBMP workers and the residents have been reported over gathering of unsegregated waste. Employees have been facing too much difficulty to separate the waste later once all the waste has been collected. And because of the mixed waste it is also becoming difficult to recycle reuse and causing problems while land filing too. This is leading to pilling up of wastes in the landfills and leading to more and more illegal dumpsites in the city consuming more space to dump the waste. Mixed waste makes it difficult to worker, as it requires much manual or mechanical sorting this puts workers health in danger especially hazardous waste can cause long term health problems as well as time taking and the waste that are been dumped in the compressor are not completely segregated.

76,Effect Of Anthropometry On Maximum Acceptable Weight  Of Lift,"manual material handling (mmh) and lifting activities are believed to contribute to the risk of low back pain (lbp). it has been found that as many as 50% of all back pains may be related to manual lifting activities. revised niosh lifting equation (rnle) was designed to reduce the incidence of lbp by recommending safe load limits, called the recommended load limit (rwl). while, an effect of worker characteristics like age, gender, weight and ethnicity, on load lifting task has been seen, the rnle considers the effect of task demands only for establishing the rwls. thus, the present study investigates the role of worker anthropometry in a manual lifting task. the findings have been discussed in the light of the rnle. a psychophysical methodology was adopted to arrive at the maximum acceptable weight limits (mawls). 50 industrial workers (25 males and 25 females) participated in the study. ancova for gender using acromial height and wrist circumference as covariates showed that while acromial height and wrist circumference had a statistically significant effect on mawl, gender did not. further, it was observed that the using psychophysical criteria of 75% capable females (as per the rnle guidelines), resulted in a mawl of 22.2. kgs, which is comparable to the recommended weight limit (rwl) of 23 kg as obtained by the rnle.",manual lifting,"The results of the present study indicate that while anthropometric characteristics of acromial height and wrist circumference had a significant effect on MAWL, gender did not have a statistically significant effect on it, when acromial height and wrist circumference were taken as covariates. Thus, it appears that acromial height and wrist circumference had a more marked effect on MAWL as compared to gender. The present research indicates that anthropometric variables may be used to determine safe loads for a given population. It was noted that for the task undertaken in the study the MAWL, as per the RNLE criteria, is 22.2 kg which was comparable to the RWL of 23 kg as obtained from the RNLE. Thus, it appears that the RWL of RNLE is suitable for the Indian population","saman ahmad and mohammad muzammil department of mechanical engineering z.h.c.e.t, a.m.u, india saman.ahmad@yahoo.co.in, m.muzammil.me@amu.ac.in",

78,Optimizing The Video Recording Settings To Improve  Accuracy Of Joint Angle Measurements In Gait Analysis,"human kinematic analysis remains one of the most challenging tasks for the researchers. in a typical gait analysis study, measurement of various joint angles is carried out with the help of markers attached to the human body. the human activity is captured by a video camera and the video is then analyzed using appropriate software. locating the markers manually in each frame is cumbersome and may give erroneous results. the problems like, motion blur, scattering, marker occlusion, marker reflection, etc., are also prevalent. the video recording settings play an important role in deciding the marker location precisely. in the present study, the effects of input parameters such as frame rate and shutter speed, on the pixel area of the led marker were investigated using the response surface methodology (rsm). it has been observed that higher shutter speed time has a negative effect on pixel area of the led marker and on the area of the bounding box. the experimentation using rsm showed that shutter speed time of 2300 µsec and frame rate of 60 frame per second (fps) are required to produce pixel area of bounding box of desired quality.","active marker, frame rate, shutter speed","The effects of motion blur, dispersion, and reflection of the LED marker on the overall accuracy of object detection in video footage are all significant. In this experiment, it was discovered that by using lower shutter speed time settings, the sharp LED object in a video frame is produced. Furthermore, as the frame rate value is increased, the bounding box area increases as well. The number of frames grows in proportion to the increase in the value of the frame rate. Finally, the optimal value of the input parameters is established, which results in a sharp image of the LED marker as well as the optimal conditions in which the LED marker image can operate.

79,The Effect Of Iso 14001 Standards Adoption On  Manufacturing Firms’ “Return On Investment”: Using Psm,"it is necessary to be aware of both the costs and the advantages associated with the adoption of iso 14000 certification in an organisation in order to conduct an accurate evaluation of the investment with regard to the state of the financial performance. on the other hand, as we will see, calculating these figures can be challenging, mostly because there is a dearth of reference data or particular evaluation criteria. this paper investigates the effect of iso 14001 certification on firm performance using indian public listed manufacturing firms financial data from cmie prowess data base using the propensity score matching techniques followed by regression analysis. the result indicates that effect of iso 14001 certification on firm performance is significant. the further investigation reveals that sales coefficient is higher than cost for iso 14001 certified firms. this study provides empirical support for policy-makers promoting environmental practices that may lead to sustainable economic growth.","iso 14001, psm, manufacturing","and Implication In the fast-paced and ever-changing world of modern business, an organization's primary focus should be on maximising its resource utilisation in order to get a strategic edge over its rivals. The ISO 14001 certification confers significant benefits on every company in terms of economic benefits. The findings of this research show that the advantages of adhering to the ISO 14001 standard go far beyond the improvements in corporate legitimacy that can be achieved by doing so. This was demonstrated by better operating performance in comparison to those who did not implement. In our result financial benefits due to operating performance, because sales and cost is directly corelated with same magnitude, however we found that iso 14001 certified firms has higher sales and cost but magnitude of cost is smaller than sales. Which indicates that Iso 14001 certifications helps firm to get operational efficient by reducing wastage or by improving operational process. The management should be aware that there are performance benefits associated with ISO 14001 that go far beyond the benefits associated with marketing. More precisely, the results imply that standards such as ISO 14001 can enhance operating performance by applying operating procedures which promote a mindset of waste reduction and continual improvement. Because the findings presented here suggest that the integration and diffusion of ISO 14001 environmental practises can help build operating capabilities that lead to both cost efficiency gains and operating speed gains, management should incorporate ISO 14001 alongside a culture of cost control and collaboration amongst 658","and probit regression model priyadarshi ranjan research scholar, school of management studies, university of hyderabad, hyderabad g.v.r.k achayulu professor, school of management studies, university of hyderabad, hyderabad","References

80,Development Of A Framework To Assess The Impact  Of Information And Communication Technology,"rapid technology advances and dynamic market forces have altered the business landscape as also fundamentally altered existing business models. information and communication technology (ict) usage and deployment have opened the doors for enterprises to compete in any marketplace. ict tools are great enablers, enhancers, levelers, and facilitators of enterprise operations. while most researchers and industry practioners are unanimous about the fact that ict positively impacts supply chain management (scm) performance and improves supply chain capabilities, there is evidently an identified gap in terms of assessment and measurement of these ict benefits and capabilities in scm. this is despite the fact that there are several scm performance measurement frameworks. the novel research direction of this investigation emerged from the observation that there is clearly an absence of an assessment framework to accurately describe the impact and benefit analysis and to what magnitude ict has improved the competitive advantage of enterprises through the improvement of the enterprise supply chain. this research work assumes greater significance as a result of the present situation due to the covid-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the need for industry 4.0, digitalization, and embracing of ict not only for the supply chain but also for all aspects of the enterprise. the motivation of this thesis is to make an original contribution to the body of knowledge in terms of addressing this gap in the rubrics of ict effectiveness in scm as also providing enterprises with a benchmark on their ict deployment in scm. this thesis is about the development of an assessment framework of ict deployment in scm, consisting of an empirical model and capability index and its dovetailing into the apics supply chain operations reference (scor) model, which has universal appeal and wide acceptance. the rubrics and performance indicators of various constructs for measuring the impact of ict in scm in the empirical model evolved into an ict capability index metric for scm. this assessment framework of the benefits of ict deployment can be used by any enterprise irrespective of the geography or country, vertical or sector, manufacturing or services. measurement of the ict impact on scm aids decision-making and policymakers as also helps to identify targets and to track and benchmark progress. this can also provide insights on the selection of appropriate ict tools after measurement of its impact on the supply chain paradigm and understanding success factors and operational challenges for the adoption of various ict tools. the empirical model uses well-defined metrics from the scor process reference model corresponding to supply chain processes and performance constructs, thereby providing a robust research methodology. all of the scor processes and attributes are influenced by ict, but this model also does not list ict enablement as a metric of supply chain performance. the constructs used are reliability, responsiveness & agility, which are considered customer-facing, and cost & assets, which are internal process-facing. with regard to analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (cfa) using structural equation modeling (sem) was used on the results of the survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews for quantitative and qualitative inputs. 661",,,"(ict) deployment in supply chain management (scm) prashant r. nair department of computer science & engineering, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, coimbatore dr. s.p. anbuudayasankar professor department of mechanical engineering, amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, coimbatore",

The researchers have produced a cheap and convenient solution for this problem using Arduino, sensors connected to the Arduino board, and other applications such as the mobile application for data viewing and customization. This alleviates the workload of the farmers in terms of monitoring and maintenance towards the livestock they have. The researchers recommend several details to further improve this research. One is to test the diagrams given by the researchers and comparing it to other products that have similar objectives. Comparisons to its efficiency to cost will inform readers of the optimal hardware solutions for this problem. Second is to have more features that may be useful in growing livestock. At its current state, the solution given by the researchers offers only simple parameters.","dr. eric b. blancaflor, john daryl aumentado, james nathanael c. de los reyes, mark louie dj. dipad, joshua angelo karl r. perez and wesley mikhail c. tolentino school of information technology mapua university makati, philippines ebblancaflor@mapua.edu.ph, johndaumentado@gmail.com, natnatdelosreyes@gmail.com, louie04887@gmail.com, jakrperez17@gmail.com, dexmikhail@gmail.com",

ownership that comes with purchasing physical copies. Gamers who purchase physical copies desire the option 
of having the game in their hands and being able to decide what to do with it. When compared to digital, there is 
the possibility that a publisher will remove a copy of the game, and gamers who paid will lose access to it. Physical 
sales are even more pronounced when it comes to AAA games, games that are released by big gaming studios. It 
is estimated that 75% of games sold via Amazon, GAME, GameStop are physical copies (Dring 2021).

83,Security Assessment Of An Enterprise’ E-Mail And Domain  Name System: A Case Study,"the domain name system (dns) is a critical protocol in today’s internet operation. it establishes a standard naming convention for human-readable, understandable, and memorable domain names and ip addresses of internet services. the abundance of study on dns in general and security and privacy suggests that all issues in this area have been resolved. the reality, however, is that despite the substantial amount of literature on different elements of dns, there are still many unresolved issues. the researchers offered a standards-based security assessment using cyber security evaluation tool (cset) to help the staffing agency understand and assess the many hazards associated with using the domain name system. furthermore, the researchers investigate a range of potential countermeasures to such threats.","dns, ip address, threats","& Recommendation The standards-based security evaluation demonstrates that a concentrated effort to solve the issues highlighted in this study may result in significant security improvements. Most of the issues highlighted need a sophisticated or high- tech remedy and establishing security policies is strongly advised. Adhering to the Cyber Security Evaluation Tool’s findings as a guideline for improving cybersecurity is critical for achieving the intended security objective. For the Google Workspace, Domain Name System, and virtual machine of the case site company to remain secure, they must be reassessed regularly. At the very least, yearly, or promptly after a significant breach, is recommended. We conclude that the security of the. Staffing Agency case site in this study should be enhanced. Based on our findings, the researchers recommend the following: To help prevent spoofing and spam with SPF. A DNS record called an SPF TXT record verifies the domain name from which email messages are delivered, so assisting in the prevention of spoofing and phishing. SPF verifies the IP address of the sender against the purported owner of the transmitting domain to validate the origin of email communications (Microsoft 2022). To increase security for an outgoing e-mail with DKIM. Set up DKIM to shield your domain from spoofing and stop spam filters from flagging your outgoing communications. The From address of an email message is forged in a sort of email assault known as spoofing. A communication that has been faked looks to come from the fake company or domain. DKIM can identify when a message has been altered and when the From: address has been changed without authorization (Google Workspace 2022). To increase security for forged spam with DMARC. DMARC, or Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance, is an email authentication mechanism that builds on SPF and DKIM, two further email authentication techniques, to determine whether an email message actually comes from the location it claims to have. In addition to email authentication, it also has reporting features, allowing domain owners to look at email authentication data for their own domains. DMARC's primary goal is to stop phishing and email spoofing. In recent years, email phishing has been a significant security concern. According to research, about 50% of cyberattacks target small firms, and over 90% of network breaches begin with a phishing email. A security breach puts a lot of things at risk for a company, including damaged brand reputation, intellectual property theft, immediate cash loss, etc.(Dmarcly 2022) Set up Cloudflare Origin Certificate to server.

At different boundary voltages the PV curve used in FZPO technique are divided into multiple zones. The adaptive and fixed step size using simple linear equations are used to make the calculation more efficient. In compare to P&O technique the FZPO technique attains a drift free tracking. The controller parameter for FZPO technique are used only for design stage and it does not need any complex calculation during real time tracking. Hence the FZPO technique is performed better than the conventional P&O MPPT for standalone PV system.","vaishali malik school of renewable energy and efficiency national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india vaishali_32019121@nitkkr.ac.in, vaihsali.malik.96@gmail.com shivam assistant professor, department of electrical engineering national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india shivam@nitkkr.ac.in ratna dahiya professor, department of electrical engineering national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india ratna_dahiya@yahoo.co.in",

87,A Model To Facilitate Healthcare Infrastructure Pertaining  To Medical Emergencies Using Block Chain,"in india, the number of deaths caused just by failing to treat a patient in an emergency situation in a timely manner is considerable. one of the key factors is india's emergency response system, which is out of date, in comparison to other technology. this study focuses on achieving operational excellence using block chain technology. the proposed concept focuses on real-time location monitoring of the ambulance, allocation of the nearest ambulance and hospital depending on the real-time location of the patient. since there is a surge in demand for speedy medical emergency help, the study also focuses on maintaining a database of the patient's past medical records. however, these records shall be encrypted and accessible by the pertinent doctors or authorized persons before the patient arrives at the hospital. the concept has essentially addressed all issues of safety and compliance. a descriptive analysis employing simulation techniques and secondary data from a literature review are used to support the proposed concept. after examining the contributions of all other entities, this research proposes a model that uses block chain to help in the reduction of time during crisis and the facilitation of healthcare infrastructure related to medical emergencies.","emergency response, block chain, real-time location","Within a hospital, there are many more medical crisis occurrences than cardiac arrests, and many of these may go unnoticed and untreated. By providing immediate access to critical care personnel and equipment, a medical emergency response system can help avoid accident fatalities. India's medical infrastructure is severely deficient, resulting in innumerable deaths that may have been averted if the system had been improved with better technology, money, and less hardship. According to Cause and Effect analysis, we found that majorly six challenges are individually fragmented. These can be address as well as synchronize as per this model to validate with positive results and can reduce the mortality rate and various emergency response challenges. Objective criteria for diagnosing a crisis should be included in the medical emergency response system.

88,Evaluation Of Direct Air Capture Methodologies Based On  Clean Energy And Sequestration Potential From Indian,"climate change is one of the major challenges faced by the world in the 21st century. the recent ipcc (intergovernmental panel on climate change) report highlights that even with the rapid decarburization, the existing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have severe irreversible impacts on the climate. therefore, negative emissions technologies like direct air capture (dac), bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, afforestation and reforestation, etc. are expected to play an important role in climate change strategies. researchers are working on scaling up the technologies to get significant benefits. however, the different direct air capture methodologies are energy-intensive. while researchers are working on identifying ways to improve process efficiency, this research is focused on identifying the areas of application where dac is more effective. this study aims (i) to summarize the various popular dac methodologies – solvent, solid sorbent, electro-swing, cryogenic, and humidity/moisture swing – based on the identified indicators, and (ii) to evaluate the dac technology to identify the preferred sites in india for developing dac facilities in the near and long term. all states and union territories of india are evaluated from the short- and long-term perspectives based on clean energy and sequestration capacity. the proposed framework will help the government agencies and private investors to take informed decisions on the preferred sites for developing dac facilities.",climate change,"Direct air capture is an important negative emissions technology having significant potential to combat climate change. DAC is getting a lot of attention from investors, who see a potential in the technology to complement the decarburization efforts being carried out throughout the globe. Different DAC methodologies can be used to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and each has its advantages and limitations. Solvent and solid sorbent based systems are currently the most mature methods. Companies are trying to scale up these processes and reduce the cost of capture. The study provides a brief comparison of the different DAC methodologies. Available literature pointed out that the energy source and the nearness to the sequestration capacity are two major factors that determine the efficiency of a DAC system. Based on these two factors a weighted factor method is developed in the study to evaluate all states 749","perspective deepikachoudhary research scholar, department of mechanical engineering birla institute of technology & sciences, pilani (bits pilani), pilani, india p20210074@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in himanshuchaturvedi department of chemical engineering birla institute of technology & sciences, pilani (bits pilani), pilani, india f20180031@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in kuldip singh sangwan senior professor, department of mechanical engineering birla institute of technology & sciences, pilani (bits pilani), pilani, india kss@pilani.bits-pilani.ac.in","References

90,A Comparative Study Of Statistical Features Used In Rolling  Element Bearing Health Diagnosis Using Six Sigma,"the purpose of this paper is to examine the ability of different statistical features obtained from denoised vibration signals to distinguish between healthy and defective rolling element bearings (reb) at the six sigma significance level or defects per million observations (dpmo). raw vibration signals from the experimental setup were subjected to interval dependent denoising. discrete wavelet transforms (dwt) technique was used to generate 17 statistical features for 4 independent conditions of reb, viz., healthy(n), and reb with defects on inner race (ir), outer race (or) and ball (b). these statistical features were compared using the independent samples test at a six sigma significance level. five statistical features that could distinguish between a defective and a healthy reb viz, root mean square (rms), standard deviation (sd), square of mean of square root (smsr), mean absolute value (mav) and log-log ratio (llr) at six sigma significance were identified. the methodology used in this study is a unique combination of vibration signal analysis, statistical feature extraction and simple inferential analysis of reb defects at very low significance levels comparable with six sigma dpmo. the identified statistical features can be used before predictive analysis.",wang and zeng,"This study is intended to explore the ability of different statistical features to distinguish between a healthy REB and REB with defects on ball, IR and OR at higher significance levels corresponding to six sigma standards. Vibration signals were extracted from a customised bearing test rig. These signals were subjected to Interval dependent denoising, and statistical features were extracted using DWT technique. Using DWT method of signal processing seventeen statistical features were extracted from the signals. Three pairs of independent samples were formed based on the REB condition concerning 17 statistical features. Inferences were drawn about the ability of each statistical feature to distinguish between a healthy and defective REB, by application of the independent samples test. It was inferred those the five statistical features, viz., RMS, SD, SMSR, MAV and LLR could critically differentiate between a healthy REB and a defective REB irrespective of whether the defect is on ball, IR and OR. This study suggests that the inferential analysis of statistical features can help researchers to focus only on those statistical features that can differentiate between healthy and defective REB by eliminating those statistical features that do not 772","approach h.s. kumar associate professor, department of mechanical engineering nmam institute of technology - affiliated to nitte (deemed to be university), india urkumar2006@nitte.edu.in, gururaj upadhyaya associate professor, department of mechanical engineering nmam institute of technology - affiliated to nitte (deemed to be university), india gururaj@nitte.edu.in","References

91,A Study On The Effects Of Covid-19 On The Lives Of  Migratory Labourers,"covid-19 crisis has made huge impact and caused grave economic challenges in countries around the world and especially on developing countries like india. many sectors were affected both economically and emotionally. one such sector which had the possibility of being harmed was that of migrant labourers. the labourers were suddenly left jobless due to the pandemic. most of them moved to their place of origin but some decided to stay at their place of work. many news articles highlighting their hardships and struggles were published. government and private organizations extended some aid towards their daily requirements during the pandemic. however, not a lot of research articles were published about their condition and how they fared during the time. being an unorganized sector, the workers do not have job security. even in the best of times, their income rates are low and savings, non-existent. this project attempts to identify the issues, which affected the migrant labourers during lockdown. data was collected from 63 migrant workers using a structured questionnaire. the respondents were workers who had migrated from places such as north karnataka, bihar, odisha, uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh to bengaluru. data was collected from different parts of north bengaluru. during the survey, it was found that earning was the factor that majorly affected their state of living. this study and subsequent analysis showed that migrants were content with their increased wages and job assurances given by their employers.","covid-19, migrant labourers, challenges","The Covid-19 outbreak, has disturbed millions of lives around the world. Similarly, it has affected a lot on the lives of the people who live in India. Many of the labourers who travel to different parts of the country had faced lot of issues. Some of these issues include getting back to their hometown, getting support to fulfil their necessities and so on. Our focus was to analyze the difficulties faced by them. This was possible by conducting a scheduled survey, which consisted of questions regarding the five major factors namely Livelihood, Earning, Privileges, Mobility Issues and Job Security. The qualities such as measure of central tendency, measure of variability was analyzed by performing Descriptive Statistics for the PC’s. The effect of age, occupation and gender on the factors was found out by conducting independent sample T-test. We have also built a Structural Equation model using JMP to build a relationship between latent variables and measured variables. From the analysis, it is found that earning has a significant effect on livelihood of migrant labourers. We can also say that earning has an impact on mobility issues, most of the mobility issues were concerned with the monetary benefits 783","chandra sen mazumdar assistant professor, department of faculty, management and commerce, m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india chandrasen.ms.mc@msruas.ac.in varsha s, amruth n, gagana p, manasvi n m, tilak p, sanjana s biradar, sanjeev l d, soorya thejas g r and tanushree n mba student, department of management studies, m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india varsha.shivaswamy@gmail.com, namruth97@gmail.com, gaganaprakash153@gmail.com, manasvimohan1998@gmail.com, tilakpaneendra978@gmail.com, sanjanabiradar50@gmail.com, sanjeev.sanjeevld1@gmail.com, rangasoorya@gmail.com, tanushree11598@gmail.com","References

92,Application Of Simulation In Warehouse Management  Vaibhav Kankal,"simulation is becoming a need for the industries nowadays as the businesses are required to take critical decisions frequently. simulation has various applications in many areas. the current research focuses on simulating the warehouse situation. a simulation model of the warehouse is built by using witness 2021 simulation software. the model is also validated by comparing it to a real-life situation. after running the model for a certain time, the statistics have been collected for the model. this will help to understand the existing situation for the warehouse. then the efforts are made to reduce the queues. for that what-if- scenarios are generated. based on these scenarios, the experiments have been conducted in the witness experimenter. the results for these experiments are then analyzed and the best results with alternative solutions are provided.","simulation, warehouse","There are so many advantages of using simulation over doing the calculations manually or with the help of spreadsheet. If we consider it financially the cost of making the prototype of the system and experimenting through it will become rigorous and costly. Whereas the software will provide the exact details. During this study, simulation has helped in the process of building the model also the experimenter feature of it has helped to optimize and analyse the processes which are being conducted inside the warehouse. The reports which Witness provided has given us the capacity of our existing system and its utilization. Also, Witness provided the statistics report after adding the processing machines. Witness also provided the visual interpretation of the processes in a single model which might not be possible as the machines and workstations are huge which helped in the external communication. Witness’ visual interface also helped to communicate effectively with the people working at any level with ease irrespective of their knowledge about the witness software. The dynamic chart inside the model helps to get the report at any specific time also it helps to get the day when the highest number of items were in the queue. In the optimization process witness has helped to get the scenarios which were possible to analyse also it helped to understand the effect of various parameters on the length of queues. From which it can be understood that the machine number are the most important criteria to reduce queue, the cycle times can help to reduce queues significantly, but the parameters and number of carriers don’t help much in reducing the length of the queue. Finally, this model helps in making critical decisions considering the factors which affect the system. So, it can also be used as a decision-making tool.","second year m. tech project management department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management college of engineering, pune, maharashtra, india kankalvn20.mfg@coep.ac.in n. r. rajhans professor department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management college of engineering, pune, maharashtra, india nrr.mfg@coep.ac.in",

94,A Study On Oxy-Fuel Diesel Engine And Comparison With  Conventional Air Combustion,"to achieve minimal carbon emissions and zero nox emissions of a diesel combustion engine, a numerical study on novelistic oxy-fuel combustion (ofc) technique (nitrogen free combustion) is carried out. diesel engine chemical reactions mechanism indicates that the presence of nitrogen during combustion generates nox emissions, so a nitrogen free oxidizer environment i.e. oxy-fuel combustion is investigated, analyzed and compared with the conventional air combustion engine. a 4-stroke water cooled kirloskar type engine with conventional air combustion (cac) is experimentally tested at various load conditions, with data acquisition done on cylinder pressure, indicated brake power (ibp), indicated mean effective pressure (imep) and emissions. the experimental data is used to correlate and validate the 3d computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulation setup with cac and the validated cfd model is used to study the ofc impact on in-cylinder flow, engine performance and emissions. the results indicates that nox emissions are completely eliminated in ofc and carbon emissions are significantly reduced. contrastingly an average drop of 45% in ibp, imep of ofc is noticed at all the operating conditions, which can be attributed to lean, early start of combustion and shorter combustion rates in ofc. water injection technique is adopted to overcome the loss in engine performance with ofc, although a relative average improvement of 32% in engine performance is observed in ofc with water injection, the overall engine performance is still 10% lower compared to the conventional air combustion.","oxy-fuel combustion, 3d cfd, diesel engine, emissions","This research is about an investigative study on converting a conventional combustion diesel engine into an OFC to evaluate the variation in in-cylinder parameters, engine performance and emissions at various engine load conditions. Below are the significant conclusions of this research • The start of combustion in CAC is occurring at 358CAD, whereas in OFC it is at 345CAD signifying an early combustion and resulting a relatively lower peak pressure and temperature. • The effect of increased oxygen volume during in combustion is inducing a very high effective thermal conductivity of the working fluid in OFC, thereby increasing the heat transfer loss through the cylinder walls and resulting a 45% reduction in IP, IMEP. • In OFC, NOx is completely eliminated and a remarkable reduction in CO emissions and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions are observed. • The loss in engine performance with OFC can be recovered by water injection technique. Water injection is controlling the early start of combustion, rate of combustion and wall heat transfer losses, yielding a relative average improvement of 32% at all the engine loading conditions with unchanged emissions. • Though the overall engine performance in OFC with water injection is still 10% lower compared to CAC, the loss in performance is well compensated by the reduced carbon emissions and zero NOx emissions.","raghavendra ugraram research scholar, department of mechanical engineering jawaharlal nehru technological university anantapur (jntua), ananthapuramu - 515002, andhra pradesh, india. raghuugraram@gmail.com r. meenakshi reddy associate professor of mechanical engineering g. pulla reddy engineering college, kurnool- 518007, andhra pradesh, india rmreddy123@gmail.com b. chandra mohana reddy associate professor of mechanical engineering jawaharlal nehru technological university anantapur (jntua), ananthapuramu - 515002, andhra pradesh, india. cmr_b@yahoo.com",
95,Production Flowline Optimization Using Simulation  Akash Januji Borkar,"this paper focuses on improving the flow efficiency of a production line using simulation software. the aim of this study is to simulate the actual flow using advanced simulation software and improvement in productivity was done by increasing the utilization of the underutilized facilities. simulation modeling was used to evaluate the equipment and manpower performance for the manufacturing system. each individual facility in the flow has to be analyzed carefully and allocated to stations in a balanced way over the available workstations. the paper is divided into 3 parts, the first part consists of data collection and distribution selection in which selection of best data distribution was carried out, the second part is about simulation modeling, analysis of the simulated model in which underutilized facilities were identified, and cause of the underutilization was identified, in the third part, the results of the model were analyzed, validated and finally, best modifications for the flow were suggested to improve the efficiency of the flow. and finally, cost-benefit analysis was performed to determine the tenure of recovering the total investment. based on the simulation results, the top under-utilized facility was m5, m6, m7, m9, and m3 and the existing production was struggling to meet the customer demand due to machine shortages. so, to overcome this underutilization problem, we suggested some modifications by generating different scenarios in the flowline described in the proposed improvement section.","simulation, productivity, bottlenecks","After the final analysis of simulated model, it was possible to detect the inefficiency of workplaces by simulated model results. In particular, it was possible to identify how much each workplace contributed to total inefficiency. Since the aim of this study is to improve the throughput and efficiency of the system through reducing the idle time and improving the material flow, In the first simulated model result it was observed that the M5, M9 is the main reason to the inefficiency of the flow. This is due to the high M4 process timing per part, the M5 machine remains idle until a batch of 24 parts come from M4 process to the buffer. So, to overcome this inefficiency of M5 process the first option is to combine the M5 process and M4 process so that there will be no buffer waiting for M5 operation for a long time or the next alternate solution is that we can simply utilize the M5 facilities forM5 other components which are in the queue for M5from other production flows. And for improving the effective utilization of M9 and M3 generation of multiple scenarios were carried out and obtained optimum solution was determined via adding additional facilities or CNC. Finally Cost Benefit Analysis was performed, and a period of 9.97 years was estimated for the recovery of total investment that the company has made.","second year m. tech project management department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management college of engineering, pune, maharashtra, india borkaraj20.mfg@coep.ac.in dr. neela r. rajhans professor department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management college of engineering, pune, maharashtra, india nrr.mfg@coep.ac.in",
96,Anthropometric Chair Design For People With Down  Syndrome,"down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the extra copy of 21st chromosome in human beings. people affected by down syndrome have different anthropometric traits compared to rest of the population. they are shorter in height, have broader neck circumference, larger hip breadth and short hands. many of the people affected with down syndrome have desk jobs which require continuous sitting in the chair for a long period of time and causes musculoskeletal disorders among them. the office chair used currently is designed based on normal population. musculoskeletal disorders (msds) maybe due to mismatch of their body anthropometry with normal chair. an ergonomic chair for people with down syndrome was designed by considering their body anthropometric characteristics. the body measures of people with down syndrome are collected and compared with the rest of the population. for designing the chair, 5th, 50th and 95th percentile of the anthropometric data was considered. it is found that people with down syndrome needs chair with lower seat height, larger seat width and larger backrest width. the specific design of chair for people with down syndrome will reduce their msds to a greater extent.","down syndrome, ergonomic chair","Ergonomic fundamentals were considered to design the workstation and provide comfort. The 5th , 50th and 95th percentile were used to calculate the suitable results. Suitable allowances were also provided. By designing the workstation following guidelines user’s discomfort can be reduced which enhances their performance and productivity. While designing the workstation, safety guidelines should also be considered. The designing should follow the design for adjustability principle. The anthropometric dimensions play a vital role in the designing of a workstation. By using the collected data from different participants and based on the posture and nature of work the designing of workstation is done. When a workstation is designed based on anthropometric traits the MSDs were reduced to greater extent.The body anthropometry of people with Down syndrome are very different compared to the normal population. They are shorter in length compared to the normal population which make their seat height and seat depth shorter in length compared to existing chairs. Hip breadth and waist circumference are larger for them when compared to the normal population which results in increased dimension of seat width compared to existing design. Most office furniture are designed based on BIFMA Guidelines were not suitable for the subject group use for a long period of time. While calculating seat parameters it is evident that most of the dimensions calculated have high variation from the conventional design of chair. Since more people of the controlled group are getting educated and prefer to go to a job for a daily living we should design workstations comfortable to them considering their anthropometric traits. 826","dhanushma prathap and s a binoosh department of mechanical engineering college of engineering trivandrum,thiruvananthapuram,kerala,india tve20meie08@cet.ac.in, binoosh@cet.ac.in","References

98,,"the concept of “agile” originated nearly three decades ago from the software development and project management disciplines and existing presently in diverse forms and levels is an intriguing research arena that has wider scope and implications. agile as a method has germinated into various forms such as scrum, kanban, scaled agile framework (safe), large-scale scrum (less), spotify model, continuous integration, scaled agile lean development (scaled), and many more. agile initially adopted in an isolated software development and team level, has over the years progressed into projects and programs, and furthered into solutions and portfolios, and achieved full-service expansion into an enterprise level framework. it has been proposed in this article to undertake a novel approach to survey the literatures of agile methods, models, and practices from software development and modeling to large-scale case study organization levels in a less explored banking and financial services sectors. outcome of this study highlights the causal factors, best practices, benefits along with learnings that practitioners of banking and financial services sectors could adopt and envision a streamlined agile implementation.","agile methods, banking","This paper evaluates in a systematic and detailed approach the earlier studies on agile methods, models, and practices from software development, modeling to large-scale case study organization level in a feeble explored banking and financial services sectors. Findings and analysis of this study highlights that there are multiple challenges, causal factors, remedies, best practices, success attributes that practitioners of banking and financial services sectors need to envision when they plan to adopt agile implementation. Due to the traditional banking values and approaches, there are challenges and impediments in the agile transformation in this sector. Practicioners have to strike a balance in adhering to regulatory complications as well as educating and servicing the customer to create trustworthy and long- lasting relationships when adopting the agile methods, models and practices. The thematic summary of agile implementations using state-of-the-art methods at multiple levels primarily for Banking and Financial Services domains consisting of remedial measures and success attributes (presented in section 4 and its sub-sections) could provide some valuable cues for practitioners to guide with mitigative measures and key success factors towards agile adoption. Literature evidences suggest future research avenues in terms of applying cutting-edge hybrid agile techniques, categorizing IT Governance mechanisms and widening the scope of agile adoption to other industries. 6.","agile approach - study of project management methods in the banking industry shyamsundar santhanam ph.d. research scholar, amrita school of business amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, coimbatore, india s_shyamsundar@cb.students.amrita.edu, shyamsundarsanthanam@gmail.com m. suresh associate professor, amrita school of business amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, coimbatore, india m_suresh@cb.amrita.edu",

100,Risk Modelling And Supporting Techniques For Deep  Excavations In Metropolitan Locations,"construction is crucial to a country's overall economic growth, particularly in developing countries, in the current era of globalization. if construction operations are not carried out strictly according to a local or national building code, they might result in large-scale failures endangering human lives, personnel property, and the economic balance. it is vital to handle the construction process's risk elements. the self-weight of soil and surcharge loading behind the retaining line is the driving force and the shear strength of soil is the resisting force as a result, deep excavations invariably cause lateral and vertical ground deformations. as a result of the produced ground deformations, nearby structures and services become kinetically loaded. risks associated with ground movement cannot be calculated solely using mathematical predicting models and engineering simulations as it needs to address the uncertainty of soil properties, geo-materials, ground constitutive nature, building stage modeling, three- dimensional impacts of deep excavations, time-dependent natures of ground deformations, and the critical necessity to include human variables such as craftsmanship into prediction models are all important considerations. this article presents a review of the most effective methods for evaluating hazards related to deep excavation and current mitigating techniques. theoretical approaches to enhancing the safety of deep foundation excavation are examined in the context of a hospital building in khartoum state and a residential district project in southern jianxi province.","deep foundations, risk assessment, globalization","Even for shallow excavations, appropriate temporary earth-retaining structures should be constructed to protect the sidewalls of the excavation.

101,Modeling And Static Analysis Of Rotary Evaporator Parts  Using Solidworks,"the rotary evaporator is used for systematically removal of solvents from samples by using evaporation procedure in chemical laboratories. the working principle of rotary evaporator is that the boiling point of liquids lowers on decreasing their pressure which allows the solvent to vaporize at lower temperatures than when boiled in a normal atmosphere. molecular cooking for the preparation of distillates and extracts can also be done by this device. after thoroughly studying the device and its functions we have designed the parts of rotary evaporator and assembled using solidworks software. in this we have taken vapour duct, rotary mechanism assembly and bench for static analysis using solidworks. the maximum static stress and static strain, minimum static stress and static strain of vapour duct, rotary mechanism assembly and bench are analyzed.","rotary evaporator, solidworks, vapour duct","The design and analysis on the structure of the rotary evaporator is developed successfully and it indicates that the design of the rotary evaporator created has good enclosures provided for the equipment for preventing the unexpected spillage of the chemicals and breakage of the glassware. Material for the parts of the rotary evaporator is selected on the basis so that it can with stand their actions from strong acid and alkaline substances. Static Analysis is done in SOLIDWORKS simulation on the parts of the rotary evaporator where they experience loads and forces.

103,Exploratory Study On The Impact Of Digitalisation Of The  Supply Chain On Performance And Visibility In The Indian,"in a rapidly changing world where technology is constantly evolving. the ultimate goal of any supply chain is to achieve end-to-end transparency by means of analysis of real time data. with the onset of the pandemic several supply chains have crippled. the inception of an intelligent supply chain can open doors to create a transformation in the existing supply chain management system into one that is independent and self-conditioning. various tools such as cloud computing, internet of things, big data analytics, sensors, etc. can be used for the digitalization of the supply chain. in the indian manufacturing industry, while multinational companies are aggressively working towards digitalizing their supply chains, the msme sector is reluctant to undergo this transformation. the possible reasons for this might be the lack of information and research available which truly understands the benefits reaped by companies which have digitalized their supply chains in this sector. the focus of this research is to conduct an exploratory study on the impact of digitalization on the manufacturing industry. the study is based on data collected from a survey, which upon analysis using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling reveals that digitalization has a positive and direct influence on visibility and performance. inculcation of digitalization improved transparency between the supplier, retailer and distributor. it also highly positively impacts the planning operations for msme companies in the indian manufacturing sector. some of the most beneficial aspects were the performance of the order fulfillment rate followed up by the economic performance.","digitalization, msmes","The aim of the project was to understand the benefits reaped by digitalization in the MSME companies which have upgraded their supply chains. There was a targeted focus of investigating the direct effects of digitalization on the performance and chain visibility, and the mediating effect of visibility on the relationship between digitalization and performance. Our research revealed that digitalization has a positive and direct influence on visibility and performance. The study also identified visibility as a significant mediating variable, with partial mediation. It was further found that the up gradation to a digitalized supply chain reaped benefits in several factors.

104,Experimental Analysis Of Solar Air Heater Coupled With  Solar Water Heating System Augmented With Reflectors,"solar air heaters are renewable, active heating devices that use an absorber plate, a collector and an air blower to heat a space under consideration. they are meant to aid the existing heating devices and not replace it. in conventional solar air heaters, there is absorption of solar radiation by the black absorber plate and used to heat the air beneath it which is made to flow using a blower and heat is used to warm the space. in this study, the conventional solar air heater is modified with the help solar water heating system with a reflector which aids in extra heat gain by the absorber plate of solar air heater which in turn heats the air to a higher temperature. study was conducted over a three-day period between 10:00 to 18:00 hours and average meteorological and input values were taken. there was 48% increase in amount of heat gain by the solar air heater while the increased in efficiency of the solar air heater is nearly one and a half times than the conventional solar air heater which was the aim of the study. this modified solar air heaters could be useful in industrial as well as domestic applications as it is more efficient.",,The thermal performance of modified SAH and conventional SAH has been evaluated. The augmentation in this experiment was of reflectors. The reflector was faced on SWHS for three consecutive days. The comparisons are done in conventional and modified SAH and found that modified SAH is beneficial than conventional SAH. The following are the main findings for modified solar air heater compared to conventional SAH: • The modified SAH obtained 7.54 % higher output air temperature than the conventional SAH. • The daily average heat gain absorbed by the air in modified SAH was 48%greater than conventional SAH. • The efficiency of the conventional and MSAH was 18 percent and 27 percent respectively.,"jitenderverma school of renewable energy, national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india jitender_32019110@nitkkr.ac.in, jitenderverma96@gmail.com vijay kumar bajpai professor, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india vkbajpaifme@nitkkr.ac.in",
105,An Acceptance Study On Vehicle Scrappage Policy 2021  Pertaining To Personal Car Owners In Bengaluru,"in the globalization era, pollution from old vehicles is increasing faster. this may lead to changing the vehicle or to curtail vehicle pollution, which may result in the scrapping of old vehicles. to complement and supplement government of india passed vehicle scrappage policy in fy2021, a pilot study was conducted to know the public awareness of vehicle scrappage policy. an effective policy related to vehicle scrapping cannot be successfully implemented unless large number of people supports policies on government intervention. this paper aims to explore the public comprehension and acceptability about vehicle scrappage policy after creating awareness in bengaluru, india. in this study, methods adopted are pilot study through market survey, statistical analysis and encompasses relevant literature review. after the survey, people have awareness about the policy but unsure of fringe benefits one can attain from government.therefore, creating awareness and advertisement on the vehicle scrappage programs along with benefits both economically and environmentally to the country are warranted.","vehicle pollution, old vehicles, scrapping","and Recommendations The data clearly indicates that, out of 126 responses only 67.50 % respondents own vehicle. Majority of respondents were not having knowledge about the Vehicle Scrappage Policy. Market survey made people to get insight about the awareness. As a result, 81.20 % accepted that scrapping old vehicles will reduce environmental pollution. But 50.60 % believed that Scrapping Vehicle is an effective way of replacing old vehicle and 49.40 % opted for resale. From the study, it can be concluded that even though people appreciate the policy, the respondents are still unsure because the policy is new and people are not satisfied with the benefits announced by the Government. Further, the respondents are keen to observe the acceptance of policy in near future, until then people shall choose reselling their car instead of scrapping. This shows that the Government has to create awareness, advertise and stress the vehicle scrappage programs to leverage the benefits from the policy considering environment. From our market survey, people received awareness about the Vehicle Scrapping Policy and now they are expecting more from the Government. Instead of 25% rebate on the road tax, the Government should increase the tax rebate since; an individual will pay more than 25% in terms of taxes ranging from GST to road tax, cess, and toll gates etc. Strict laws on emission of vehicles should be imposed so that people will scrap their old vehicle to hinder tax. The automobile industry should use best-in-class technologies for scrapping old vehicles, where it can increase the availability of good raw materials which can be recycled and used for future propose. Government should advertise more about the scrapping areas to make aware for public.","anup jayaram, vinay k, yashasvi g v student, department of management studies m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india anupjay05@gmail.com, vinayk14581@gmail.com, yashasvi17.gv@gmail.com k m sharath kumar professor & head – department of management studies m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india dd.sr@msruas.ac.in",
106,Evaluating The Resilience Of A Loading Facility With  Estimated Time Of Arrival Information,"slot management systems such as the truck appointment system (tas) play a crucial role in the functioning of the logistic terminals such as loading and unloading facilities by managing the timing of truck arrivals. but truck arrivals are unpredictable due to the uncertain nature of road traffic. both early and late truck arrivals increase truck waiting times and create congestion around the loading facilities, which is undesirable. due to the emergence of industry 4.0 technologies, real-time truck arrival information can be shared to manage slot adjustments better as late arrivals reduce slot utilization and affect slot availability for future bookings. this study is focused on a loading facility facing uncertain truck arrivals and proposes mathematical models for optimal rescheduling of slots in the presence of truck arrivals information. the integer mathematical model developed for optimal rescheduling minimizes the truck waiting times by explicitly capturing the complexity of loading operations at a petrochemical facility. we integrated the rescheduling model into a discrete-event simulation model to compare the performance of the proposed approach with the current scenario to estimate the expected benefits at higher congestion and demand levels. the results show that the truck waiting time reduces by more than 50% at higher congestion levels.",slot management,,"ratnaji vanga, yousef maknoon and lóránt a. tavasszy faculty of technology, policy, and management delft university of technology, delft, netherlands r.vanga@tudelft.nl, m.y.maknoon@tudelft.nl, l.a.tavasszy@tudelft.nl sarah gelper school of industrial engineering eindhoven university of technology, eindhoven, netherlands s.gelper@tue.nl",
107,A Decomposition Based Algorithm To Minimize The One  Machine Weighted Tardiness Problem,"the one machine weighted tardiness problem has been studied extensively by researchers over the last few decades. it is a problem that is simple to state, but not easy to solve. it is a problem of sequencing a set of independent jobs on a single machine with the objective of minimizing total weighted tardiness. in view of its np-hard nature, a decomposition-based heuristic is proposed and computationally compared with some well-known heuristics available in literature. the proposed heuristic consists of two phases. in the first phase, certain dominance conditions for a selective forward neighborhood swap are developed and applied. the second phase consists of a local improvement procedure using a single pass insertion technique to further improve the schedule. the simplicity of the algorithm enables manual solutions to small problems. several problem-sets with different schedules and three measures of performance are used in this comparison. initial results are promising and indicate that the proposed heuristic is the best for all measures of performance.","scheduling, weighted tardiness, ph.d.",,"jaideep t. naidu professor, school of business thomas jefferson university, philadelphia, pa, u.s.a. jaideep.naidu@jefferson.edu",
108,Flow Analysis Of Ramjet Engine For Optimized Nose Cone  Design,"this study aims to understand the effects of variable nose cone geometry on the performance of a ramjet engine. the performance of a ramjet engine is primarily measured by its critical factors, namely, the pressure recovery ratio and velocity variations. specifically, the combustion performance and overall efficiency of a ramjet engine depend on the pressure recovery ratio. design modifications are carried out by using the formulae from the literature and simulations are carried out initially to validate the results from the literature for the specified nose cone angle. further, the nose cone angle is varied from 6° to 20° with increments of 2°, and its impact on the overall performance and efficiency of the ramjet engine is analyzed. variations of pressure recovery ratio along the cowl and ramp surface of the engine are plotted along with their contours to determine the most favorable nose cone angle. considering the optimal nose cone angle, the concavities are also varied along the ramp of the engine’s inlet for a range of 2 mm with increments of around 0.5mm in between them. the best pressure recovery ratio which benefits the working of the engine is understood. graphs are plotted to compare the various results obtained between the pressure recovery ratio along the cowl and ramp surface for varying angles and concavities. the best pressure recovery attained concurs with literature for a nose cone angle of 11° while its combination with the concavity of 4.318 mm gives the optimum performance.",ramjet engine,"Considering the advent of research in the field of Ramjet Engines, this paper describes the effect of varying inlet nose cone angles and concavities on pressure recovery ratio. Initially, the model geometry is considered by varying the inlet nose cone angles from 6° to 20° in steps of 2°. Upon selection of the ideal nose cone angle, the best configuration is suggested by analyzing the performance of the nose cone angle at various concavities. The concavity is varied from 2.794 mm to 4.826 mm in the steps of 0.508 mm. The inlet nose cone angle of 11° is used to validate the model by simulating the setup suggested in the literature. The boundary conditions mentioned in the literature are applied in the simulations. The obtained pressure recovery ratio plots and pressure contours fall in good agreement with the literature results. The same setup is used for the study of configurations with variable nose cone angles. It is noted that high back pressure in case of 20° causes the heated air to leak out of the inlet region, reducing system efficiency and leading to an aerodynamic stall. With respect to the effect of angle, it can be concluded that the 11° nose cone angle has the best pressure recovery ratio. The results obtained from variable nose cone angles are further extended to note the effects of variable concavity. The concavity of 3.81mm was suggested in the literature. The effects of various concavities, ranging from 2.794 mm to 4.826 mm, are investigated in this study. It is found that an aerodynamic stall is obtained in the case of 4.826 mm. Importantly, in the present study, it is noted that a concavity of 4.318 mm gave the best pressure recovery at 11° nose cone angle. It can be concluded that variation in inlet nose cone angles leads to non-monotonic changes in pressure recovery ratio. At a smaller nose cone angle, lesser number of secondary shockwaves are being produced and as a result, the primary shockwave hits the cowl tip. Since the number of primary shockwaves being produced are less at smaller nose cone angles, the pressure recovery ratio is low. With an increase in the size of concavity, the number of secondary shockwaves increases, and hence the pressure recovery also increases. But at large nose cone angles (θ1 > 11°), more number of secondary shockwaves deflect the primary shockwave within the cowl surface. As a result, overall shockwave propagation is disturbed due to the deflections, reducing the pressure recovery ratio. Also, the presence of concavity along the ramp surface alters the flow leading to a total pressure rise in the concavity models. Hence, with the increase in concavity, a gradual increase in the pressure recovery ratio is observed. Proposed Improvements Further improvements to precisely gauge the pressure recovery ratio by considering the addition of the diffuser at the inlet nose cone. While the compression ramp and isolator region play a significant role in compressing the inlet stream of air, the diffuser further contributes to the pressure recovery ratio. A study on the design of the diffuser in the inlet nose cone would suggest the ideal geometry for supersonic applications.","dr. avinash govindraju and dr. santosh kumar assistant professor, department of mechanical engineering bms institute of technology & management, bengaluru, india – 560064 avinash.govindaraju@bmsit.in; santoshkumar@iisc.ac.in tarun pachauri, kartikay awasthi, nihal. u. shetty, vipan singh and karan manoj department of mechanical engineering bms institute of technology & management, bengaluru, india – 560064 tarunpachauri786@gmail.com; 1by18me026@bmsit.in; 1by18me034@bmsit.in; 1by18me062@bmsit.in; karanmanoj13@gmail.com",

110,A Study On Hydroponic Farming In Indian  Agriculture,"hydroponics is a method of growing plants in water without soil. it is type of horticulture and subset of hydroculture. the water must be enriched with nutrients and the plants need some type of inert medium to support the root system. the research gaps were identified after the detailed review of literature. extant literatures show that hydroponics farming is more efficient and high yielding. but very limited studies are made in comparison with the traditional farming. few studies also examined that there is less awareness about hydroponics farming to the people. also, there was not detailed study about challenges regarding hydroponics farming and subsidies which help to setup it. thus, we are trying to fill this gap through our study.","hydroponics, vertical farming, agriculture","The research paper focuses on the role of hydroponics in the Indian agriculture. Hydroponics is a highly effective approach utilized in a variety of agricultural domains and also during the natural disasters. However, hydroponics requires less manpower, but it is still costly and complex, with high productivity. The awareness about hydroponics among the people was less; many people did not have a clear picture about Hydroponics. From this research we found out that many people do not prefer Hydroponics farming as the initial investment cost is very high and the financial support provided by the subsidies in the Government for Hydroponics farming are very less compared to traditional farming. Even though there is huge demand for Hydroponics produce as it is organic, medium and small-scale farmers faced the majority of difficulty in distribution and marketing. Among all the hydroponics produce greens have a huge demand. The main purpose of this paper was to create awareness among farmers in India about the benefits of hydroponic farming when compared to traditional farming and to understand the various challenges faced by them in India in setting up a hydroponic farm.","figure vishwanath kumar h m m.b.a in business analytics student, department of management studies ramaiah university of applied sciences (ruas), bangalore, india vkgowda1020@gmail.com ajay r assistant professor, department of management studies ramaiah university of applied sciences (ruas), bangalore, india ajay.ca.mc@msruas.ac.in praphul kumar k m.b.a in business analytics student, department of management studies ramaiah university of applied sciences (ruas), bangalore, india kpraphulkumar.kumar@gmail.com cheshire h m.b.a in financial management student, department of management studies ramaiah university of applied sciences (ruas), bangalore, india cheshire1211@gmail.com",
111,An Interaction Between Teacher And Student Digital  Involvement In A Pandemic-Building Resilient Classrooms,"the adoption of the new hybrid education model during the pandemic altered the teaching-learning techniques that posed instructors and students with a slew of obstacles as they attempted to adapt to the digital modes of communication. the objective of this research is to discover new challenges faced by teachers and students which stayed as roadblocks in the technology adoption process. the research provides a new framework for depicting several stages of student-teacher digital involvement. a qualitative approach is employed in order to arrive at a grounded theory. purposive and snowball sampling techniques are used to contact teachers and students. the findings indicate that teachers and students are now confronted with a variety of new obstacles like unstable internet connectivity, work-life imbalance, unethical methods, and response verification dilemma. the exploration resulted in the development of a new framework that identified four quadrants depicting phases of student-teacher digital interaction. the outcomes of this study assist institutional management authorities in identifying the numerous problems that they would face when implementing online teaching-learning methods. the research is the first attempt to unite student-teacher conflicts by proposing a four-quadrant framework, thereby giving a road map for educational institutions seeking to increase students' self-reliance. .","self-reliance, teaching-learning, education policy","Based on the findings, the study suggests that both students and teachers commit to bring education to a condition of complete satisfaction on both ends to reach a degree of complete self-reliance. The flaws highlighted in the preceding sections are raised from both the instructor and student perspectives. The largest obstacle faced by teachers and students is the network problem and the need for both sides to adapt to the changing instructional patterns. Therefore, it is crucial to offer teachers and students, full access to technology and sufficient training for teaching, learning, and evaluating. Another difficulty was recreating the environment that existed in formal teaching-learning physical classrooms, as practically all interviewees favoured offline classes for superior information transmission in both directions. This issue requires significant effort to resolve. One of the new concepts uncovered by this research was the Answer Verification Dilemma faced by teachers, which rendered them incapable of confirming the authenticity of a student's response to the non-performance of a task. The difficulty was to determine whether the kids' comments were logical or an attempt to evade responsibility. This research report also offered a novel model depicting the many levels of student-teacher interaction, dubbed the Self-reliance window, which depicts the relationship between the levels of student digital involvement and instructor digital involvement. This window presents four levels of digital involvement - Quadrant 1- Webinar Sickness, Quadrant 2- Innovative Routine, Quadrant 3- Derailing, and Quadrant 4- Ceiling - allowing the education sector to assess the current student-teacher digital involvement relationship and take steps to strengthen it. In brief, the study described the many obstacles that teachers and students experienced as a result of the implementation of the new Tech-based CEM. The paper's findings were based on previous research and open-ended interviews with teachers and students in the new institutional system.

112,Predicting Green Innovation Levels Among Automobile  And Earthmoving Sectors,"with a growing concern for environment and mounting pressure from stakeholders in the manufacturing ecosystem, there has been a movement for the manufacturing firms to take the route of green manufacturing and green innovation. green manufacturing innovation involved developing a green awareness, having green manufacturing systems in place, developing a green manufacturing culture and continuous improvement towards excellence. automobile and earthmoving sectors being one of the large contributors to manufacturing economy in india clearly lacked a framework to pursue green manufacturing practices. to understand the green manufacturing practices, to differentiate the ‘leaders’ and ‘followers’ in green manufacturing innovation, and to predict green innovation index (score), this research surveyed 70 predominantly small and medium manufacturing firms and a few large firms of automobile and earthmoving sectors in karnataka, comprising both ancillaries and assemblers. multiple linear regression was employed with a ‘green innovation index’ of a firm as the dependent variable and factor scores (from exploratory factor analysis) as independent variables. key factors that determined the green innovation index were - ability to recycle, recovery management, green stakeholder support, green commitment of employees, green value chain, cost and resource assessment, green design, strategic alignment towards green manufacturing, reuse and implementation of 3r’s.","green innovation, automobile, nstmis",,"hosur srinivasan srivatsa professor faculty of management and commerce m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india srivatsa.ms.mc@msruas.ac.in arun. r asst. professor, in mechanical and manufacturing engineering department m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india rarun.me.et@msruas.ac.in sandeep n asst. professor, in mechanical and manufacturing engineering department m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india sandeepn.me.et@msruas.ac.in vijaya kumar s asst. professor, in mechanical and manufacturing engineering department m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india vijayakumar.me.et@msruas.ac.in",
113,Comparative Studies Of Aloe Vera Powder And Alum To  Remove Turbidity In Raw Water,"coagulation plays a very crucial role in the treatment of potable water, especially in consumption of drinking water for human kind. aluminium sulfate is the most common chemical coagulant. aloe vera is widely acknowledged as a plant with numerous uses. it is useful in medicine, but utilization of aloe vera using in various water and waste water treatments can be used as a low cost adsorbent instead of high cost adsorbent. in this study, some natural coagulants have been explained for the coagulation process. water is an important resource for the survival of life. this study focused on developing an efficient and cost-effective processing technique by using aloe vera gel to produce natural coagulant for use in raw water treatment. the turbidity removal efficiency of alum and aloe vera powder are 89.65% at coagulant dose 40mg/l and 77.68% at coagulant dose 150mg/l respectively. the results showed that the alum is more effective than aloe vera but some drawbacks have been seen in using alum, as it induces alzheimer's disease because of its carcinogenic properties. so aloe vera powder is reduced the alzheimer's disease.","turbidity, alum, aloe vera powder, coagulant, coagulation",", taking into account all the benefits, the use and development of natural coagulants have promising futures as a green technology with a workable, long-term solution for reducing water pollution. 6. Conclusion This study was mainly focused on the preparation of Aloe vera; study on its performance and effectiveness as a coagulant in the water. Alum was give better result compared to Aloe vera. The turbidity of raw water is reduced by 87.62% with Alum; and 78.48% with Aloe vera powder as the coagulant. Hence, it is better to use the natural coagulant aloe vera during raw water treatment. This is also effective in terms of cost and environmentally friendly and coagulation-flocculation activities. Aloe vera may be effectively employed as a natural coagulant for the treatment of raw water, according to this experimental investigation. As a result, natural coagulants may substitute alum without affecting how well the procedure works.","achint mtech (environmental engineering), department of civil engineering national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india achint_32012101@nitkkr.ac.in, achintanand051997@gmail.com s.deswal professor in civil engineering national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india sdeswal@nitkkr.ac.in",

116,Analysis Of The Key Drivers Of International Business  Strategy For Higher Education Institutions,"firms across sectors have gone global, entered foreign markets, exported, and imported products & services through various international business strategies. the dynamics of the higher education sector in india have seen a rapid shift with changing regulations, a revolutionary new education policy (nep), and a spurt in the quality & features of virtual education. there is a growing excitement of opening campuses and goal posts across borders, while facing an uncertain future due to the impending entry of foreign universities and institutions in the country. extant research in higher education lacks insight into the application of concept of global strategy for competing in the larger competitive environment. this paper aims to bridge this gap by identifying the drivers for development of various innovative & flexible international business strategies that can be applied to higher education institutions (heis). previous studies show that heis are faced with a challenge that there is no single pattern in the wide range of choices made by students based on different variables, such as motivation, culture, language, online education, economic & political situations, employability, and other aspects. findings indicate that study abroad, semester abroad, immersion programs, credit transfer pathways & twinning arrangements through university collaborations, are few of the models for gaining international education that have encouraged students to stay home while being able to achieve the distinction & benefits of international education. the research builds a conceptual framework for the various drivers of international business strategy and proposes a model for global citizen development (gcd) which is validated using content validity ratio (cvr) with a case study approach.",higher education,"and Future Research Indian HEIs have the potential to make their own mark in the world and end the growing debate of why they are not able to break into the top table of rankings. With growing competitive forces, there is a strong need for global positioning that is balanced with fulfilling the need gap of the students. However, Internationalization of higher education has been very sparsely studied through strategic lenses. There is a need to look at this area beyond neoliberalism & a presently limited vision. This study has proposed a comprehensive framework of drivers for strategies of international business that provide a new direction of global citizen development. The simple international business strategy of expansion into new markets through opening of a branch campus or acquisition has not been a preferred route for Indian higher education institutions until now when IITs are being invited by other countries. Smaller degrees of collaboration like curriculum validation, faculty & student mobility, as well as joint research have low execution costs and high levels of outcomes that can assist in increasing brand equity, which is going to be an important parameter of consideration when finalizing any dual or joint degree arrangement. This framework provides a foundation for future researchers to validate and develop in detail along each parameter & proposed strategic dimension. There is potential to deploy better qualitative and quantitative research methods to draw deeper insights that can make contributions to practice, policy, and scholarship.","bhawna kumar research scholar, amity university, uttar pradesh, noida, india bhawna.kumar@gmail.com gurinder singh group vice chancellor, amity university gsingh@amity.edu",

So that farmers may quickly obtain the claim amount and have their losses covered. Crop insurance schemes were created to help farmers reduce their losses. It offers financial assistance and encouragement to crop loss farmers, the loss caused by natural disasters, pests, and diseases. The PMFBY scheme plays a major role in agriculture and benefits farmers. This study carries the initial step in identifying a different variable and correlating the effect of the PMFBY scheme in Karnataka. The study also involved a Unite root test, criteria order selection has base test for the analysis. Once after this analysing VAR estimation with the help of each individual variable has been considered with the formula to find the least square. The least-squares method is a statistical procedure to find the best fit for a set of data points by minimising the sum of the offsets or residuals of points from the plotted curve. Least squares regression is used to predict the behaviour of dependent variables. This was considered for each variable to know the probability and the fit. The second test was done on the root of polynomial characteristics. To find its stabilising condition. The third variable, the VAR Granger Casualty, was considered to know all the five variables, which help us predict the dependent variable. VAR Residual Serial Correlation LM Tests help to know, as a result, neither test can rule out the possibility of no serial correlation. In other words, from lag 1 to 3, there is no evidence of serial correlation. Thus, it can be concluded that the VAR model satisfies the stability condition. Therefore, all the variable’s holds good for the study.","ms. vanishree. k research scholar assistant professor, department of management studies m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bangalore, india vshree2821@gmail.com dr. n. suresh faculty of management and commerce m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, bangalore, india nsuresh.ms.mc@msruas.ac.in",

As delays are observed in order processing process due to errors in information flow. Order processing delay is an indicator that orders processing function is not an effective and efficient process. These errors are eliminated by automating manual form filling process i.e., Order Summary and Customer Order Acknowledgment form using excel. Standard template is developed to understand all requirements of the customer along with terms and condition in Customer OA form. Due to automation human interference in the process got less, no need to assign resource to fill up form and give lot of time to verify and do amendment in the mistaken form as well as in BOM. Due to this 80% of the time is reduced in form the filling process. Also, no need to inform about delays due to this process and it also improve the image of the organization in customer. To show the cost impact of the issue, impact stage rating added in prioritization of issues along with rating of severity and occurrence. By multiplying all three criteria, it gives effective prioritized open siren issue for corrective action, and it also help to show which issue has highest cost impact. Ultimately both actions i.e., automating form filling process and open siren issue prioritization helps to reduce order execution time. 1025","nitin krushnaji hinge second year m. tech project management department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management college of engineering, pune, maharashtra, india hingenk20.mfg@coep.ac.in","References

121,Assessment And Evaluation Of Factors Leading To Rural  Women Entrepreneurship,"research on rural women entrepreneurship has attracted the attention of several scholars as well as various governing bodies. in the literature, there have been several studies documenting the success and failure of rural women entrepreneurs. however, it is necessary to know the hierarchy of factors that impact the commencement of the businesses they manage. the purpose of this research is to identify the factors that influence rural women's decision in establishing a business venture. it is an attempt to compile a comprehensive list of criteria and rate them in terms of their impact on the advancement of rural women entrepreneurs. a literature review backed by expert opinion resulted in the identification of sixteen different variables and the authors used fuzzy ahp to come up with a comprehensive list of criteria and their degree of importance. an examination of the relative importance of these characteristics can assist policymakers by highlighting important aspects that affect the initiation of the business by rural women entrepreneurs. the findings have the potential to aid in effective decision making by policymakers through emphasizing critical elements relevant for entrepreneurial success.","women, entrepreneurship, advancement, rural","Entrepreneurship is an emerging concept and in the present era women are consistently trying to break the biases and creating their own ventures for their personal growth as well as income flexibility. In the same way rural women are no different. They are creating small and medium enterprises by starting something on their own and empowering themselves to lead better lives and become independent. However, there are many factors which affects the initiation of their enterprises and act as challenges and barriers in their way forward. For successful implementation of policies and programs these factors need to be identified and prioritized to get meaningful insights about the status of rural women entrepreneurs. As a result, this research attempts to identify several elements that impact the initiation of businesses by rural women entrepreneurs through a literature review. The authors achieved objective 1 by obtaining factors influencing rural women entrepreneurs’ venture initiation and objective 2 by prioritizing and ranking these factors. Identifying factors available in the literature and grouping them along with the assistance of expert panel for offering their comments makes the process more meaningful. The study developed four groups of factors namely, personal, social, resource and technological. Fuzzy AHP is used as a technique to find both local and global weights for the factors with the guidance of expert opinion from the academia as well as budding women entrepreneurs. These factors are then ranked in order to identify which factors are most significant and which are least important in terms of their impact on rural women entrepreneurs. Analysis of the strength and inter-relationship between the factors along with the identification of variables from a specific industry have been recommended as prospective research areas.","neha anchliya research scholar, department of management studies malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, india nehaanchliya@gmail.com akshay patidar research scholar, department of management studies malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, india patidarakshay03@gmail.com monica sharma associate professor department of management studies malaviya national institute of technology jaipur, india msharma.dms@mnit.ac.in",
122,Work Life Balance Of Parents With Special Need Children  Ms. Rashmi R,"work-life balance is relatively undiscussed topic among the parents of special need children compared to parents of neuro-typical children. this article presents the results concluded by our own research aimed at determining factors influencing work-life balance in parents of special need children. the result is based on the analysis influence of total 25 variables categorized into 3 major factors: day-to-day factors, work-life factors, occupational factors, personal factors. the study explores this topic by addressing factors influencing work-life balance and its hardship faced by parents of special needs children. the ultimate aim of our work is to raise awareness and inspire parents with special needs children to look at their specific hardships and stage in life to understand what type of work-life balance programs and emotional support they would need in an organization or their colleagues can provide. with context of management if an organization in terms of their employers, understands what extra support parents of special needs children need, they will be able to get maximum productivity from their employee.","work-life balance, parents, special need child","From this study, we will hopefully see that the work-life balance is a lot more entailed when a special needs child is involved. Employees with special needs child need to know what specific work-life balance programs they need to be able to work. They can do this by understanding what extra hardships are in their lives, and by being realistic at what stage they are at in life. A lot of these decisions will revolve around the type of special needs child they have. Employees will also need to understand that companies will not always offer those programs, so it is important to evaluate everything and make clear distinctions between needs and wants. On the other hand, employers need to know just what their expectations of their employees are, so that they will know if the employee is reaching them. They also need to know what time and effort they are willing to put into establish work-life balance programs, and which programs fit well with company policies and are beneficial to the company. Employers will see that while it might take extra work-life balance effort to hire a parent of a special needs child, it can still be beneficial and the employee can still have maximum performance in the company. The purpose of this paper was to show that establishing a work-life balance, especially among working parents with special needs children, is essential to both the health and production of a company. Successful organization are those that understand the hardships faced by parents of special needs children, create programs that help their employees attain balance between work and life, and understand their employees’ needs at different stages of their lives. 6.1. Recommendations Our study solely focused on the Work-Life Balance of Parents with Special Needs Children, and did not include any comparison group (e.g., parents with typical children). Prior research in this field suggested that the experiences of these employed parents are distinctively different from employed parents of typically developing children; particularly in their ability to find appropriate child care. However, it would be beneficial to compare the demands, resources, and strain outcomes of working parents with special needs children to working parents caring for a typical child. The sample encompassed a diverse group of working parents caring for children with special needs. We interviewed parents through support groups in Bengaluru Karnataka. However, this method of recruitment meant that any parent who are not associated to these support groups (or who choose not to be part with them) were not included in this study, thus restricting the range of types of parents we sampled. Considering the geographical location surveyed and the number of parents available in that location, this result is derived. Thus, the results might get changed based on different location and the increase sample size. Also, the data for this study was gathered using only a self-report survey questionnaire, which may lead to Mono- Method Bias. Mono-method bias may have inflated the strength of the observed relationships among demands, role- specific strain, between-role strain and resources. So, in this context proposed future improvement is, data should be gathered through multiple sources (e.g., from both parents, observation, location etc.)","assistant professor department of management studies ramaiah university of applied sciences bangalore, karnataka, india rashmi.co.mc@msruas.ac.in heena parveen, k s punith kumar student, department of management studies ramaiah university of applied sciences bangalore, karnataka, india heena0004@gmail.com, punithks2012@gmail.com",

124,Importance Of People And Hrm In The Digital  Transformation,"digital transformation is disrupting manufacturing, business, and almost every field. it is imperative for all organizations to transform to be relevant in the competition. digital transformation is not a piece of software technology that we can buy, plug in and it will work. as pointed out by scholars and industry practitioners, transformation is a continuous journey, and to be successful, we need to identify critical elements of transformation and success factors and work on it. while there are several factors, when organizations are transforming, human resource and hrm plays a critical role. implementing digital transformation without considering the people factor will be the disastrous approach. this research aims to determine the effect of human resource factors and hr management on the organization’s digital transformation. using ms excel, regression analysis was carried out. researcher has found a strong connection between organization digital transformation and human resource management factors.",people,Digital transformations are managed as plug-in software; organizations focus more on digital tools than resources and human resource management. Digital transformation is an enterprise-wide initiative with the objective of doing business in an innovative way. Companies look for the ROI from transformation implementation and more customer engagement to enhance the business. Objective of the digital transformations can be achieved through proper resource management. This article studies the resource and human resource management impact on the success of digital transformations. The analysis result indicates that human resources and practicing of its key elements have a significant impact on the success of the digital transformation.,rajeev joshi dba student at swiss scholl of business management geneva switzerland raj12ju@gmail.com,
125,Fatigue Life Analysis Of Pre-Cracked Aluminium Alloy Panel  Repaired With Ud-Cfrp And Ud-Gfrp Patches,"structural components are known to fail through the growth of a fatigue crack. one effective way to repair a component is by bonding fiber composite patches. in this study a pre-cracked aluminium skin 6061-t6 of one mm thin plate is repaired by symmetrically bonding patches of fiber reinforced polymer. the repair is simulated through numerical investigations to compare the performance of unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced polymer (ud-cfrp) patched specimen with that of uni-directional glass fiber reinforced polymer (ud-gfrp) patched specimen for the same stiffness ratio (s) and the same fiber volume fraction ( 𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓). the j-integral for the max and mini stress of fatigue load is calculated by finite element analysis in ansys-15. the maximum stress intensity factor (𝐾𝐾𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ) and minimum sif (𝐾𝐾𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 ) are calculated from the relation between j-integral and sif for various crack lengths. then the paris law is invoked using the relation between δk and the crack length (a) to determine the crack length versus fatigue cycles. the comparison of the results of ud-cfrp and ud-gfrp specimens shows that the ud-gfrp patched specimen achieves marginally better performance. however, ud-cfrp patches were much thinner.","stiffness ratio, volume fraction",A thin centered pre-crack skin of aluminium 6061-T6 is repaired using symmetrical UD-CFRP specimen and symmetrical UD-GFRP patch specimen.

127,Price And Production Forecasting Model Of Okra – A Case  Study,"okra (abelmoschus esculentus) is perishable in nature and its variable prices as well as arrivals depend on the supply and demand in the market. approximately 73% of worldwide okra is cultivated in india. this research incorporates seasonal variation in the forecasting of arrivals and three categories of prices, which were de- seasonalized to achieve a regression line. initial values of level, trend and seasonality were exploited from the regression line and were used to perform static time series forecasting analysis. the same initial values were then updated for every new data entry for the adaptive time series forecasting model (winters model). the errors and fit of model were seen on the basis of mse, mad, mape and r2 values. a database for the arrivals as well as the maximum, minimum and modal prices of okra was gathered for 12 years (jan’10 to dec’21). the static model gave a mape of about 19.33% for the prices and almost 207% for arrivals of okra. on the other hand, the adaptive winter’s model, which incorporated the previous as well as the current data, streamlining itself after every new entry, gave an average error of 13.9% for the prices and about 18.9% for arrivals. this adaptive model predicted the modal price of jan 2022 and feb 2022 to be rs. 5800/quintal and rs. 5600/quintal, and the actual values observed are rs. 5700/quintal and rs. 5200/quintal.","okra, de-seasonalization, dairy products","and Future work 4.1 Conclusion There is a high need to apply the concepts and methodologies of supply chain management to the agricultural sector to reduce the wastage of food and other resources. Most of the products in this sector are perishable and there is a need to anticipate the needs and plan accordingly well in advance. On analysing the data available, it was observed that there was seasonality present which repeated itself every year. The static model and adaptive winter’s model were used to analyse and forecast the data of okra productions and prices. The errors and fit of model were seen on the basis of MSE, MAD, MAPE and R2 values. The Static model gave a mean absolute error of about 19.33% for the prices and almost 207% for arrivals of Okra.

130,Implementation Of Standard Work In Healthcare Industry  Pratiksha Shankar Patkal,"standard work is an effective method for the continuous improvement of manufacturing systems. it is a useful tool to document the most efficient method to create a product or service and describes how tasks are executed consistently by anyone. standard work helps to maintain the quality, provides efficient operations, and ensures the proper use of tools and equipment. it finds application in various organizations to manage their tasks effectively and efficiently. standard work helps to train employees to identify and eliminate non-value-added activities such as unnecessary motion, waiting, and defects, thus significantly reducing the time to complete the task. standard work acts as a diagnostic tool, by exposing the issues and promoting continuous improvement. even though this is a very helpful tool, it is often overlooked and underutilized. the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of this lean manufacturing tool. in this paper, a lifecycle management project in the healthcare sector is used as an example of application. the healthcare sector consists of various critical manufacturing processes and defects that require critical attention and quick solutions. the main findings are, that lead time can be decreased by approximately 22- 25% with the implementation of standard work and is effectively a good tool to train the employees easily and to normalize the work procedures with increased flexibility and production, and decreased waste, errors, and lead time.","standard work, lean manufacturing","When used properly, seemingly basic methods can occasionally result in significant breakthroughs at cheaper prices. Lean production's central tenet, which encourages making more with less, is taken into account when implementing the standard job. Because of this, the corporation need not make a significant investment. The company now has a foundation for documenting the numerous project-related procedures thanks to the standardisation of the processes through Standard work. These documents are crucial for giving staff more flexibility, as well as for boosting productivity and reducing variability to the point where they can reduce a variety of wastes and manufacturing failures. Thus the advantages of applying Standard Work proved to be: • Train employees easily • Reduce lead time • Reduce variability in process • Better control on project processes • Reduce rework Standard Work is useful for simply documenting the Project procedures contained in projects. It is more interactive and simpler to grasp when typical work is documented using a SIPOC (Supplier, Input, Process, Output, Customer) diagram and a process flow chart with swimlanes. Employees can quickly comprehend the project process by standardising the job instead of constantly asking someone who is familiar with the procedure for assistance. By employing standard work, waste and rework can be decreased. Because there can be no improvement without a standard, standard work can be utilised as a tool for ongoing improvement. 1114","m.tech project management, department of manufacturing engg. and industrial mgmt. college of engineering, pune, india patkalps20.mfg@coep.ac.in dr. s. s. anasane assistant professor, department of manufacturing engg. and industrial mgmt. college of engineering, pune, india ssa.mfg@coep.ac.in","References

132,Decentralized Scheduling For Flexible Job Shop With  Sequence-Dependent Setup Time,"scheduling is a persistent problem in manufacturing systems and is considered one of the most challenging combinatorial problems. the scheduling problem of flexible job shops where operations are scheduled on the available flexible machines is commonly referred to as fjsp and is considered as an important scheduling problem due to its nearness to advanced manufacturing systems. during production, the achines need setup for processing two different jobs consecutively. such setup time is called sequence-dependent setup time (sdst). this paper presents a decentralized multi-agent-based model for the fjsp-sdst. for optimization, a popular swarm-based algorithm, particle swarm optimization (pso), is embedded with the multi-agent model to achieve a global solution. an illustrative example has been explained along with the computational results for the ten standard test cases to show the effectiveness and robustness of the approach.",,"This paper has addressed the FJSP with sequence dependent setup time (SDST) with an objective to minimize the makespan. The decentralized multi agent-based model is presented to solve the FJSP-SDST. The approach consists of three agents: coordinator agent, job agents and machine agents. These agents are employed with auction strategy to solve the two sub-problems of operation sequencing and machine selection along with fulfilling the SDST constraint. To perform global search, the multi-agent system is embedded with optimization algorithm Particle swarm optimization (PSO) to achieve minimization of Makespan. An illustrative example is solved. The performance of the algorithm is compared with benchmark algorithms by solving ten standard benchmark instances. The results are competitive for small problems and are much better for large problems. This approach shows the effectiveness of decentralized approach to solve complex problems of FJSP. In future works, the proposed decentralized algorithm will be applied on the other standard benchmark instances for testing the large problem size with multiple objectives and constraints.","manojkumar r. pal, murari l. mittal, gunjan soni department of mechanical engineering malaviya national institute of technology (mnit), jaipur, india 2017rme9086@mnit.ac.in, mlmittal.mech@mnit.ac.in, gunjansoni.mech@mnit.ac.in satyendra s. chouhan department of computer science engineering malaviya national institute of technology (mnit), jaipur, india sschouhan.cse@mnit.ac.in",
133,Oil Properties Analysis And Ferrography Analysis To  Monitor The Condition Of Single Speed Worm Gearbox,"condition monitoring of the system is important, historical data is available for the system but we cannot always depend on it for near-net prediction of system failure. in this paper, oil properties analysis and ferrography analysis is used to maintain and extend the life of the system. due to sliding motion in the case of a single-speed worm gearbox temperature increases and it leads to a decrease in the performance of oil properties. as result, the overall performance of the gearbox gets affected. in oil property analysis, response parameters like viscosity index, and tan are analyzed, whereas direct reading ferrography offers parameters like large particle count and small particle count, wear severity index, and wear particle concentration. analytical ferrography gives us morphology related to wear particles. microscopic examination of wear particles helps to find out the type of wear and source of wear. as per industrial application, the speed of the gearbox, the geometry of gear pairs, the material of gears, and oil level, the type of lubricating oil and load on the gearbox determines the process input parameters. on the basis of the required process parameters, an experimental setup using a single-speed worm gearbox is developed. oil examination is carried out at fixed time intervals for recording response parameters. the oil samples obtained by experimentation can be examined through oil properties analysis and ferrography analysis. the current study includes formulating relation of oil properties to the wear of gear pairs to make a condition-based maintenance policy to maintain and extend the life of the gearbox.","ferrography, worm gearbox, friction","In this study, constant speed and load are applied to the single-speed worm gearbox system. Oil properties analysis and ferrography analysis have been used to investigate the condition of a single-speed worm gearbox under the normal operating condition. Oil properties analysis provides viscosity index and TAN No. which shows the viscosity of oil decreases with degradation of oil, and an increase in TAN leads to corrosion. Ferrography analysis provided wear rate, oil condition, type of wear mechanism, and source of wear. In the case of oil properties analysis, kinematic viscosity goes on decreasing with time and TAN No. increases with time. the wear rate is low initially and it goes on increasing with time. Correlating these two condition monitoring techniques resulted in the comprehensive diagnosis of the operating condition of the worm gearbox. Because they are dependent on each other. As no. of running hours are increasing degradation of oil also increases, change in oil properties depends on the number of running hours and wear rate depends on the change in oil properties. It is seen that process parameter with no. of running hour cause a change in oil properties and a change in oil properties causes an increase in wear. From this study, we can conclude that change in oil properties impacts on wear of the gearbox which shows that both are the function of gearbox running hours. A combination of oil properties analysis and ferrography analysis is very useful to find out the source of the problem if arises and to take corrective action as well as to make the condition-based maintenance policy to maintain and extend the life of the system.","mr.somesh s bhale mtech, manufacturing engineering and automation department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management, college of engineering pune bhaless20.mfg@coep.ac.in dr. jayant karajagikar assistant professor, department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management, college of engineering pune jsk.mfg@coep.ac.in",

Load and speed are significant factors in terms of wear. • It is found that the coefficient of friction continuously reduced as the load increased. This is because when the load increased, a lot of wear debris gathered in the contact zone and mixed with lubricant, acting as a third body. Therefore, the decrease in friction coefficient was caused by three body abrasive wear mechanisms. 1500 1000 500 0.0019 0.0018 0.0017 0.0016 0.0015 0.0014 0.0013 0.0012 0.0011 4 3 2 24 16 8 Speed (rpm) Mean Pressure (N/mm2) Time (Hr) Main Effects Plot for Wear(gm) Data Means 1156","shivshankar s. dumne, dr. b. rajiv, dr. m.d. jaybhaye. department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management college of engineering, pune, maharashtra, india dumness20.mfg@coep.ac.in, rbh.mfg@coep.ac.in, mdj.mfg@coep.ac.in","References

135,Modelling And Analysis Of Supply Chain Disruptions  Through Simulations,"a supply chain is a network between a company and its suppliers to produce and distribute a specific product/service to consumers. this network constitutes people, entities, information, activities, and resources. a supply chain disruption occurs when demand or supply spikes or falls unexpectedly, resulting in a massive imbalance between the two. as supply chains become more global, the risk of such interruptions has aggravated considerably. in fact, catastrophic occurrences have highlighted the importance of analyzing disruption risk and developing mitigation plans to deal with it. in this research, we use the simulation software arena to model a supply chain and analyze the consequences of network disturbances. the present research seeks to assist an organization in determining its level of risk in terms of disruptions that compromise product availability. a discrete-event simulation model of a multi-echelon supply chain consisting of a retailer, a manufacturing plant maintaining an input and output buffer, and a supplier is developed. disruptions are introduced at different echelons of the system, and the dependence of customer fill rate and the demand fill rate on disruption durations are investigated in detail. the research offers a detailed understanding of the consequences of disruptions by capturing both risk profiles and material flow. mitigation strategies, namely, safety inventory (inventory control) and contingency strategies for backing up specific suppliers or links in the supply chain (sourcing), are examined in the present paper. furthermore, the effect of these mitigation strategies on the customer service level is also analyzed.","supply chain, risks, disruptions","It is observed that disruptions even at one segment of the supply chain system significantly impact the performance of the entire supply chain system. A disruption in the upstream can significantly affect all the downstream segments. Therefore, it is essential to focus on each supply chain segment while developing mitigation strategies. Investing in backup facilities throughout the supply chain network should be done to minimise disruption risks in the system. It is observed from the results that when the mean inter-arrival time of the disruptions increases, the demand fill rate also increases. As disruptions occur less frequently and the system has sufficient time to recover from the earlier disruption, the disruptions do not get cumulated. An increase in disruption durations decreases the demand fill rate since the longer disruption durations make the system more prone to disruptions getting cumulated which can lead to a high level of retailer lost sales. While considering different types of distributions for the disruption durations, it is observed that as the maximum parameter (D_MAX) and the minimum parameter (D_MIN) increase, the demand/ customer fill rate decreases since the disruption duration increases for all the considered disruption distributions. It is noted that the least fill rate occurs in the case of uniform distribution since each disruption duration has the same chance of occurring, including the maximum disruption duration considered. But in the case of both triangular and normal distributions, the chances of having the extreme disruption durations are least likely to occur. As a result, the most likely duration is close to the distribution's mean. This feature implies that a triangularly or normally distributed disruption is easier to handle than a uniformly distributed disruption duration. Furthermore, the presence of a backup production plant can tackle the type of disruptions having high disruption duration and low disruption frequency (disruptions with high inter-arrival time) more effectively. Therefore, this type of disruption can be tackled by introducing backup facilities at each supply chain echelon. However, this option may not always be financially feasible. Quantification of the risk associated while introducing disruptions can be studied in a more realistic manner in the simulation model. Extending the current simulation model to include multiple entities at each stage/segment of the supply chain is an area for further work. More mitigation strategies can be developed and tested. Future work can also focus on optimising various parameters by considering cost aspects in the modelled supply chain to maximise the performance of the supply chain using the OptQuest extension in Arena simulation software.","aswin k unnikrishnan, arjun k unnikrishnan, anoop ajith and abhi k devadas graduate students, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut (nitc), india aswin_b180040me@nitc.ac.in; arjun_b180042pe@nitc.ac.in; anoop_b181044pe@nitc.ac.in; abhi_b180348me@nitc.ac.in vishnu c r assistant professor, vit business school vellore institute of technology, chennai, india vishnu.cr@vit.ac.in r sridharan professor (hag), department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut (nitc), india sreedhar@nitc.ac.in",

137,Multi-Criteria Inventory Classification Using Machine  Learning Algorithms,"inventory control is essentially a predominant decision to be undertaken by operations managers of a firm. a proper inventory control system ensures a sufficient amount of goods or materials to meet the firm's demand without facing undersupply or oversupply of materials. traditionally, decision-makers classify inventory items into various classes or subgroups for easy monitoring and managing stock levels. the classification efficiency can be ameliorated by applying machine learning algorithms. the present paper focuses on developing a hybrid methodology that integrates machine learning algorithms with multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm) to facilitate multi-attribute inventory analysis. this technique enables the operator to leverage the benefits of both ml and mcdm. the data set is initially classified using mcdms like the simple additive weighted (saw) method and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis) model. performance metrics like overall cost and customer fill rate are utilized to rank the efficiency of the generated mcdm models. supervised machine learning algorithms like decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (svm), xg boost and knn are employed on the mcdm models, and the performance of the system is established in terms of the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm. in order to prevent the inventory model from inclining towards the majority class, upsampling of the dataset is undertaken. analysing the results, it is concluded that the application of topsis mcdm provides better results for the considered systems in both machine learning and non-machine learning performance indices.","inventory control, abc classification, machine learning","A generic hybrid technique of multi-criteria decision-making models combined with machine learning methods for analysing multi-attribute inventory classification problems is presented in this research. Inventory classes were determined by employing two different MCDM approaches, TOPSIS and SAW. Following the classification, five machine learning algorithms, i.e., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support vector machine, XGboost, and KNN, were employed to anticipate the pre-identified classes of each classification method. After checking and eliminating outliers, the dataset has been divided into a training dataset and a testing dataset. Once the division is done, then evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1 score, and accuracy were obtained. After analysing the results, it is evident that TOPSIS is best MCDM technique for multi-criteria inventory classification situations in all aspects like the fill rate and overall cost when compared to SAW. Although the prediction of algorithms may not be exact in some circumstances, depending on the various data sets, owing to concerns with data distribution and measurement, the case study proved that all algorithms were able to categorize inventory items exceptionally effectively. It is commonly acknowledged in the field of machine learning that an imbalance distribution of ABC classes can affect classification accuracy; thus, an evenly distributed training set was created using random under-sampling methods before a different data set, which included a distribution with Pareto assumption. As previously stated in this study, accuracy alone is insufficient for comprehensively evaluating and comparing categorization systems. Further research using additional data sets and/or alternative machine learning algorithms, as well as multiple MCDM methodologies, can be employed to examine the extent to which the general hybrid methodology suggested in this work can efficiently categorize inventory items. Most importantly, the hybrid ML-MCDM methodology can be applied for inventory classification in a real-world situation involving thousands of inventory items.","dharani lekha g, amrutha sai k, praveen kumar g, chakravarthi p graduate students, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut (nitc), india dharanilekha_b181045pe@nitc.ac.in; amrutha_b180444pe@nitc.ac.in; praveen_b180463me@nitc.ac.in; paramkusam_b180775me@nitc.ac.in vishnu c r assistant professor, vit business school vellore institute of technology, chennai, india vishnu.cr@vit.ac.in r sridharan professor (hag), department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut (nitc), india sreedhar@nitc.ac.in",
138,Monitoring Of Transformer And Detection Of Faults In  Transformer Using Iot And Cloud Computing,"transformer is a device which helps in improvement of efficiency and safety of electrical power system by increasing or decreasing voltage levels whenever we needed. as transformer is very important electric device it is necessary to check health condition of transformer by checking various parameters of transformer like voltage, current, etc. so if there are any abnormal change in parameters of transformer, we can easily detect fault present in the transformer to avoid catastrophic effects. it is very tedious job to monitor transformer manually so there is necessity of monitoring transformer in real time. for monitoring transformer in real time, we are using iot in which various sensors, raspberry pi is used for monitoring and along with this cloud computing is used. cloud computing is technology which is used for storing and processing data from any computer. there are many different iot applications that use the open-source platform known as thingspeak cloud. cloud computing is the success of iot technology. and we are going to add machine learning into this for detecting whether transformer is faulty or not by using various algorithm.","transformer, current sensor, voltage sensor, raspberry pi","The proposed technique with results has shown that the protection scheme works properly with accuracy, sensitivity of this scheme very high for the abnormal and faulty conditions. Transformer Health Monitoring will help to identify or recognize unexpected situations before any serious failure which leads to greater reliability and significant cost savings. If transformer is in abnormal condition we can know from anywhere. No human power need to monitor the transformer. Details about the transformer are automatically updated in webpage when the transformer is in abnormal condition. With the help of Machine Learning, prediction of faults can be done. Also, while monitoring parameters of transformer, the actual reason which caused the failure of transformer can be found. The data obtained from transformer will be useful for creating effective dataset. In future we can add more parameters of transformer and create more robust ML algorithm to predict the fault in transformer. We can get all information by placing the proposed system modules at every transformer. In future, the machine learning based approach for fault detection in the transformer will be presented. The input to the system would be voltage, current and temperature while output would be the classification of faulty or non-faulty system.","minal rajput and prof. pratibha shingare department of e&tc college of engineering, pune, india rajputms20.extc@coep.ac.in, pps.extc@coep.ac.in",

The performance of wavelet transform with fault analysis mainly depends on its threshold value, but this value is not same for different power system networks, and it is required to determine separate threshold value for respective power system network. This drawback can be overcome by using Radial Basis Function neural network. The analysis of RBFNN also presented in this paper. The RBFNN will not depends on any threshold value for classification and identification of faults in the power system.

140,1203,"speed breakers or hump has formed to reduce the accidents, but unfortunately excessive use of speed breakers in urban area / inner cities / metropolitan distracts vehicle drivers. in addition to that, most of time drivers cannot recognize the appearance of unmarked speed breakers and lose control of the vehicle, causing serious accidents and loss of lives. especially in india speed breakers may not be visible to driver’s eye due to fade borders, having no cross lines to indicate, damaged road, less differentiation from road and so on due to poor maintenance, in this article we proposed a new approach to sort out identified problems using image processing techniques. as we seen the high severity is in night time most cases, we planned to developed algorithms to work on night time as driver may avoid / mitigate the critical situation in daytime. 1. introduction the speed bump detection system in a vehicle is used to detect speed bumps, humps, speed breaker on the roads and alert the driver or other components in the vehicle to apply appropriate action like brake, steer etc. the driver may miss to notice the speed humps in complex driving conditions especially during night time due to less / no lights. an un-noticed speed- hump on high speed is harmful to passengers especially pregnant women and elderly people travelled in vehicle. it also leads to damage the tires and tubes and even may damages the vehicle also sometime. usually, speed humps / breakers are built in places like school zone, accident-prone locations, sharp turing, congested residential streets, unmanned level crossings where speed of the vehicle needs to controlled to avoid accidents. the speed humps will have various physical identities such as height, length of ramps, depth etc. however, most of time it is not followed in india. most of the humps in india are not being constructed and maintained according to the public safety guidelines of indian road congress (irc) i.e., irc099, which is resulting in severe discomfort to the driver and even causing loss of direction control which is leading to fatalities. according to the news published in times of india on sep 14, 2015, 14:42 ist, according to the road accident report (2014) published by the road transport and highways ministry, while 4,726 lives were lost in crashes due to humps, 6,672 people died in accidents caused due to potholes and speed breakers. 1.1 objective according to indian roads, different types of humps are placed in roads to slow down the vehicle speed and sometimes installed in a series of several humps to prevent cars from speeding. here we have captured few types and decided to detect it all by proposed approach.",,"The idea of this paper is to detect hump to prevent or mitigate the collusion and vehicle damage by hitting on it.

141,"Pull-Based Operations In A Hostel Mess: A Case Study  M.Manohar, Sreekumar K.P., I. Saran Kumar, Y. Reena, C. Sudeepcarey,","wastage is reduced in the manufacturing process by employing a lean manufacturing technique known as the pull production system. in pull production, kanbans are used to manage production activities. they are a basis for: when an item is to be manufactured, how many are to be produced, etc. in the current operation, food and groceries are carried from one station to another and enhancing it using lean manufacturing principles is addressed in this article. the primary aim is to reduce inventory, eliminate shortages, and reduce system work-in-progress of raw materials, all of which will be accomplished through lean methodologies. a schematic diagram of the pull process is constructed considering the current workstations in the mess kitchen. the number of distinct kanban’s necessary is computed. implementation of lean production system with kanban’s dramatically improves the mess's performance. compared to the existing system, the proposed system would use fewer raw materials (work-in-progress) to meet the same demand. the proposed system will greatly improve the system's efficiency and station cycle times.","lean manufacturing, kanbans","By implementing the Lean Pull system in the dining room, the continuous consumption of inventory between stations can be reduced, the kitchen staff is assigned to different work stations according to the nature of the food cooked and the time needed to cook. Stations 6, 7 and 8 were in charge of the cooks Therefore, it is difficult to reduce the cooking time. Helpers can be removed to balance the system, and one helper is removed from each of stations 1, 4, and 9. Since the combined cycle time of both workers at stations 1, 4, and 9 is 12, 18, and 30 seconds respectively. Also, this time is less than the system cycle time of 36 seconds. Therefore, one helper can be removed from each of these stations. The total number of workers in the mess were 20, comprising of 7 cooks and 13 helpers. But the proposed system requires only 5 cooks and 13 helpers with further looking upon cycle time of workers 3 more helpers can be removed from the station. Finally, the mess can be run by 11 workers (5 cooks and 6 helpers) only instead of proposed 20 workers. Theoretically the maximum possible efficiency is 96% with 6 workstations. But the actual possible efficiency of the system is 72% achieved with 8 workstations. Items produced at each meal are level production as they are produced daily on demand. The dining room service level will significantly improve if the proposed system is implemented. It is possible to achieve zero stockouts or disgruntled inmates compared to the previous system. In the current system occasionally, final items or raw materials unavailability happens. The lead time for each food preparation activity is increased by scenically rearranging the workstation and reducing the waiting time of in process units. 1223","aabir mohsin and v. madhusudanan pillai student, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut, india manoharmahapatro@gmail.com, sreekumar_m210066me@nitc.ac.in, ika_m210541me@nitc.ac.in, reena_m210534me@nitc.ac.in, sudeep_m210539me@nitc.ac.in, aabir_m210540me@nitc.ac.in, vmp@nitc.ac.in","References

The system modelled here has been analyzed with and without filters and it can be seen that a filter is very necessary for the harmonic mitigation if the control scheme of inverter is not able to eliminate the total harmonics. The control scheme here was only able to reduce the lower order harmonics and the higher order harmonics are eliminated through the LCL filter with resistance damping with optimal values of inductor and capacitor. The solar irradiance also affects the THD, as can be seen from the Fourier analysis of inverter current with LCL filter. The inverter current at 1000 W/m2 has THD as 4.77% but at 800 W/m2 irradiance the THD is 5.10% which is slightly more when irradiance is decreased in this system. The system parameters which are taken and are calculated has been given in the Table 3 below. 1255","raj moyal department of electrical engineering national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india moyal.raj@gmail.com dr. shivam assistant professor in electrical engineering national institute of technology (nit), kurukshetra, india shivam@nitkkr.ac.in","References

146,Stockout Prediction In Multi Echelon Supply Chain  Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"the main objective of a supply chain is to fulfil the customer demands in the right quantity at the right time. if an organization cannot meet the customer demand, stockout or out-of-stock situations happen. inventory stockouts are costly to the organization and are very common in supply chains. it not only results in the loss of revenue but also affects the service level, which results in a loss of competitive advantage. stockouts can be prevented by proper inventory planning and control. for any organization, it is crucial to maintain optimum inventory levels to ensure customer satisfaction. these days, technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give organizations the ability to foresee the future and proactively manage their inventory in the supply chain. this study investigates various supervised machine learning classifiers. it proposes the best machine learning stock out prediction model for each member of a four-stage divergent supply chain with eight members. since the dataset for such a supply chain is not available, a supply chain operation simulation has been conducted under three distinct inventory replenishing policies such as order-up-to (out), order-up-to smoothing (outs) and (s, s). data generated from the simulation is divided into two sets, the train set and the test set. various supervised machine learning algorithms are trained using training dataset. a five-fold cross-validation technique is adopted for the validation of the model. a random search cross-validation technique adjusts the hyperparameters of each classifier. the performance of the model is evaluated on the test dataset based on the assessment matrices, and it is found that boosting algorithms perform better than the other classifiers. this study proposes a meta-learning-based stacked ensemble model, using xg boost, ada boost and random forest classifiers as the base model. the performance evaluation shows that for each supply chain member, the stacked ensemble model performs better than other classifiers, including boosting classifiers.","supply chain, inventory policy","Inventory stockouts are costly to the organization and are very common in supply chains. Occurrence of stockout results in degradation of the overall supply chain performance. Poor inventory planning results in not only loss of revenue but also loss of market share. This situation can be overcome by proper inventory planning and control. With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning, supply chain managers are interested inosinate driven approach for making inventory-related decisions. This study considers a simple type of divergent supply chain with four-stage and eight members under different inventory-position-based inventory policies such as OUT, OUT Smoothing and (s, S). Python-based supply chain operation simulation is conducted for each inventory policy. The output of the simulation experiment reveals that (s, S) inventory policy has the highest stockout instances at each stage, followed by the OUT and OUT smoothing inventory policy. Data generated from supply chain inventory simulation is used for training and testing the machine learning classifiers. The problem of data imbalance is solved by employing SMOTE sampling techniques, and it is found that algorithms used with sampling techniques perform better those without sampling techniques. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique that helps to eliminate the multicollinearity issue that arises while developing machine learning models. Tuning of the model's hyperparameters is required to get a stable and high-quality level of performance in the prediction process. The primary focus of this research has been analysing various machine learning algorithms to predict stockouts. Considering this developed prediction models for each participant of a four-stage divergent supply chain consisting of eight members operating under three distinct inventory replenishment policies. The assessment matrices show that the performance of the model developed with boosting classifiers is better than that of other classifiers for every supply chain member under each inventory policy. It has also been found that the 1268","saurav shukla department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut, kozhikode - 673601, india sauravshukla140@gmail.com v. madhusudanan pillai professor, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut, kozhikode - 673601, india vmp@nitc.ac.in","References

147,Upstream Supply Chain Activity Of A Start-Up Restaurant:  A Case Study In Foodie Panda,"the restaurant supply chain starts from the raw material collection to final product delivery. in today’s digital world restaurants are maintaining both traditional and digitalized methods for supply chain processes. in the first phase of the process, fixing the quantity of raw material demand analysis is a crucial factor for making decisions to avoid wastage of product or even stock-outs. as the raw material involved in the process is perishable it’s very important to keep it in the right quantity and quality standard to avoid serious issues to the people eating it. this study aims to analyze the upstream supply chain process of a startup restaurant. upstream supply chain activity is linked with the supplier and raw material intake. direct observation is done regarding their upstream supply chain activity and a theoretical study is done based on it. information regarding the various sources of the raw material intake in that restaurant is collected. further, analysis is done to identify the strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of their supply chain activities. in this study, suggestions are incorporated with managerial implication to enrich their strength, make more utilization of their opportunities, washout the weakness and maintain barriers from potential threats. correlation analysis is done to evaluate effect of supplier delay and preparation time delay on missed orders. it is found that both supplier delay and food preparation delay is highly correlated to missed food orders.","demand analysis, forecasting, correlation","For an emerging restaurant like Foodie Panda, it’s very important to keep good records on upstream supply chain management. As far as new venture is concerned it will be having its own growth period to get established by their name so to maintain its profit level every part of the activity should be managed properly. This study gives an overall idea about the upstream supply chain activity of the concerned restaurant. Based on the Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat analysis the study identified the status of upstream supply chain management of the new restaurant Foodie Panda. Identified the point of improvement. If the restaurant maintained its strength by exploring the opportunities by reducing weakness and competing with threat, then in a long run the firm will be a success. Correlation Analysis and graphical representation is done based on supplier timing, Food preparation timing and missed orders. We identified that supplier should maintain proper time for delivering raw materials otherwise it will affect the whole process. The food preparation timing will be lagged, and restaurant will miss its valuable orders. We found that these factors are highly correlated. Proper Timing should be maintained for a cost-effective supply chain flow.","s raj arunima and s a binoosh department of mechanical engineering college of engineering trivandrum, thiruvananthapuram, kerala, india d-tve21jan033@cet.ac.in, binoosh@cet.ac.in",

150,A Study On The Effect Of Covid-19 On The Livelihood Of The  Reelers And Weavers Of Sericulture Industry In Southern,"the covid-19 pandemic and lockdown has caused massive disruption in almost every sector of the economy in india and informal sector has been the worst affected. the sericulture and handloom industry being the second most employers in the informal sector is important to the economy in terms of employment generation, output and export. but, the industry has been engulfed with manifold problems since its inception and covid- 19 crisis worsened the condition of the sericulture workers. in this context, the current study is an attempt to look into the impact of pandemic and lockdown on the industry in the informal sector in karnataka and the key problems faced by the workers in their everyday life. taking information from both primary and secondary sources, it is observed that the sericulture industry in karnataka is severely affected by covid-19 and lockdown which resulted in loss of income and livelihood to the handloom workers. ban on non-essential transportation facilities led to unavailability of raw materials, inflated price of yarn and dyes. closure of markets resulted in unsold clothes piling up in weavers’ residents which drastically affected revenue generation in this sector. the weavers are living and working in ill standard houses and suffering from malnutrition, indebtedness etc.","covid-19, informal sector","The data obtained by the survey was analysed by statistical tools (SPSS Software) based on this interpretation were made. The present study briefly depicts a general picture of the sericulture weavers in the country and the multidimensional problems being faced by them. Both the primary and secondary data shows that sericulture workers are living in ill standard houses which are responsible for their poor health and unproductive working condition. They are having very low level of income resulting in acute poverty and hence malnutrition among them. • Data shows restricted working conditions and less Sales. • Resulting low financial condition and support • In this study we found the positive correlation matrix test between the variables • From Scree Plot, it is seen that there are 7 components are above the Eigenvalue 1. The Eigenvalue 1 is predefined. From these 7 components, questions can be grouped into their respective variables and further tests can be continued. • Cronbach’s Alpha is .716 6.1 Findings • The COVID-19 pandemic and repeated lockdowns continue to take a toll on Karnataka’s weavers, both in the handloom and power loom sectors. Their income has dropped 70 per cent to 80 per cent, in the past year many are caught in deep financial crisis and wonder if they’d ever be able to get back on track. • In Doddaballapura, several looms have closed following a drop in sales. March to May remains the peak season with marriage orders and bulk purchases. But with lockdown restrictions, their business remains affected. • They are living on a hand-to-mouth budget. It’s because the government is giving them ration, they are able to live. The financial distress is unbearable to most of them and has drastically affected their livelihood. • By the time they could recover from the economic downfall in 2019, the pandemic hit them again and while they thought the worst was over and resumed work in October 2020, the second wave completely halted their business. With the pandemic spreading to rural areas, work did not resume in most of the region. • A weaver, Sanjeevappa, 47, says he can earn only ₹500 a week as the loom owner has capped the work to five saris a week to each worker. Nagaraja says he used to earn ₹3,000 before the lockdown. The financial packages or the loan moratorium did not reach workers, he says it helped loom owners, but not him.","karnataka khush garg mba_marketing faculty of management and commerce, bengaluru,india khushgarg748@gmail.com karanpreet singh ratra mba_financial management ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india karanpreetsratra@gmail.com nidhi shetty mba_human resource management faculty of management and commerce, bengaluru, india nidhiushetty57@gmail.com poonam bhadergade mba_pharmacy faculty of management and commerce, bengaluru, india poonambhadargade19@gmail.com mr. rajeev prasad p assistant professor, department of management studies ramaiah university of applied sciences, bengaluru, india rajeev.ms.mc@msruas.ac.in",
151,Experimental Investigation Of Aa5052 In Single Point  Incremental Forming Using Dynamic Tool Condition,"recent advancements in cae have made it possible to create several new sheet metals forming techniques that are best based on more traditional technology. the goal of the current work is to conduct an experimental investigation of the behaviour of 1.5 mm thick aluminium alloy aa5052 h-32 during single point incremental forming in terms of major strain, minor strain and calculated thickness. an optical measuring device uses a circle grid to indicate the measurement area to estimate strain. the full factorial approach was used for the experiment design. using autodesk fusion 360, it is possible to significantly generate the necessary tool paths and shape. for the experimental work, a truncated square pyramid geometry with a 60-degree angle was chosen.","spif, circle grid, spindle speed, thickness","The following conclusions were drawn from the present investigation are above graphical representation: Step depth, spindle speed and feed rate are the influential parameters affecting major strain, minor strain, and thickness of sheet in single point incremental forming. Present contributions of process parameters to the major strain, minor strain and calculated thickness of sheet were made assuming other process parameters as constant. As Step depth increases the value of major strain, minor strain decreases, and thickness increases respectively. With increase in value of Spindle speed and feed rate, the value of major strain and minor strain decreases, while thickness increases.

152,Economic Analysis Of Public Priced Iot Based Traceability  System In Perishable Food Supply Chain,"worldwide food contamination crises and their consequence on health and monetary losses inflated public concerns, putting food supply chain under pressure to assure quality and safety. when short shelf life food products go through post-harvest process, it becomes difficult to isolate contamination source. consequently, supplier claims to produce good quality food, meanwhile it reaches to consumer’s contaminations occurs in transit, which results in financial and reputation loss. hence, food traceability is highly important to combat losses and maintain quality as expected. internet of things (iot) has potential to improve performance of logistic through traceability. despite all the advantages, it imposes a mere cost on supply chain players. however, they can consider it as an opportunity to raise consumer fidelity when quality sensitive consumers are ready to bear additional cost. so this system termed as public priced traceability. further, implementation of proposed traceability raises the question of investment decision that who will bear the implementation cost. to address the question a game theory approach applied. mathematical model is developed for individual supplier, retailer and centralized investment. numerical study revealed that in centralized investment model is the most profitable option, although selling price and information sensing price is higher than other models.",,,"aishwarya dash research scholar, industrial systems engineering department iit kharagpur, india aishwaryadashiitkgp@gmail.com s.p. sarmah, m. k. tiwari professor, industrial systems engineering department iit kharagpur, india spsarmah@iem.iitkgp.ac.in, mktiwari9@iem.iitkgp.ac.in",

154,Resilience Antecedents And Performance Of Indian Supply  Chains During Disruptions: Evidence From Fsqca,"the global functioning of supply chains has exposed them to volatility and turbulence making them vulnerable to disruptions. resilience has become an important ability for supply chains that enhances event readiness and aids recovery to a better operational state. the restoration of supply chains ensures business continuity and improves performance against the firms whose supply chains are not resilient. the importance of resilience towards supply chain and firm’s performance has resulted in several studies on its analysis. the literature is replete with studies analyzing antecedents of resilience and their effect on supply chain performance amidst disruptions. despite the abundance of the empirical literature, only a few have examined the resilience antecedent configurations to assess supply chain performance. even fewer studies have examined the necessity and sufficiency conditions of these configurations. limited research evidence exists in the context of global supply chains having partners in india. the present study explores the antecedents of resilience influencing supply chain performance amidst disruptions. furthermore, the study aims to obtain the necessary and sufficient configurations of these antecedents for enhancing supply chain performance and provide managerial suggestions. therefore, the research questions are (1) what are the antecedents of resilience that may impact the supply chain performance amidst disruptions? (2) what configurations of resilience antecedents can explain the supply chain performance? the research question are solved via following methods: firstly, based on literature review and expert interviews, the antecedents of resilience are obtained for indian supply chains. furthermore, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca) is utilized to obtain necessary and sufficient configurations of the antecedents that can explain supply chain performance amidst disruptions. the output of fsqca software reveals the presence of multiple, equally effective configurations of causal factors that exist for explaining the interplay of antecedents towards enhancing supply chain performance amidst disruptions.",fsqca,The obtained configurations may be validated using variance-based techniques to gain a complementing insight into the linkages between the enablers and supply chain performance. The present study has a limitation of using a small sample which may be increased for obtaining more complex and important configurations which might have been missed. The threshold values used in the present study may also be varied to obtain different configurations which might have escaped the analysis. Future studies may also study supply chains of other industry and country contexts and combine the findings for a generalised framework for supply chain resilience.,"nishtha agarwal research scholar, department of management indian institute of foreign trade, new delhi nishtha_phdmf19@iift.edu prof. nitin seth professor, department of management, quantitative studies indian institute of foreign trade, new delhi nitinseth@iift.edu",
155,"Bird’S Eye View Of Machine Learning, Deep Learning In  Agriculture","agriculture is the backbone of india as it is the source of food as well as one of the factors of economic development. the agriculture sector's contribution to the indian economy is much higher than the world's average. agriculture has several stages, such as soil preparation, crop selection, control of pests or insects, crop yield, and crop sales. artificial intelligence (ai) is one of the very emerging areas in the computer field. applying ai in farming is now essential to increase crop production. machine learning (ml) and deep learning (dl) are sub-areas of ai. though ml and dl follow their learning strategies. this paper gives an outline of ml and dl concerning agriculture. this paper also studies on comparison of ml and dl models with results. the majority of dl models are outperforming ml models. ml and dl are also applied in several other domains like medical, agriculture, business, transport (logistics), entertainment, education, and many more.","machine learning, deep learning","Both Machine Learning and Deep Learning help to develop intelligent machines, which are useful to predict or detect output.ML and DL methods are necessary to apply in agriculture to gain profit by producing more yield. Though ML and DL are sub-areas of AI, the followed procedure is different. Compare to conventional ML models, DL models outperform in the majority of tasks like classification, detection, etc., with better accuracy. Depending on requirements of user, one can choose ML or DL. However, deep learning algorithms can be overkill for less complex problems because they require access to a vast amount of data to be effective.It means that the task with small datasets ML, and huge datasets DL is preferable.","d. madhu sudhan reddy, full-time research scholar, department of cse, sri venkateswara university, tirupati. madhu.dagada@gmail.com dr. n. usha rani, assistant professor, department of cse, sri venkateswara university, tirupati. usha552@yahoo.com",

157,Distortion Effect In Geometry Of Prismatic Thin Wall Parts  Of Aa2014-T651 During Machining,"thin wall parts distort due to redistribution of unbalanced residual stresses after material removal. this distortion is due to generation of bending moment on parts during material removal. prismatic slender aa2014 models were analyzed by transient thermal analysis and structural analysis with finite element software for geometric distortion against nominal dimensions by incorporating solution treatment properties and then initial stresses and strains into the analysis model for achieving t6 condition. subsequently, the model was prepared by reducing it to 90% of pre- stresses to simulate stretched model conditions to map with t651 condition. subsequently, total deformation was analyzed by material removal using birth and death technique for t651 condition models by incorporation of proportional stresses and strains, by applying correction factor, were evaluated in physical experiment by slitting method strain gauge method. simulation experiments were carried out with corrected model to evaluate total deformation by layer removal. deformation results were used for statistical analysis to study the effect of geometrical parameters on distortion trend. it is found that length of the part has significant effect on distortion. this analysis is useful for designing of prismatic slender parts for considering geometry effect on distortion of aa2014 t651, which can be a guide during design for incorporating reinforcements to minimize distortion after material removal.","aa2014-t651, residual stresses","The following conclusions can be drawn by the analysis of distortion on slender prismatic thin wall part using FEM model and statistical models. • Residual stresses in AA2014-T651 properties were achieved by using FEM model and simulation in order to estimate the deformation. • Minimum principal stress mainly depends upon length and width combination of raw material and its contribution is 31.75%. • Deformation can be estimated using regression model equation in AA2014-T651 by considering geometrical parameters and residual stress. • Deformation can be predicted using correction factor by comparing physical components using minimum principal stresses through FEM model. • Deformation mainly depends on internal stresses as compared with geometrical parameters. • This Deformation model can be used as a guide for providing ribs at appropriate places to avoid distortion during design stages. • Deformation can be decreased by reducing length, width and providing ribs in the slender prismatic thin wall parts. • The predicted simulation model is 80% accurate.

159,Dynamic Selection Of Inventory Replenishment Policies  For A Fast-Changing Supply Chain,"global supply chains suffered considerable impact from the disruptions caused by the pandemic scenario and the need for efficient supply chain management is at an all-time high. supply chain performance is strongly influenced by the inventory management policy adopted at each echelon. thus, there is a requirement for an efficient inventory replenishment policy for supply chain environments undergoing frequent changes. the traditional static replenishment policies, omnipresent in industries, prove to be suboptimal in this case as the optimal replenishment policy depends on existing supply chain conditions. this work proposes a dynamic framework, inspired by a similar model identified in literature, which is able to find the optimal replenishment policy for a particular echelon in a three-echelon serial supply chain environment characterised by eight attributes. supervised machine learning techniques were incorporated for developing the framework which is finally able to select and implement the optimal replenishment policy from four possible alternatives. the dynamic framework is developed using different machine learning algorithms, which further gives an insight into their performance. a comparative analysis of the proposed models is performed under two supply chain environments, namely the chaotic and the fast-changing. the results highlight the improvement obtained by considering the dynamic framework rather than the static alternatives. additionally, the random forest (rf) based model was found to be the best performing model compared to its counterparts. finally, the proposed model was observed to outperform the model identified from literature, thus portraying the significance of the work.",machine learning,"and Scope of Future Work The pandemic scenario has created a volatile market environment characterised by frequent changes in the supply chain environment which have forced industries to better manage their inventory. The traditional static alternatives would prove to be suboptimal under such changing conditions, which is attained by changing the values of eight attributes considered in this study. As shown in Figure 1, the lowest value of the J metrics (evaluation metrics) is observed in different order policies according to the varying conditions. Lowering the J metric value directly corresponds to a reduction in operating costs. Thus, a dynamic framework which is able to identify the best policy considering the varying conditions of the operating environment will perform better than a static policy applied throughout without considering various internal and external factors. This concept was successfully proven by the study conducted in this work. Further, the proposed dynamic framework for a three-echelon supply chain was compared with a similar model by Priore et al. (2019) from literature and with the traditional static order policies. The result proved the success of the proposed model in managing the echelon under consideration compared to the alternatives. All the dynamic models outperformed the static alternatives which again cements the argument that a dynamic model offers better performance. The proposed model surpassed the similar model from literature as the former bears more similarity between its training dataset and the comparing environment. In addition to that, the proposed model also considered the inventory position as an attribute, which was not accounted for in Priore et al. (2019). Among the models implemented using different ML algorithms, RF model outperformed the models developed using decision tree and SVM. This could be due to the efficiency of ensemble models and the characteristics of the training dataset. In real-life scenarios, the conditions are probably more dynamic which can result in the obsolescence of extracted knowledge. This point towards the need for careful examination and updating of the existing knowledge acquired through the decision tree model. In this direction, using dynamic knowledge refinement techniques is a suggested future work (Park et al. 2001). Also incorporating the network structure of the supply chain into the analysis is another direction for future research. 1404","steve george varghese, karthik suresh, lithin lakshmanan department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut, india stevegv2000@gmail.com, karthiksureshks3@gmail.com, lithinlakshmanan44@gmail.com v madhusudanan pillai professor, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut, india vmp@nitc.ac.in devendra k yadav assistant professor, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology calicut, india devendrak@nitc.ac.in","References

162,Efficient And Sustainable Supplier Selection Strategy  Forsmesusing Marcos: Insights From A Case Study,"supplier selection (ss) is an important aspect of supply chain management (scm) and appropriate supplier evaluation opens up a lot of opportunities for every organization. simply looking for suppliers with the cheapest price is no longer considered ""efficient supplier selection"". selection of a good set of suppliers is a multiple-criteria- decision-making (mcdm) process. despite the fact that earlier research has presented several methods and tools for effective supplier selection, only a few approaches have attempted to address issues of smes in supplier selection decisions. we proposed an integrated two-stage mcdm approach that consists of analytical hierarchy process (ahp) and measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution (marcos) for supplier selection problems of small and medium-sized enterprises (smes). and the results are validated with the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis). ahp & topsis are widely researched and used for a long time but marcos is relatively new compared to them. this approach can be easily implemented using a spreadsheet program. this spreadsheet is useful in practical situations and does not require the user to have any prior knowledge of optimization. a real-life case is examined to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. the novelty of this study is that it presents a realistic, easy-to-implement, and proven supplier selection technique for smes to achieve sustainability.",,"and future research agenda. In the modern supply chain, traditional single-criterion method centered on the lowest cost is not sufficient. Although the literature on supplier selection has recommended a variety of tools and techniques for effectively evaluating suppliers, there has been no thorough evaluation of supplier selection models from SME's point of view. Furthermore, there is a dearth of studies in the literature that considered the limitations of SMEs.In view of this research gap, this research addressed the supplier selection issue of SMEs and revealed that SMEs can gain a competitive advantage if they follow the proposed method of supplier selection. A spreadsheet program is developed for professionals working in SMEs that will assist them in SS decision-making. In addition, the developed spreadsheet program is designed to incorporate the changes in criteria or sub-criteria very easily and the same change will be reflected in the entire program. Therefore the results can be generalized to any sector where different criteria or sub-criteria are of prime importance. The results of the case study conducted on a manufacturing company revealed that the proposed method and developed spreadsheet program are capable to alleviate supplier selection issues of SMEs.","ganesh narkhede 1research scholar, department of manufacturingengineeringand industrial management, college of engineering pune (coep), pune, india 2assistant professor, department of mechanical engineering, vishwakarma institute of information technology (viit), pune, india ganesh.narkhede@viit.ac.in dr. neela rajhans professor,department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management, college of engineering pune (coep), pune, india nrr.mfg@coep.ac.in",

166,Development And Evaluation Of Multistage Evaporative  Cooling System,"air conditioning has become a vital part of our day to day lives, but with the current cooling solutions there are concerns regarding to high energy consumption and emission of dangerous gases depleting the ozone layer. an evaporative cooling system (ecs) is considered as one of the oldest and low-cost cooling systems. however, the temperature drop in ecs is low and hence in this work, a multistage cooling system was developed and tested for its performance. this system consists of indirect and direct evaporative cooling system. the combination of indirect and direct ecs reduces the dry bulb temperature significantly. the experimental results show that the temperature drop in two stage is higher than the single stage. it is also observed that the energy consumed by this system is low as compared to conventionally used hvac system. from this work, we conclude that the multistage evaporative cooling system can be used as an alternative to the hvac system for commercial and industrial applications.","cooling, multistage, performance","There is a need to develop environmentally friendly low cost ECS. The multistage ECS is an efficient and eco-friendly cooling solution. It has high application in dry and torrid regions and can be used in a variety of fields. The first stage is an indirect ECS where heat exchanger designed in such a way that there is no contact between air and water, hence there is no increase in humidity and sensible heat transfer occurs, due to which this stage is preferable in regions where humidity is high. The second stage is direct ECS where the heat exchanger has direct contact with water and the air passing through this is cooler and contains little more moisture as compared to the first stage. Therefore, IDEC system has a huge scope of application in industrial and commercial buildings as it reduces temperatures to a level that provides thermal comfort while the humidity also is maintained. The multistage ECS consumes 25% less energy compared to vapour compression refrigeration system thus making it a preferable and feasible option.","dr. n kapilan professor, department of mechanical engineering nitte meenakshi institute of technology (nmit), bengaluru, india kapilan.n@nmit.ac.in reuben richardson pavan kumar k, advaith s agasthya, pramodh r student, department of mechanical engineering nitte meenakshi institute of technology (nmit), bengaluru, india reubenrichardson2000@gmail.com, advaithsagasthya@gmail.com, pramodh106@gmail.com, nanpav15@gmail.com",

169,Time-Series Forecasting Of Stock Prices Using Arima:  A Case Study Of Tesla And Nio,"there has been a rapid increase in the demand for electric vehicles across the globe and so are their stock prices. the companies, like tesla and nio, have seen a rise and fall in their stock prices over a period of time. various models have been used by researchers/analysts in this field for the stock price prediction using econometrics models, deep learning techniques using lstm, rnn, etc. the purpose of this paper is to predict the stock prices of these two electric vehicles (along with their stock closing prices). the econometric model, arima (p, d, q) in particular, has been fitted to predict the stock prices of electric vehicles. the arima (p, d, q) model helps in forecasting by converting the non-stationary data into stationary one using the differencing technique. further, with the help of the ml algorithms, the model appropriately uses the data (training data) and then validates (testing data) in a fixed proportion. in this paper, we will predict the stock prices of electric vehicles by extrapolating the data to a future time period and then compare the forecasting accuracy. in terms of the managerial implications, the prediction is expected to help the case companies for better optional planning and execution. 1. introduction the rise in the consumption of fossil fuels has caused several environmental concerns, causing temperature rise, melting of icebergs at both the poles, rising sea levels, etc. usage of fossil fuels is limited and constrained but there is unlimited demand for them. in this scenario, many automobile companies have started producing electric vehicles replacing petrol and diesel vehicles. there has been a surge in the demand for evs (electric vehicles). tesla has become one of the largest ev-producing companies in the world causing a surge in its demand and stock. nio a china-based ev maker has also risen as one of the competitors of tesla in recent days. so, predicting the stock price of these companies will fetch numerous interesting outputs for the stock traders. because of the uncertain nature of the stock market, predicting stock prices become difficult. to minimize the investment risk and make a profit, several forecasting techniques are used. deep learning methods like long short-term memory (lstm) is used to learn patterns from data and infer solutions from unknown data (ghosh et al., 2004). for this paper econometrics models like arima has been used. arima models are some of the widely used techniques in forecasting (box and jenkins., 1970) and have come well before machine learning-based models like lstm. for short-term prediction of financial time series data, arima modeling is efficient (chatfield, 2000). it is an open model, it helps the researchers in understanding the nature of the dataset at each stage of the processing (jagwani et al., 2018). this paper attempts to predict closing stock prices using arima, to analyze the prediction with the actual value. the datasets consist of 7 attributes, out of which we will be interested in predicting the closing price of the stocks as it defines the company’s trading performance on day to day basis whether the stock prices have gone up (mahadik et al.,2021). tesla and nio stocks data from 10-12-2018 to 03-06-2022 have been taken for analysis and have been obtained from yahoo finance. the total number of observations during this period is 878. further, we split the data, training 80% and testing 20% into two parts. training data helps in model building and then with the help of testing data we predict whether it fits the data for accuracy. while this section has introduced the paper, section ii will briefly discuss the literature, section iii is based on the methodology and the data pre-processing, section iv will discuss the result of the analysis. in the section v we will conclude with direction for future research. 1517",,"and direction for future research This paper attempts to predict the future stock prices of TESLA and NIO using ARIMA. Using ARIMA modeling has been simple and the results have been promising. Further, more advancement can be done using SARIMAX, and various other ML (machine learning) algorithms like logistic regression, KNN, and Decision tree (CART), etc. The stock prices of companies depend upon current events, tweets, political news, and other factors. Hence, we can overcome these limitations by using Sentiment Analysis. Thus, we can develop a model which can be more accurate than the proposed model. Throughout the whole analysis and after forecasting the Closing prices for both TESLA and NIO, we observe that TESLA stock prices have been increasing at a fast rate than the NIO stock prices, whereas NIO has seen a plunge in its stock, which rings an alarm for NIO to do the several modifications required to be done. If TESLA keeps going with this increase in its stock prices, certainly it will give it more edge over its EV rivals like NIO and other companies globally.","sidharth tiwary (corresponding author) student of mba (business analytics) school of management studies, university of hyderabad, hyderabad sidharthtiwary73@gmail.com pramod k. mishra asst. prof. of operations management and decision sciences school of management studies, university of hyderabad, hyderabad pramod.mishra@uohyd.ac.in",

176,Fault Diagnostics On Vibration Data Of Taper Roller Bearing  Using Deep Learning Algorithms,"industries are looking for advanced maintenance techniques to reduce the cost of maintenance and increase the productivity of plants. fault diagnostics is the focus area to reduce the downtime of the machine and ensure its durability. bearing condition monitoring is important because bearings are the key component of rotary machines. bearing failure detection relies heavily on vibration signal analysis. a defect in a rolling element causes the bearing to generate an impulsively responsive signal. this work contributes to the development of the framework to generate and acquire bearing vibration data. the data is collected for healthy bearing, bearings with cage damage, and ball damage. it generates a unique pattern of vibration signals for each bearing defect at constant, increasing, increasing and decreasing, and decreasing and increasing speeds. the data is post-processed using deep learning techniques capable of diagnosing and categorizing the different failure conditions. the paper proposes feature extraction and deep learning algorithms for diagnosing bearing faults. feature extraction of signals is the traditional method of fault diagnosis, which involves expert knowledge and time. the 1d and 2d convolutional neural network (cnn) algorithms give an accuracy of 99%, which is far better than the feature extraction and artificial neural network (ann) techniques, with an accuracy of 55%. such techniques will help in the adaption of smart manufacturing in india.","industry 4.0, deep learning, arduino uno","a) According to feature extraction and data visualization studies, faulty bearings generate more vibrations, and the vibration spectrum differs significantly and uniquely between healthy and faulty conditions. b) The developed data acquisition unit is able to sense and capture the unique pattern in vibration signals. c) The new approach based on CNN is developed in this study for diagnosing faults in the time domain vibration signals of taper roller bearings by 2-D image generation from vibration signals and utilizing CNN effectively for classification of images. d) Comparative study of fault diagnosis using ANN, 1D CNN, and 2D CNN is done on the same bearing data set. This shows that ANN gives only 55% accuracy, whereas both CNN-based approaches, are able to do fault diagnosis with 99% accuracy. e) The robustness of the model is tested by carrying out the experiments at varying speeds of bearing and also with combined faults. Under such varying operating conditions the deviation in validation accuracy score is only 1%. Hence above methods proved to be automatic, fast, and reliable to implement in industries.","mahesh s. bankar department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management, college of engineering pune, maharashtra, india. bankarm03@gmail.com b. b. ahuja department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management, college of engineering pune, maharashtra, india. bba.mfg@coep.ac.in maneetkumar r. dhanvijay department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management, college of engineering pune, maharashtra, india. mrd.mfg@coep.ac.in",

184,Exposure To Paints And Respiratory Health Ailments Among  Painting Workers In Commercial Sectors,"background: the chemistry of paints has changed over time and this led to potential health hazards for house painters. survey and interviews scheduled on work profiles determined the exposure to solvents in commercial painting. painting work was observed in many work situations at different sites. aim: this research paper aims to explore the worker’s experiences with solvent-based and water-based paints regarding health implications. methods: the current study is related to research on paint workers' health issues. subjects for the study were chosen randomly from several places around uttar pradesh, india. an interview schedule was developed to collect relevant and maximum information. the study used a sample size of 150 that were not pre-determined. all the responders were from the labour class and worked with paints. a schedule of interviews was developed to gather information about the painters' demographic profile and current health status. the statistical approaches such as standard deviation and anova were used for analysis. results: the study reveals that painters are exposed to paints, so they have to face various health issues. painters were at high risk and significantly associated with health problems and respiratory issues compared to the average population. conclusion: our study highlighted the risk and problems among painters due to paints, including breathing problems, prolonged cough, chest discomfort and almost all lung problems.","carcinogen, chest discomfort, respiratory health, including pigments","This paper highlighted the risks and problems of paints among painters, including breathing problems, prolonged cough, chest discomfort, or almost all lung problems. Painting workers are supposed to get exposed to various physical, chemical, and biological carcinogens responsible for health problems. Respiratory and other health risk is often associated with dust and smoke, chemical pollutants, solvents, etc. As reported in the observations and studies, most of these toxic smokes, gases, residue, and other toxic particles can penetrate masks and other safety equipment, endangering painters even though precautionary measures are taken. The study came up with conclusions based on the research objectives in the study area. They were as follows: (a) The population at risk of ill health effects of paint exposure was significantly associated with age. (b) The study confirmed the presence and association between painting and asthmatic symptoms, bronchitis symptoms, lungs issue, heart issues, and other health problems. Therefore, it was concluded that the high proportion of painters suffering from various disease symptoms associated with painting was due to the presence of health hazards associated with the painting occupation. (c) It was observed that painters in the study were less using a mask during work and concluded that this lack of protection increased exposure time, increasing the likelihood of contracting disease symptoms associated with painting.

187,"Evaluating Academic Staff Development Strategies In A  Higher Education Institution Using Hybrid Swot, Ism,","human resource development has been an interesting topic to be discussed since it strategically improves the overall organizational performance. moreover, the industrial era 4.0 which has been growing rapidly also demands the need for agile human resources. universities as educational institution have a vital role to contribute to this development. a good academic staff development practice will bring positive impact to the quality of students so that it is strongly required to build a better capacity building system for younger generation. on the other hand, human resource development is a domain which can be solved using the mcdm approach as it involves multiple factors as well as decision-makers (dms) to make an effective strategic decision. accordingly, this study aims to develop an evaluation model for human resource development strategies in the education sector. specifically, an academic staff development case in terms of research policy is selected and then the model is tested at a private university in indonesia. in this study, the integration of three methods – swot matrix, interpretative structural modeling (ism), and analytic network process (anp) – is applied where a swot matrix focuses on identifying the relevant strategies, the ism method is to model causal relationships among the strategies, and the anp method is to prioritize the strategies using the importance weights obtained based on the ism structure. finally, this study has identified the 18 academic staff development strategies and presented a fundamental and a target strategy that can be recommended to the dms.",swot,"This study integrates three methods, namely SWOT analysis, ISM, and ANP for academic staff development strategies applied in a private university in Indonesia. A SWOT analysis is selected to identify the strategies taking into account both internal and external factors. Then, the integration between ISM and ANP is proposed to evaluate a more effective and thorough academic staff development policy since it may not only model the causal relations, but also finding a key strategy by taking into account the importance weight based on the strategies’ relationship. In this study, it is considered that the WO4 strategy – increased research outputs – has become a fundamental strategy for the others. Although this paper has developed a new evaluation model for human resource development strategies demonstrated by selecting academic staff, it is encouraged to investigate another subject such as student development since these two entities are main asset for the educational institution.

The study analyzed the data collected from 389 young entrepreneurs using closed-ended questionnaires using the Rasch Model. Innovativeness and proactiveness did not differ significantly between the two individuals, according to the findings of this study. However, the key finding of this study is that the risk-taking abilities of entrepreneurs from generations Y and Z differ dramatically. The findings of this study reveal that both gen Y and gen Z entrepreneurs have enormous potential for entrepreneurial success. The results of this study provided new light on entrepreneurial education for these two generations. Education and training can be administered in the same manner to these two generations because of their entrepreneurial similarities. The mentorship program is ineffective for Gen Z; instead, they should be supplied with various resources and opportunities to assist them learn independently throughout their entrepreneurial path. A weakness of this study is that only Greater Jakarta data were collected. A number of questions remain unanswered. First, comparative research on the entrepreneurial performance of entrepreneurs from generations Y and Z is required.

Conclusions are presented as follows: 1. Based on the conclusions above, it can be explained that with environmental accounting understanding and the importance for companies to protect the surrounding environment by managing waste and applying environmental management accounting, it can help accounting students understand the importance of implementing environmental accounting for companies to meet the company's business sustainability. 2. Pro-environmental behavior is measured by various indicators and factors that shape pro-environmental behavior so that it can be explained that individuals who have adopted pro-environmental behavior will help increase awareness of the environment both for themselves and for the common good. 3. In carrying out environmental conservation, knowledge and real adoption are needed in realizing these activities. The presence of go-green-based applications can help everyone increase environmental awareness by using applications that help recycle plastic waste and reduce the use of paper waste to reduce the accumulation of plastic waste and minimize excessive deforestation.","application usage on environmental awareness of accounting students mariska renate desiree setijanto accounting department, school of accounting bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 mariska.setijanto@binus.ac.id toto rusmanto professor, accounting department, school of accounting bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 trusmanto@binus.ac.id",
196,Analysis Of E-Commerce Repurchase Intention By  Consumers During The Covid-19 Pandemic Based On Social,"the emergence of global social isolation in the context of the covid-19 pandemic accelerated the growth of e- commerce to a high level, that allowed companies to become more technologically aware of customer management, moving from a traditional system to a modern one. however, this change has not been carried out in a drastic way, and even not completely, because the peruvian commercial environment is difficult to penetrate, and it is complicated to displace the already established sales channels. therefore, in this research, data was collected from the main e- commerce companies in the peruvian market, at the national level (falabella peru and ripley peru), to demonstrate the importance of social media management as a factor promoting repurchase intention and that, consequently, it is an important aspect to consider during the elaboration of loyalty models in organizations. for this reason, a survey was used as a data collection tool and the information obtained was analyzed using structural equation modeling with ibm spss amos software. given this, the most relevant result obtained was that social media activities have a positive and significant effect on repurchase intention. on the contrary, brand equity and customer relationship have a positive relationship, but not as relevant for repurchase intention.","social networks, e-commerce","H1: There is an effect of social media activities on repurchase intention. According to the model analyzed, it can be concluded that there is an effect of social media activities on repurchase intention in an e-commerce company, and that, moreover, this influence is significantly positive. As previously explained in the numerical results, the management of social networks presents a direct effect estimate of 1.35 on repurchase intention, and also shows a regression weight of 0.561, the highest of all the proposed paths. Therefore, the importance of implementing the use of social networks for pre- and post-sales processes as a driver of the repurchase intention indicator can be deduced. H2: There is an effect of the relationship with the customer on repurchase intention. The results obtained allow us to affirm that there is a non-significant positive direct effect of customer relationship on repurchase intention, this is supported by the fact that, when analyzing the direct effects table, an estimate of 0.016 is found for this path. Furthermore, once the regression weight is reviewed, an estimate of 0.048 is found, which is of little importance compared to the rest of the variables. H3: There is an effect of brand value on repurchase intention. Regarding the third hypothesis, it is concluded that there is an effect of brand value on repurchase intention. Although the influence is positive, this does not represent the ideal path, as it remains with a relatively low direct effect estimate (0.20) and an even lower regression weight (0.126). This indicates that brand value is not a variable that can be directly considered as a factor influencing repurchase intention. H4: There is an effect of social media activities on customer relationship. Although the relationship with the customer is not related to repurchase intention, the bond with the consumer is influenced indirectly by social networks, since it is a consequence of social network behavior. The table of direct effects explains that the estimate for both variables is -1, which allows us to understand that while one rises, the other tends to fall. On the other hand, in the revision of the regression weight, it is found that this indirect effect is negative and insignificant, having an estimate value of -0.138. 1791","network behavior grecia ximena mendoza fernandez, fiorella giuliana riojas rebata, yvan jesus garcia lopez facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, perú 20181175@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20181606@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe","References

197,Implementing Lean Six Sigma To Improve The Turnaround  Time Of Blood Samples In A Private Hospital Of India,"healthcare organizations implement the lean six sigma (lss) methodology to achieve performance in terms of cost, quality, and productivity. the purpose of this paper is to implement lss in the casualty of a private hospital in india to mitigate the issue of high turnaround time (tat) of the blood samples. the dmaic (define-measure- analyse-improve-control) strategy was utilized as the model of problem-solving during lss implementation. a team comprising two doctors, three nursing staff, and two support staff was formed to carry out the project. in this work, we found that multiple variables could impact the high tat of the blood samples in casualty, thereby prolonging the patient stay and crowding. in a phased manner, the casualty workforce under the guidance of the lss professional could able to utilize the power of simple lss tools like process flow map, ishikawa diagram, sipoc, 5-why analysis, spc, etc, to find the root causes and take corrective actions during the implementation process. as a result, the average tat is reduced from 164 minutes to a new average of 84 minutes. this study was restricted to a specific area in a multispecialty hospital in india. hence the validity can be built on by including other departments in the same hospital or doing similar studies in other hospitals. the findings will empower the researchers, professionals, and managers in the healthcare sector to incorporate a similar way of hands-on training and simultaneous lss implementation for continuous process improvement.","lean six sigma, healthcare, casualty","and Limitations The TAT is an important parameter in effective patient care, especially in the setting of a casualty. This study aimed to reduce the TAT based on the DMAIC approach used in LSS. It is seen that every single aspect of DMAIC has been successfully applied to the whole laboratory process in the casualty. After the successful implementation of quality-improvement strategies, the TAT showed significant improvements and process stability during the study period. The reasons for the delay in lab processing time were also identified and rectified during the process. It was observed that the laboratory turnaround time was reduced significantly. The findings from this study demonstrated that DMAIC methods can be used in a different setting to obtain significant improvement in the process. There were some limitations in our study. First, this study was conducted in a single hospital and the findings may not be generalized to all institutions as they have a different SOP, manpower, etc. for the laboratory process.

201,An Explainable Machine Learning Model To Optimize  Demand Forecasting In Company Deos,"nowadays, having an accurate demand forecast is extremely important as it allows the company to manage resources in an optimal way and thus achieve greater productivity. there is a large demand for accurate forecasting, and utilizing artificial intelligence can help companies gain a better understanding of their market. in this research presentation, machine learning (ml) is used to optimize demand forecasting. the data collected was trained and due to the available data rate, the cross-validation technique was used to avoid overfitting. using time-series, it will be possible to predict future sales for the first trimester of 2021. finally, the impact of the ml tool on the deviation of the company's demand forecast was evaluated using indicators of accuracy (forecast accuracy) and bias (forecast bias).","demand forecast, machine learning, forecast accuracy","It was possible to identify the main causes that affect the monthly forecast and generate a deviation. In general, the most relevant causes were Exogenous Factors and Event Analysis (past and future). Specifically for the category of deodorants, the main cause identified is Marketing Activities. In addition, a forecast accuracy percentage greater than 80% was achieved in the first trimester of 2021 (January: 82%, February: 83%, March: 84%). This is aligned with the company's goal of having a high value to ensure more accurate forecasts. No expected results were achieved for the bias forecast because the models achieved values are outside the desired range of -5% to 5% (January: 16%, February: 7%, March: 14%). It should be noted that February was the only month that obtained a better result than the current method used by the company (7% vs -14%). Finally, the impact that Machine Learning can bring to the company if implemented was evaluated; the most outstanding benefit is that existing resources can be channeled to create a good marketing and sales strategy at the point of sale, which reduces the main problem of deviation.","cabrera feijoo gianella, germana valverde jimena facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, perú 20170231@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20170640@aloe.ulima.edu.pe garcia-lopez yvan jesus facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, perú ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe",

206,Impact Of Covid-19 On The Efficiency Of Nifty Pharma  Companies,"the current study examines the efficiency changes of nifty pharma firms before and during the covid-19 pandemic. the sample has 17 selected pharmaceutical firms that represent a large fraction of pharmaceutical sector in india. using data envelopment analysis (dea) the study reports an increase in overall efficiency in the years 2020 and 2021. further, the improvement in scale of operations was reported among the sample of firms. pre-pandemic surge in the number of production (pure) efficient firms subsided by the end of 2021, marking negative impact of covid-19 on the allocation of inputs by pharmaceutical firms. it was found that production efficiency positively correlates with firm size and negatively with age. we recommend that inefficient companies optimize their scale efficiency through mergers and acquisitions, organic growth, restructuring, or outsourcing. production efficiency can be achieved by minimizing salaries, wages, and bonuses, which presents a sensitive issue for managers to devise salary-cutting policies. lastly, the study reports changing nature of reference companies, thus highlighting the importance of regular efficiency benchmarking.","covid-19, dea",,"hanna olasiuk and sanjeev kumar o.p. jindal global university, jindal global business school sonipat narela road, haryana, india, 131001 holasiuk@jgu.edu.in, sanjeevkumar@jgu.edu.in","references for input optimization. Analysis has shown that 
greater production efficiency is positively associated with firm size and negatively with age. However, further 
improvement of production efficiency seems challenging as it involves compensation of employees. 
Notwithstanding the progress made by the firms, 7 companies from Nifty Pharma list need to improve production 
efficiency and 8 require certain scale adjustment.  
 
Negative shock presented by Covid-19 pandemic has proven the agility of pharmaceutical business in India. On 
the other side the resilience could be created by the speculative demand, which triggered companies to increase 
output. It is to be examined further whether these firms will be able to keep the level of efficiency or opportunities 
presented by pandemic will vanish over time. The study can be elaborated by exploring the relationship between 
efficiency and stock prices of the above-mentioned companies.

210,An Intelligent Prediction Model For Thrust Force And  Torque Using Machine Learning Approach In Friction,"friction drilling is a chip less hole-making process in which a conical tool is used to form the hole on the sheet metal by frictional heating. metal flows plastically in both upward and downward directions. the extruded metal on top is converted into the boss with the help of the shoulder of the tool while downward extruded material is well controlled to form the bush. a formed bush can be threaded and used to screw other connecting parts. the process is suitable for sheet metal having a thickness of less than 5 mm and finding applications in automobiles, furniture, etc. thrust force and torque are two important parameters which affect the frictional heating during hole formation and thereafter tool wear and hole quality. in this work, experimentation on low carbon steel, aisi 1018 has been carried out at the vertical machining center. for real-time data acquisition of thrust force and torque, kistler dynamometer equipped with dynoware software is used. the thrust force and torque prediction model for friction drilling of aisi 1018 steel has been developed using random forest (rf) and regularization methods (rm). ridge and lasso regression which are important tools in rm have been utilized to model the measured data for thrust force and torque. gridsearch(gs) technique has been used for tuning hyperparameters. the random forest (rf) gives a reliable prediction of thrust force with 𝑅𝑅2= 0.97, mean absolute error (mae) = 71.91 n, root mean square error (rmse) = 96 n on training data and 𝑅𝑅2 = 0.92, mae =140 n, rmse = 96 n on test data. similarly, torque prediction random forest (rf) gives better predictions than rm on test data with 𝑅𝑅2 = 0.93, mean absolute error (mae) = 0.22 nm, and rmse = 0.29 nm but on training data performance is almost similar both the methods. comparisons among rf, ridge, and lasso regression show that rf is an effective technique to ensure high predictive accuracy of thrust force and torque.","friction drilling, random forest, machine learning","The Modeling and prediction of response parameters of any machining process positively impact production in terms of reduction in cost and resources. 1. The result clearly shows that Random Forest algorithm performed much better than Regularization method and it gives MAE between Actual and predicted Thrust Force 140 N on test data. 2. Both regularization techniques Ridge and Lasso Regression gives nearly same prediction in terms of 𝑅𝑅2 which is 0.91 and 0.88 on test data respectively. 3. Random Forest gives better results in case of Torque Prediction and both the Regularization techniques gives nearly same results in case of Thrust force and Torque Predictions. 4. For dealing with Underfitting and Overfitting hyperparameters of all three models were tuned with the help of GridSearch (GS) technique from that we get optimum values of Hyperparameters. In case of RF max_depth = 5, max_features =2 and n_estimators =10 these are the optimum values of hyperparameters. Optimum values of hyperparameter in case of Ridge and Lasso Regression are 𝛼𝛼 = 0.1 and 𝛼𝛼 = 1 respectively. The result shows that the RF could be utilized by process operators to predict thrust force parameters prior to the actual production process in order to save the cost of material and resources.","drilling process 𝐊𝐊𝐊𝐊𝐊𝐊𝐊𝐊𝐊𝐊 𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝐒𝟏𝟏 and 𝐃𝐃𝐃𝐃.

216,The Connection Between Manufacturing And Energy Sector  And Its Impact On Indonesia’S Economic Growth,"this paper examines how indonesia challenge the issue of energy availability to support indonesian manufacturing. considering the number of manufacturing industries in indonesia, the country requires a significant amount of energy. the total energy supply owned by indonesia cannot fulfill the demand of manufacturing because several other supporting sectors require energy supplies as well. this study uses qualitative and secondary data taken from various literatures relevant to this topic. in addition, the author also uses the theory of economic diplomacy to analyze the problem of energy availability for manufacturing with the aim of indonesia’s economic growth.","manufacturing, energy sector, trade","The manufacturing industry in Indonesia is needed from the existence of an energy supply. The adequate energy supply can help the manufacturing sector in fulfill its needs so that it can move well. Based on the theory, there are four points discussed among others, trade, investment, industrial cooperation, and labor. First, in the trade, there is a role of China as an income contributor in the Asian region that requires Indonesia's energy supply to fulfill its needs. Second, in the investment, Indonesian foreign investments can help in encouraging productivity, Indonesia can be further developed and have more advanced technology in manufacturing. Three, Indonesia cooperates with the United States in maintaining energy availability and developing technology and knowledge. Four, the existence of this manufacturing can also help Indonesia in providing even greater employment opportunities in the country. With the opportunity of employment, it can reduce the unemployment rate in the country. Finally, the reduced unemployment rate can also have an impact on the country of Indonesia because it will be able to have an impact on increasing economic growth.

Precisely, this paper conveys comparative analysis from lens of disaster management regulations in both countries, including the similarities and differences. To begin with both countries are prone to disaster due to its geographical profiles as its similarities among other significant factors. Furthermore, in term of differences among other significant factors, there are the considerations of whether the disaster management coordination is overlapping or not, in each of the mentioned countries. Similar to Indonesia and Japan, then other countries have to consider subsequent series of disaster management as precautions in at least three stages of Natural Disaster Management, known as NDM. This NDM comprises precautions actions prior, during and posterior the occurrence of disaster. Those actions are meticulously categorized as disaster preparedness, disaster response and disaster recovery, according to several scholar works. Ultimately, it can further be improved for future research in both theoretical and empirical perspectives, not only in Indonesia and Japan, but also for the rest of countries worldwide.","business engineering trilogy khristian edi nugroho soebandrija industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering bina nusantara university jakarta, 11480, indonesia knugroho@binus.edu meilani civil engineering department, faculty of engineering bina nusantara university jakarta, 11480, indonesia meilani@binus.edu",
218,Influence Of Amplitude On The Value Of Noise In Sinusoidal  Signal,"in expressing sinusoidal waves mathematically with the addition of the amplitude parameters, the equation becomes x(n) = σan sin 2πfnt. signals in the form of sinusoidal waves can experience interference when getting frequency readings. this interference is caused by the presence of noise in the sinusoidal wave signal. in this study, the amplitude of sinusoidal signal and noise will be compared to determine how much noise affects frequency readings. the method adopted to transform discrete data x(n) into frequency is the discrete fourier transform. based on the results obtained, when the amplitude value in discrete data is greater than the noise value, frequency readings are defined and clear. noise value double the value of the amplitude value can still yield frequency readings from a structure; however, results are barely comprehensible.","amplitude, noise, frequency, signal","After conducting this study, it can be concluded: • The amplitude value of 1 and the noise 0.5 can be concluded that the noise has not interfered with the reading of the value of the structure frequency • The amplitude value is 0.1 and the noise is 0.5, it can be concluded that the noise has interfered with the reading of the value of the structure frequency • The amplitude value of 0.01 and the noise of 0.5 can be concluded that the noise has interfered with the reading of the value of the structure frequency • Amplitude value in discrete data which is greater than the noise value gives clear frequency readings • Noise value with twice the amplitude value can still read the frequency value from the structure • The noise value is 2 times greater than the amplitude value, causing difficulty in determining the reading of the frequency value.","irpan hidayat, roesdiman soegiarso and made suangga, riza suwondo civil engineering department, faculty of engineering bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia irpan@binus.edu , roesdimans@pps.untar.ac.id , suangga@binus.edu; riza.suwondo@binus.ac.id",

227,Supporting Class Infrastructure Through Task Management  Mobile Application During Pandemic,"during the pandemic, most university students have difficulties interacting with lecturers to follow and update their project progress periodically. procrastination is a problem that often occurs in this kind of circumstance. developing the sustainable infrastructure that may be implemented for this situation needs further consideration, and several factors contribute. digital technology scientifically can optimize or improve performance also interaction between lecturers and students. utilizing mobile apps as tools to support the infrastructure of class activities can help break down their projects, and it also ensures the sequence stays in the proper order. constructing tools for students using the app task management may improve their productivity in running tasks assigned by their lecturers. the methodology used is in-depth interviews (qualitative) with students and lecturers, supported by a literature review based on design thinking for educators by ideo design by tim brown. the authors also analyze and visualize based on the data obtained from the research methodology. the results show that there is potential for both students and lecturers to use this app in their classrooms as they are likely to use it to manage their tasks and for lecturers to keep track of their student's progress and give feedback.","procrastination, digital method, productivity","and Recommendation After going through research, analysis, design concept, and experimentation, the researchers, have emerged with a more effective way to maintain interaction between lecturers and students through digital design methods. They are constructing tools to improve student project monitoring that can be implemented based on mobile apps to avoid procrastination problems. For students, it can be challenging to start on more significant tasks as the amount of work can seem overwhelming. Therefore, the tasks can be broken down into smaller, more achievable goals in subtasks to make them more manageable. Utilizing this Task Management mobile app would help students visually keep track of their projects in class with a pre-determined list of tasks from their lecturers. This project has the potential to be implemented in classrooms to help visually inform student progress of their projects and remind them of their deadlines and for lecturers to give feedback and track their student's progress in every project they assign. It can be a sustainable solution.","emanuel saptaputra, vera jenny basiroen, and abigail nagaria department of visual communication design graphic design and new media program, binus northumbria school of design jakarta, indonesia emanuel@binus.edu, nonjane@binus.edu, abigail.christian@binus.ac.id",

229,"Global Corporate Responsibility, Transparency, And The  Environment: Tracing Indonesian Second Trier Suppliers Of","as stakeholders increasingly demand products produced socially and environmentally responsible, multi-national corporations (mncs) have since 1990 more and more joined global corporate responsibility (gcr) frameworks showing an increased awareness of mncs about the need for sustainable forms of production in their supply chains. uniqlo is one of the global fashion brands committed to global gcr standards. it will look for suppliers that operate in an environmentally responsible manner. in total, fourteen first tier and nine second-tier suppliers of uniqlo are indonesian companies. in this paper, we have examined the participation of uniqlo’s indonesian second-tier supplying factories in proper, the environmental management rating program of the indonesian ministry of environment. our research shows that since 2015, uniqlo’s 2nd tier suppliers increasingly participate in proper – starting from 2021, all uniqlo’s indonesian 2nd tier suppliers participate in proper. we conclude that this increased participation in proper may indicate increased pressure on supplier companies from mncs such as uniqlo to demonstrate environmentally responsible management. to anticipate a growing demand for environmentally responsible production, we recommended that the indonesian government expands the proper program to include companies with a less expected/potential environmental impact, such as sewing factories, or develop a similar program for such companies so that these companies can demonstrate compliance with international gcr standards of production and management. keyword global corporate responsibility, environmental responsibility, japanese companies, supply chain, indonesia 1. introduction japanese multinational companies are significant players in the global economy. multinationals have worldwide production and distribution networks and are increasingly held accountable by stakeholders – consumers and shareholders - for the behavior of partner companies in their supply and distribution chain. the presence of multinational cooperation may bring advantages in the country of origin and the country where its suppliers are located. however, the demand by mncs for cheap products may also have negative consequences, among other environmental degradation. (saleh 1991) with the issue of global warming gaining prominence on the world stage, there is increasing pressure on mncs to tackle sustainability, recycling, water, air pollution, and waste throughout their supply chain. the environmental policies of heavy industry and mining sectors have long been on the radar of ngos as the environmental damage has been acknowledged for a long time. since the 1990s, however, the sustainability of the fashion industry and the impact of fashion brands and their suppliers on the environment (and human rights) has gained prominence. consumers and other stakeholders increasingly demand environmentally sustainable production. bad publicity about environmental pollution may cause damage to the brand. vice versa, a ""green"" image will increase the value of a fashion brand's products. the fashion industry is more polluting than most people realize. it is responsible for 20 percent of global wastewater, 10 percent carbon emissions, and vast amounts of waste. every second, one garbage truck full of textiles is landfilled or incinerated. our clothing is also polluting the ocean with plastic. (un alliance for sustainable fashion addresses damage of 'fast fashion,' 14-march-2019, https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/un-alliance- 2086",,"Uniqlo is a global fashion brand committed to environmentally sustainable production according to GCR standards. This research has indicated that Uniqlo is relatively transparent by publishing lists of its first-tier and second-tier suppliers compared to other Japanese and global fashion brands. Databases such as those published by the Fashion Transparency Index increase the accessibility of sustainability reports and other public data published by MNCs and will increase pressure on MNCs to increase their transparency on environmental management. Our research has attempted to develop a framework to investigate whether Uniqlo's commitment to sustainable environmental management moves down the supply chain. Figure 1 shows that since 2015, Uniqlo's 2nd tier suppliers increasingly participate in PROPER – starting from 2021, all Uniqlo's Indonesian 2nd tier suppliers participate in PROPER. In 2020 5 of 6 suppliers participating in PROPER scored “Blue” (compliance) and only the new participant PT Jiale Indonesia scored “Red”. PT. Winnersumbiri Knitting Factory, the company that scored “Red” in 2019 improved its environmental performance in 2020 and scored “Blue”. These developments indicate that it is likely that suppliers of Uniqlo are encouraged by Uniqlo to participate in PROPER and to score at least “Blue”. On the one hand the commitment of Uniqlo to produce in environmentally sustainable ways encourages Uniqlo to advance its agenda of sustainable production to its suppliers and to participate in schemes such as PROPER. On the other hand, increased participation of its suppliers in PROPER makes Uniqlo increasingly vulnerable to bad performances of its suppliers – resulting in bad publicity. While proof of environmental-friendly management is in the interest of suppliers of MNCs and may increase the value and the market of Indonesian factories, bad environmental performance does quite the opposite, as it damages the image of the brand. Hence there is increased pressure on supplier companies of MNCs such as Uniqlo to demonstrate environmentally responsible management. On a more abstract level, it shows how international commitments by MNCs to adhere to GCR standards impact on production and management of suppliers at local levels. As a global fashion brand, Uniqlo pushes for the implementation of international GCR standards in all factories within its supply chain. Indonesian producers can anticipate such global developments and GCR standards by participating in initiatives such as PROPER. Hence it is recommended that the Indonesian government expands the PROPER program to include companies with a less expected/potential environmental impact, such as sewing factories, or develop a similar program in which the environmental performance of such companies is rated so that these companies – such as the first tier companies (sewing factories) of Uniqlo - are in turn stimulated to be transparent about their environmental performance and will have an incentive to implement high environmental management standards.","japanese fashions brands abdul rasyid and stijn cornelis van huis business law program, law department, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 arasyid@binus.edu, stjin.huis@binus.edu",
230,Implementing Abc Tools To Increase Behavior Based  Safety At Bolon House Construction In Ulos Village North,"today, many organizations worldwide from manufacturers to construction building, to governments are still struggling to achieve their safety performance by increasing people’s behavior and mind sets to achieve zero accident. there’s a tools that can be used as an approach to reduce the accidents called behavior based safety (bbs). the value of this tool is obvious. in business, including building construction need an improvement, especially in safety, they generally result in better safety, quality, and productivity. through this paper we will discuss how to provide the latest state-of the-art behavioral safety process and abc tools for the involvement of workers and contractors and building a positive safety culture in the company. by doing the abc method, we will learn how the problem can be solved by measuring the antecedent, behavior, and consequences of the unsafe condition and unsafe action to prevent the accident of workers and also to increase safety performance, safety awareness, and productivity.","zero accident, abc method, company culture","Company could encourage their workers to improve their workplace by increasing safety performance to achieve company goals with zero accidents. The company has responsibility to provide workplaces are safe and productive. BBS can be applied when the worker adopts a positive attitude toward changing and improving the way they work and puts the attitude into action. By following safety standard, the workers will have a better workplace with small risks. BBS is the fundamental of the company safety culture, as a business practice, a tool, the way of learning, thinking, and improving. Within a gradual process that has been an accumulation from many decades of effort. People learned how to identify and understood the unsafe condition and unsafe action and solve the problem. Company’s safety performance metrics are increasing again within a better observation and it will become stronger in the future utilizing ABC concept as a tool in the organization, business practices and culture. Company need to develop the safety culture to continue the thinking process of people which involves individuals thinking outside of themselves. To ensure the problem solving is proper implement and well addressed, the authors recommend that a company need to ensure that employees in problem solving situations not to jump to conclusions that may become an obvious solutions. Those solutions normally have a component of emotional attachment which may not address the true issue. The company safety culture must engage other team members who can contribute to the deeper and better solution. Missing the optimum opportunities will affect to company safety performance and it will accumulate throughout the year. The organizations that implementing the ABC and BBS concept should drive, by management and good leadership thought processes. With proper training and mentoring, more employees should become champions of safety improvement. ABC and BBS must be attached in people’s mind set and in everything that being done in the organization to help the employees constantly learn how to be more safe, effective through following the safety standard. ABC tools leads to improved Productivity, increased safety, and better morale. When ABC is first introduced, many companies see safety and productivity increase by 30 to 100 percent ABC tool helps and lets management become more attentive to people’s need because it creates a good environment and morale. The ABC tool strategy strives to improve the safety performance while paying attention to results. The ABC method is good for many companies to solve the unsafe condition and unsafe action/behavior. The case study proved that it also represents a suitable tool for the searching and effective implementing good improvement at the Ulos Villages, especially on Bolon traditional house. Method that encourages people to be more creative, explore the critical thinking and communicate as a team, especially the improvement team. Innovation needs interdisciplinary team approach.

236,A Temporal-Causal Network Model For Hypertension  Among Young Adults,"hypertension is a major public health problem because of its high ubiquity among around the world. currently, hypertension in young adults is very common. it is because of the increase in lifestyle behaviors with advancement of technology and better standard of living. the factors responsible for hypertension among young adults are unspecified. the risk of hypertension is very high among young adults as it contributes to an early onset of coronary heart diseases, stroke and ephemeral ischemic attacks. the work mainly focuses on the identification of major facets responsible for hypertension in young adults and to develop a computational model for determining hypertension. the data collection is carried out among young adults in the community through clinical tests. a set of questionnaires are prepared based on the study to analyze what are the risk factors for hypertension. statistical analysis is done to identify the major contributing risk factors and network-oriented modeling based on temporal-causal network (tcn) is used for preparing the computational model for hypertension. the novelty of this paper is the usage of temporal-causal network modeling, which helps in depicting and cope- with causal dependencies, propagation over time. with the help of statistical analysis and network-oriented modeling using temporal-causal network, facets contributing hypertension among young adults are identified and the progression of disease is modeled.","hypertension, ischemic attacks","The existing work focuses on the identification and analysis of the factors that leads to hypertension among the young adults and used these factors to develop a computational model based on temporal-causal network to determine hypertension among the young adults. The model used was a neurologically inspired computational model based on temporal-causal network for determining hypertension level using certain input factors. The input factors responsible for elevating and alleviating hypertension were identified from literature review and discussion with medical practitioners. The factors were analyzed through Exploratory factor analysis. The questionnaire consists of 28 questions and the analysis was carried out for each of the 28 questions. These 28 components were extracted after factor analysis to compress into 15 set of components. These 15 sets of components are being grouped into 6 factors through factor analysis and are sorted according to their function. The exploratory factor analysis revealed the presence of six factors exceeding 1, explaining 25.15%, 15.26%, 14.38%, 7.75%, 7.25% and 6.81% of the variance respectively. The six factors found out through factor analysis are Mental stress, Food habits, Family support, Depression, Lifestyle habits and Aggression. The computational model developed based on Temporal-causal Network to determine hypertension is valid since it passes validation test conducted for 60 data points out of 138 data points. The validation of the model brings one observation into light, that is, irrespective of the hypertension value, the level of hypertension is significantly affected by the mental stress, lifestyle habit and food habitual values that keeps the level from dropping to zero. It can be also noted that 16% of the respondents who are having lower family support along with mild depression and aggression significantly affecting hypertension. The model helps to know about the progression of hypertension with the input values for the find out factors such as mental stress, aggression, depression, Time Time Hypertension 2158","reshma s and dr. k sunil kumar department of mechanical engineering college of engineering trivandrum, thiruvananthapuram, kerala rameshreshma095@gmail.com, ksk_sunil@cet.ac.in","References

238,The Effect Of Adding Zinc Titanate Nanoparticle And Ecofriendly Sunflower Oil To Mql On Surface Roughness And,"turning, as well as other types of mechanical cutting operations, are absolutely necessary for the machining of advanced cutting materials (inconel718). for the manufacturing of aerospace components, pressure vessels, and race car engine parts, inconel 718 superalloy has been widely used in the manufacturing industries, due to its excellent mechanical properties such as high impact and tensile strength at very high temperatures, high-temperature resistance, and corrosion resistance. but machining inconel-718 is restricted to use in some industries due to the inability of tool material to survive for a longer period of time due to the work-hardened effect and it is having low thermal conductivity, due to this property, a huge amount of the cutting temperature dissipates towards the cutting tool instead of the cutting chip. when machining processes are performed, heat dissipation becomes a more difficult task. because of this, the tool life and the quality of the machined surface are negatively affected. as a result of this, while machining advanced materials the flood coolant (fc) cutting fluid was used in order to reduce the enormous amounts of heat that are produced at the cutting zone; however, the government has released restrictions on the usage of alternative cooling (fc) techniques to reduce its “effects on the atmosphere and the operator's health”(gupta et al., 2021a). mql is employed as a substitute for traditional cutting fluids since it reduces lubricant consumption, and environmental & health impacts. however, pure mql cooling does not provide appropriate cooling performance. the introduction of eco-friendly vegetable oil (sunflower oil) and nanoparticles (zinc titanate, zntio3) into the minimum quantity lubrication led to significant improvements to the fluid's viscosity, thermal conductivity, and wettability which further reduces the cutting temperatures and cutting forces. in this research, a number of experiments were performed on inconel-718 “under different cooling conditions such as dry machining, pure mql, and mql-nanofluid using the same cutting parameters (depth of cut, feed, cutting speed)”(tamang et al., 2018) with regard to surface roughness, and cutting temperatures. an interesting result showed that the mql-nanofluid technique was more effective in reducing cutting temperature and enhanced surface finish when compared to pure-mql, dry cutting. using eco- friendly cutting fluid with mql shows promising outcomes in terms of sustainability and machining outputs.","inconel-718, mql, dry cutting",,"cutting temperature in turning of inconel -718. pandi jyothish research scholar, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology (nit), warangal, india. jy719054@student.nitw.ac.in v. vasu professor, department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology (nit), warangal, india vasu@nitw.ac.in dhurke kashinath professor, department of chemistry national institute of technology (nit), warangal, india. kashinath@nitw.ac.in",

240,Customer Analytics Using Multicriteria And Machine  Learning: A Case Study On Foody Application Vietnam,"online platforms allow customers leave their opinions after using products or services. data collected from customers is enormous. how to organize and transform the data to useful information is one of the most important work to improve future business strategies. this study focuses on customer analytics to define the potential certain groups of customers so restaurants can concentrate their efforts and to build a database system that includes a satisfaction rating scale in order to benefit in the customer's experience. this study applies a method combining machine learning (ml) techniques and multi-criteria decision making (mcdm), with the case study of customers on foody vietnam. using the criteria rating data, the revised fuzzy c-means (rfcm) clustering technique builds descriptive modeling to discover customer segmentation while random forest (rf) technique builds predictive modeling to show satisfaction classification. method based on the removal effects of criteria (merec) ranks the criteria that customers of each generated segment rate on the foody platform, which are location, space, quality, service, and price. the results give three segments of customers with different criteria ranking and a customer preference prediction. the study provides a better insight into customer understanding and therefore, helps restaurant owners in terms of improving overall customer experiences.","customer analytics, machine learning","The study works on the customer analytics problem to help Foody business understand the customers, therefore, make a wise business decision as well as benefit customers with better service and experience since service is served distinctively. Different forms and promotional activities, different bundles and incentives can be used for different segments based on the unique needs and characteristics. The work carries out three main phases including customer segmentation by applying Revised Fuzzy C-Means, criteria ranking by applying Method Based on the Removal Effects of Criteria, and customer satisfaction prediction by applying Random Forest. The results suggest that segment 1 includes the group of customers that have best experience out of three segments, segment 2 includes the group of customers that have average experience from the restaurants and segment 3 includes the group of customers that have not-so-good experience. In terms of each segment, to improve customer experience, businesses can adjust the “Price” criterion for segment 1, create a better “Space” for segment 2 and provide better 2206","luong thi ngoc anh school of industrial engineering and management international university – vietnam national university of ho chi minh city ho chi minh, vietnam luonganh30499@gmail.com ha thi xuan chi school of industrial engineering and management international university – vietnam national university of ho chi minh city ho chi minh, vietnam htxchi@hcmiu.edu.vn pham huynh tram school of industrial engineering and management international university – vietnam national university of ho chi minh city ho chi minh, vietnam phtram@hcmiu.edu.vn","References

The projected demand for 2017 with the Least Square method alone is 28,833 units. The next step the researcher needs to do is calculate the multiplicative seasonal variation method to find out the number of requests each month from the projected demand results with the Least Square method.

243,Evaluation Of Business Model And The Supplier Selection  Of Xyz Company Using Ahp Method,"this study aims to see pt xyz problem in the big picture, the company's business model is analyzed using business model canvas, and the supplier selection is calculated using analytical hierarchy process (ahp) method. the criteria considered by the managers when picking the right supplier are quality (71.68%), delivery system (20.9%), and procurement system (7.4%). the result proposed the best suppliers for duck meat according to the preferences are supplier 2 (52%), supplier 3 (21.9%), supplier 1 (13.5%), and random selection (12.6%). the result proposed the best suppliers for boneless chicken according to the preferences are supplier 1 (51.3%), supplier 3 (19.6%), supplier 2 (18.7%), and random selection (10.4%). the result proposed the best suppliers for mineral water according to the preferences are supplier 3 (36.4%), supplier 1 (23.9%), supplier 2 (23.5%), and random selection (16.4%). compared to the previous practice of selecting suppliers based solely on an ""approximate"" system, ahp questionnaires have proven that managers consider selecting one particular supplier better than random selection, as evidenced by the value of random supplier selection having the lowest weight in all three categories of materials which are calculated using ahp.","business model, ahp method","and Suggestions 4.1 Conclusion Based on the Business Model Canvas concept that analyzes elements of XYZ Company's business model, it is found that the Key Activity elements (production, marketing, supply chain management) are influenced by the availability of Key Resources (raw materials and HR) and Key Partnership (suppliers and building managers) for operations business. Without these two elements, Key Activity will not work. The key activity appears to serve the Customer Segment, namely employees and young people located around the Bidakara Tower. XYZ Company uses a personal and complementary approach for loyal customers to maintain Customer Relationships. For Value Proposition, XYZ Company is here to introduce various types of coffee from Indonesia that are offered through XYZ Company's physical outlets. For the cost component, XYZ Company spends the budget on marketing, maintenance, employee salaries, place rent, and the cost of raw materials (Cost Structure) and gets income from direct and indirect sales (Revenue Stream). From the results of the analysis conducted by researchers, it was found that XYZ Company has a problem in the Key Partnership section that is still changing. Therefore, researchers help XYZ Company get a permanent supplier to solve problems in the Key Partnership element so as not to interfere with other business elements. According to supplier evaluation and analysis using the AHP method, the results show that XYZ's best duck meat supplier is supplier 2 with a percentage of 52%, followed by supplier 3 at 21.9%, supplier 1 at 13.5% and a random selection of suppliers at 12 6%; XYZ's best boneless chicken meat supplier is supplier 1 with a percentage of 51.3% followed by supplier 3 at 19.6%, supplier 2 at 18.7% and random supplier selection at 10.4%. In comparison, XYZ's best mineral water supplier is supplier 3 with a percentage of 36.4%, followed by supplier 1 at 23.9%, supplier 2 at 23.5% and random supplier selection at 16.4%. Compared to the previous practice of selecting suppliers based solely on an ""approximate"" system, AHP questionnaires have proven that managers consider selecting one particular supplier better than random selection, as evidenced by the value of random supplier selection having the lowest weight in all three categories of materials which are calculated using AHP. 2226","linda, willyel phanata, akhmad sudrajat and bachtiar h. simamora management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 bsim@binus.ac.id","References

244,Reduction Of Failed Products At Pt. Xyz Using Analytical  Hierarchy Process Method,"companies that produce goods in a large capacity, if there is no good control will cause a risk. the purpose of this research is to identify operational risks that occur and provide strategies to reduce failed products that can be applied by pt. xyz. the research method used is to use the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) and the calculation uses generalized pareto distribution and uses the root cause analyze strategy. so, companies must pay more attention to the condition of raw materials and check the inventory of raw materials that have been damaged before processing in order to avoid greater losses in the future.",root cause analyze,"and Suggestion 4.1 Conclusion Based on the results of research and discussion in previous chapters, several conclusions can be drawn, namely: 1.There are 5 operational risks that occur at PT. XYZ, namely: i) Damage to Raw Materials ii) Errors in the Production Process of Goods iii) Supplier providing incorrect material iv) Factory Maintenance Damage v) Errors in Bookkeeping Manually (Manual Risk) 2. The most dominant value of potential operational risk (Value at Risk) experienced by PT. XYZ from January 2013 to December 2015 amounted to 5,455,825 pcs. The results of the Value at Risk calculation show that the operational losses suffered by the company are quite high. The potential loss that exceeds the most dominant Value at Risk (Expected Short Fall) is experienced by PT. XYZ from January 2013 to December 2015 amounted to 6,139,215 pcs. The results of the Expected Short Fall calculation show that the maximum amount of loss experienced by the company. The company is feared that it will get a high enough risk if there is no further handling of the operational risk. 4. Proposed Risk Reduction A. Damage to Raw Materials: 1.Use ground transportation that is faster than ships like Container Trucks. 2.applying the FIFO system, which is the material that comes first to the factory, will be the first material to be processed into ceramics. 3.Design a storage area for special materials so that they are not easily damaged. 4.Order raw materials with a minimum amount of standard so as not to over-accumulate. B. Mistakes in the Production Process of Goods 1.Ensuring that the composition of the material to be processed is suitable and appropriate, not exaggerated and reduced so that the product produced matches the quality of the sale value. 2.Improve supervision of materials, technicians, systems, and machinery in the production process so as to minimize the results of wasted or residual products. 3.Factory equipment is always controlled so as to prevent damage and incur costs. 4.Conduct employee training on a regular basis in an amount sufficient to avoid waste for one-on-one employee training. C. Supplier providing incorrect material Ensure in advance that the goods received are quality and not defective. 4.2 Suggestion For problems or operational risks faced by PT. XYZ, the authors provide the following suggestions: 1. Companies must increase the quality of workers in doing their work so as not to add to the losses incurred in the company, such as the most dominant problem, namely damage to raw materials. To minimize the risk of loss, workers must be more careful in re-checking old raw materials for immediate use, maintaining the temperature of the room so 2235","chalvin gunawan, zezkiel ezra, bachtiar h. simamora management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 bsim@binus.ac.id","References

247,"Capacity Planning To Fulfill The Coal Demand In Pt Xyz  Ilham Putra Pratama, Daryl Octovianus Chiok, Bachtiar H. Simamora","demand for coal in the world today continues to increase, one of which demands coal in indonesia. the increase in demand for coal will certainly make some producers have to prepare their production capacity to meet the demand for coal, given that coal is currently also used as alternative fuel oil. one of the companies engaged in coal mining in indonesia is pt. xyz. the purpose of this study is for pt. xyz can continue to meet the demand for coal, especially in the future. in this study, researchers used a capacity planning method that aims to meet the optimal production capacity and meet all the demand forecasts in the future. before capacity planning, demand forecast forecasting is used as a basis for determining future production capacity requirements, forecasting using 5-year historical data starting from 2012 to 2016. given the predicted demand that has been calculated, the company can find out the required capacity requirement in fulfilling all future requests. the addition of capacity has the cost of investment for the company, for that done the feasibility of investment analysis using a cost-benefit analysis approach. the results of this study indicate that the company needs to increase the production capacity from 13,497,624 tons/year to 18,338,040 tons/year to have optimal production capacity because the capacity can meet the demand of 18,204,390 tons/year in 2021. investment cost. the addition of capacity is feasible because the results of the cost-benefit analysis show the npv and roi positive, profitability index and benefit-cost ratio above 1, and payback period under five years.","capacity planning, forecasting method, spss","and Suggestion 4.1 Conclusion Conclusions based on the results of capacity planning analysis, it was found that to have optimal production capacity, the company needed additional production capacity because the company's current production capacity could not meet future demand. The addition of production capacity is done through the addition of machines. The addition of machines consists of adding two units of coal crusher in the year, adding two units of excavators and seven units of dump trucks, so the company can have a production capacity of 18,338,040 tons/year to meet all future requests are 18,204,390 tons/year in 2021. 4.2 Suggestion A. Suggestions for PT. XYZ The following is a suggestion for PT. XYZ: 1. Companies are advised to apply the demand forecasting method with a linear regression method for the next period (2018 and beyond) so that they can know the surge in demand and can control the movement of demand so that the forecast results can be more accurate. 2. PT. XYZ, it is recommended to increase production capacity by increasing the number of machines following the results of existing calculations, thus PT. XYZ can fulfill all consumer demands. B. For further researchers For further researchers, can use other forecasting methods (not using Excel and SPSS tools) by conducting moving averages or exponential smoothing so that they do not project trends like researchers do now.","management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 bsim@binus.ac.id",
248,Production Cost Analysis As Paint Production Planning  References,"pt. xyz face a challenge in the form of high production cost, which leads to expensive product results and the inability to meet the market demand, which can cause a significant profit loss. this study aims to evaluate the production cost that can be arranged more efficiently, therefore, reducing the price of production and arranging an effective and efficient production planning to fulfil the market demand. the research method used to evaluate the production cost is the activity-based cost method. the methods used for production planning are forecasting, aggregate planning and master production scheduling methods. based on the result of data processing, it is known from activity-based cost calculation that one of the production costs that can be minimized is backorder cost with the final amount of rp37.201.062. moreover, the best forecasting method in production planning is the linear regression method. thus from the proposed aggregate planning, it can be derived that the total production cost can be lowered up to rp120.881.904.","activity-based cost, forecasting, aggregate planning","& Suggestions 4.1. Conclusions The following conclusions are proposed in this study: 1. Calculation of costs in production activities can be divided into total costs and overhead costs, in addition to all costs incurred can be divided by how many products are produced and the cost of production will be found / kg. The cost of production/kg in 2017 is IDR 9,101 lower than in 2016, IDR 9,490. 2. Costs that can be eliminated from the production process are costs in the form of overhead. Overhead costs that can be reduced are backorder costs because production planning has been done to minimize backorder costs to Rp37,201,062. 3. The Linear Regression method is the best and most optimal forecasting method for companies to predict future consumer demand. This is because the MAD value of 4627,623, MSE of 26064590 and MAPE value of 27.546% are the smallest MAD, MSE and MAPE values compared to other forecasting methods. 4. In Aggregate Planning, the most optimal method for minimizing the total production costs of a company is the Mixed Aggregate (Overtime and Backorder) method, where the Overtime method prioritizes maximiz- ing labor equal to the Backorder method so that combining the two methods will produce a total cost amounting to Rp120,881,904 consisting of a Backorder fee of Rp37,201,062 and an Overtime of Rp83,680,842. 5. The best Master Production Scheduling to be applied in paint production is to use a table that illustrates the paint production schedule. 4.2. Suggestions The following suggestions are made in this study: 1. PT. XYZ is recommended to use the Activity Based Costing System Method to calculate the cost of pro- duction to more clearly see the cost or expenditure according to the activity causing the cost. 2. PT. XYZ must be able to determine which costs can be eliminated or streamlined, and if eliminated, these costs do not disrupt production 3. PT. XYZ should use the Forecasting method to predict demand in the coming period to do production planning in advance. 4. PT. XYZ should use the Aggregate Planning method that can be adapted to the company's state in con- ducting production planning. 5. Scheduling using Master Production Scheduling can help PT. XYZ in arranging production scheduling.","garda muhammad industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 haryadi sarjono management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 haryadi_s@binus.ac.id siti nur fadhilah almunawaroh industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480",
249,Workload Assessment With Nasa-Tlx And Work  Satisfaction As The Basis Of Improvement Of Work Systems,"employee's workload of pt xyz is predefined as relatively high if it takes into consideration manpower and the task amount. the exceeded workload can affect the job satisfaction of the employee. hence, it is needed to do an assessment to measure the workload and its effect on job satisfaction. the workload was measured by nasa-tlx, which consists of mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. at the same time, job satisfaction is measured by a questionnaire that consists of remuneration, promotion, superior's assistance, and colleagues' assistance. the objects of this study are an employee of the sustainability and operation department. the research result in workload is definitely high. besides that, there is a correlation between workload and job satisfaction. there are two correlation models, positive and negative. a high workload can improve job satisfaction, but otherwise, it can decrease job satisfaction.","workload, job satisfaction, nasa-tlx, correlation","and Suggestion Based on research that has been done, it can be concluded several things as follows: 1. Perceived workload by Sustainability and Operations department employees at PT XYZ, in general, is high. A total of 10.52% perceived high, and 89.47% perceived high. 2. Workload received by employees can affect employee job satisfaction. There are positive and negative correlations. A positive correlation means that if the workload increases, job satisfaction also increases, such as the relationship between effort workload factors (effort) and support factors of superiors' support. A negative correlation means if the workload increases but job satisfaction actually decreases, for example, is the mental workload factor (mental demand) with the promotion job satisfaction factor.","roy wahyudi rochman, rida zuraida industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 rzuraida@binus.ac.id",
250,Implementation Of Lean Manufacturing To Minimize  Waiting Waste And Defect Waste In Press Machine At Pt,"the purpose of this study is to minimize waiting waste and defect waste in an effort to reduce unproductive time and defects in the production of press machines at pt xyz in accordance with the lean manufacturing concept. the problem with waiting waste is the high time of miss feed, inspection, df fault, and product repair, while the problem with defect waste is a large number of lump defects. resolving the defect waste problem certainly reduces the time for inspection and repair because the main problem is interconnected, namely ibutsu. the solution for the miss feed and df faults is the redesign of the scrap drain, a stopper for fixing materials, and a vacuum protector with the poka- yoke concept. meanwhile, the solution for defective waste is proposed to change the cleaning system to prevent ibutsu on dies with the pdca concept (plan, do, check, act). the prediction for the total time that can be reduced after solving the waiting waste problem is 1,786.5 minutes, and the completion of the defect waste is predicted to reduce the percentage of defects from 2.48% to 0.5%.","lean manufacturing, waiting waste, defect waste, poka-yoke","and Suggestion After conducting the discussion and analysis that has been done, the following are the conclusions that have been produced: 1. There are two types of causes of waiting waste, namely stop time (miss feed, inspection, DF fault) and repair in the press machine production process. The problem with the miss feed is caused by the presence of scrap that has accumulated in the drain, and there is no proper storage for vacuum and fittings. For the DF fault, the fault is caused by improper installation of the material so that the centering position is not according to the procedure, and the storage arm is incorrect. For inspection and repair problems, the main cause of the ibutsu is found on the dies when the press machine is running. This is the same as the main cause of defect waste, namely ibutsu, which causes production results to become lumpy defects. 2. The solution to minimizing waiting waste (miss feed and DF faults) is the application of the Poka-Yoke concept to the design innovation for scrap sewer, stopper (for material installation), and vacuum protector (to prevent damage to vacuum and fittings). Meanwhile, the solution to minimize defect waste, inspection, and repair is the application of the PDCA concept in an effort to change the cleaning system in order to minimize ibutsu on dies and improve the quality of cleaning results. In addition, the estimated total waiting time that is minimized from the proposed improvements is 1,786.5 minutes and can increase the production rate by 26,458 pieces in one month. Meanwhile, from defect waste, the decrease in the number of defects that occurred reached 1,568 pieces and the percentage of defects decreased from 2.48% to 0.5%. Suggestions from this study are as follows: 1. The proposed design that has been approved should be implemented immediately considering the amount of waste that can be minimized and the benefits that can be obtained after implementing the proposed design. 2. After the application of the proposal, a new work instruction is also needed so that operators can easily use the new design. In addition, training is also needed to run the production process smoothly on the press machine with the newly proposed design and system. 3. We recommend that the staff from the pressing division not only focus on increasing the SPM of each type of car body component, but start to be reminded of the importance of minimizing existing waste due to inappropriate processes. 4. Maintenance of the washing machine must be carried out regularly to prevent ibutsu that appears as a result of the washing process and inspection to the vendor must also be carried out to reduce the dirt on the product.","xyz muhammad iqbal hakeem, richard dimas julian murphiyanto, sarah alfiani, tota pirdo kasih industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 tota.kasih@binus.ac.id",
251,Improvement Of Production Space Layout And Design Of  Production Assistance,"designing a good layout and having a high efficiency will certainly reduce production costs so as to generate more profits for the company. in pt xyz, the layout of the machines and departments is still less efficient, which took quite far for the materials to proceed and was also accompanied by the backtracking. according to that statement, the authors do the design a new layout using activity relationship chart, worksheet, dimensionless block diagram, activity relationship diagram, area allocation diagram, from to chart, and material handling equipment so, giving the result of a new layout that yields efficiency up to 16% of a type of product. in addition, to support the work of the operator, design tools were carried out using rapid entire body assessment and anthropometry methods in making the design of these tools so as to produce a so-called adjustable pallet.",worksheet,"and Suggestion 4.1 Conclusion After making observations, data collection, data processing and data analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn from research at PT XYZ: 1. The best efficient and effective production layout design at PT XYZ is the layout design in Figure 4 . 2. Production productivity efficiency produced by the 2nd proposed layout listed in Table 8, where efficiency of 11% is generated for the type of small ordinary cardboard, an efficiency of 8% for the type of large ordinary cardboard, an efficiency of 11% for special types of small cartons and 16% for large types of special cartons. So that the 2nd proposed production space layout results in better productivity than the initial production space layout. 3. The design tools that can support production activities at PT XYZ are shown in Figure 7, lifting pallet to assist production operators. Where these tools can help the course of production by making operators more supportive of their work which is evident in the proof of REBA that the score is reduced to 4. 4.2 Suggestion The following are suggestions that can be given to PT XYZ's factory: 1. It is necessary to prepare a special area for Finish Goods to be more organized and make it easier to move finished goods to the shipping area 2. It is necessary to consider replacing equipment or maintenance for equipment that is damaged and old (for example: hand pallet) to facilitate the operator in moving materials. 3. It is necessary to relocate or remove inactive machines from the production area to increase production space so that productivity will increase production. 4. It is necessary to make a large box to hold the remaining pieces of cardboard which can be placed close to the press machine to minimize the need for space to put the remaining pieces of cardboard material so that the environment around the press machine area becomes more organized.","jefry dwiki chairulie, leonardo carlos lie, radivia fioresta, fransisca dini ariyanti industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia fransisca.ariyanti@binus.ac.id",
252,Proposal Of Re-Layout Finished Goods Warehouse And  Labour Scheduling In Xyz Inc.,"the objectives of this study are to find out the optimal layout for warehouse finished goods, to find out if the re-layout of warehouse finished goods which have been proposed provides significant change to the overtime of the workers, and to find out the best proposal of labour scheduling for non-staff to make the schedule more effective. the used methods are the integrated class-based storage method, dedicated storage method, from-to-chart method for layout improvement and tibrewala, philippe, and browne algorithm for non-staff labour scheduling proposed. the results of re-layout the warehouse finished goods are obtained that the space efficiency is 48,66% and the reduction of cycle time from 3,33 minutes to 1,86 minutes, and the percentage of overtime decreased after partial implementation. the result obtained for the new labour scheduling of non-staff is needed to reduce the amount of labour by as many as two persons, so the workers become 85 people.","layout, dedicated storage, from-to-chart","and Suggestion 4.1 Conclusion Based on the results of research conducted at XYZ Inc, the following conclusions are obtained: 1. The proposed improvement in the layout of the final product warehouse given is to change the placement of the product areas according to a large number of requests. To minimize the time required, products with large quantities of demand will be placed closest to the door (I/O) using the Class-Based Storage Method and arranged in accordance with the principle of first-in, first-out (FIFO) in order to make it easier for workers to pick up products according to customer orders. To determine the space requirements, a calculation using the Dedicated Storage Method is obtained, and space efficiency of 48,66% can be used for the needs of other departments. In addition, determining the proximity relationship between areas using the From-to-Chart Method, so that time and movement become more efficient and effective. 2. The proposed improvement in the layout of the final product warehouse proposed provides a significant change to the overtime of workers. It can be seen after the layout of the final product warehouse is gradually changed, then there is a decrease in cycle time from 3,33 minutes to 1.86 minutes to pick up products that will be sent to customers. In addition, there was a decrease in the percentage of overtime little by little each month from 8,40% in July 2016 to get a percentage of 1,18% in June 2017, which means that changing the layout of the final product warehouse can minimize the time of work so that this influence the decrease in the percentage of overtime each month. 3. The proposed good labour scheduling system for non-staff workers is to reduce the number of workers by two people to 85 people and 0% over time. In the iteration results, it was found that there were 14 workers on Monday 2302","aurellia victoria, lidya guestine, noviana, fransisca dini ariyanti industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 fransisca.ariyanti@binus.ac.id","References

Calculation of normal time is done by considering the adjustment factor on each manpower in each work station. The adjustment factors are the skill, effort, condition and consistency possessed by each manpower. The calculation of standard time is done by considering the leeway factor or loose time of the manufacturing process of the product. The easing factors are constant allowance and variable allowance. 2. Current line performance calculation is done by calculating the Line Efficiency value, which is a comparison of the total time per work station to the relation of cycle time to the number of work stations. Then the Balance Delay value is the ratio between idle time to cycle time and the number of workstations. In other words, the amount between Balance Delay and Line Efficiency is equal to one. Furthermore, the Smoothness Index value is an index that shows the relative smoothness of an equilibrium assembly line. 3.

The proposed layout is done by using the ARC method, sequencing the production process to determine whether or not the relationship between these departments is important, after which the data is processed into a worksheet so that it is easy to read the results of the ARC. Then the results from the worksheet are made into a dimensionless diagram to apply the proposed layout design to ARC which has been made manually, the most effective and efficient layout is in manual ARC layouts, because the manufacturing process takes into account other details such as worksheets and dimensionless. diagram. • Efforts to minimize the cost of moving the initial raw material can be done by minimizing the distance from the raw material itself. From the results of data processing, to obtain an effective raw material transfer distance required a new layout proposal that has been made manually. This is because the proposed displacement distance in the proposed ARC layout is Rp19.360.439,60 with an efficiency of 32%.

256,"Proposed Layout For Optimizing The Fabrication Process  Anggi Octari M, Ardian Pramana Wicaksana, M Dimas Suwandi, Januar Nasution","pt. xyz is a company which is concerned in the manufacture of air conditioning. the problem with the current layout is that each interconnected area has a great distance, and there are backtracking, cross-movement, and does not have one flow process. the problem makes the time of this fabrication process to be long or less effective and due to the distance between the distant areas, causing the distance of material handling moves that are less effective. the long distances can affect the timing of product displacement and the cost of material handling. in this research, the design is created an ergonomic design for the table in the housing area with the aim of increasing the optimality of the fabrication process in pt. xyz and redesign the layout of each area using the corelap method. the corelap method consists of three stages: the analysis phase, the adjustment stage, and the evaluation stage. the analysis phase includes material flow analysis, activity relationship chart (arc) analysis, and the space of the available area. the adjustment stage is the stage to arrange the layout of proposed results from the corelap method and adapt to the needs or circumstances of the field. the last stage is the evaluation stage, which is to compare the actual layout and the proposed layout. corelap method is adapted to the needs and conditions in the field to produce the optimal layout that has one flow process of the fabrication process and save the material handling cost of rp877.622,31 or save material handling cost of 62,53% compared to the actual layout.",and mining areas,"and Suggestions Based on the results of the processing and analysis that has been made, several conclusions are obtained, namely as follows: 1. The optimal layout for the HVAC fabrication process at PT. XYZ is that there are no more layouts with backtracking, cross-movement, and one flow process. In the proposed layout, the design room and meeting room 1 (large), which were previously adjacent to the warehouse, were removed, and doors were made in the design room and meeting room so that the trajectory to be taken would be fewer and more effective in reducing material handling costs. It will be issued by the company. In addition, parts of the material area, measuring area, cutting area, corner-cutting area, bending area, and bending press area are also placed close to the warehouse, and these areas have been adjusted to the fabrication process due to back tracking and cross-movement in the previous layout. Other areas are also placed close together according to the fabrication process of each product made. 2. The total material handling costs for PT. XYZ that must be spent on the actual layout is IDR 1,403,526.27, with the total distance for each related area of 1442.4m. 3. Total material handling cost savings for the proposed layout is IDR877,622.31. With a percentage of material handling cost savings of 62.53%. 4. The proposed table design for the housing area is made based on the needs of the fabrication process and the workers at work. The proposed table has been made using Indonesian dimensions. In addition, the proposed table is made using the 50th Percentile (P50) based on the average Indonesian person and worker. The table is made to have different heights to suit what product will be made. The dimensions used in making the first table, namely to assemble the HVAC body frame, are dimensions in sitting positions such as D16, D12, and D11, namely popliteal height (43.09cm), thigh thickness (18.79cm), and elbow height in a sitting position (31.84cm) with the allowance from the groin to the end of the table which is 13.09cm from the result of subtracting D11 and D12. For the table to assemble the electricity control panel, use the dimensions in the standing position, namely D4 with elbow height in the standing position with a size of 102.82cm. With the height of the board, namely using the dimensions of an Indonesian in a standing position, namely D2 with an eye height of 154.47cm. Here are suggestions that companies can use: 1. The company re-layout based on the results of research using the CORELAP method because, with this layout, the company can optimize the fabrication process, which has an impact on reducing material handling costs. 2. Applying ergonomic principles to make the proposed table in the housing area so that companies can improve work efficiency in the housing area. 3. There is a need for a safety colour for each area to increase the awareness of workers to be more careful and thorough when working.","industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 januar_nasution@binus.ac.id",
257,Supplier Selection Using Analytical Hierarchy Process &  Warehouse Repair Using From-To-Chart,"the objective of study in pt. xyz is to determine the best supplier, warehouse repair procedures, and the level of health and safety. the method used is analytical hierarchy process method for supplier selection, abc analysis and from-to-chart method for warehouse improvement, and reba and job hazard analysis calculation to observe health and work safety level. the results obtained by the best suppliers are americans with a value of 40.56%, warehouse arrangement based on the result of attraction 3 with the value of 403 hoist and followed by the calculation of abc analysis where classification a has 12 items, classification b with 19 items, and classification c with 32 items. the results of reba calculations when picking up goods and signatures machines are 6 and 10, which indicates a moderate risk and high risk and requiring a change. job hazard analysis results indicate a risk of danger during the process of unloading and shipping process so that it needs a change","abc analysis, from-to-chart","and Suggestions Based on the results of the analysis and discussion at the PT. XYZ warehouse, it can be concluded as follows: 1. To determine the best supplier by weighting the criteria for all PT. XYZ suppliers using the analytical hierarchy process method, which prioritizes the quality aspect of its delivery. It can be concluded that American suppliers with a selection percentage of 40.56% are the best among other suppliers. 2. To determine a good and efficient warehouse layout, PT. XYZ uses the From-to-chart (FTC) method and ABC Analysis in grouping goods. The best results were obtained after doing the calculation 3 times with a total flow distance value of 403 movements and a max value of 52. The proposed layout is based on the level of activity between one area and another which has a very important relationship so that the area becomes close together. That way all the activities and time spent by workers at the PT. XYZ warehouse are optimal. 3. To determine the recommendations for work safety and security for PT. XYZ employees, the REBA calculation method & job hazzard analysis are used. In the process of lifting goods and signature machines, the REBA calculations obtained are 6 & 10, which means that it is risky and at risk of living, it requires a change in the way of working. Then the results of the job hazzard analysis, found several things that are potentially dangerous, namely when receiving goods and delivery of goods, where the process requires improvement. After a conclusion is drawn, the suggestions that can be given are: 1. Making suppliers America as a supplier of PT. XYZ. However, it is possible to order goods from other countries to cover urgent needs by using a smaller lead time from American suppliers. 2. Employees can use trolleys when moving goods, both on receiving and packaging. Then when sending employees who use motorbikes can use additional delivery boxes. This aims to minimize the possibility of accidents.","ahmad aribi braza, aldian syah ramadhan, fathur rahman, fransisca dini ariyanti industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 fransisca.ariyanti@binus.ac.id",

Because the results of this study indicate that there is a significant effect of profitability, liquidity and size on capital structure, it is hoped that companies engaged in infrastructure, transportation and utilities, can optimize the company's profitability, the company must be able to maximize all its wealth for operating activities in order to generate the highest profit and prevent companies from using debt. Companies that use their own capital in company activities mean the company is to pay all its own expenses. Controlling the fulfillment of short-term obligations on time to control the collection receivable from customer, controlling cash availability for short term payments and optimizing the use of assets to generate profits will show that the company's management of capital is effective. Infrastructure, transportation, and utility companies require strong fund management considering that the payment system from the customer depends on the settlement period. If the infrastructure company experiences an error in calculating costs in carrying out the project, the company needs to be mentally prepared to wait for the next payment. The risk of capital if company do not have a strong capability to pay will affect the company's performance and ultimately to the company's reputation. Costs need to be considered in determining the use of debt. In the end, with the use of debt that is greater than the benefits and in bad economic conditions, the company will not last long because it has to pay interest and principal payments on the loan. This research takes an observation period of 2018-2020, in which 2020 the emergence of Covid conditions that have an impact on the economy that is not profitable for business. The existence of investor confidence in the size of the company, namely the larger the size of the company is expected to be able to manage assets optimally to obtain stable profits. The level of assets considered to guarantee for investors in the event of liquidity, investors can obtain funds for the funds obtained. But investors expect the company to have a long life in earning profits in difficult conditions such as the Covid-19, some infrastructures company survive and able to fulfill their obligations to stakeholders. The strength of a company able to create the sustainable company condition and to carry out financial management to the maximum extent possible in the company's operational processes with controlling the capital structure. In this study, contras with the theory that it can be seen that in 14 of the 26 companies with a DER level above 100%, which means the higher the DER, the worse the company is because the risk of the company is getting bigger, but the company is able to generate profitability during Covid-19 in 2020. This shows that if a company with high profitability will affect the capital structure in which the company chooses to obtain debt, it becomes a funding tool that can encourage the company to survive in difficult situations provided that the company has the ability to pay so that it can avoid default in difficult times. If the company chooses to obtain funding to increase revenue, the company must be able to manage the use of debt efficiently so that the company can obtain a cost of capital or other types of debt with 2401","life cycle? frihardina marsintauli accounting department, binus online learning bina nusantara university indonesia 11480 frihardina.marsintauli@binus.ac.id","References

267,Identification Of Ergonomic Risk Factors And Postural  Analysis In Electrical Transformer Manufacturing Industry,"ergonomics is concerned with the analysis of several work-related factors that may be a potential risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders, and development of solutions to eliminate or reduce such risks. the present study aims to identify ergonomic risk factors and analysis of postures in an electrical distribution transformer manufacturing industry in karnataka. some of the major activities in transformer manufacturing are core building, coil winding, drying in oven, final assembly and manufacturing of tanks. the manufacturing activities are characterized by repetitive actions, forceful, or prolonged exertion of the hands, heavy lifting and carrying of heavy objects; and prolonged awkward postures. the industry employs about 150 workers and 60 workers were selected for the study. a sample of 36 workers from various sections is selected for study. the mean age is 31.41 ± 8.17 year and average experience 9.26 ± 5.91 year. the body mass index (bmi) indicated 75% workers are normal and only 8% are overweight. a msd questionnaire was used to determine the prevalence of msds and ergonomic assessment tools rula and reba were used for postural analysis. the self reported msd questionnaire shows discomfort in lower back (86%), upper back (55%0, wrists/hands (61%0 and shoulder (58%). the results of rula and reba revealed about 40% and 47% postures in high risk category. few selected postures are analyzed using catia software and recommended improvements are shown which results in reducing the risks of postures. to reduce the risk factors several ergonomic interventions were recommended like redesign of work stations to reduce awkward postures, and risks of manual handling. use of personnel protective equipment is also recommended and awareness and training the workers about ergonomic principles may result in improved health, environment and productivity.","ergonomics, postural analysis, wrmsds, rula",,"vidyadhar g. biradar research scholar industrial and production engineering department p.d.a.college of engineering kalaburagi, karnataka, india vgbiradar@gmail.com qutubuddin s.m. associate professor, industrial and production engineering department p.d.a.college of engineering kalaburagi, karnataka, india syedqutub16@gmail.com hebbal s.s. principal p.d.a.college of engineering kalaburagi, karnataka, india shivahebbal@gmail.com",
268,Distracted Driver Detection: A Comparative Study Using  Cnn,"road accidents due to distracted driving have been on a rise in recent years. as per the road accident report 2019, 11 people were killed each hour in india due to road accidents (transport research wing, 2020). this makes it crucial to take measures to stop the number of road fatalities. it found that the major cause of these accidents was driver error. this paper proposed a solution to detect the distraction of drivers into different predefined classes. the use of different pre-trained convolutional neural network (cnn) models viz. alexnet, vgg16, and resnet50, for the classification of distracted drivers according to the state farm’s distracted driver detection challenge on kaggle, are depicted in this paper, as well as mymodel is trained on dataset consisting of different local driver’s 2d dashboard camera images along with the state farm’s dataset. after comparing the results of predefined models with mymodel, the best result has been found as a categorical cross-entropy loss of 0.2344 on the validation set and an accuracy score of 93.28%.","distracted driver, cnn","We compared three well-known CNN models with our model for the distracted driver detection and classification problem. After trying out several CNN models, MyModel’s Validation loss was 0.1295. We can conclude that MyModel performs far better in validation and training too. If we provide any random image from particular 10 classes, it will give better prediction results. Furthermore, current deep CNN models can be used to automatically detect distracted drivers and can be integrated with different hardware systems to warn the driver. However, the main constraint for distracted driver detection using a dashboard camera from the driver’s viewpoint is the driver’s privacy. In the future, if CNN models can recognize distracted behaviors using images from a dashboard camera that captures the drivers from different angles in real-time, and combining distracted driver detection with drowsy driver detection using one classification model.","sujay h. jagadale m.tech student, department of production engineering, veermata jijabai technological institute (vjti), mumbai, 400019, india. jagadalesujay@gmail.com, shjagadale_m20@pe.vjti.ac.in dr. p.r. attar assistant professor, department of production engineering, veermata jijabai technological institute (vjti), mumbai, 400019, india. prattar@pe.vjti.ac.in",
269,A Health Monitoring System Based On Wearable Sensor  And Data Aggregator,"iot (internet of things) is now a part of technology development. in utilizing the iot technology, data aggregation can be applied. data aggregation itself is a method that can help perform data processing in a system. sensor technologies are widely used in health systems, in particular to help with health monitoring. a health system utilizing the technology of a smartwatch with sensors that can record body conditions and allow real-time data transmission can be developed with the help of several methods, one of which is data aggregation. to avoid data loss or lack in the midst of sending data packets, it is necessary to use a data aggregator as well as the cloud and an api to attract and send the data packets. the cloud is also a component that is quite important because it enables cloud computing as well as data storage. the data aggregator also helps reduce the transmission delay in sending data packets and compute the data that arrive from the sensors. meanwhile, the api is widely used to carry out the process of transmitting data on an application or system, so it can be connected to a server or the cloud to manage data requests from a user to the server. it is also important to assess the source or resource used in the system, including the throughput or the amount of load that can be received by the resource.","internet of things, data aggregation, cloud","and Future Works From the results of the design and implementation of the sleep quality detection program, some conclusions can be drawn. The application created can display time data by pulling data following a request when the program is run, and the system will process the data. Meanwhile, the aggregator used can pull data from the Fitbit server and process the data for data display. The test on the system shows that the system has high enough throughput to be able to attract more data and accommodate enough user usage so that the application can be utilized by many users. The use of a cloud service makes it easier to withdraw data and lighter to process the data because computing over the cloud is performed per computing request. In the future, it is hoped that the application or system can be developed further in integration with other health devices. It is also expected that the application or system can measure, calculate, or make a diagnosis of abnormality in the body more quickly and accurately so that the users can find out information on their health on their application earlier.","ritchie chandra and binus graduate program-master of computer science bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 ritchie.chandra@binus.ac.id, nico.surantha@binus.ac.id nico surantha department of electrical, electronic and communication engineering faculty of engineering tokyo city university 1-28-1 tamazutsumi, setagaya-ku, tokyo, 158-8557, japan",
270,System Architecture For Urban Farming Using Internet Of  Things And Microservices,"urban farming is growing rapidly currently. this has an impact on the use of systems and technologies that support urban farming. problems faced by urban farming managers include difficulties in checking, extreme natural conditions, and limited knowledge related to plant management. the use of iot in supporting urban farming has been done by many other researchers. however, so far there has been no research that synergizes iot and microservices in supporting urban farming. synergy of iot and microservices can optimize urban farming's productivity and efficiency. in this study, we used system development approach to construct the system. we divided into three stages, such as requirement analysis, design and implementation. the result in this study are system architecture and prototype system, which is include system architecture design, and list of microservices in system architecture. then, we provided some features in system architecture. keyword internet of things, microservices, urban farming, system architecture. 1. introduction agricultural commodities are one of the important aspects in meeting the needs of food supply (naik et al. 2018) urban farming is increasingly in demand by people who live in big cities (buehler et al. 2016 ) urban agriculture is oriented towards realizing the ease of fulfilling daily food needs and creating additional urban green open spaces (horst et al. 2017). however, there are several challenges currently being faced by many farmers and owners of urban gardens or urban farming. manually caring plant tends to take time in the process and there can be human error from the results obtained (rajalakshmi et al .2018) in the agricultural and plantation industries, temperature and weather greatly affect the process of plant development and the results obtained (weng et al however, with weather conditions that are currently uncertain and often change (b. parkes et al), there are temperature conditions that can change for plants and can hamper crop yields and others. third, limited knowledge on how to check and determine the ph of water, soil moisture, and plant conditions can also have an unfavourable impact and results are not optimal (higgins et al. 2017), irregular plant caring and watering schedules damage plant development (katsoulas et al. 2006). these conditions result in frequent damage to crops, crop failures and a decrease in the quantity and quality of crop yields. therefore, the development of a system that can help industrialization and modernization of urban farming. one technique that can be applied to overcome this problem is to develop a smart system for urban farming cultivation using iot and microservices. 1.1 objectives the research objectives in this study are to analyzing systems requirement, to design systems architecture and design prototyping systems for urban farming. the systems would be developed based on internet of things and microservices architecture. we combined internet of things and microservices architecture (msa) to implement systems requirement and systems design. 2466",,The system Architecture for urban farming based on IoT and Microservices can be Implemented using mobile apps media. It would be easier for users to manage and monitor in real time. The system can be used effectively to improve the information obtained and utilization in using water resources.

In this case, both the CPM and PERT analyzes show almost the same results, and the project completion time using the two methods differs by only one day. PERT analysis proved to be more effective with a calculated project completion probability of 99.8%. This paper also proves that the method is effective and efficient to apply in this field. Examples of the application of the CPM method are widely used in development projects. One example is used to optimize the ATV (all-terrain vehicle) manufacturing process by considering time constraints and available resources. 7. Suggestion In building a project it is highly recommended to use this method, namely PERT and CPM. Timeliness in project development depends on the situation and conditions, the most important of which is the available manpower. PERT and CPM assist in programming and monitoring the progress of the stages involved so that the project is completed within the deadline. The development of a project can run optimally with the PERT and CPM methods because it has been proven that the methods are very effective and efficient. Many researchers find it very helpful with the PERT and CPM methods. The success of using the PERT technique can save project completion time two years ahead of the planned schedule, so this method is widely used on large projects, especially on research and research projects. where these projects have never been carried out and do not have definite completion data.","with pert and cpm method haryadi sarjono binus business school undergraduate, bina nusantara university, jl. k.h. syahdan no.9, palmerah, jakarta barat, 11480, indonesian. haryadi_s@binus.ac.id vivi dwi kurnia sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi bisnis indonesia, manajement business, jl. kebayoran lama no. 46, south sukabumi, west jakarta, 11560, indonesia. vividwikurnia9@gmail.com",

This research also demonstrates that there is no dominant journal or publisher addressing the issue of procurement outsourcing in supply chain management. This means that research in this area is still dispersed across different journals or publishers. Furthermore, development maps are classified into 9 clusters based on co-occurrence and keywords. This review, on the other hand, summarizes the research trend of procurement outsourcing in supply chain management into three major issues. First, based on the research location, it's worth noting that the main country that have served as research locations in the twenty years have been Sweden. Meanwhile, based on the research approach used, the results of data analysis show that the majority of the research employs an empirical study approach and a case study. Comparative analysis and causal relationships are two examples of research methods used. In other words, some studies compare the objects that have successfully implemented procurement outsourcing. Furthermore, several studies have been conducted to examine the impact of implementing procurement outsourcing models on a variety of factors, including efficiency and productivity. In this field, descriptive qualitative methods are still the most commonly used approach. In terms of context or research scope, studies related to include procurement, manufacturing, management, production and telecommunication among others. According to the findings of the review of the field of study, this issue is frequently studied across a wide range of industries. In other words, the context of this study is multidimensional or cross-industries. As a result, when studying procurement outsourcing in supply chain management, some researchers take multiple approaches. Of course, many unexplored perspectives remain unexplored because they are not dominant perspectives. This is especially true when one considers how some researchers tend to use multiple approaches. As a result of this analysis, the contexts that are frequently discussed are also interindustry or multi-industry issues. The scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the Scopus database, is the research's limitation. In the future, it is strongly advised to conduct research using a broader literature source. Furthermore, the findings of this study can be used as hypotheses, and comprehensive and systematic follow-up research is being conducted. The findings of this study are expected to serve as a resource for academics researching procurement outsourcing in supply management.","edvard e suhendra student of doctor research in management, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 edvardsuhendra@gmail.com mohammad hamsal binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 mhamsal@binus.edu asnan furinto binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 afurinto@binus.edu rano kartono binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 rano.rahim@binus.edu",
283,Building A Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain –   A Case Study In Plastic Injection Industry,"for the past decades, the supply chain network has been significantly influenced by several major factors. standing out of those is global warming which causes radical changes in traditional supply chain network. therefore, environmental vulnerability with legality and economic benefits has made supply chain management to be as an important objective for companies and governments. sustainability must be built-in supply chain network design (scnd), by striking the right balance between cost-cutting and environmental preservation. the goal of this paper is to develop a green closed–loop supply chain (g-clsc) network by first, evaluating supplier selection with multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm). subsequently, a bi – objective mixed-integer linear programming (milp) model is presented for facilities allocating and consolidate closed-loop flow, with two objectives: minimizing operating cost and minimizing co2 emission. the model is testified by implying on the case of a vietnamese plastic injection enterprise consisting of facilities spreading all over the country. the simulated result demonstrates the efficiency and validity of the proposed solution model. all possible solutions are measured thoroughly to identify the optimal design for prior environment protection. ultimately, the solution model finalizes with a forward and a reverse supply chain network.",,"With the aim of accomplishing the Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain application to improve the efficiency and profitability of plastic injection industry in Vietnam, this journal utilizes Analytic Hierarchy Process to evaluate supplier selection and Mixed Integer Linear Programming to build a Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network, which both help diminish cost and CO2 emission. This paper provides approaches to develop a Green Closed- Loop Supply Chain to improve the efficiency and profitability of plastic injection industry in Vietnam. By using AHP method to evaluate supplier selection and Mixed Integer Linear Programing to build a Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain Network that both minimize cost and CO2 emission. By implementing the historical data of a Vietnamese firm in 2019, four industrial sites have been chosen as the optimal location to open new distribution center. These locations are guaranteed to generate a profit and deplete environment pollution in 12 months, which would be breakeven with the accepted goal of case company. Furthermore, through analyzing, this new network has achieved validity since differentiation between all optimal cost and CO2 emission for each α are very negligible (0.29% and 2.17% respectively). However, the demand, transportation and fix cost data used for the model are historical data from the past and may change considerably in future due to COVID-19, this limitation may decrease the proposed model accuracy and reliability. Moreover, even though demands used in this model is real but, it is uncertain. With this, it can be convinced that there are rooms for improvements and adjustments for G-CLSC problem. Thus, further research is crucial to help the solution model to be able to comb with the fluctuate and dynamic changes of future market.","trien chau ngoc student, school of industrial engineering and management, international university -vietnam national university, ho chi minh city, vietnam chaungoctrien@gmail.com uyen ngo thi thao school of industrial engineering and management, international university -vietnam national university, ho chi minh city, vietnam nttuyen@hcmiu.edu.vn ha thi xuan chi school of industrial engineering and management, international university -vietnam national university, ho chi minh city, vietnam htxchi@hcmiu.edu.vn huy nguyen hoang school of industrial engineering and management, international university -vietnam national university, ho chi minh city, vietnam nhhuy@hcmiu.edu.vn",
284,E-Commerce Price Suggestion Algorithm – A Machine Learning Application,"e-commerce is a key move that has altered the way businesses are conducted, particularly in the retail industry. in the e-commerce business, pricing is one of the most significant aspects in determining profitability, and closely linked to the company's sales. the rise of online markets has necessitated the creation of a machine learning tool for pricing suggestions. the aim of this study is to select a machine learning model to create a price suggestion tool for ecommerce enterprises. three machine learning algorithms – linear regression, random forest and lightgbm – are tested on a dataset of an ecommerce enterprise to indicate the performance of models when using in a dataset with several features and millions of rows. the study also processes to make improvement the output of models, including parameters tuning, feature selection or remove outstanding values. the result shows that light gbm after grid search cv process outperforms in terms of both prediction error and processing time.","e-commerce, lightgbm, machine learning, price suggestion",", the model would perform better when some features are dropped, which are Subcat 1 and 2, Item condition, Shipping and Description length. Other than that, the performance remains stable. 5 . Conclusion Price prediction has shown to be difficult for online marketplaces. Sellers are frequently overconfident, labeling items with selling prices that are far higher than they should be. The idea is to automatically determine a price for a product based on its attributes, which can then be used as a starting point for negotiations between buyer and seller. The study shows the price prediction model in terms of three algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and LightGBM using one main method to evaluation: Mean absolute error. Processing time is also another method for assessment, but it is a sub evaluation method. Many studies have been carried out to enhance the performance of models, such as removing outlier values, PCA, and so on. Feature selection in collaboration with hyperparameters tuning is considered as one of the best solutions, and LightGBM is the leader of three algorithms that always performs at a good level, no matter that before or after parameter tuning. Moreover, the processing time of LightGBM is always around one minutes and while tuning parameters it takes less time than Random Forest although the number of combinations is larger than Random Forest. The result found is consistent with previous findings of the key","linh nguyen tran quang student, school of industrial engineering and management, international university -vietnam national university, ho chi minh city, vietnam ntquanglinh1999@gmail.com uyen ngo thi thao, anh duong vo nhi, hoang nguyen thi phuong lecturer, school of industrial engineering and management, international university -vietnam national university, ho chi minh city, vietnam nttuyen@hcmiu.edu.vn, dvnanh@hcmiu.edu.vn, phuonghoangnguyenthi11@gmail.com","References

In which 54 articles under study were analyzed through a qualitative analysis between 2011 and 2021, which show an optimal panorama of the usefulness and scope of project management as a tool for the development process of lean manufacturing and not only in that area but also in decision making within dynamic environments. Project management and its good practices play a very important role in the automotive area and companies that provide services especially, to offer a solution to problems to make use of lean manufacturing tools. It is evident that statistical analysis and Value Stream Mapping are the most used tools for project management problems. However, for the attributions by countries, it is shown that Mexico does not have significant advances in project management and administration that can be applied in schemes under the needs and characteristics for projects of the Mexican industry. This is not bad, on the contrary, the wide margins to expand new research and contributions of scientific articles that day by day allows us to offer a more standardized approach. Not to mention that (India) has a greater means of validation in its proposals, which it attributes to more successful and relevant publications for researchers seeking to open new paths with the use of lean manufacturing tools under a scheme of use of good practices for a proper project management as (Forno et al., 2014) and (Jadhav et al., 2014)pointed out that, despite the good results observed in the implementation of the lean manufacturing philosophy in the last decade, there are still many opportunities for improvement, that justifies further research in this area in order to identify critical points for the implementation of projects in the lean factory.","manufacturing maría angélica rodríguez sánchez student of master’s degree / sales and logistic engineer posgrado ciateq a.c./ mi metal processing mexicana aguascalientes, aguascalientes, méxico angelica.rdzsan@gmail.com , rodriguez-a@mmpm.com.mx josé carlos hernández gonzález research associate in logistics and supply chain / specialized engineer of application it, electronics, and control. advanced technology center, ciateq a.c. villahermosa, tabasco, méxico carlos.hernandez@ciateq.mx , jos_car.01@live.com.mx",

This review, on the other hand, summarizes the research trend of affiliate marketing into three major issues First, based on the business category, it's worth noting that the business category that have served as research in the last years have been tourism. Meanwhile, based on the research approach used, the results of data analysis show that the majority of the research employs an empirical study approach and a case study. Comparative analysis and causal relationships are two examples of research methods used. In other words, some studies compare the objects that have successfully implemented affiliate marketing in e-commerce. Furthermore, several studies have been conducted to examine the impact of affiliate marketing models on a variety of factors. In this field, descriptive qualitative methods are still the most commonly used approach. In terms of context or research scope, this issue is frequently studied across a wide range of industries. In other words, the context of this study is multidimensional or cross-industries. As a result, when studying affiliate marketing some researchers take multiple approaches. Of course, many unexplored perspectives remain unexplored because they are not dominant perspectives. This is especially true when one considers how some researchers tend to use multiple approaches. As a result of this analysis, the contexts that are frequently discussed are also interindustry or multi-industry issues. The scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the Scopus database, is the research's limitation. In the future, it is strongly advised to conduct research using a broader literature source. Furthermore, the findings of this study can be used as hypotheses, and comprehensive and systematic follow-up research is being conducted. The findings of this study are expected to serve as a resource for academics researching affiliate marketing in e-commerce. 2642","julius solichin student of doctor research in management, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 juliusmp@ymail.com mohammad hamsal binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 mhamsal@binus.edu asnan furinto binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 afurinto@binus.edu rano kartono binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 rano.rahim@binus.edu","References

ESG performance literature has increasingly raised each year which was marked by the number of publications in recent years. According to the result, at the initial result stage, obtained as much as 267 datasets from Scopus database. The result of this study shows the trends of ESG performance research, publication outlets (peer- reviewed journals), contributing authors, and productive countries. The analysis of keywords with less frequent occurrence indicates the potential topics for future study as contribution of this study. Thus, this study also intended to notice research development and predict potential advancement in future research through bibliometric analysis because there has been a significant increase in ESG performance research. The Vosviewer application had been successfully demonstrated in mapping and visualizing the bibliometric data. The limitation of this study is datasets only taken from Scopus database especially peer-reviewed journals as resources. Thus, we recommend that further research should use various electronic databases such as Web of Science (WoS), Springer, IEEE Xplore et cetera in order to get better scientific contributions.","analysis tjatur widyantoro binus business school doctor of research in management bina nusantara university jakarta selatan, dki jakarta, indonesia tjatur.widyantoro@binus.ac.id muhtosim arief binus business school doctor of research in management bina nusantara university jakarta selatan, dki jakarta, indonesia marief@binus.edu",
290,"Clmv, Asean6 And China’S Belt And Road Initiative:  Economically Secure, Politically Insecure","this paper aims to explore the influence of bri in clmv countries and its implications for the process of asean economic integration. asean faces an economic development gap between asean6 and the clmv bloc that can be filled by china through various economic development schemes, including the belt and road initiative (bri). bri can be a dilemma at various levels, but it can also be a stimulant to strengthen asean economic integration. the characteristics of the asean region that adheres to open regionalism or hybrid regionalism can be an advantage in economic integration through aec, where economically, asean member countries can freely determine the pattern of bilateral economic cooperation with virtually any country, but politically, the asean way principle can determine the pattern of political decision making at the regional level. without the domination of a country in the region, all member countries will speak on behalf of the region if there is a political decision concerning the region. at this point, the tendency of sub-regionalism within asean can be suppressed while still obtaining economic benefits.","asean6, clmv, asean integration, china","This paper conducts an analysis at the domestic level of politics and the economy to identify the influence of BRI on the AEC. At the domestic level, BRI helps to realize the national interests of ASEAN members, especially CLMV. At the political level, China through BRI can stimulate ASEAN in forming a more effective decision- making system to avoid decisions that harm ASEAN in AEC integration. However, in the case of ASEAN, the logic of decision-making differs from that of economic logic. Politically, there will always be a chasm between CLMV and ASEAN6 countries. countries in the CLMV can receive tremendous economic benefits from China. However, ASEAN6 will have their own decision-making logic at the intergovernmental level. As a consequence of regional integration based on government initiatives, not on the market, the processes that occur at the market level will be fully controlled by the governments of each member state. ASEAN6 is likely to maintain the dominance of decision-making by the founding countries of ASEAN and will continue to be wary of the steps taken by sub regional actors in decision-making at the supranational institutional level. The role as the founder of ASEAN will remain a conditio sine qua non in political decisions at the regional level. However, this can be seen as an ASEAN advantage that is able to harmonize the necessary economic dimensions, while maintaining the political pattern that has been going on so far. In this case, there is no need for an integral and institutional political mechanism as long as ASEAN’s security is not at stake, such as the EU. Due to various limitations, this dilemma cannot be resolved in this paper.","aditya permana and mochammad taufan department of international relations, faculty of humanities, bina nusantara university jl. kemanggisan ilir iii no.45, rt.12/rw.6, kemanggisan, kec. palmerah, kota jakarta barat, daerah khusus ibukota jakarta 11480 adityapermana84@binus.ac.id, mochammad.taufan@binus.ac.id","references and power in the European Community: a liberal intergovernmentalist

The two major test that was performed was the Constant Radius and Constant Speed tests. For each of the tests, definite path was defined at six different velocities. The developed model in MATLAB-Simulink is capable enough to simulate the lateral and longitudinal control of the vehicle. The model is designed, keeping a four- wheeler in mind and the vehicle parameters were chosen according to it. The PI controller employed in this model is able to control the longitudinal motion of the vehicle under all conditions. The Stanley controller used to control the lateral movement of the ego vehicle is very effective at low speeds. But as the speed increases the lateral acceleration increases and the RMS error increases.

293,Critical Success Factors Of Sustainable Collection And  Transportation In Municipal Solid Waste Management,"in recent years, the continuously growing municipal solid waste (msw) has been a global concern due to growing urbanization, dynamic changes in the market, and the harmful impact of msw on the environment. hence, collecting the generated waste from different sources and transporting it to different disposal options is the beginning of achieving sustainability. to remain an environment-friendly, long- term economically growing and social supportive system, ensuring the integration of sustainability in the collection and transportation (c&t) phase is of particular importance for the municipal solid waste management (mswm) system. thus, this paper identifies the critical success factor for sustainable c&t of the mswm system for indian cities. these factors are analyzed further to understand the relationship of one another and importance of the successful sustainable c&t through interpretive structural modelling and fuzzy-micmac. the findings will be helpful for decision-makers in making decision on adoption of these factors.",sustainability,"and Future scope The initial step of MSWM is the C&T phase, which collect MSW for further processing. To protect environment, reduces the impact to society and economic growth, this study found CSF for sustainable C&T of MSWM system. These CSF were analyzed using ISM to interpret the inter-relationship among enablers and Fuzzy MICMAC to categorize CSF for analyzing its impact on system. Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis depicts the importance of driving and dependence power while making decisions. Moreover, result indicated that the implementation of these CSF would achieve some targets of sustainable development goals in C&T of MSWM system for Indian cities. The result of the study would be helpful for decision-makers to focus on the specific enablers and improvements for the same. Since, the primary input for the used technique is expert opinion, a biased opinion on the topic will affect the output of the system. The number of experts selected for the study is limited and therefore, could not be generalized to other sectors. Thus, identified CSFs can be tested for other sectors and other developing countries. Different mathematical modeling can be done for each CSF improvement. The developed model can be validated using in-depth case study and structural equation modelling.

296,Power Generation Using Speed Breaker With The Help Of A  Rack And Pinion Mechanism,"energy is the most basic and essential need for all living things on the planet. energy is the driving force behind any country's economic development. in today's world, conventional energy sources produce the majority of energy. however, the world's population is growing at an alarming rate, and conventional energy sources are becoming scarce. this paper harvests energy from a speed breaker by arranging gears and employing electronic devices. saving a lot of money allows for the generation of a large amount of electricity. and, if implemented, will be extremely beneficial to the government. when a vehicle is in motion, it generates various forms of energy due to friction between the vehicle's wheel and the road, i.e., a rough surface. heat energy is also produced when a fast-moving vehicle collides with the wind. potential energy to electrical energy conversion is the principle at work. a power production system exists that converts the potential energy created by a vehicle moving up on a speed breaker into kinetic energy. the vehicle gains height as it moves over the inclined plates, increasing the potential energy wasted in a conventional rumble strip. when the breaker is tripped, they crank a lever attached to a ratchet-wheel mechanism, an angular motion converter, which rotates a geared shaft loaded with recoil springs. the shaft’s output is connected to a dynamo, which converts kinetic energy into electricity.","rack, pinion, recoil springs, geared shaft, electronic gadgets","This sort of power generation has been identified as being less expensive than many other choices, and the model has less parts, thus assembly would be very cheap with all of the components readily available and no model- specific parts manufactured.

Mutual funds offer superior returns, and security, and also serve as a form of savings. There are many ways to invest in the financial markets, but according to investor comments, mutual funds offer guaranteed and safe returns on investments. Investors are aware of the advantages of investing in mutual funds. SBI mutual fund firms should come forward to fully support investors at times like COVID-19 by providing advisory services, and extra suggestions, also assisting them in portfolio design, comprehending different mutual fund schemes, and promoting such types to ensure investor happiness. The SBI bank should educate people about the economic scenario and help them grasp the facts given in various schemes so that investors can assess the risks linked with the funds they are participating in and the investment decisions they are making. This may assist the SBI mutual fund company in attracting more investors and the mutual fund industry in achieving new heights. During crises such as pandemics, investors should identify the risks, return levels, and make decisions based on professionals rather than panicking, as this will help them earn greater returns and ensure the safety of their investments.","karnataka vishal mankari student, mba (finance) m.s. ramaiah university of applied sciences bangalore-560054, karnataka, india e-mail: vishalm2507@gmail.com vanishree. k assistant professor (finance) m.s. ramaiah university of applied sciences bangalore-560054, karnataka, india e-mail: vshree2821@gmail.com",

300,Impact Of Operational Decisions Of Rbi On Indian  Economy – An Evaluation Of Select Instruments,"the current economic scenario of various countries across the world are hugely suffered from the set back issues such as war incidents, global recession, downward trend of economic growth and uncertainty caused due to covid-19. the outlook for growth and inflation are both at risk from lingering conflict and sanctions, high oil and commodity prices, protracted supply-chain disruptions, amplified global financial market volatility resulting from monetary policy changes in major economies and new covid-19 outbreaks in india. during 2021–2022, excess liquidity conditions and the external benchmark-based pricing of variable rate loans significantly improved monetary transmission. the bulk of the industries saw an increase in interest rates on existing loans. with the support of conventional and unconventional liquidity measures, rbi has supported the banks to maintain orderly market conditions while boosting mood on the financial markets. in view of the existing scenario, the research paper critically examines the trends in instruments used by rbi to control the flow of deposits and money circulation among the banks with a main aim to reduce the negative effects of economic down turn. in this paper, an attempt is made to evaluate the impact of financial instruments of rbi on indian economy. the paper further examines the influence of the select instruments (i.e., repo rate, reverse repo rate, cash reserve ratio) on inflation rate, gdp and unemployment rate. the study is descriptive research oriented. secondary sources of data extracted from rbi; world bank data holds major part of the present research paper.","crr, gdp, inflation, repo rate","The Indian economy has been slightly impacted by RBI operating choices. A country's economy is greatly impacted by the repo rate because it is crucial to controlling the market's cash flow. Depending on market liquidity and inflation cash flow, the Indian monetary policy controls and regulates the repo rate. Additionally, the repo rate directly influences banks' ability to borrow money. As the repo rate rises, banks' borrowing capacity decreases, which lowers industries' production capacity and raises the cost of essential products and services while also increasing unemployment. Repo rates play a significant part in regulating inflation in the nation. For instance, if there is high inflation, the RBI will raise the repo rate, which will reduce the amount of currency flowing through the market. As cash flow declines, investment and manufacturing capacity also decline, which lowers the inflation rate. Banks are encouraged to borrow money from RBI since, on the other hand, RBI only cuts the repo rate when the inflation rate declines.The repo rates of RBI and the interest rates on loans of commercial banks are proportional to each other If the repo rates get increased interest rates on loans to get Increased and vice versa. Reverse repo rate increases encourage commercial banks to deposit more money with the RBI, hence limiting the quantity of money accessible in the market. A rise in the reverse repo rate will cause the money supply to decline, 2741","dubey sandeep pgdm ii semester itm business school, warangal, telangana state, india. email id: dubeys.2123w@itm.edu dr suresh chandra ch visiting faculty, itm business school, warangal & associate professor, department of business management vaagdevi degree & pg college hanamkonda district, telangana state, india drchsuresh8@gmail.com","References

302,Seismic Assessment Of Pipe Rack Considering Coupled And  Decoupled Case,"pipe racks are important part of industrial structures such as oil refineries, petrochemical sector, as they are used to support piping systems that transports fluids from one place to the other. the aim of this study is to carry out linear dynamic analysis of ethanol gas plant pipe rack considering coupled and decoupled case (for both pipe empty and operating conditions), using ansys and validating with staad pro. while analyzing pipe rack generally, the point masses calculated due to the weight of piping system and fluid are applied on the pipe rack structure, which usually satisfies the seismic mass criteria, but the stiffness added due to piping system and their supports are been neglected. the effect on seismic demand of pipe rack, due to additional masses and stiffness of piping system have been checked. it is observed that in coupled case the modal frequencies of the structure is higher due to additional pipe stiffness, but at the same time base shear values are lower as compared to decoupled case, which can further direct towards the change in response reduction factor (r) for both the cases which may eventually result in reduced base shear values.","pipe rack, piping system","In this study, an ethanol gas pipe rack was modelled, considering coupled and decoupled models, whose weight ratio exceeded 0.25 as per the clause given in IS 1893 part 4, for such structures both secondary (pipelines) and primary (pipe rack) are needed to be modelled. Here in this study four models were analyzed in ANSYS and Staad Pro, considering coupled and decoupled case for both empty and operating condition, and Pushover analysis was carried out in Staad Pro for evaluating response reduction factor. The main findings of this case study are as follows: In case of coupled model for both empty and operating conditions modal frequencies value increased by 35% as compared to decoupled case, this is mainly due to increased stiffness added because of pipelines and its support boundary conditions. It was also observed that the values of base shear for coupled cases was reduced considerably (9% in X direction and 43% in Z direction), which can further direct towards the change in response reduction factor (R) for both the cases which may eventually reduce base shear values. Pushover analysis was carried out to evaluate response reduction factor in Z direction, which resulted in giving higher (R) factor for coupled case in respective direction. Maximum roof displacement was observed in decoupled case (operating condition) but was within permissible limits. The results show that considering dynamic interaction while modelling and analysis of such structure is important as added stiffness and masses may affect the seismic response of the structure.","heena a. shaikh department of civil engineering college of engineering, pune, maharashtra, india shaikhha20.civil@coep.ac.in hina410shaikh@gmail.com dr. i. p. sonar department of civil engineering college of engineering, pune, maharashtra, india ips.civil@coep.ac.in",
303,Measuring The Ergonomic Risk Factors Associated With The  Perceived Risk Of Covid-19: A Case Of Residents In The,"the covid-19 pandemic has caused the general population to remain indoors, since the government ordered a national lockdown on march 15, 2020, because of the rising cases in the country. amidst the lockdown, citizens were still required to do their jobs and studies at home. this resulted in numerous ergonomic problems and discomforts since not all filipinos have a decent workstation in their respective houses. the conducted research observes the ergonomic- based risk factors with the perceived risk of covid-19, specifically about the residents of paranaque city. a study from davis et al (2020) discusses the different setups of employees that were analyzed by experienced ergonomics, and it showed that some employees have very poor ergonomics such as having non-adjustable chairs and wrong positioning of monitors, etc. the researchers have applied a quantitative research design to gather the necessary data to prove the hypothesis. online surveys were used to acquire data from the residents, the medium used for the research are social media applications. the data gathered suggests that most respondents are aged 20 and below, had attended high school, were primarily students, office clerks, etc. the results show that a significant number of residents from the paranaque area feels at risk of getting covid-19. it was also concluded that most of the respondents were concerned for their family’s safety. research conducted by mertens et al (2020) also shows that a large percentage of people are worried that their loved ones might get infected with covid-19.","ergonomics, risk factors, perceived risk, covid-19",,"philippines brian kenneth f. nanale, neil ivan b. bayer, robert ephraim c. pabiling senior high school mapúa university 658 muralla st. intramuros, manila, 1002, philippines bkfnanale@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, nibbayer@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, recpabiling@mymail.mapua.edu.ph ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial and engineering management mapúa university 658 muralla st. intramuros, manila, 1002, philippines mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph",

305,Effects Of Different Light Levels On The College Students’  Cognitive Performance,"this study aims to empirically discover the effects of different light levels on college students' cognitive performance. due to the coronavirus pandemic, most universities, schools, and other educational institutions have halted classes and activities in response. they have been forced to shift from face-to-face to online learning and significantly impact students' daily lives, particularly those who began their first year of college entirely online. many students spend much of their time in their bedroom, which now has their classroom, where they join virtual classes, study, and do coursework. our moods and cognitive capacities, such as learning and productivity, are strongly influenced by lighting. the researchers used data from a sample of 100 respondents obtained from a digital survey questionnaire containing a modified lighting ergonomics tool from the canadian centre for occupational health and safety (ccohs). sixty-nine percent (69%) of participants ages 18 to 24 years old, ranging from year 1 to 4, prefer studying at night. regression analysis was used to determine if there are effects of light used by the students on their preferred time to study. the day and night sections were separated, but both results rejected the alternative hypothesis. the pearson correlation has determined the linear relationships between factors. the analysis of variance (anova) showed no significant differences in the light levels used during daytime and nighttime. the researchers recommend exploring and considering other factors and including employees in work-from-home set-ups.","lighting, concentration, memorization, productivity","Light is essential for humans to live in this world. Different brightness ranges may give humans comfort or discomfort, resulting in various serious irreversible health conditions. With the pandemic, students and employees had to adapt to the concept of online learning and work from home set-ups. The rise of ergonomically- designed equipment for a work area emerged through the years, but not many people have considered lighting. The study's main objective is to determine whether different light levels: Low, Medium, High, and Very High can affect a student's cognitive performance: Concentration, Memorization, Productivity, and Perception. The researchers disseminated a digital survey to 100 respondents of college students and were able to gather data that was analyzed using different statistical treatment tools. Sixty-nine percent (69%) of participants ages 18 to 24 years old, ranging from Year 1 to 4, prefer studying at night. The Pearson Correlation has determined that the number of hours a student has allocated for studying has an intermediate positive linear relationship with the usage of light and eye strain and a negative linear relationship with productivity. The type of light used had also shown a negative linear relationship with productivity and intermediate positive with eye strain. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed no significant differences in the different light levels used during daytime and nighttime. Lastly, Regression analysis was used to determine if there are effects of light used by the students on their preferred time to study. Day and Night sections were separated, but both results rejected the alternative hypothesis, which states that there are significant factors affecting college students' cognitive performance in relation to the different light levels. 2793","sachi liyah s. bautista, shiela mae c. ilagan, isabella francesca c. lazaro, fea claire b. plantilla and ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university intramuros, manila, philippines slsbautista@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, smcilagan@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, ifclazaro@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, fcbplantilla@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

In this study, it is examined that ceramic powder should have a sub-micron size for homogeneity of the polymer composite. For the development of filament temperature and screw rotation are important factors. After examining different temperatures, it is found that extrusion of filament takes place at 135 degrees Celsius and the diameter ranges from 1.65 mm to 1.75 mm. By changing PLA-ZrO2 percentage ratio in the composite, there may be a difference in homogeneity and mechanical strength. But there are many ceramics and polymers available which be used for the synthesis of composite according to their applications. Apart from composite, a DC motor regulator can be used for controlling screw rotation which can improve filament extrusion and another cooling system can be used for filament cooling.","varun kumar, lakhwinder pal singh and narendra kumar department of industrial and production engineering dr b r ambedkar national institute of technology jalandhar, india varunk.mt.20@nitj.ac.in, singhl@nitj.ac.in, kumarn@nitj.ac.in",
307,Evaluation Of Mental Fatigue Of Students: A  Comparison Between Traditional And Online Learning,"this study evaluated college students' mental fatigue between traditional face-to-face classes and online learning. due to the coronavirus that started in the philippines last march 2020, the students faced a fast transition to online learning. the teachers and students had a significant adjustment to that setup which affected the student's mental health, particularly mental fatigue. the researchers would like to assess and compare the mental fatigue of students between traditional and online learning; the researchers conducted a digital survey on the students with 100 respondents where 51% are females, and 49% are males. the mental fatigue questionnaire was used, and it was reported that 86% of students experience mental fatigue online and 74% in traditional. the anova results for the comparison of both modalities showed that in an online setup, students are more prone to mental fatigue, with a mean of 18.825 and 16.010 for a traditional setup. this study found that the only significant factor is the duration of study in an online class, and no factor was found to be significant in a traditional setup.","mental fatigue, pandemic, online learning","In this study, the researchers gathered data from 100 respondents of college students in different schools in the Philippines, and the mental fatigue scale was used to determine the level of mental fatigue of the respondents. Also, the researchers determine and compare the factors such as the number of assessments that can student finish within the day, the difficulty of exams in different subjects/courses, duration of the study of the student, and the GPA of the student last term/semester. The survey received 50.5 percent female responses and 49.9 percent male responses. Furthermore, 75% of the students are between the ages of 18 and 20, and 25% are between the ages of 21 and 25, indicating that most of the students are in their sophomore year of college and have had exposure to both modes of learning. In an online format, 86 percent of students expressed mental fatigue; in a traditional version, 74 percent of students reported mental fatigue. As a result, both modalities have a reasonable chance of affecting students' mental fatigue in statistical analysis. Still, online learning is considerably more significant because more individuals were involved, and based on the ANOVA results, the online format has a mean of 18.825 and 16.010 in the traditional format. In correlation, the only significant factor was the duration of study in the online class. Students' mental fatigue is proportional to their duration of online study. 5. Recommendation Based on the researcher's result, we recommend that future researchers explore the different factors that affect students on mental fatigue. Also, the researcher advises adding more respondents for the data to be more accurate in comparing the result of which learning modalities affect the most students in mental fatigue. Moreover, the researchers can study the different students, not only the college students but also the high school and elementary students. For students, the researchers recommend taking a rest and doing the assessment early or in advance before the deadline to lessen mental fatigue. It is suggested that time spent on leisure, other activities, and academic responsibilities, be well managed. Using an application, for example, that displays the schedule, and due date could make work easier to manage and prioritize. For institutions, it is advised that the school adjusts the distribution of major and minor courses loaded on each student per term. According to the findings, the stress in schoolwork, light sources in the house, and noise in the study area increase a student's mental fatigue level. This indicates that students' mental fatigue is linked to their physical health. Furthermore, the findings revealed that a student's typical study hours considerably impact their level of mental fatigue. In theory, a student's average study hours are related to the units in their program. As a result, if the student's task is distributed differently, the study hours will also alter. 2806","in college students virlix claire a. estandian, marc christian c. reyes, robin d. torres, ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university 658 muralla st. intramuros, manila, philippines vcaestandian@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, rdtorres@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mcreyes@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

308,Effects Of Coffee Consumption On The Psychological  Wellbeing Of Undergraduate Students During Online,"this study evaluates undergraduate students' coffee consumption levels and investigates how it affects their psychological well-being during online learning. caffeine is a psychostimulant that boosts body energy levels, and coffee is its primary medium in beverages, so it is popular among students due to their need for help studying, especially during online classes. however, caffeine also has adverse effects. the researchers gathered data from a sample of 100 college students through a digital survey that aimed to know their level of coffee consumption and general mental health status using the ghq-12 questionnaire. the ghq-12 generates social dysfunction, anxiety and depression, and loss of confidence. the data obtained from the respondents were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and measurements of this study have determined that age and social dysfunction are associated with coffee consumption. it was concluded that age is directly proportional to coffee consumption, and students with high social dysfunction tend to consume a high amount of coffee. the researchers recommend that educational institutions must hold seminars for their students to discuss this awareness and encourage dosage limits of coffee to students.","coffee consumption, mental health, online class","In this study, the researchers collected data through a questionnaire given to 100 undergraduate college students who consume and drink coffee. The researcher used a 4-point Likert scale to rate the respondents' mental health and measured the results by Goldberg's 12-item General Health Questionnaire, which helps assess an individual's physiological status and determine the presence of social dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and loss of confidence. The result of the demographic shows that most of the respondents gathered were males aged from 21-to 22 years old, currently in their second year of college. Most respondents consumed 1 to 2 cups of coffee daily and preferred to drink coffee any time of the day. And lastly, most of the respondents consume coffee for school purposes based on the survey given. In the Mental Health Measurement or the GHQ-12 Questionnaire, the respondents were given 12 items to evaluate the presence of a mental disorder. These 12 items are namely: worrying, ability to concentrate, losing much sleep over worry, playing a useful part, capable to make decisions, under stress, not being able to overcome difficulties, able to enjoy day-to-day activities, being able to face problems, feel unhappy and depressed, losing confidence, thinking of self as worthless, and feeling reasonably happy. The results show that 51.10% of the respondents showed signs of social dysfunction, 35.09% showed signs of anxiety and depression, and 13.81% showed signs of loss of confidence. Based on the correlation analysis results, coffee consumption and the respondents' age showed a significant relationship, thus proving that consumption of coffee also increases with age. Furthermore, another factor that led to a significant relationship is the consumption of coffee and the presence of social dysfunction in the respondents, thus stating that an increase in consumption of coffee can also increase social dysfunction in the consumer. Other comparisons of factors such as consumption of coffee with anxiety and depression and coffee with loss of confidence have no significant differences. Therefore, it can be proven that a high amount of coffee indicates an adverse effect or risk of mental health disorders, specifically social dysfunction. Social dysfunction is one of the symptoms of neuropsychiatric disorders and has been repeatedly associated with severe health outcomes such as possible suicidal risk and poor communication with people (Porcelli, 2020). 6. Recommendation The results of the statistical analysis and the study's outcome proved that a high amount of coffee consumed by undergraduate students appears to have a negative effect on their mental health status. Thus, the researchers have concluded to provide recommendations and probable solutions to this problem. For educational institutions, the researchers suggest that they uphold their policies to support and care for students' welfare by initiating mental health awareness programs within their respective communities. Such programs must include online webinars or discussion programs about how overconsumption of coffee can expose students to risks of mental health disorders, specifically Social dysfunction, which has been proven in this study. This initiative will help students be encouraged to improve their mental health during online learning so they can perform better without being negatively affected by the coffee they consume. For the students, self-awareness is encouraged by the researchers. Knowing their amount of coffee intake and its noticeable effects on the system of their bodies would help them evaluate their well-being. However, the researchers mainly suggest that those students who drink such a high amount of coffee, more than 2 cups per day, must reduce their consumption due to the determined risks according to the study. The researchers also suggest alternative brain- 2814","learning raven gio charles a. bajar, gerome kaye m. cangco, jimmuel r. dantis, stephen shadrach p. marcos, ma. janice j. gumasing school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapua university 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines rabajar@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, gkmcangco@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jrdantis@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, sspmarcos@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, mjjgumasing@mapua.edu.ph","References

310,Triz And Lss Integrated Models Assessment: A Holistic  Model Development For Organizations’ Excellence,"today, the business world is in extreme competition. every organization is striving hard to find an ideal strategy to stand out from the rest of its competitors. however, achieving excellence is far from easy, and faced with problems. organizations usually use improvement approaches with experts in total quality management (tqm), lean management (lm), and lean six sigma (lss) to overcome punctual problems. unfortunately, companies still need a holistic and innovative framework involving the organization staff for solving problems. therefore, this paper proposes a futuristic framework for organizations’ improvement integrating triz and lss from the strategy to operational execution. the proposed model was based on a literature review on excellence, lss, and triz. furthermore, the authors’ experience as academics, researchers, and industrialists facilitate the framework experimentation in a real context. the results show that the framework allows companies to develop a continuous improvement culture, focus on priorities and develop an innovative approach to solving problems. this system will enable future research and management systems to take the framework as a basis for continuous improvement and to open the opportunity to discover triz differently.","lean six sigma, triz, problem solving, excellence","In conclusion, the excellence heart framework could be used to solve any business problem. The strategic and operational levels enable communication between stakeholders and focus the staff energy on objectives. TRIZ and LSS integration makes problem-solving easier. Therefore, the framework engages everyone in continuous, innovative, and sustained improvement. The proposed Tools make possible the TRIZ integration into industries. The framework integration in the company’s production system or ISO will positively affect companies’ performance. Further research must take into consideration human complexity. The company’s culture, management, staff motivation, and human personalities need to be studied and integrated into the framework. The framework was tested in complex and complicated problems, but we need to test if the framework will positively influence chaotic issues in the COVID19 context or in the ware context.","soumaya elyoussoufi laboratory lm2i, department 2i2d national school of electricity and mechanics (ensem) hassan ii university casablanca, morocco soumaya.elyoussoufi@ensem.ac.ma mohamed mazouzi laboratory lm2i, department 2i2d national school of electricity and mechanics (ensem) hassan ii university casablanca, morocco m.mazouzi@ensem.ac.ma anass cherrafi ensam school moulay ismail university a.cherrafi@ensam.umi.ac.ma",

312,An Empirical Study On Capital Structure Of Energy Sector  In India,"the study aims to explore the impact of capital structure on the energy sector in india. several variables were identified in order to know their effects on the capital structure of energy sector in india. the analysis comprises panel data set of 28 companies ranging from 2009 to 2020 which leads to a total of 336 sample size. hausman test is performed to find the best fit model among the several panel data regressions. the variables firm size, interest coverage and operating expenses are significant in relation to book leverage of the firm. the findings of the study reveal that 43% of the book leverage of the firm. the firm leverage, industrial leverage, firm leverage one lag have a significant impact on the capital structure and suggested that the energy sector has comparatively less risk and has good profit. the results obtained were statistically significant. key words book leverage, capital structure, operating costs, hausman test and panel data. 1. introduction india ‘s energy sector is one of the most varied in the world. these sources range from coal, lignite, oil, natural gas and various sources like solar, wind, agriculture and waste produced by agricultural activities. the demand for electricity has increased immensely and also is expected to increase in the years to come. hence, the demand for energy sector is increased. over the next 20 years, india is expected to have the highest rise in energy consumption among any nation in the world as its economy continues to grow and provide its population more affluence. the dilemma of how to effectively supply this rising demand without aggravating problems like expensive energy imports, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions is raised by the mix of a developing and industrialising economy and an expanding and increasingly urban population. the analysis shows that india's electrical industry is changing, making it possible for the supply of clean, cheap, and dependable power to an increasing number of families and companies. this transformation is being driven by the fast spread of solar power and smart policy-making. the industrial and transportation sectors, which include things like road freight, steel, and cement, will prove much harder to expand sustainably, as it is the case with economies all around the world. energy security concerns in india are many and constantly changing. according to current policy parameters, india's total import cost for fossil fuels is expected to quadruple over the next two decades, with oil making up the vast majority of this total. domestic production of oil and gas continues to lag behind demand trends, and by 2040, net reliance on imported oil will have increased from 75% to over 90%. this ongoing reliance on imported fuels exposes us to price cycles, volatility, and potential supply interruptions. if system flexibility is not greatly strengthened, many electrical distribution businesses' financial health is not addressed, and other reform plans are not carried out, india's domestic market may also see dangers to energy security, notably in the electricity sector.the main aim of this paper is to identify the impact of capital structure in the energy sector and the analysis of the same has been done by identifying various variables. 2. literature background 2853",,"The study was mainly done to identify the various factors that affect the capital structure in the Indian energy sector. With 336 observations and panel data covering the years 2009 to 2020, the study looked into the factors that influence capital structure. The study's objective is to identify the numerous characteristics that have a significant impact on capital structure as well as to assess how capital structure affects company value in the paper sector. For identifying the best fit model, Hausman test models are used. The findings indicate that it is possible to establish the capital structure of the Indian energy sector by the independent variables that have been identified. The descriptive statistics enabled that the companies has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt and the earnings of the companies are quite volatile. The Hausman test was conducted to know the best fit model which is the fixed effect model. The analysis considers the factors book leverage and company size to be important. The regression analysis portrayed that the variable firm leverage has a significant relationship with the book leverage and the rest of the variables does not have a significant relationship. The regression analysis suggested that only the variable firm leverage 1 lag has a significant relationship with the dependent variable and the rest of the variables does not have a significance relation with the dependent variables and is not much effective. 5.1 Limitations and Future Scope The study was only limited to energy sector and for a period of 12 years for 28 companies. The variables that were identified were also limited. Further analysis can be done on various other industries and by identifying different variables that have an impact on the capital structure of the companies by using similar or more advanced methods for analysing the variables.","sowjanya s r student, m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, india savitha kulkarni assistant professor, m s ramaiah university of applied sciences, india",
313,Finite Element Modeling And Analysis Of Three Anatomically  Shaped Scaffold Models,"the fabrication of porous scaffolds is a significant challenge in orthopedic applications. bone fractures can be repaired using porous biomaterial scaffolds. in addition to promoting bone growth, they also aid in the tissues' ability to osseointegrate. porous scaffolds are increasingly being made using additive manufacturing (am) methods. modeling and finite element analysis (fea) allow for more affordable exploration of the mechanical and biological behavior of patient-specific implants. in this study, we have used the cad programme creo to construct a scaffold lattice structure with three different unit cells triangular, hexagonal, and octagonal, and finite element analysis (fea) of the compressive strength of these unit cells has been carried out using the abaqus software. compressive strength of lattice structures based on these three-unit cells was studied for the biocompatible pla thermoplastic polymer with a strut size of 2mm.","lattice structures, fea","In this study, modelling of porous structures made of biocompatible PLA material (triangular, hexagonal, and octagonal) and their FEA have been undertaken to simulate the compressive behavior of the material under uni- axial load. Compressive stresses, porosity, surface area, and volume of all scaffolds were analyzed and compared. Elastic moduli were determined by the FEA to be 240 MPa for the hexagonal lattice structure scaffold, 235 MPa for the octagonal scaffold, and 687 MPa for the triangular scaffold. The SA/V ratio of the triangular lattice structure is higher than that of the other lattice structures, hence it is recommended as the optimal choice. Fabrication of all scaffolds will be done in the future as part of the planned activity in order to validate the results (a) (b) (c) 2864","rohit gupta, lakhwinder pal singh and narendra kumar department of industrial and production engineering dr b r ambedkar national institute of technology jalandhar, india varunk.mt.20@nitj.ac.in, singhl@nitj.ac.in, kumarn@nitj.ac.in","References

314,Effect Of Build Orientation On The Wear Behaviour Of  17-4-Ph Ss Printed Using Laser Powder Fusion Bed,"in the present work, we have investigated the sample orientation effects on the wear behaviour of laser powder bed fusion (lpbf) processed 17%cr-4%ni precipitation hardenable (p.h) steel. the samples were printed in three directions (horizontal (0o), vertical (90o) and inclined (45o) in the build platform using dmls system. (eos m 290) machine. 17%cr-4%nip.h steel samples were given rough polish, medium polish and fine polish. the microstructure was studied for both as printed and surface modified conditions using scanning electron (sem) microscopes. the wear test was tested for all three orientations. the input parameters selected were: applied load of 10n, sliding distance of 1000m, rubbing time of 30min with ambient working temperature. the wear rate was measured and compared among orientations for as printed and surface modified conditions to identify the best orientation. the post worn surface was analysed using sem to identify wear mechanisms. the key findings from the present work are; 1. lb-pbf 17-4 ph ss as-built specimens have high wear rate as compared to polished conditions. this is most likely related to the hardness of lb-pbf 17-4 ph ss. 2. medium finish- horizontal built lb-pbf 17-4 ph ss possesses higher wear rate as compared to rough and fine finished samples. this is attributed to the lath martensite and austenite formed on the surface a result of higher surface roughness of lb-pbf specimens. 3. fine finish –horizontal built specimens showed least wear loss, but on an average the inclined built specimens in all polishing conditions showed least wear loss. 4. adhesion was the dominant wear mechanism, while abrasion and surface fatigue were the wear mechanisms.","stainless steel, orientation, wear",,"pooja angolkar research scholar, department of mechanical engineering, jntu hyderabad, india 21pooj@gmail.com m. manzoor hussain professor in mechanical engineering and registrar jawaharlal nehru technological university hyderabad india manzoorjntu@jntuh.ac.in qutubuddin s.m. associate professor, industrial and production engineering department p.d.a.college of engineering kalaburagi, karnataka, india syedqutub16@gmail.com",
315,Optimization Of Springback In Vbending At Elevated  Temperatures Using Taguchi Approach,"in recent decades the high demands of dual-phase (dp) brass find wide applications in electrical, electronic and other appliance industries. therefore, study of material characterisation and springback behaviour are essential in forming of sheet metal components. in the present work, an isothermal uniaxial tensile test was performed to evaluate the accurate mechanical properties, which are essential pre-requisite for optimization of process parameters to decrease and minimize spring-back for any sheet-metal-forming operations. the v-bending test was conducted at specified test parameters temperature (773 k, 873 k, and 973 k), punch velocity (1 mm/min, 5 mm/min, and 10 mm/min), holding-time (30 s, 60 s, and 90 s) and orientation (00, 450, and 900) concerning rolling direction. taguchi approach was utilized to optimize the test parameters such as temperature, punch velocity, holding-time, and orientation. the optimal set of parameters obtained were temperature (973 k), punch velocity (1 mm/min), holding-time (90 sec) & orientation (90°) and using these optimal set of parameters a confirmation test has been conducted and it was reported that the spring-back was decreased significantly in v-bending process for dual phase (dp) brass sheet. the main objective of the study is to investigate the springback behaviour in v-bending process on brass sheets to understand the formability and to optimise the processes parameter to minimize the springback effect using taguchi technique to meet the needs of the sheet metal forming processes.",,,"v dharam singh assistant professor, mechanical engineering department, muffakham jah college of engineering and technology, hyderabad, india dharamsingh10@gmail.com m manzoor hussain professor in mechanical engineering and registrar jawaharlal nehru technological university, hyderabad, india manzoorjntu@jntuh.ac.in syed shoeb pasha m.e (cad/cam) student muffakham jah college of engineering and technology, hyderabad, india shoieb5158@gmail.com k phani raja kumar sr. manager, tech mahindra americas, usa dr.phanikaturu@gmail.com shasaif hussain m masters in industrial and systems engineering niu, usa shasaifh1404@gmail.com","References

319,Modeling And Simulation Of Four-Wheel Steering System For  Shorter Wheelbase Vehicle,"in-vehicle handling one of the most important systems is the steering system. typically, all vehicles have a steering system that allows the vehicle to be turned to either side, that is, left or right. in this paper, an idea of implemented considering a steering system for the rear wheel in addition to the front wheel, resulting in a four-wheel steering system. the turning radius required for four-wheel steering is less than that necessary for front-wheel steering after evaluating the effect of the four-wheel steering system. some cars use four-wheel steering to improve steering response, increase vehicle stability while driving at high speeds, or reduce turning radius while maneuvering at low speeds. however, the improvement in turning radius is discussed using ackermann steering geometry (asg), from which the wheel critical turning angles are calculated for minimum turning radius. the steering system is implemented using a rack and pinion mechanism, and the design of the pinion and rack are obtained from asg. in the study, the vehicle behavior for 4-wheel steering is done using a physical prototype and matlab simulink model. also, the steering of the front and rear wheel is performed using a servo motor which is controlled by the microcontroller. the vehicle's turning radius is reduced by 33% due to the four-wheel steering system. improvements have also been made in high-speed handling while changing lane with the four-wheel steering system, in which excessive lateral displacement has been reduced by 77% and reduce the time required to change the lane. also, the study of these forces for the four-wheel steering system is discussed for low-speed maneuvering. keyword steering mechanism, ackermann steering, front wheel steering, four-wheel steering, matlab simulink and dynamics. 1. introduction the steering system is the most important component of any vehicle. it allows the driver to have complete control over the vehicle’s maneuvering. the steering function is to steer the vehicle with the manual input to the steering wheel. the majority of vehicles, including cars, trucks, tractors, and other vehicles, have front-wheel steering. except for special purpose vehicles, front-wheel steering input has been utilized to control the direction of vehicles since the invention of the automobile. because of its importance in managing vehicle dynamics, yaw stability management of the vehicle is one of the intriguing challenges to focus on in this scenario. it is generally known that a simple bicycle model which can be used to examine the vehicle's maneuvering and handling stability dynamics. in four-wheel steering systems, a mechatronics system steers the rear wheels. while turning using four-wheel steering system wheels rotate by angle ∆θ1,∆θ2 and ∆θ3,∆θ4 for the front-wheel and rear-wheel respectively. this study shows vehicle steering at low and high speeds, with the low-speed study demonstrate the vehicle’s turning radius can be reduce, which is useful for parking and u-turns. 1.1. objective in this study, a four-wheel steering system with a shorter wheelbase is introduced as it was not reported before, particularly to the hatchback category of vehicle. in this paper, 1. to study the steering mechanisms for a four-wheel steering system. 2. using a four-wheel steering mechanism study the vehicle behavior for a shorter wheelbase. 3. reduce the turning radius and improve the high-speed maneuvering of the shorter wheelbase vehicle. 4. to study the dynamic behavior of four-wheel steering vehicle. 2912",,"It has been observed that system design for four-wheel steering employing Ackermann steering geometry mathematically satisfies the ideal steering condition. Also, the following points are concluded: • A four-wheel steering vehicle, a smaller turning radius minimizes the time it takes to turn the vehicle. • It has been noted that the circle trace by the four-wheel steering is of radius 350 mm and the ellipse trace by front- wheel steering is of radius 525mm. • Steering on all four wheels at high speed, the vehicle’s lateral movement is faster and more stable than when steering on the front wheels. A reduction in turning is noted as a function of the yaw position and yaw rate. This concludes that the four-wheel steering system helps to reduce the turning radius of the vehicle by approximately 33%. There are also improvements in high-speed maneuvering; while these results are likewise observed for the prototype; the physical prototype the turning radius of the vehicle is reduced by approximately 35%; given that the prototype is a scaled-down version of the actual car, it can be conclude that the calculations for the prototype are also applicable for the actual vehicle. Also, it has been observed that the stability of vehicle factors is different for low-speed and high-speed. Also, the normal force and lateral forces were affected while vehicle steering. • The normal and lateral forces increase with increased velocity. • The low-speed maneuvering normal and lateral forces affect the vehicle stability • The suitable turning for the four-wheel steering vehicle is 18km/hr.","rahul g. shete, maneetkumar r. dhanvijay, sudhir madhav patil department of manufacturing engineering and industrial management college of engineering pune, maharashtra, india sheterahul333@gmail.com, mrd.mfg@coep.ac.in, smp.mfg@coep.ac.in",
320,Numerical Simulation Of Hybrid Passive Heat Sink For Onboard Ev Charger,"the battery chargers are an important component in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles and various other clean energy systems. the thermal management in the battery charger is a crucial aspect that influences its overall performance and cyclic stability. passive cooling technology using heat sinks is preferred in developing battery chargers due to its reliability, quietness, and efficiency. in the present work, new hybrid passive heat sinks with various fin geometries namely inclined interrupted fins, pin fins, and straight interrupted fins, have been developed by adding a phase change material layer to passively cooled bare fin heat sinks. the developed heat sinks have the same geometric footprint as that of the battery charger; ic650 was built by the industrial partner of the project delta- q technologies. simulations were carried out to analyze the effects of pcm quantities for thermal loads on the heating-cooling performance of the hphs using ansys fluent 19.1 commercially available software to validate the experimental results from the literature study. inclined interrupted fin design found more effective in terms of thermal performance among all considered configurations. keyword pcm, hybrid passive heat sink, thermal management, passive cooling 1. introduction the electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid vehicle markets are developing rapidly to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, with a projected reduction of 200 million tons of oil equivalent by 2030. (alawadhi and amon 2000) demand for evs is expected to increase by 20% in the coming decades. (ali et al. 2018) this requires technological advances in the design of electric drive units and improved charging infrastructure. in recent years, the miniaturization of electronic components, as well as the improvement of their performance, have led to the emergence of high- performance devices with high packing density.(benyamin et al. 2021) therefore thermal management of electric vehicles is an important issue which is needed to be addressed as not the only battery but other components e- motors, controllers, and onboard ev chargers generate numerous amounts of heat.(bunsen et al. 2019) hence there is a need to develop an effective cooling system for thermal management of onboard ev chargers. notable research work has been carried out using different passive and active cooling systems i.e. air cooling, liquid cooling, heat pipe cooling, refrigeration, thermoelectric, and the use of thermal conductivity enhancers in finned cooling is done. however, pcm cooling remains the foremost selection based on its high-energy storage density. (farzanehnia et al. 2019) the key selection for a proper pcm requires both high latent heat and thermal conductivity in order to store and reject with facility the heat. phase change materials-based heat sinks are emerging as one the effective techniques for the removal of heat from electronic devices. current research focuses on improving the thermal performance of heat sink models using pcm as a thermal conductivity improver. the effect of various parameters influencing the performance of tce-pcm-based heat sinks needs to be studied in systematic order. 1.1 objectives in literature different fin configurations were investigated where it is found that most of the work has been done by use of pcm on microprocessor chips, fin submerged in pcm is used as thermal conductivity enhancers to improve the heat transfer characteristics of pcm enclosed in containers and use of pcm-air hybrid heat sink design which combines the effect of fin interaction with the pcm & ambient. this design facilitates continuous heat dissipation from the heat sink to the ambient via natural/forced convection. from the research study, it’s found that the 2924",,"In the present study hybrid design of heat sink is developed for real industrial onboard Ev charger using paraffin wax as a PCM. The effect of PCM quantity over different geometries is compared with the finned heat sink design. Viz. inclined interrupted, straight interrupted, and pin fin was analyzed at different thermal loads. The following conclusions were drawn from the study: For finned heat sink without PCM condition Inclined interrupted FHS delivered the best performance followed by Circular and Straight interrupted FHS for a thermal load of 80 W. At higher thermal loads of 100 W and 120 W, the shape of the temperature profiles for Inclined interrupted, Circular, and Straight interrupted FHS is similar to that at 80 W, except that the slopes of the temperature profiles are higher. Overall, the thermal performance of inclined interrupted FHS at all the thermal loads was found to be higher than for Circular and Straight interrupted FHS. Using Phase change Materials based hybrid heat sink design offers potential in cooling electronic devices compared to traditional methods.so by using PCM as a thermal conductivity enhancer in finned heat sink design reduce heating rate and peak temperatures of the heat sink thus electronic devices can have longer usage. It is concluded that less peak is observed in the contours of temperature with PCM as a TCE for a given time period. So, maximum thermal performance is achieved and reduce thermal stresses in heat sink. Thermal conductance calculated at different thermal power levels for three different configurations was higher for pin fin configuration at 80 W i.e. 0.72 and for straight interrupted fin configuration at 100 W i.e. 0.69 2930","pranali gole, mahendra sable and vishal bhalla department of mechanical engineering college of engineering, pune, india golepp20.mech@coep.ac.in, mjs.mech@coep.ac.in, vbhalla.mech@coep.ac.in","References
