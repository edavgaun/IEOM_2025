0,Can Electric Motorcycles Overtake Two-Wheeled Gasolinepowered In Southeast Asia?,"motorcycles two-wheeled gasoline-powered with internal combustion engines (ice) and resulting co2 pollution are very large in southeast asia, including indonesia, malaysia, and vietnam. the adoption of technology innovation in electric motorcycles (em) can be utilized to achieve a target of the transport sector's zero emissions by 2050. the em technology innovation provided transportation solutions that are environmentally friendly, energy-efficient, and lower operating and maintenance costs. but, the adoption rate of em in southeast asia still needs to improve and faces challenges of adoption-diffusion problems, i.e., product, process, innovation, and business. the early adopter has inconvenience and anxiety about their daily mobility needs over long distances. the charging infrastructure and battery capacities are critical components for solving the problem. first, users with high mobility who drive beyond the maximum mileage, if they run out of power, will stop and wait a long time for the battery to be fully charged again. second, the scenario is to increase the battery capacity to 2-3 times the usual capacity to increase the vehicle's mileage without recharging it during a trip. there is an example of a dilemma in making a business strategy. will electric motorcycles fail to overtake two-wheeled gasoline-powered? can we achieve a target for the transport sector's zero emissions by 2050? the intervention instruments used early supply chain integration to solve the challenges and problems of adopting electric motorcycles in indonesia were conducted by the university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology, universitas sebelas maret. we also promoted an equivalent annual cost (eac) to compare the options between improving battery capacity and infrastructure of charging by considering the cost of owning, operating, and maintaining for an extended period of the electric motorcycle market. comparing the three countries is needed to obtain comprehensive input for economies of scale in global market competition. we offer to assess an em ecosystem in malaysia and vietnam. the novelty of research that is expected from this research is developing an eac model suitable for the electric motorcycle market in the southeast asian market. thus, the research results can provide the option of strategies for designing the global competitiveness of the electric motorcycle market and helping electric motorcycles overtake two-wheeled gasoline powered in southeast asia.","battery capacity, early supply chain",,"wahyudi sutopo1,2 , muhammad hisjam2, 1)university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology 2)research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, jl. ir. sutami, 36 a, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id; hisjam@staff.uns.ac.id sayyidah maulidatul afraah master program of industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, 57126, indonesia sayyidahmaulidatula@student.uns.ac.id azanizawati ma'aram faculty of mechanical engineering, universiti teknologi malaysia, skudai, johor baru, 81310, malaysia niza@utm.my",
1,Improving Supply Chain Resilience Against Price Volatility  By Long-Term Contracts And Price Adjustment Formulas –,"short-term supply agreements and quarterly pricing based on the log export price are dissuading investment into new zealand's wood processing, perpetuating the commoditisation of the forest industry and concentrating market risk rather than encouraging adding value onshore and market diversification. supply, demand, cost, and revenue uncertainties reduce business confidence and discourage investments. a long-term contract with price adjustment is not a zero-sum game. the transparent information, calculability, steadiness, and time for adjustments across the supply chains provide synergies and advantages for the strategic allies. to mitigate risks, long-term contracts with price adjustment clauses are frequently implemented in power generation, coal, nuclear, construction, and oil industries. this price adjustment method benefits commodity suppliers and buyers with steady product flow and long payback period capital investments. beyond cost reduction and productivity, in these lean supply chains, risk mitigation is essential for the entire payback period. usually, the allies take significant roles in each other's businesses and have a symmetric relationship. therefore, they want to build long-term partnerships rather than realise one-time gains. that paper introduces the benefits of the abovementioned solution in decreasing risks and improving supply chain resilience and profitability for all parties.","risk, long-term contract, phd",,"case study of wood processing industry in new zealand robert istvan radics senior lecturer in supply chain management faculty of agribusiness and commerce lincoln university lincoln, new zealand robert.radics@lincoln.ac.nz muhammad umar lecturer in supply chain management faculty of agribusiness and commerce lincoln university lincoln, new zealand muhammad.umar@lincoln.ac.nz",
2,Integrating Feature Engineering With Deep Learning To  Conduct Equipment Health Management For Semiconductor,"fault detection and diagnosis (fdd) and predictive maintenance (pdm) are two critical issues in equipment health management (ehm). the former aims at identifying equipment conditions (healthy vs. poor) while the latter focuses on the prediction of the remaining useful life (rul) for key components. in reality, imbalanced datasets containing limited defective samples make precise fdd very challenging. in addition, the prediction of the rul is difficult because of limited availability of true data. in this research, fdd and pdm are transformed into the prediction of probe’s core states and tip length. in particular, this research aims at accomplishing the following goals: (1) ensemble learning is used to identify key performance indicators (kpis) that significantly affect probe’s core states (classification) or tip length (regression). (2) a two-stage stacking architecture is applied to improve the predictive performances. (3) oversampling schemes are adopted to handle imbalanced datasets and improve predictive performances in core states. research findings demonstrate that vendor type, chip size, chip leads, cleaning depth, and cleaning touchdown are common kpis in probe’s core state and tip length. further, stacking architecture and oversampling can significantly improve the f measure by at least 10%.","fault diagnosis, probe length",,"manufacturing chihhsuan wang national yang ming chiao tung university, chihswang@nycu.edu.tw",

9,Pot-Hole Detection And Reporting System   Using Deep Learning,"pot-holes are a prevalent problem that affects the effective functioning of the road infrastructure. they cause a high number of road accidents, and vehicle damage, resulting in higher maintenance costs. effective strategies are therefore required to report potholes to road maintenance authorities and thus facilitate constant upkeep and repair. this study focuses on the development of a deep-learning-based pothole detection and reporting system, to assist road maintenance personnel in making informed road repair decisions. a yolov5 model is developed and trained using a custom dataset containing pothole images obtained from a survey conducted by the researcher, as well as online sources. the model is integrated into the overall system, to facilitate the detection of potholes from uploaded images. comprehensive data visualizations are created, with the location of detected potholes added to a map. pothole maintenance procedures are implemented to ensure that the pothole information in the system is accurate and up to date. overall, the system provides a clear and concise viewpoint from which road repair decisions can be made and justified.","pothole detection, reporting system, deep learning","This study presented a deep-learning-based pothole detection and reporting system that provides comprehensive data visualizations. The first objective of the study was achieved by creating a user interface feature to upload or capture an image. To capture additional information on potholes in the specified collection region, a questionnaire survey was implemented where system users could provide more context on the state of the road based on their perspective. The second objective was achieved by using a member of the YOLO family of algorithms (YOLOv5) to build a model to detect potholes. To make the trained model available to other system components, it was then embedded in a FASTAPI application and deployed to a cloud environment. The third and fourth objectives were successfully met. Before pothole detection, an image verification step was implemented, to check if the contained location information of where it was captured. If the information was available, the user would then submit their pothole detection request. Upon successful detection, the location metadata captured was used to add the detected potholes on a map. Visualization reports within the defined dashboards would then be updated accordingly. The fifth objective was also met as all registered system users were able to receive email notifications upon successful pothole detection. A pothole maintenance process was also implemented to ensure that the pothole information in the system portrayed an accurate view of the state of the road infrastructure. All these features led to the successful implementation of a system that supports informed road repair decision-making.","wellington t. mpofu, belinda ndlovu, sibusisiwe dube, joseph mutengeni department of informatics and analytics national university of science and technology bulawayo, zimbabwe wellington.t.mpofu@gmail.com, belinda.ndlovu@nust.ac.zw, sibusisiwe.dube@nust.ac.zw, joseph.mutengeni@nust.ac.zw",
10,Customer Churn Analytics Using Classical Machine  Learning Algorithms And Deep Neural Networks:,"this research focuses on customer churn analytics in the banking sector of zimbabwe, specifically investigating the effectiveness of classical machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks. customer churn, characterized by the loss of clients in the banking industry, has significant implications for banks, including revenue reduction, increased customer acquisition costs, and reputational damage. the study utilizes a dataset of customer data containing demographic and banking-related features to train and evaluate various models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, xgboost, and a basic deep learning algorithm. the findings reveal that all models exhibit high accuracy in predicting customer churn, with the deep learning model demonstrating superior performance compared to the classical algorithms. however, the study acknowledges limitations such as a small sample size and constrained feature set, which may impact the generalizability of the findings. the conclusion discusses the practical implications of the research for zimbabwean banks and suggests potential avenues for future research to address the identified limitations and further enhance customer churn analytics in the banking sector.","customer churning, companies","The four models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost) and deep learning are all machine learning techniques that can be used for classification tasks such as customer churn prediction. Classical machine learning models are often easier to interpret and require less computational power compared to deep learning models. Logistic Regression, for example, is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that works by modeling the probability of the outcome using a linear function. Decision Trees and Random Forest are non-parametric supervised learning algorithms that work by recursively partitioning the data based on the values of the features. XGBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting to improve model performance. On the other hand, deep learning models, such as neural networks, can handle complex and high-dimensional data and have been shown to outperform classical machine learning models in certain tasks, such as image and speech recognition. However, they require more computational power and can be more difficult to interpret compared to classical machine learning models.","a case of zimbabwe banks. zvinodaishe revesai, mary dzinomwa, belinda ndlovu, phillip nyoni, and sibusisiwe dube department of informatics and analytics national university of science and technology bulawayo, zimbabwe n02162069b@students.nust.ac.zw,mary.dzinomwa@nust.ac.zw , belinda.ndlovu@nust.ac.zw, philip.nyoni@nust.ac.zw, sibusisiwe.dube@nust.ac.zw",
11,A Quest For Management Practices In Vietnam’S  Manufacturing Firms,"although technology is a primary input for productivity, it may be a burden to seek, acquire and adopt modern and expensive technology for firms in developing countries such as vietnam. management practices may substitute costly technology to improve labor productivity in the manufacturing sector. this study of 35 countries recognizes the strong positive correlation between labor productivity and management, merging the world management survey and conference board datasets. a closer analysis of 11,702 observations in the manufacturing sector shows that larger firms tend to use more management practices. a comparative analysis of adopting management practices indicates that vietnam’s firms have lower mean management scores than high-income nations on average. in vietnam, firms in the low-tech manufacturing sectors, such as furniture and textile production, have lower management scores. other results are that vietnam’s operations management and talent management scores are poorer than overall management scores. the results suggest that managers in vietnam’s manufacturing firms must invest more in adopting management practices, which leads to a better output rate. this investment will also enhance human capital for firms.","management practice, operations, performance, manufacturing","The findings imply that Vietnam’s manufacturing firms are underinvesting in management practices. It is important to train managers with managerial skills. In terms of operations management, some of Vietnam’s firms have not implemented modern manufacturing processes such as lean manufacturing systems, contributing to efficiency. Vietnam’s firms also underperform other peers in recruiting and retaining talented people. 79","tung nhu nguyen lecturer, school of business international university – vietnam national university ho chi minh city quarter 6, linh trung ward, thu duc, ho chi minh city, vietnam nntung@hcmiu.edu.vn","References

12,"Hearing Threshold Levels Among Clothes Convection  Industry Workers In Klaten, Central Java, Indonesia","occupational hearing loss (ohl) is observed when employees are subjected to high decibel levels or ototoxic substances that damage one’s hearing. noise-induced hearing loss (nihl) is a condition that progresses gradually and is frequently unnoticed in its early stages due to the absence of observable symptoms. noise-induced hearing loss is usually detected after effects on hearing ability, difficulty understanding speech, and affected communication. most nihl causes permanent neural damage but is preventable. the study aims were to determine the prevalence of decreasing hearing threshold among workers in the cloth convection home industry at klaten, central java, indonesia. the study used an observational analytic approach with a cross-sectional design, and the sample comprised 21 workers from the home industry. through interviews, we collected demographic data, the onset of working, and the use of protective devices. all participants underwent pure tone audiometry and were categorized by noise exposure environment. a total of 21 workers, 18 (85.7%) female and 3 (14.3%) male are 31-60 years old, and the most duration of work is 11-20 years. the main results showed that the prevalence of decreasing hearing threshold among workers in this study was 33.3%. hearing threshold decreasing was correlated with the onset of working more than ten years of experience (p = 0.001, r= 0.655). ear protection is a habit in 10 (47.6%) workers.","hearing loss, audiometry, prevalence, human",,"asti widuri doctoral program in faculty of medicine, public health and nursing universitas gadjah mada (ugm), yogyakarta, indonesia otorhinolaryngology department faculty of medicine and health science universitas muhammadiyah yogyakarta (umy) yogyakarta, indonesia astiwiduri1972@mail.ugm.ac.id endraswari estigroho medical student, faculty of medicine and health science universitas muhammadiyah yogyakarta (umy) yogyakarta, indonesia endraswari8@gmail.com eko pujiyanto department of industrial engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta (uns) surakarta, indonesia ekopujiyanto@staff.uns.ac.id",
13,Performance Evaluation Of Artificial Intelligence In Decision  Support System For Heart Disease Risk Prediction.,"the leading cause of death in the world is heart disease. for medical professionals, prediction is challenging because it requires a higher level of predictive expertise. there is a knowledge gap in the field of healthcare despite the abundance of information. information is either present but not mined in underdeveloped nations like zimbabwe, or it is present but not mined to gain insights. the data gathered over time by the healthcare industry can help artificial intelligence (ai) technologies produce accurate predictions and decision-making outcomes. in this study, we used the random forest algorithm as our experimental model to evaluate ai's performance in predicting the risk of developing heart disease. with a recall of 91% and an f1-score of 83 percent, we were able to predict heart disease with an accuracy of 80% using a random forest algorithm. thus, the most effective algorithm for classifying heart disease is the random forest algorithm.","heart disease, random forest, constricted","Prediction and diagnosis of heart disease have always been difficult undertakings for medical professionals. Costly procedures and therapies for cardiac illnesses are available in hospitals and other medical institutions. Using machine learning techniques, we developed a strategy for predicting heart illness in this paper. The findings demonstrated a high accuracy standard for delivering improved estimation results. The key benefits of utilizing machine learning to forecast heart disease are that it allows for early heart disease detection, manages massive amounts of data using the random forest method and feature selection, and is both patient- and cost-friendly.","nyasha w.c mukura, belinda ndlovu department of informatics and analytics national university of science and technology bulawayo, zimbabwe nymukura@gmail.com, belinda.ndlovu@nust.ac.zw",

15,Maize Crop Yield Prediction Model Using   Machine Learning,"predicting crop yield in general is critical for agricultural planning, resource allocation, and food security. the recent adverse effects of climate change on agricultural productivity have given rise to crop yield prediction which is essential in assisting farmers in anticipating the worst and preparing accordingly. maize is one of the most popular staple foods in sub-saharan africa, and at the same time is the most affected by climate change. knowing the expected maize yield in advance therefore helps those communities that are heavily dependent on maize, to prepare in advance to handle the projected situation. despite several efforts that have been done to predict maize crop yield, the topic remains an open discussion. this paper joins the debate and uses data analytics and machine learning to build a reliable predictive model for estimating maize crop yield. using historical maize crop yield, weather, and environmental data, the random forest regressor (rfr) technique is trained to capture non-linear patterns and identify complex correlations in the data. the results of the model’s evaluation show an accuracy of 70.52% demonstrating the model’s ability to capture a substantial portion of the variability in the data. the predictive model can be useful for maize production farmers and maize grain depots, as it gives them time to plan for the future. policymakers may benefit from the model, as it helps them to make informed policies on grain management. future research should consider testing this model in a live environment, before packing it for deployment on a large scale.","machine learning, weather stations, and sensors","The design of a crop yield prediction model involves careful consideration of data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. Developing models that can accurately predict crop yields can be achieved by using a structured approach of collecting comprehensive and high-quality data. Conducting thorough data preprocessing and feature engineering, experimenting with different model architectures, and regularly evaluating and refining the model can also produce accurate models. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations and challenges such as data quality and availability, the complexity of crop-yield relationships, generalization to different regions and crop types, and the dynamic nature of crop-yield relationships.

16,The Role Of Technological Entrepreneurship And Innovation  System For Commercializing Electric Motorcycle,"technology will continue to develop as time goes by and human needs are increasingly complex. one of the issues currently being discussed is the issue of sustainability and renewable energy to reduce high air emissions. the indonesian government aims to reduce carbon emissions, one of which is by increasing the number of electric vehicles used. convertible electric motorbikes are a technological innovation that comes from university research. in order to support the development and commercialization of conversion kit technology, a model framework is needed. this research discusses the technological entrepreneurship and innovation system model that is suitable for the development of supporting technology for electric convertibles produced in indonesia. meanwhile, other aspects that will be discussed regarding technology development, namely technology push or market pull. furthermore, the product development process is also discussed to find out how to prevent technological innovation from falling into the valley of death. this study aims to develop strategies and provide lessons learned to readers so that technology commercialization can run well. the results of the analysis show that the conversion kit technology innovation currently still requires outreach because public interest is still not large, besides that the supply chain network of a conversion workshop is still not clearly defined. so that over time, the government and the conversion workshop work together to develop a supply chain for conversion kit components.","innovation system, commercialization","This study aims to develop strategies and provide lessons learned to readers so that technology commercialization can run well. In the process of determining the company's strategy, researchers obtained data based on brief interviews and literature studies from articles and journals that discussed conversion kit technology. The conversion kit is a technological innovation that was born from a series of research and development processes carried out by the university, then came into being as a spin-off university called PT. XYZ. The researcher acts as a technology entrepreneur trying to provide suggestions and solutions for companies regarding what companies can do in order to continue to earn revenue while keeping conversion kit technology innovation from falling into the valley of death. One solution that can be proposed is to maintain the quality of the conversion kit manufactured by the company, but still maintain a selling price that can compete with other competitors. So that potential users will have the view that conversion kit technology, which is the result of university research and development, has high competitiveness when compared to other products.","conversion kit: a case study tasya santi rahmawati master program of industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia tasyasantir@student.uns.ac.id wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id renny rochani research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, indonesia rennyrochani@staff.uns.ac.id",
17,The Role Of Technopreneur And Innovation System To  Increase The Adoption Of Marketplace:,"there are many marketplace innovations that have been created and adopted by people in indonesia. the marketplace property product is facilitating the transaction process from end to end in pt abc. unfortunately, studies on the study of the relationship between innovation systems and technopreneurs from a commercialization point of view are still very limited. this article provides a survey of technopreneur analysis and innovation systems that are suitable for a technology marketplace. this article highlights the common challenges and obstacles faced by companies, r&d, and product teams in developing technology entrepreneurship and the benefits for them. this article takes a case from the marketplace property application from pt abc. the existing products of the company are carefully selected to examine the framework of the technopreneur approach and innovation systems. the analysis was carried out by referring to the technopreneur approach and innovation system to understand the process of innovation management and applied technopreneur analysis. this article uses scrapping data from user reviews as a basis for swot analysis to develop a two-matrix strategy. so, it becomes the basis for improvement to increase adoption from marketplace users. the results show that this marketplace technology has reached the adoption stage. however, as many as 31% of users are still dissatisfied with the use of existing applications, especially household services which still require a lot of improvement, such as the development of features in the application.","marketplace, technopreneur, innovation, property","Based on this research, the marketplace helps consumers needs easily make property buying and selling transactions in E2E. Not only in terms of buying and selling property, various additional superior products such as household services are also provided to help consumers' needs in their daily needs. This marketplace from PT ABC has reached the adoption stage and has been downloaded by thousands of users. This marketplace has an open innovation model in its technology development, so various reviews from users may become the basis for improving and developing existing applications. Through the results of data scrapping from the review sample, it was found that as many as 31% of users were still dissatisfied with using existing applications. In addition, out of 100 existing reviews, as many as 44% consisted of negative reviews. Thus, the reviews and results of the innovation analysis form the basis for preparing the SWOT matrix for designing corporate strategy. Where, one of them is still the need for various improvements to features according to the needs of users, starting from ensuring the feature does not have errors, providing C2C features so that service providers directly connect with customers, refund system features when orders are canceled, and features that are connected to Google maps to facilitate service providers to the location of consumers. The drawback of this research is that it has not examined how to determine the most priority strategy to be carried out in the development of this product. It is hoped that future research can do this with an approach that integrates SWOT with Multi-Criterion Decision Making (MDCM).","a case study pt abc in indonesia sayyidah maulidatul afraah1, wahyudi sutopo2, renny rochani3 1master program of industrial engineering department, universitas sebelas maret 2centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology, universitas sebelas maret 2,3research group industrial engineering and techno-economic, universitas sebelas maret 1,2,3surakarta 57126, indonesia sayyidahmaulidatula@student.uns.ac.id, wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id, rennyrochani@staff.uns.ac.id",
18,Identification And Analysis Of Barriers To The Adoption Of  Blockchain Technology In The Logistics Industry,"the global logistics industry is facing increasing complexity, making effective logistics management crucial for reducing costs and gaining a competitive edge. blockchain technology emerges as a potential solution, enhancing supply chain transparency and traceability for thailand's logistics sector. however, understanding implementation challenges is crucial before investing in blockchain. this study analyzes obstacles using the index of item objective congruence (ioc) technique and expert opinions. the findings identify seven significant barriers: lack of awareness, lack of trust, lack of government support, lack of top management support and organizational policy, collaboration and network establishment issues, lack of operational standards, and technical challenges. the lack of government support ranks highest, highlighting the need for early consideration of regulatory standards and policies. these findings provide valuable guidance for organizations aiming to embrace digital transformation through blockchain implementation.","logistics, barriers","This study has identified and analyzed the barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology in the logistics industry in Thailand. Initially, a preliminary list of barriers was created by reviewing relevant literature covering various industries. The significant barriers that fit the specific circumstances of the logistics industry in Thailand were validated using the IOC technique through interviews with experts from both academic and industry sectors who possess experience in logistics and blockchain technology in Thailand. From the preliminary list of 14 barriers, seven remained significant based on their average IOC scores exceeding 0.5. They include lack of awareness (B1), lack of trust (B2), lack of government support (B5), lack of top management support and organizational policy (B6), issues with collaboration and network establishment (B8), lack of operational standards for blockchain (B10), and technical challenges (B11). The findings provide valuable guidance for Thai logistics companies interested in implementing blockchain technology, enabling them to address the identified barriers and enhance the effectiveness of their processes. Notably, government support emerged as the most concerning barrier among the experts, as indicated by the highest IOC index score. This suggests that appropriate regulatory standards, government policies, legal permissions, and digital policies should have been carefully considered from the early stages of implementation. 142","maneerat tangsakul and panitas sureeyatanapas* department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, khon kaen university khon kaen, thailand maneerat.ta@kkumail.com, panisu@kku.ac.th","References

19,Safe Evacuation Routes In Inundated Situations:  Assessment Of A Lowland District,"finding a safe evacuation route is important in the event of an accident or natural disaster. along with the climate change in recent years, torrential rains have become more occasional than before in both urban and rural areas. intensive and continuing rainfall may lead to disasters such as landslides and inundations. even if a single point on an evacuation route is inundated or critically damaged, then the route is unavailable and the evacuees who were planning to use it must find another route. in addition, in lowland districts in urban areas, where a large number of local people reside, might rush on limited available roads, particularly when a mandatory evacuation is alerted. this may raise another type of risk by excessive human flow or traffic congestion. most hazard maps are created according to geographical elevations, which quantifies the extent of flood risk, typically in terms of inundation depth. those kinds of maps may be useful for averting or mitigating property damage, while it is not tied with safeness of evacuation routes. in the case of an inundation in lowland areas, a large number of roads in the vicinity of rivers would become inundated and unavailable. this type of temporal risk due to congestion has not been considered to date. this study along this line considers both geographical elevations and availability of roads. a lowland district in eastern tokyo, adachi city, is focused on for an assessment. empirical findings highlight the impact of traffic congestion and isolation of flooded areas.","inundation, congestion, evacuation","In this study, congestion calculations were conducted to create flood inundation maps. The main purpose of creating this map is to avert encountering accidents and delays in evacuation due to excessive human flow. The outlet may serve as new hazard maps. The results of the congestion computation indicate that even the impact by narrow streets is noticeable because the shortest routes are the most congested than the main streets. People who are familiar with minor roads around the area, such as local residents, can rush into shortcuts that have a higher risk of human and/or traffic accidents. Instead, evacuating using arterial road could avoid accidents associated with human flow. If the results of this study will be used as hazard maps, only the simulated congestion may be opened to public. The flow of people will be dispersed as evacuees reach their destinations, avoiding the routes with thicker lines with their judgment. In addition to the obtained inundation maps, it is necessary for each individual to be aware of existing hazard maps published by local governments. Non-flooded roads will help people avoiding from detour by encountering flooded areas, and will aid them to evacuate efficiently without increasing human flow. Future work may take into account data such as population distribution, road width, and number of lanes. Experiments using a more realistic number of roads may be conducted to obtain more detailed results.","in eastern tokyo ko inoue graduate school of science and engineering hosei university, tokyo 184-8584, japan ko.inoue.9j@stu.hosei.ac.jp daiki ito lts, inc., tokyo 107-0051, japan daiki.ito.1008@gmail.com daiki okamura toho system science co., ltd., tokyo 112-0002, japan okamudaiki@gmail.com hiroyuki goto department of industrial and systems engineering hosei university, tokyo 184-8584, japan",

Based on the technical aspect of the study, the bagasse was a material that can be used for the body of the pencil. On the other hand, processed air dust was also an effective material for charcoal lead. Moreover, MaxIEma was successful in entering the competitive market through its introductory pencil product. Based on the survey of 156 respondents, 94.2% of them are willing to buy the product even if the price is higher than the existing charcoal pencil in the market. It also has a 1-year and 7-month payback period, which is within the 5-year range payback period to be accepted as financially feasible. Therefore, with the technical, market, and financial aspects of CoalAsse being feasible, MaxIEma was concluded by the proponents to be a successful and viable company.","jan patricia r. diamonon*, trixczia z. salinas, jea pierre b. san juan, elijah o. senia, kervin c. taoatao, and jaypy t. tenerife department of industrial engineering, college of engineering and architecture technological institute of the philippines, quezon city, philippines *qjprdiamonon@tip.edu.ph, qtzsalinas@tip.edu.ph, qjpsanjuan@tip.edu.ph, qeosenia@tip.edu.ph, qkctaoatao01@tip.edu.ph, jaypy.tenerife@tip.edu.ph *corresponding author",
21,Improving Production Efficiency For   Precast Concrete Slabs,"this research aims to study the production process and improve the production efficiency of a precast concrete floor company in pathum thani province, thailand. the research seeks to help the company improve and enhance its production efficiency by using pareto charts to identify problems and employing a why-why analysis to determine the root causes. the ecrs principle is then applied to address the identified issues and facilitate process improvement. based on the current research, the main problems identified are as follows: production efficiency is not reaching its full potential with an average production rate of 26,460.22 square meters, employee health is affected by work fatigue due to long working hours, averaging 10.95 hours per day, and labor costs amount to an average of 231,841.90 baht per month. after implementing the ecrs and modifying the work procedures, the research indicates that the production efficiency has improved, with an average monthly production rate of 29,973.82 square meters. additionally, the average daily working hours have decreased by 7.78 hours, and labor costs have been reduced to 199,825.50 baht per month. the percentages are as follows: 1) production efficiency increased by 10.88%, 2) working time decreased by 19.67%, and 3) labor cost decreased by 13.80%.","the pareto chart, ecrs: eliminate, combine","The results of improving production efficiency for precast concrete slabs can be summarized as follows: 1. The production line workflows have been eagerly anticipated, but unfortunately, they have resulted in high cycle times and significant production wastage. 2. One strategy for enhancing the production process is modifying each team's attendance time, dramatically shortening wait times. To maintain consistent production efficiency, this modification presents a problem regarding job fatigue. 3. To enhance production, one strategy is to invest in additional capital machinery. This investment can reduce time and decrease the number of employees required, from 21 individuals to 16. Consequently, the wage difference can be allocated towards accounting for the machine's payback period. 1.5 Discussion The popularity and high demand for concrete slabs, the research company's best-selling product, led to the start of this study. Internal company conversations were held to investigate how better to address consumer expectations in response to this market demand. The researcher, therefore, concentrated on increasing manufacturing effectiveness, resulting in an astounding output of about 29,973.82 square meters. The company's ability to better manage production parameters and, as a result, better satisfy consumer demand increases due to this greater efficiency. Additionally, the company's competitive position is strengthened by this greater efficiency, which boosts revenue generation. Suggestion 1. All the recorded data in this study have been collected from actual operations, allowing for more accurate and insightful analysis. 2. The ability of the workers to satisfy the production capacity means that the production process still depends on their talents. Their knowledge and skill are essential for the production process to run well. 3. Further research can be conducted to explore the possibility of reducing the number of employees by leveraging additional capital machinery in other processes. The business can increase production efficiency and possibly lessen its dependency on manual labor by finding areas where automation or mechanization can be used. This line of inquiry has the potential to raise output, reduce costs, and boost operational efficiency. he percentages are as follows. Details Before improvement After improvement Percentage Production efficiency 87.50 % 98.38 % More 10.88 % Working time 10.95 hours/day 8.73 hours/day Reduce 19.67 % Labor cost reduction 231,841.93 199,825.48 Reduce 13.80 % From the conclusions shown in above table, the researchers and the administrators There is a tendency to continually improve efficiency. It will take up the work process. In this research further and continuously record the results for consideration in future improvements All work is a new approach. which may take time to collect additional information After that, the company will continue to operate. 168","theeradon chulsom system engineering program, school of industrial engineering institute of engineering, suranaree university of technology, nakhon ratchasima province, thailand m6401177@sut.ac.th *jongkol srithorn system engineering program, school of industrial engineering institute of engineering, suranaree university of technology, nakhon ratchasima province, thailand *corresponding author: jongkol@sut.ac.th","References

27,This Content Is Internal. Industrial Wastewater Treatment In Latin America And,"this research seeks to disseminate the different methods for wastewater treatment in different industries in latin america and europe, as well as the most used ones. according to the literature reviewed, a large percentage of industrial wastewater is not treated, especially in latin america, causing a negative impact on the ecosystem. there are different methods for the treatment of industrial wastewater; however, most of the research on industrial wastewater treatment focuses on the study of a single treatment method. the methodology used was the systematic literature review, 5 categories and 10 subcategories of study were formed to analyze 30 articles published between 2015 and 2020. as the main result, it was obtained that green technologies, such as the wetlands method and use of microalgae, were the most studied in the last five years. the main limitation of this study was the lack of information regarding industrial sectors other than textile and food, so it is suggested to do future research focusing on sectors not yet studied, such as automotive, metalworking, agroindustrial, among others.","wastewater, methods, industrial sector","The purpose of this study was to analyze the most commonly used methods for wastewater treatment in different industries in Latin America and Europe. Among the main results of the study, with respect to literary production, it is observed that there were more articles published in the years 2019 and 2020. Also, the main methods used for wastewater treatment in the industrial sector were wetlands, ozonation, use of microalgae, coagulation and flocculation, as they are methods that have been studied more than once. On the other hand, the main contribution of this research is to provide knowledge about the most efficient and sustainable methods used for wastewater treatment so that companies in any industrial sector can apply them in their processes. This will contribute to the continuous improvement of the industry by reducing costs and pollution of the aquatic environment significantly. Finally, the main limitation of the present study was the limited availability of open access articles and the lack of information on industrial sectors other than the textile and food sectors, for which reason it is suggested that future recommendations be made focusing on factors that have not yet been studied.","europe: methods and applications. systematic review of literature gianfranco julinho hidalgo salhuana, valeria paola hip salazar and luis jesús córdova aguirre faculty of engineering and architecture industrial engineering career university of lima lima, peru 20162124@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20162128@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, lcordova@ulima.edu.pe",
28,A Study Of Technopreneur Ship On Market Penetration  And Product Development,"the use of renewable energy to minimize the current impacts of climate change has become a global issue that has captured the world's attention. the increasing concentration of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, in various sectors such as transportation, industry, and others, has led society to start harnessing renewable energy in their daily lives. the utilization of renewable energy is closely tied to the role of batteries as energy storage devices. apart from being used in electric vehicles, batteries can also be utilized in power generation systems, information technology, and other applications. this has resulted in a wide and diverse battery ecosystem. these conditions require battery manufacturers to continuously innovate and develop products to meet market demands while considering the preferences of buyers. in general, buyers desire batteries that possess certain criteria, such as long lifespan, high capacity, fast charging, affordable prices, environmental friendliness, and recyclability. however, creating products that meet these buyer preferences still requires further research and support from relevant parties, primarily due to the constraint of high prices of lithium-ion battery raw materials, which consequently affects battery prices. this study aims to provide an overview of product and business analysis for the development of lithium-ion batteries in pt. batex, utilizing the technopreneur ship model, swot analysis, and business model canvas (bmc). from this research, it can be concluded that the technopreneur ship model plays a significant role in the development of products and businesses.","lithium-ion battery, innovation system, technopreneur ship, swot analysis 231","In the era of technological advancements, the ecosystem of lithium-ion battery users is expanding, necessitating continuous innovation in lithium battery products. However, the development of lithium-ion batteries using technopreneurship, business model canvas, and SWOT analysis approaches poses its challenges. This is primarily due to the cost of raw materials, particularly nickel, which is still relatively high, resulting in batteries being less affordable for the general public. Innovations in lithium-ion batteries need to align with customer requirements, such as affordability, high quality, large capacity, long lifetime, and others.

33,Implementation Of Roboeoc (Automated Incident  Management System) To Human Centric Incident,"by reducing mean time to recovery (mttr) companies can minimize the duration of system outages and restore services promptly, thereby reducing the impact on the business. typically, in a contact centers or it service desk environment, once the ticket has been tagged in critical status, a serious issue is identified and defined as a problem (e.g., bug or incident, not an enhancement request), this could impact a client or trial’s workflow to the point where existing or new revenue is at risk. this research conducted a case study of an actual it service desk company based in manila, philippines on how they handled “critical tickets” due to system-wide outages or unexpected downtime of software products. the identified causes of high mttr that were based on the data of fiscal year 2022 were the primary basis. the identified root cause is the following: (1) not meeting the required service level agreement (sla) for a minimum average handling time of 15 mins. (2) promptness of the scheduled eoc in acknowledging and responding to emergency critical system alerts. (3) availability of dedicated software dev engineers / product specialists from a different region to respond to critical paging alert. based on the identified causes, the study proposed two major solutions to address the uncontrolled mttr in responding to critical tickets. first, the enhancement of the current customer relationship management (crm) user interface (ui) by conducting usability testing based on the (iso 9241-11) metrics. the sum results of enhanced crm ui give 6.97 higher compared to the existing crm design. the effectiveness improved for getting 100% quality, the efficiency having 90.45% quality, and the user-satisfaction garnering 90.67%. second, is the implementation of roboeoc for full automation of the paging alerts system replaces the eoc as the main personnel that responds to/acknowledges the ticket once it was tagged as critical. this brings a well-automated paging of the concerned team (on-call software engineers / product specialists) based on the product that was used to file the ticket. roboeoc also features “squadcast-on call scheduling”. this feature is a way to see who is in charge and when they oversee a specific critical ticket. a workflow simulation using arena was also performed to test the newly proposed workflow if it will do a significant change in lowering the mttr and handling time of engineers/specialists.",roboeoc,"The System problem being studied in this paper is the Incident Management workflow of FDI in responding to critical incidents due to unplanned or unexpected outages or system-wide issues that affect the functionality and reliability of the software products. The gathered data was from Fiscal year 2022 (January 2022 to December 2022) wherein 220 reported tickets have been escalated to critical and it accumulated 1899.97 total hours of downtime and an overall MTTR of 8.64. Moreover, an interview and survey of the stakeholders involved in responding to critical tickets give more clarity for the main causes of high-resolution time (Mean Time to Recovery) for each critical ticket. The cause for the Tech Support Tier 1 not to meet the SLA of 15 mins in handling per incident is due to poor usability of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, 89% of Class “A” identified tickets can’t be fixed by Tech Support Tier 1 and requires functional escalation for the Software development and Product team to fix. Last Fiscal Year data shows that 26% of Class “A” identified tickets can’t be resolved by Tier 2 as well and will be tagged as critical for functional escalation. In addition, ‘Class A’ tickets requires collaboration with multiple users and IT professional of affected firms or companies, and immediate functional are required for the On-call Engineers and Specialist to respond. This brings the idea for this study to measure the current CRM UX Usability and create a new tagging for Class “A” incidents that will allow Tech Support Tier 1 to escalate a ticket to critical directly for the Functional Escalation team, using automated paging alerts. The proposed implementation of RoboEOC “Transforms Human Centric Incident Management System to Automation”, before the EOC will need to pull up an Excel Sheet online to verify who the On-call Engineers for the specific issues/product that needs to page to be called out. This consumes more minutes/hours, most especially if the primary scheduled on-call is not responsive and the EOC will need to call out the manager to assign a new responder, or the manager himself/herself can take over. Another highlight for RoboEOC is the “Squadcast-On call scheduling”, this is an embedded software, that will allow a few administrators to check who is on-call each day, week, or month. The Emergency On-Call Engineers (human) will be replaced by the RoboEOC (automation) on the new workflow, the Emergency On-Call Engineers will not be expected to be the main and initial responder now when the tickets have been tagged to Critical, however, they can still monitor the logs, event viewer, and be part of the creation postmortem if needed. The current and proposed system was run in arena simulation and the results are shown in Table 10. The table shows that the proposed system drastically reduces the number of hours for acknowledging and for the initial investigation of critical incidents. The Arena simulation was able to show that the proposed system of improving the incident management for lower MTTR for critical tickets can reduce the average completion time by at least 96.24% and reduce the average waiting time of 97.81% for the ticket to be resolved.

34,Optimizing Location Of Public Electric Vehicle   Charging Station For Electric Motorcycles:,"in a few years, electric vehicles will transition to vehicles that are massively used in transportation activities in order to reduce carbon footprint. the indonesian government is committed to achieving the ‘net-zero emission’ target by 2060. in its implementation, the existence of electric motor charging infrastructure such as charging stations is one of the critical factors in the electric vehicle adoption program. consumers will feel anxious if their vehicle runs out of battery in the middle of their journey before reaching their destination. therefore, this study focuses on determining the location of charging stations in surakarta city, central java, indonesia which is targeted to be an effective strategy in providing a large initiation impact on emission reduction in central java province. this research takes into account the placement of locations that are suitable for electric motor users so that the utility of charging stations is optimal and able to serve electric motor users in surakarta city with the minimum travel cost. the method used is it applies optimization model: a mixed integer linear programming (milp) model to find the optimal locations for new charging stations that can maximize the coverage of the demand. this study uses user data, travel routes, and candidate charging station location points as data initiation for optimization models. the optimization is run to determine the most optimal solution for location of charging stations that consider electric motor users’ travel costs so that the demands can be met well.","electric motorcycle, charging stations, location","A supply chain network model has been devised to address the placement of electric vehicle charging stations within Surakarta City. This model is executed with the incorporation of several crucial factors, including the travel routes undertaken by electric motorcycle users across the city, the distribution of public facilities, population density data per neighborhood, and the identified potential charging station locations. Through this comprehensive model, invaluable insights are furnished to the local government, aiding them in making well-informed decisions regarding the optimal positioning of E-Motorcycle charging stations. Nevertheless, it's essential to acknowledge a limitation inherent in this model. Namely, the current model does not encompass variables linked to the behavior of electric motorcycle users. As such, further research endeavors should address these limitations by employing a dynamic simulation model. Such an approach would allow for the inclusion of factors like queuing and charging time, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy and effectiveness in determining the locations for Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (PEVCS). This refinement would offer a more holistic perspective and contribute to the model's applicability and real-world relevance.

35,Vulnerability Indicators On The Operation Of Electric  Motorcycle Battery Swapping Station,"the use of electric motorcycle-battery swapping stations (em-bss) is one of the efforts to accelerate the adoption of electric motorcycles in indonesia. the em-bss system can be viewed as a digital supply chain (dsc) that utilizes internet of things (iot) technology to carry out system activities. the system certainly deals with the issue of supply chain operational vulnerability, which is a concern for supply chain practitioners today. a causal inference approach is used to estimate the supply chain operational vulnerability level. the first step in using the causal inference approach is to create a structural causal model based on the expert knowledge domain. structural causal modeling started with identifying vulnerability indicators: consequences, drivers, and threat sources. the vulnerability indicator on the em- bss system obtained 12 vulnerability performance indicators as consequences, 21 vulnerability drivers, and four potential threat sources.",causal inference,,"yusuf priyandari a doctoral student at the industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, indonesia. priyandari@ft.uns.ac.id wahyudi sutopo industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, and industrial engineering and techno-economics research group (rite) surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id muhammad nizam electrical engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret, and centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology, universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, indonesia muhammad.nizam@staff.uns.ac.id hendro wicaksono school of business, social & decision sciences, constructor university, campus ring 1, bremen, 28759, germany hwicaksono@constructor.university",
36,Ecotourism Village Recognition Strategy Using Tourism  Production Function Development Model,"the development of a tourist village is one of the solutions to drive the regional economy and a realization of the master plan for tourism development. this has prompted the government to target as many as 244 tourist villages by 2024. one strategy in this development is through a potential assessment related to the level of readiness of the tourist village. in this regard, this research focuses on designing an assessment measuring instrument from wonorejo village, which has a lot of natural potentials, but its development has not been directed and runs effectively. the novelty of this research is to design an assessment measuring instrument using the criteria in the director general of forest protection and nature conservation guidelines of 2003 related to the assessment of natural tourism potential and central java governor regulation no. 53 of 2019 regarding the guidelines for assessing tourist villages. the two guidelines are then merged into a tourism model according to the principle of the tourism production function from smith (1994), which views tourism as a product so that all supporting elements such as resources and facilities can be considered explicitly and outputs in the form of services and experiences are obtained in a structured manner. the input for this assessment is based on a survey of the relevant stakeholders. based on the results of the assessment, a total value of 59% was obtained, which indicates that wonorejo village is included in a developing tourism village. then the variables were selected cumulatively based on the lowest achievement which is intermediate output included 10 sub-variables which became the basis for developing strategy recommendations.","tourism village, nature tourism, potential, assesment criteria","The measurement tool is designed using research variables that include the assessment variables for tourism villages based on Central Java Governor Regulation No. 53 of 2019 and the Guidelines for ADO-ODTWA (Tourism Destination Area-Natural Resource Conservation Area) issued by the Directorate General of Conservation of Natural Resources in 2003. The framework or model used to map these regulations is the Tourism Production Function, as proposed by Smith in 1994.The assessment value for the readiness of Wonorejo Village to become a natural tourism village is 60%, while the assessment value as a natural tourism village itself is 59%. This means that if Wonorejo Village applies and is accepted by the Karanganyar Regency Government, it will be classified as a developing tourism village. The proposal is made to increase the readiness level of Wonorejo Village for registration as a natural tourism village and to elevate its tourism village category to an advanced level. The proposal to enhance the readiness level for registration involves creating technical documents that have not been fulfilled, such as tourism potential documents and a Disaster Management Plan (RPB). Meanwhile, the proposal to upgrade the category from a developing tourism village to an advanced tourism village can be achieved by improving the achievement values of the sub-variables in the assessment. Based on the percentage achievements represented by the radar diagram, the lowest value is found in the Intermediate Output process. Within this process, there are a total of 10 sub-variables that require improvement. This proposal is analyzed using the 5W+1H method to facilitate stakeholders in making decisions. 322","and 5w+1h approach 1brahmastya artanto, 2roni zakaria raung, 3fakhrina fahma 1undergraduate student of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering 2,3staff of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering sebelas maret university surakarta, indonesia brahmastya.artanto@student.uns.ac.id, ronizakaria@staff.uns.ac.id, fakhrinafahma@staff.uns.ac.id","References

41,An Integrated Network Design And Inventory Optimization  Model For A Perishable Supply Chain Toward,"for many items, decisions related to supply chain management have not been an easy task. it is then much more complex for perishable items than the other. besides cost-efficiency, other factors, such as customer expectation and product freshness, have significant contributions to competitive advantages and business’s reputation. in other words, it would be flawed to care about either cost or profit ignoring other objectives. a multi-objective model for such items is, thus necessary. in this regard, this study introduces an integrated network design and inventory optimization model considering a perishable supply chain from a sustainable perspective. the mathematical model is to maximize profit, minimize the freshness loss of products at the point of demand fulfillment, and minimize the solid waste stress of the supply chain. in the result analysis, a numerical case is used to demonstrate the model utilization and the decision- making process. max-min operator is to solve a multi-objective model. the model resulting shows tradeoffs among the objectives. additionally, decision-makers can observe influences of the environment and society along with the economy on supply chain-related decisions, and vice versa.","network design, perishable items",,"sustainable development kim cuc vo thi, thi nguyen truong, thuy nguyen thi le, and can nguyen van faculty of industrial management can tho university can tho city, vietnam vtkcuc@ctu.edu.vn, ntthi@ctu.edu.vn, ntlethuy@ctu.edu.vn, vancan@ctu.edu.vn",
42,Integrated Lean And Tpm Model To Increase The Level Of  Service In A Plastics Company In Peru.,"in recent years, plastic has been part of the value chain of many different products, becoming a final consumer good. the enormous value of the plastics industry is beneficial for those who are part of the chain, reflected in the enormous figure of 1 trillion dollars a year, that is, 5% of the total trade of goods worldwide. this research is oriented to examine 3 tools to achieve a new model to optimize and improve the level of service, due to late delivery times and poor quality identified as the main problems within the company studied. the proposed model uses tools such as: improvement of mold change time through the smed engineering tool, improvement of the organization and production tools through the 5s engineering tool and improvement of operational efficiency under a total productive maintenance approach obtaining an improvement for the company. achieving an integrated model to improve the level of service that is suitable to be replicated in manufacturing companies.","lean, tpm, service level, smed","After the present study, it is concluded that the application of Lean Manufacturing methods can lead to the improvement in the improvement of production process times in a company of the plastic sector. An improvement is evidenced in the final indicators compared to the initial ones. The service level went from 56% to 90.4%, surpassing the target service level. Through the use of the Pareto diagram and the analysis of causes, it became evident that the two main causes of the low level of service were the late delivery time with a percentage of 71% and the low quality with 22%. When analyzing the main root causes, it was concluded that the production area was affected by high unproductive times caused mainly by the delay in mold changes, as well as the disorder and lack of organization in the work area. Therefore, with the improvement proposal using the Lean methodology and TPM in the simulation, it was possible to improve the mold change times in the production area where the heating and blowing process is performed, obtaining a result of 43.07 minutes compared to the initial situation of 59.06 minutes, all this in relation to the unproductive time within the area improved with the SMED tool theoretically. The correct application of the 5s in the production area would achieve an improvement in the organization and distribution of work tools in the area achieving a cycle time of 152.58 minutes versus the initial situation of 164.69 minutes, according to the scientific articles investigated.

43,Six Sigma Application To Reduce Variance In Turnaround  Time For Fertilizer Analysis,"central analytical laboratory, johor plantations berhad implemented the six sigma (ss) approach to obtain performance in terms of cost, quality, and productivity. this paper aims to implement ss in the laboratory to mitigate the high variance in turnaround time (tat) of fertilizer analysis. the dmaic (define-measure-analyse-improve- control) strategy was employed as the model of problem-solving during the ss execution. a team compromising of 2 chemists, 12 analysts, and 5 general workers was formed to carry out the project. in this project, we found that multiple variables could contribute to the high numbers of variance in the tat of the fertilizer analysis. in a phased manner, the team under the guidance of the chemist as the team leader has been able to utilize the power of simple tools such as process mapping, ishikawa diagram, sipoc, affinity diagram, and others, to find root causes and take corrective actions during implementations process. consequently, there was a significant reduction in the variance of tat, decreasing from 2.741 days in 2021 and 2.433 days in 2022 to 1.420 days. the mean tat also exhibited positive improvement, decreasing from 6.956 days in 2021 and 2.433 days in 2022 to a new mean of 3.018 days.","lean, six sigma, turnaround time","This project demonstrates the effective application of the Six Sigma DMAIC strategy in reducing the variance of the turnaround time (TAT) from 2.741 days (2021) and 2.433 days (2022) to 1.420 days. Additionally, there was a significant improvement in the mean TAT, which decreased from 6.956 days (2021) and 5.023 days (2022) to 3.018 days. The implementation of DMAIC tools within the framework of the Six Sigma methodology has played a vital role in improving TAT performance. Four underlying causes of high variance in TAT were identified during the process, and six solutions were implemented to address these issues. Furthermore, three control procedures were executed to ensure the sustained effectiveness of the implemented solutions over time. This study has demonstrated that the application of Six Sigma is a practicable strategy to improve laboratory TAT and that can be used for other quality improvement in similar settings.","mohd kamaruddin jaffar chemist, r&d and agricultural services, johor plantations berhad, central analytical laboratory, johor plantations berhad, kota tinggi, johor, malaysia. jpcal@johorplantations.com azianti ismail associate professor, smart manufacturing research institute (smri), universiti teknologi mara, 40450 shah alam, selangor, malaysia azianti106@uitm.edu.my",

47,Lpg Cylinder Delivery Authentication Using Artificial  Intelligence In Last Mile Delivery,"last mile delivery (lmd) relates to all activities in delivering the product to the end customer in the supply chain. safe, secure, and on-time delivery of products to customers are the primary objectives of businesses rendering lmd services. lpg cylinder distribution in india is one such business that provides lmd to its subscribed customers through delivery agents employed by distributors. despite being an essential commodity, there is no system to confirm or authenticate the delivery. this absence of the system required for authentication causes a rise in black-market deviation, negatively affecting the distributor's reliability and customer satisfaction. to the best of our knowledge, there is no research towards developing an authentication system for delivery confirmation in lmd of lpg cylinders. against this backdrop, this study proposes a secure, reliable, cost-effective delivery authentication system (das) using artificial intelligence and image metadata. the proposed das has an image classifier module built using convolution neural network (cnn) and a metadata processing module to extract geolocation. a sample image dataset of an lpg cylinder and objects which looks similar to an lpg cylinder was used to train the image classifier. a prototype das with mobilenet v2 cnn architect is developed using python and keras library. with the data augmentation technique, we could train our cnn with a small dataset and prevent it from underfitting. the transfer learning technique helped our cnn to generalize well on the study data without overfitting and produced an accuracy score of 97%. the expected outcome of this study is to reduce black-market deviation cases and to improve the distributor's reliability as well as the customer satisfaction.","lpg cylinder, last mile delivery, if disrupted","This study addresses the issue of black-market deviation in the LMD of LPG cylinders in India by proposing a prototype DAS. The proposed DAS is developed using Artificial Intelligence and Image Metadata. The Image Classifier model was developed using the transfer learning technique with MobileNetV2 neural network architecture.

48,A Comparative Analysis Of Heuristic Methods For   Facility Location And Allocation Of Buses To Facilities,"the city buses operating in the urban road transportation systems (urts) cover various non-revenue generating distances without carrying passengers. one such distance travelled from a facility in the early morning to starting point of first trip and ending point of last trip back to the facility in the late evening is the 'dead kilometers or mileage' (dk). since the mileage per unit of the fuel varies, minimizing dk cost (dkc) associated with allocation of city buses to facility (acbf) problem is an ideal objective than minimizing dk. this dkc is directly affected by the location of the facilities and assignment of each of the buses to a specific facility. due to continuous growth of any metro-city and commuters of city- buses, the number of city-buses need to be increased. further, due to environmental and logistic reasons, a few existing facilities need to be closed. due to this there is a need to open new facilities. for closing the existing facility(s), a salvage cost is incurred and for opening new facility(s), fixed cost is incurred. so, in any urts, there is facility location (fl) problem for opening and/or closing facility(s). further, fl and acbf problems are inseparable as dkc is the common cost affecting the decisions associated with each of these decision problems. so, this study considers the integrated decision problem on fl and acbf (fl-acbf). accordingly, the focus of this research is to (a) identify the best-known heuristics from literature for minimizing simultaneously fixed cost, salvage cost, and dkc for fl-acbf; and (b) evaluate empirically the performance of identified heuristics for selecting efficient heuristic(s).",fixed cost,"This study considers a new objective for the decision problem: FL – ACBF of I-URTS to minimize the CCBOs. As this problem can be viewed as a special type of transportation problem, the best-known heuristic methods reported in the literature for the traditional transportation problem are considered to apply to the FL – ACBF problem and to understand the status of these heuristic methods. For this research objective, a numerical example is considered. The analysis of the results indicated that the best performing heuristic methods reported in the recent studies, for the traditional transportation problem, are not necessarily performing as best when we applied these for the special case of the transportation problem such as FL – ACBF problem!! Further, the performance analysis indicated that both the variants of existing heuristic method: RAM outperformed all the other heuristics for the FL – ACBF problem. These inferences motivate us to address all the listed limitations of the present study as immediate future activity.","in urban road transportation systems rupkatha ghosh and m. mathirajan department of management studies indian institute of science bangalore 560012, india rupkathag@iisc.ac.in, msdmathi@iisc.ac.in",

It also shows that the activities and discussions relevant to students' strands helped them gain appropriate knowledge to understand their strand's scope further and adequately utilize their skills in their field. Based on the ANOVA findings, the differences between the virtual work immersion’s reliability and comfort, as well as the graduates’ employment status and track alignment, are significant. It denotes that their experience during their training affects their perceptions and level of employability. On the other hand, the General Weighted Average (GWA) is the only statistically significant factor on the SHS graduates' ratings based on their perceptions, gained experience, level of employability, and level of choosing a college course after taking virtual work immersion. It also means that virtual work immersion affects their academic performance. The Pearson correlation analysis results suggest that the relationship between SHS gained experience from virtual work immersion on their level of employability and choosing a college program is statistically significant. The strengths of these relationships are strongly positive, indicating that as their gained experience improved, their level of employability and level of choosing a college course also enhanced. However, virtual work immersion is challenging for some due to continuous discussion on the webinar that causes long duration, a distraction from their homes, and poor internet connection.

52,Application Of Evolutionary Algorithms For Holding Force  Optimization Using Dynamic Models,"this paper presents unsupervised holding rule generation for a climbing robot bernoulli holding pad, based on evolutionary algorithms. dynamic variations in frictional coefficient of surface and robot state require adaptability on holding force, when combined with internal pad dynamics. a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (hea) combining operators from differential evolution, memetic algorithm and multi objective and open-ended evolution (monee) implementation was developed, tested and validated for augmenting robot pad dynamics in a dynamic environment, with the aim of reduction in pressure energy usage. different variable combinations established in literature were permuted and results observed in terms of solution standard and speed. comparative results showed the hea method produced better results than other algorithms in terms of solution quality and processing time. hence the work exhibited that hea can improve holding force adaptability by providing quickly a set of near optimum conditions for the climbing robot.","dynamic variations, bernoulli pad","This paper has presented a hybrid Evolutionary search algorithm combining Differential Evolution, Memetic Algorithm and MONEE Implementation. In MATLAB simulations, this algorithm has shown to develop optimum holding force significantly faster than the stand alone algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed hEA can improve fitness by providing quickly a set of near optimum conditions. The hEA based optimisation approach introduced combines established computing methods in a hybrid framework for combined internal adaptation and environment task driven optimisation of a climbing robot Bernoulli based holding pad. The framework consists of: 1. Objective function modelling based on the Derivative rule, 2. Fitness function value for parameter inclusion, 3. An evolutionary based hybrid optimisation algorithm and 4. MATLAB modelling and simulation. The framework has been implemented and tested in MATLAB. The results of the application presented show that the approach can find an optimal holding force and that the system parameters can be determined. The tests realized in this paper will now allow holding force design problems of the same class to be solved by using the best combination of operators found in this article. It is now also possible to move on to the next stage of the project and represent these findings in a suitable control scheme.","for a climbing robot rujeko masike lecturer department of industrial & manufacturing engineering harare institute of engineering harare, zimbabwe rujekom3@gmail.com karamjit kaur department of electronics & communication engineering amity university haryana gurgaon, india kkaur@ggn.amity.edu rajesh arora mechanical engineering department amity university haryana gurugaon, india rarora64@ggn.amity.edu s.n. sridhara vice chancellor hitts university chennai, india sridharasn1964@gmail.com",
53,"A Milp Model For Single Depot, Single Truck And Multiple  Drones For Last-Mile Delivery Problem","the high volume of daily e-commerce shipments in major urban areas require today’s technology of drones for last- mile delivery (lmd) of parcels. the traditional method of delivering parcels using trucks is time-consuming due to traffic congestion, impeding their timely delivery. on the other hand, drones can avoid traffic congestion by flying over road networks. however, drones have a limited flight endurance due to their battery capacity constraints. at the same time, trucks possess long-haul capabilities. hence, for achieving an efficient lmd, both trucks and drones should be integrated to offset each other’s disadvantages. this paper addresses one such truck-drone based last-mile delivery (td-lmd) problem. there are plenty of studies which have investigated td-lmd problem with different configurations. for our study, we examine the td-lmd problems involving single depot, single truck and multiple drones (sd-st-md) configuration. in the literature, various researchers have used mathematical models and heuristics to address this problem. in our study, we consider one mixed-integer linear programming (milp) model given in the existing literature for the td-lmd problem with sd-st-md configuration and relax one of their assumptions to give it a new dimension. in the process of extending the milp model, we also introduce the co2 emission cost along with the economic cost for optimizing the td-lmd problem. accordingly, the workability of the milp model is tested using a tiny numerical example and solved through developing a code in the python-milp solver module. further, the computational complexity is analyzed by increasing the number of nodes in the sd-st-md based td-lmd problem.","last-mile delivery, truck, drones, emission cost","In this study, we considered a single depot, a single truck and multiple drones (SD-ST-MD) configuration for a truck- drone based last-mile delivery (TD-LMD) problem. Due to the increasing environmental concerns, we considered minimizing the cost from an economic and environmental perspective as compared to the total completion time of delivery of TD-LMD. With this, the existing Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model in the literature is appropriately extended for the additional dimension considered in the problem configuration of TD-LMD problem. Then, the proposed MILP model was demonstrated by developing a suitable numerical example to reflect the problem configuration considered in this study. Further, the computational complexity of the proposed MILP model was analysed by increasing the number of delivery points. The computational complexity analysis clearly indicated that the simpler version of TD-LMD is computationally intractable to get an optimal solution. So, the TD-LMD problem requires an alternate method such as heuristic algorithm and this becomes the immediate future research issue for addressing TD-LMD problem considered in this study. 467","saloni jangid department of mathematics central university of rajasthan ajmer 305817, india salonijangid2002@gmail.com rupkatha ghosh and m. mathirajan department of management studies indian institute of science bangalore 560012, india rupkathag@iisc.ac.in, msdmathi@iisc.ac.in","References

54,Smart Contract-Based Rice Supply Chain Traceability:  Perspective Of Bangladesh,"bangladesh’s economy draws its main strength from the agriculture sector. rice is the staple food of the country, and is the most important crop in bangladesh’s agricultural sector. however, this sector is facing numerous challenges. the main challenge is proper tracking of agricultural products and ensuring payment after delivery. as the whole transaction process of products and money currently depends on third parties, both buyers and sellers use agents for delivery and payment of food. ultimately these agents add additional cost to the system. blockchain is a technology that can provide a remarkable solution for product traceability in agriculture and food supply chains. in this paper, we have conceptualized a smart contract-based agricultural system through which buyers and sellers can directly interact with each other. with leveraging the smart contract facility of blockchain, transactions among stakeholders can be recorded, and the need for intermediaries will be eliminated prevailing a central authority system. all transactions will be recorded in blockchain’s immutable ledger which provides a high level of transparency and traceability to the supply chain. furthermore, in this paper, we have provided data privacy protection solutions through cryptographic primitives and markle trees that can avoid enterprise privacy and sensitive data leakage. we have also shown cost analysis and performance analysis. we made our smart contract codes publicly available on github.","blockchain, ethereum, merkle tree","In previous years, the agricultural supply chain traceability network for rice was overlooked. Nowadays it has raised a public concern. To keep a record of specific information and database about the purchased product (rice) and its raw material status throughout the entire rice supply chain of Bangladesh. To conclude, we have tried to create a trusted Smart contract-based Blockchain traceability system to ensure transparent information flow between the stakeholders of the rice supply chain. Smart contracts were created to ensure proper product tracking and reduce the uncertainty regarding payment issues. This paper addressed issues of data storage, data integrity, low traceability of products, and lack of transparency in the transaction of funds and products of the rice supply chain of Bangladesh. We have focused on the issue of the lack of information technology use in the rice supply chain of Bangladesh and tried to overcome this problem with a Smart contract-based solution. cost, security and performance analysis was done based on testing and validating the Smart contracts. Any attempt to make the functions of the smart contract more optimized is likely to be made. This will reduce the Gas consumption of smart contracts. When Ethereum 2.0 is published, this can be made to reinforce the contracts. How product conditions can be verified with the help of decentralized consensus needs further analysis. Further analysis can be done on how to reverse a transaction through a smart contract when arrived product is damaged.","maliha rajwana haque, sadia tabassum department of industrial & production engineering rajshahi university of engineering & technology rajshahi, bangladesh m.rajwana@gmail.com, sadia.tabassum16022@gmail.com & khairun nahar asst. professor, department of industrial & production engineering rajshahi university of engineering & technology rajshahi, bangladesh khairun.nahar@ipe.ruet.ac.bd",

Firstly, it aimed to observe interactions between business environment, generic strategy, operations strategy, and business performance during COVID-19 in the Lebanese economy. Results indicated significant direct effects of each variable, with changing interactions based on other variables. Secondly, the study tested whether generic and operations strategies could mediate and significantly affect ENV and PER during COVID- 19. Partial mediation was seen between various strategies and performance. This suggests that cost leadership, differentiation, or focus strategies could be more effective under changing business environments. Results align with contingency theory, strategic management theory, and resource-based view theory. The study has limitations, including no funding and a small data sample (51 participants). Future research should explore these interactions further and consider additional variables like supply chain integration and innovation strategies.","in the lebanese industries ziad ghazal* mba graduate school of business lebanese american university beirut, lebanon ziad.ghazal@lau.edu abdulnasser kassar associate professor at adnan kassar school of business lebanese american university beirut, lebanon abdulnasser.kassar@lau.edu",
56,"A Study On Order Release Control Policies In Wafer  Fabrication Facility: A Review, Classification And","the manufacturing of semiconductor chips consists of a four-stage process: wafer fabrication or processing, sort or probe, assembly, and test. out of four stages, wafer fabrication, which necessitates a large amount of investment in plant and equipment, is probably the most complicated manufacturing process today. in addition, wafer fabrication complexity is caused by many factors, including unrelated parallel machines, batch machines, uncertain process yields, re-entrant process flows, random equipment failures, and process variability. maintaining a competitive advantage and remaining profitable in operational terms requires improvements in wafer fab performance. workload control (wc), a combination of order release control (orc) and dispatching control (dc), is employed to regulate the flow of orders through the wafer fab, and this is a promising technique to reduce the wafer’s processing cost and increase customer satisfaction by delivering products on time. particularly, orc is considered a critical operational control strategy in wafer fab as it controls the system's wip and meets due dates. hence, to properly understand orc policies, this study meticulously reviews the existing studies on orc in wafer fabrication. based on the literature analysis, the existing orc policies are classified considering eight dimensions that describe fundamental characteristics and logic behind the orc policies and possible suggestions are presented for future work. further, this study presents a discrete event simulation (des) based conceptual model framework for the performance assessment of any orc policies with various performance measures such as average cycle time, average throughput, wip level and number of tardy jobs. the proposed des model can capture the complexities in the wafer fabs, such as re-entrance, non-identical parallel machines, and rework, in a very effective manner. finally, the proposed framework is expected to improve the efficiency of the des model as it reduces the preparation time for input data and is also flexible to emulate random scenarios with uncertain processing times, product mix and product routes.",,,"conceptual simulation framework ragupathi t department of management studies indian institute of science bangalore, india mathirajan m department of management studies indian institute of science bangalore, india ragupathit@iisc.ac.in, msdmathi@iisc.ac.in",
57,"Monotonic Job Recommendation With Separated Features Kaito Hoshi And Takanari Seito, Hashi Yuichi,","in recent years, job recommender systems (jrss) have been developed to compute matching scores of workers for projects. however, their rss do not satisfy monotonicity. satisfying monotonicity is important because it is a matter of course for users. in this study, we propose a monotonic jrs. the conventional monotonic model guarantees monotonicity for one type of input value. however, there is no study on a monotonic model that guarantees monotonicity for two types of input data: workers and projects. our model can guarantee monotonicity for changes in two types of input data. our study is novel with respect to the jrs and monotonic model.","recommender system, deep learning, monotonicity","In this study, we proposed a JRS model that guarantees monotonicity. Our model makes predictions satisfying monotonicity for changes in two inputs, the worker and project. In the conventional monotonic model, it was not possible to maintain monotonicity against changes in two input values. By constraining the weights to be positive, we designed a feature extraction such that the higher the skill, the greater the feature. The matching score function was designed to determine the suitability by comparing the value of the two features. We mathematically proved that the proposed model satisfies monotonicity. As a result of the analysis, we confirmed that the prediction accuracy of the model is higher than the prediction of all 1s. Thus, the minimum degree of the accuracy is assumed to be guaranteed. In contrast, we confirmed that the proposed model is less accurate than the cut-off model. A future work will involve eliminating the difference in prediction accuracy between with and without monotonicity. Specifically, we envision that proposed model intends to increase the expressive power of feature extraction. Feature extraction of the model used in the experiment comprises a linear layer and an active function. We observe that the configuration is extremely simple. Previous studies on monotonic models involved complex models, such as the deep lattice network (DLN) (Seungil et al. 2017). These models are more expressive; thus, their accuracy is also higher. Replacing the construction of feature extraction from this construction to the DLN (or other complex monotonic model) will improve accuracy. 503","tatsuya izumi, shinji iizuka research and development dept. hitachi solutions east japan, ltd. miyagi, japan kaito.hoshi.fy@hitachi-solutions.com, takanari.seito.cw@hitachi-solutions.com, yuichi.hashi.wg@hitachi-solutions.com, tatsuya.izumi.hz@hitachi-solutions.com, shinji.iizuka.zt@hitachi-solutions.com","References

The major difference between continuous production processes and custom product processes is the rate of improvement due to complexity. The rate of change is much slower for custom production due to unique designs and complex processes, but it still decreases complexity. The same changes in high-volume/continuous production plants give much better results. While applying lean methodologies, only a few have been applied because some do not work, such as pull. It is difficult to apply pull in more customized settings due to different paints, customers, and procedures. Lean thinking always makes changes towards flexibility regardless of the size of the industry, but there will be a difference in applying lean to complex and non-complex industries, and the development rate will also be different.","dave olson1, naim islam2 and kuldeep agarwal2 1jones metal, inc., 3201 3rd ave., mankato, mn 56001 2department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology , minnesota state university, mankato, mn 56001, usa kuldeep.agarwal@mnsu.edu, naim.islam@mnsu.edu",

61,Using The Case-Based Reasoning-Yolo Approach For  Rapid And Effective Identification Of Bruises,"bruises can appear when blood vessels rupture, which can lead to the risk of blood leakage into the surrounding tissues. evaluation and detection of these symptoms, especially those related to health problems or accidents, are very important in medical environments. bruises can also serve as an alert sign of health problems that a medical evaluation is recommended and might be urgently needed. unfortunately, it can be very challenging for medical practitioners to appropriately identify and categorize bruises due to the complexity of the situations and many types of bruises. the main goal of this study is to promote the use of artificial intelligence (ai) in healthcare systems. it aims to help improve computer-aided practices by making use of an open-source algorithm such as yolov8 and incorporate it into a case-based reasoning (cbr) approach for fast and precise identification of bruises. in this study, we introduce an approach to this problem by using the cbr-yolo approach. the use of the cbr-yolo approach can help and support the decision-making practice. although bruises have many types and the same appearance, it can still provide recommendations and commentary on the bruises. this method can be useful in diagnosing patients in a timely manner.","yolo, decision-making","Integrated Case-Based Reasoning and YOLO have been applied together as an approach to diagnosis and identification of bruises. In this paper, we have proposed the CBR-YOLO approach for the identification of bruises. There is one process that differs from the original case-based framework (YOLO prediction process). The result of the CBR-YOLO approach is quite significant decision-making for practitioners in the healthcare setting.

62,A Case Study Of Healthcare Operations In Thailand'S  Government Administration Using Pattern Mapping,"by mapping patterns of prescription diversities from health administered standards, this study reveals prescription diversity among patients diagnosed with cancer in a rural area of thailand. the purpose of this study is to provide the groundwork for future research on the interaction between activity-related coverage and economic models of social health benefits. in order to understand how prescription variations affect patients, this study maps prescribing trends from electronic medical records to individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer symptoms. this study demonstrated how cloud computing and big data technologies may be effectively used to assist the transfer of data from local hospital databases to cloud databases. in actual cloud service implementations, this approach focuses on optimizing corresponding software performance and finance. despite the stated prescription standards, this study may indicate that judgments made by health services programs for the treatment of chronic illnesses are subject to influence. one factor contributing to system inefficiency has been identified as a lack of care coordination, particularly when tests and treatments are repeated because the results are not shared across providers. there are more than 1,000 preferred brand names and generic products for the treatment of chronic illnesses on the market for cancer therapies. this study utilizes multiple softwares to specify patterns of choices in order to prevent overprescribing and overdiagnosing because the list is triple-extended for non-preferred medications. the cost and profit associated with a drug's selection may be transformed into particular rules for programs managed by the health system. the results of this study suggested how recommendations specify medication orders for multiple coverage plans should be altered in order to uncover prescription trends in health administration programs, the association between benefit plan modification and reimbursement amount, as well as drug selection, dose, and manufacturer variability, were all quantified in the same illness using a regression model. the medical condition determines the amount per prescription, however the doctor may try to increase the dosage for the greatest possible benefit. the results are equivocal, but they also imply that alternative patient-type and brand selections result in better hospital benefit. the profitability of hospitals is significantly impacted by brand preference. the hospital's profit margins are larger when physicians are exposed to more brand alternatives, which may be the result of increasing brand rivalry. in the instance of hospitalization, the reimbursement index and the estimated dosage factor were both positive. according to this conclusion, more government reimbursements will result in a bigger profit margin for the hospital on each prescription. in order to comprehend the patterns of prescription for health services in thailand, it may be useful to define the efficiency in healthcare procedures.",,,"for the prescription procedure for cancer praowpan tansitpong assistant professor nida business school national institute of development administration (nida), thailand praowpan.tan@nida.ac.th",
63,Optimization Of Efficiency In A High-Traffic Fuel Station In  India Using Queuing Theory And Service Time Analysis,"this study aims to optimize the efficiency of a high-traffic fuel station in mumbai, india, by employing queuing theory and analyzing the service time distribution. data was collected from a station with four fuel nozzles during rush hours, including inter-arrival times, service times, waiting times, fuel types, and vehicle types. inter-arrival time data followed a poisson distribution, while the service time data for each nozzle was analyzed using various distributions. the analysis revealed that the weibull distribution provided the best fit for the service time data. this study utilized a multi-server queueing model (m/g/4) to calculate system utilization, waiting times, and the mean number of customers in the queue. according to the result, the model output was reasonably matched to observed data as the error percentage was found less than 20% for all output parameters. several recommendations were made to optimize the fuel station, including automation, analysis, and maintenance. practical implementation of low-budget modification and non-technical recommendations reduced the system’s waiting time by 22%. for long-term optimization, further data analysis and implementation of the recommendations are necessary. nevertheless, this study provided valuable insights for fuel station operators in india.",queuing theory,"An Indian fuel station with a high volume of traffic had been analyzed using queuing theory and service time analysis. Inter-arrival time data followed a Poisson distribution, while nozzle service times followed a Weibull distribution. Fuel station operations needed to be modeled with accurate service time distributions. This study used a multi-server queuing model (M/G/4) to calculate system utilization, waiting times, and the mean number of customers in queue. Fuel station data showed a reasonable match between model output and observed data, indicating its applicability. Several recommendations were made based on the analysis- to optimize pumping speed, implement a queue management system, train staff cross-functionally, and use automated data analysis, payments could be streamed. Optimized performance and minimize service disruptions could also be achieved through predictive maintenance practices. Implementation of selected recommendations reduced the waiting time by 22.1687%. As a result of using queuing theory and service time analysis, this study contributed to fuel station optimization knowledge for Indian fuel stations. Other fuel station operators from India, especially Mumbai, could use these insights to cut wait times, improve productivity, and enhance customer satisfaction.","pravin mahendra mishra industrial & systems engineering, northern illinois university, dekalb, illinois, usa pravinmishra114@gmail.com mobasshira zaman industrial engineering, arizona state university, tempe, arizona, usa mzaman4@asu.edu",
64,Management  Application Of Triangular Fuzzytopsis Method For,"the rapid growth in the indian construction industry has led to a need for efficient supply chain management and timely procurement of raw materials, particularly cement. choosing suppliers is crucial to project completion, so a robust and reliable process is essential. the study proposed an application of the triangular fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis) method to address conflicts and uncertainties in supplier selection. in this study, multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) is employed to evaluate and rank potential cement suppliers on various criteria such as quality, delivery time, reliability, after-sales support, reputation, experience, etc. for design hub, mumbai. the results consistently ranked acc, birla corporation, and india cement as top suppliers, even when reducing the set of criteria. hence, this method for selecting suppliers under uncertain conditions was demonstrated as reliable and effective. construction firms in india would be able to increase supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and execute projects more efficiently with this approach by combining fuzzy logic with mcdm not only for cement but also for other construction material purchasing. further exploration of fuzzy mcdm techniques was encouraged by these findings as this method of triangular fuzzy topsis provided a robust and practical solution for choosing cement suppliers, ultimately resulting in improved project outcomes.","fuzzy topsis, supplier in india",,"cement supplier selection for a construction firm in india mobasshira zaman industrial engineering, arizona state university, tempe, arizona, usa mzaman4@asu.edu pravin mahendra mishra industrial & systems engineering, northern illinois university, dekalb, illinois, usa pravinmishra114@gmail.com","References

68,Rmit Classification: Trusted  Unravelling Risks And Resonance In Service-Oriented,"purpose – this research examines risk management for service-oriented manufacturing supply chains via two stages, highlighting its differences from manufacturing. initially, the authors review earlier studies in order to pinpoint the distinctive characteristics of service-oriented manufacturing supply chains and identify prevalent risks. secondly, an empirical study in the construction field, which was heavily struck by the covid-19 pandemic, is conducted to thoroughly inspect the resonant effect of these risks on service-oriented manufacturing supply chain performance. design/methodology/approach – to validate the resonant effect mechanism, the theoretical model is compared to a newly created comparative model that encompasses the single effects of risks on supply chain performance. findings – 63% variance of service-oriented manufacturing supply chain performance was explained by the resonant effect model, compared with 46.3% in the comparative model. moreover, each risk exerts a more glaringly significant impact on supply chain performance, asserting the mechanism of the resonant influence. another noteworthy result involves the demand risk possessing a low effect on supply chain performance, thus reinforcing the superiority of service-oriented manufacturing supply chains. research limitations/implications – future studies should discover optimal “resonant” models aiming at anticipating worst-case scenarios and safeguarding their supply chain. practical implications – indubitably, reducing the mechanism of the resonant effect will centre on lowering the coefficient of “α,” thereby restricting/eliminating the link among risks. therefore, proceedings of the 4th asia pacific conference on industrial engineering and operations management ho chi minh city, vietnam, september 12-14, 2023 © ieom society international 612",,,"manufacturing supply chains tram nguyen, head of supply chain management program, faculty of business administration, ho chi minh city open university, ho chi minh city, vietnam (edit) an duong thi binh, lecturer and convenor, swinburne university of technology, melbourne, australia (edit) mohammadreza akbari, mba academic director (singapore) and senior lecturer, james cook university (edit) huy truong quang, rmit vietnam (edit) huytruong.quang@rmit.edu.vn",
69,Filtrar: A Canal Solid Waste Collector And   Compactor Machine,"this project aims to fabricate a scale model prototype of a machine that will serve as a waste collector and compactor for solid wastes that can efficiently prevent floods and preserve cleanliness. it will be an additional solution to reduce manual cleaning and the conventional use of nets to trap floating solid waste, which is unsafe for workers collecting garbage in canals. the proponents have considered different factors and options to determine the best possible features and the most feasible and reasonable design option. trade-off analyses such as technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (topis) using entropy and critic (the criteria importance through intercriteria correlation) and sensitivity analysis were also used to determine the best design option. among all the 18 design options considered by the proponents, the fabricated prototype was based on design option 11 with closeness coefficients (ci) of 0.75 (entropy) and 0.66 (critic). it utilized mild steel as the body frame material, the semi- automated mechanism, and an electric linear actuator compactor system. this design project has accomplished the set objectives through testing, iterations, and statistical analyses. furthermore, recommendations regarding the project's future improvements were provided, especially on its functions and features. these recommendations' main objective is to enhance the product's performance, durability, space utilization, holistic functionality, and lifespan.",topsis critic,"Using the TOPSIS Entropy and CRITIC weighting methods, the result shows that Design Option 11 was the best alternative to fabricate, garnering the highest Closeness Coefficients (Ci) of 0.75 and 066 respectively, among other design options. The proponents also conducted 15 trials to test the efficiency and productivity of the machine in terms of waste collection and compaction. The conveyor machine has an average speed of 153.31 seconds per 10 revolutions (one trial), given that there is no load or waste on the collector jaw. Succeeding, an average of 166.80 seconds is required when there is an increasing load (waste) from 1 kg to 20 kg accumulated per trial. It can also be seen in their average that there is a significant difference, and the load causes changes in the speed of the conveyor machine. It also indicates that there is a need for improvement in the motor power and load capacity used. Moreover, the proponents concluded that the machine could accumulate up to 194.24 kilograms of waste per hour. Compared to the data from the manual collection during the clean-up drive at Esteros in Metro Manila, the result shows a 1,439.17% increase. It is because the machine can accumulate 582.80 kg per three hours compared to a person with an average of 37.86 kg of waste. It means that the machine can help users save time since it can collect more waste continuously than manual collection since individuals have more time bottlenecks and allowances, such as fatigue, delay, and personal allowance. However, the speed of machine collection may still vary depending on the weight of solid waste. On the other hand, it is observed that the compactor machine speed changes from its initial speed of 127.23 seconds (without load) to an average of 116.90 seconds when the proponents tested it with 0.1 kg waste (combination of plastics and metal cans), which the time became faster. It might be due to no load being compacted, keeping the compactor machine continuing until it reaches the end side of the waste bin. Another factor is the machine's limited power capacity, which needs to be improved with higher motor power capacity. Human errors (such as late clicking of timestamp) might also be one of the factors why the time for with load is faster and varies than without load. Nonetheless, the speed of the compactor machine did not show a significant relationship to the combination of waste materials (plastics and metal cans) accumulated in terms of mass percentage. It also shows that speed is consistent using the different percentages of waste combinations and does not significantly affect the speed in 15 trials. In terms of battery life, both systems of the machine (compactor and collector systems) can utilize the full spread of 100% given that they are working alternately and a rate of 80% without the support battery pack.","jhia angelyck mavy r. cruz, thea g. espinueva, vincent matthew f. labrador industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines - manila mjamrcruz@tip.edu.ph, mtgespinueva@tip.edu.ph, mvmflabrador@tip.edu.ph dr. maria teresa b. mendoza industrial engineering department - adviser technological institute of the philippines – manila mariateresa.mendoza@tip.edu.ph",

Work culture has a negative and insignificant effect on employee satisfaction and work productivity, meaning that work culture has no effect on PT Bara Permata Mining employee satisfaction. This means that the indication of the implementation of work culture is still felt to be less strong so that it shows a decrease in morale and work discipline of its employees and work culture is not needed in research in this company because the system has been running using Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that have been applied in each department so that the work culture itself runs in accordance with the existing system. 2. Work pressure has a positive and significant effect on employee satisfaction. This means that the higher the work pressure given will have an impact on employee satisfaction. The pressure referred to here is a work target that has been determined by management so that when the target has been achieved, the level of employee satisfaction with their work will increase. 3. Job satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on work productivity. This means that the higher the level of job satisfaction, the more employee work productivity increases. 4. Work pressure has a positive and significant effect on work productivity. This means that the higher the work pressure given, the more employee work productivity increases. 5. The results showed that job satisfaction can mediate between work culture, work pressure and employee productivity so that job satisfaction is a good intervening variable.

74,Order Dispatching And Delivering Decision For   A Food Delivery Service,"this paper investigates a dynamic food delivery problem, in which orders arrive dynamically and must be delivered to customers within specified time windows. a fleet of capacitated vehicles is used to deliver the orders. the goal is to minimize the total transportation distances associated with fulfilling customer demands on time. the authors propose a methodology for solving this problem, which involves two steps: 1) order grouping: the orders are grouped into sets based on their arrival time and delivery time windows. 2) route optimization: for each set of orders, an optimal delivery route is found using a cvrptw model. we evaluate the methodology using experimental results. we found that the decision timeframe (the length of time over which orders are grouped) has a significant impact on the performance of the methodology. when the decision timeframe is narrower, it tends to require a higher number of vehicles compared to wider time frames. however, it also results in a shorter average waiting time for customers. with a wider timeframe, more options for orders can be combined in one delivery routing, which can reduce the travel cost/distance. however, too wide a timeframe may lead to increased travel distances due to a small gap between the time of decision making and the guaranteed time of delivery.","cvrptw, food delivery, order management","In food delivery management, effective decision-making plays a crucial role in achieving desirable outcomes. The challenge lies in creating an optimal delivery route that strikes a balance between transportation distances and customer satisfaction. The algorithm proposed in the paper is a promising approach for solving the problem with dynamic order arrivals in food delivery. The algorithm can make decisions in real time, and it is able to adapt to changes in the environment. This makes it a good candidate for use in real-world applications. The paper's findings can be used to inform the development of more sophisticated algorithms for food delivery. By understanding the optimal length of time for grouping orders, food delivery companies can minimize transportation distances and time, and improve the delivery experience for their customers.

75,"Development Of Food Container With Spoilage Detector  Jan Marielle I. Bidayan, Arjen Guila C. Cruz, John Rei C. Garchitorena, Erika Mae","the researchers developed an upgraded food packaging that can detect food spoilage. the research was inspired by the present issues in the industry regarding food waste and food safety. this endeavor is driven by three sustainable development goals (sdg) with an objective for all nations to have a common goal that will lead to stability and economic growth. qualitative and quantitative methods were utilized in this study, specifically interviews and surveys. the qualitative approach was used to gather insights from experts for technology development. a survey was conducted to determine relevant information regarding the market. the survey was also utilized for validation from consumers and for determining the product's market viability. about 100 respondents from the national capital region participated in the study. the technical feasibility aspect of the product was determined through product testing in the department of science and technology-industrial technology development institute (dost-itdi), preliminary manufacturing, and production assessment. based on the initial manufacturing assessment, the daily yield is 200 units and 4,400 units monthly. this study was viewed to be viable because it has a payback period of one year and seven months. the startup business begins with modest profits and sales but progressively grows over the years, leading to higher sales, profits, and positive cash flow.","food packaging, food safety, food waste","After using both qualitative and quantitative techniques, the product, WasteNot is considered marketable since the majority of the respondents are willing to buy and use the product. It also shows that most of the respondents find it difficult to identify food spoilage, thus validating the need for the development of a food container with a spoilage detector. The product is feasible because based on the initial and final testing of the device, it has met the working conditions proposed. Also, under the financial aspect, the payback period of the product produced significant results. Furthermore, the target market, or consumers' response to the survey, was in favor of buying the product. Developing a product that can detect food spoilage easily and aids people in monitoring the real-time status of their food can positively impact the environment by reducing one of the main contributors of waste, which is food waste. At the same time, through WasteNot, people can better ensure food safety consumption. Occurrences of food poisoning can be prevented if people are able to detect spoiled food accurately. Pursuing the production of WasteNot can also create more job opportunities for individuals, which can then impact the country's economy. The researchers suggest exploring other indicators of spoilage, such as halochromic ink and other gas sensors. According to Leite et al. (2022), halochromic sensors, specifically methyl orange and bromocresol purple 2% (w/v), were able to create a perceptible signal that indicates food spoilage through a color change. Another recommendation is to test the food spoilage detector on raw meat or fish. The researchers also propose to explore using solar power to operate the product. Solar energy is proven to be a sustainable energy source, and at the same time, it has a lower impact on the environment than other energy sources (Johnston 2022). Another proposed improvement is utilizing LoRa technology to improve the battery life of the product. According to Garcia et al. (2019), LoRa consumes less power than WiFi, although there should be necessary changes in its settings to ensure low energy consumption.","p. ople, carl joseph c. quintana* and jaypy t. tenerife industrial engineering program, college of engineering and architecture, technological institute of the philippines, quezon city, philippines qjmibidayan@tip.edu.ph, qagccruz@tip.edu.ph, qjrcgarchitorena@tip.edu.ph, qempople@tip.edu.ph, *qcjcquintana@tip.edu.ph, jaypy.tenerife@tip.edu.ph *corresponding author",

81,"Improvement Model To Increase Productivity Using Slp, 5S  And Standard Work At A Pisco Producer Sme In Peru","over the years, the pisco industry has experienced significant growth, which is why the smes in the sector need to improve their production processes. many of these companies have difficulties in their production processes related to low productivity, mainly due to inefficient plant distribution. therefore, the main purpose of this scientific article is to support these companies in the pisco industry by increasing their productivity. this will be achieved by implementing the following improvement proposal using the engineering tools of systematic layout planning, 5s, and standard work. the proposal of this article is a new plant layout, in order to eliminate unnecessary transfers in the production process, alongside standardized processes and an innovative temperature control system. the proposed model was validated with the use of arena software by comparing the pre-implementation and post-implementation results of the model, in order to verify if the implementation of these tools had a positive impact on the pisco producing company. as a result, the productivity increased by 11%, the transfer times between stages were reduced from 20,36 hours to 13,86 hours, meaning a 31,92% reduction per production process; and the waste generated during the process was reduced by 11%. also, from a financial point of view, a payback period of 1,51 years and an npv of usd 3 938,92 were obtained.","productivity, 5s, standard word","Based on the validation carried out, it was possible to demonstrate that, through the correct implementation of engineering tools, it is possible to make improvements in the Peruvian Pisco industry. In the case of this article, it was possible to increase the company's productivity by 11%, which translates into a total of 1 452 Pisco bottles of 750ml each. Likewise, thanks to the new plant layout, the elimination and reorganization of elements and the new standardized processes, carried out with the SLP, 5S and Work Standardization tools, respectively, it was possible to reduce transfer times from 20,36 hours to 13,86 hours, which means a reduction of 6,5 hours or 31,92% per production process. Likewise, it was possible to reduce waste generated by 11.88% per production process. On the other hand, the improvement proposal of this article has the potential to generate a positive economic impact of more than USD 10 000 per year. Finally, if this proposal is analyzed and implemented by other small and medium-sized companies in the Peruvian pisco sector, it could generate growth in the industry, since one of the main problems in the industry is an inadequate distribution of the production plant, and with this model, they would be attacking the main problem.","pedro andre kcomt villavicencio, iago martin santa maria sotelo and alberto flores-perez facultad de ingeniería. universidad de lima, lima, perú 20180976@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20181759@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, alflores@ulima.edu.pe",
82,Three Key-Elements For Data Center Facilities   Sizing In Early Stage Of Design,"the growth in data trafficking, data processing, e-learning, social networking, digitization of services and in general, the simple fact that almost everything is shifting digital, necessitates an ever-increasing demand in information handling and processing. the massive amounts of data are stored and processed in “servers,” “routers,” “firewalls,” and storage devices (also known as it load) installed within data centers (dcs). data centers consume an important amount of electricity (about 2% per year), and it is forecasted that consumption will rise to more than 3.8% of global electricity consumption by 2030. three key elements to be considered are the it load rating, the layout-arrangement of the it white space and cooling rating. these are related by the power density, which directly relates the data center size, the cooling capacity, and energy use. this paper covers the main technical infrastructure design for a case study of dc-500 kw in hoa lac-vietnam, the design is following international guidelines and best practices. we present a better way for selecting dc’s power density and optimal layout-arrangement for it racks. it is a conjunction of cooling load and airflow sizing, and computational fluid dynamics (cfd) simulations to analyze the heat distribution (cold air intake, hot air exhaust) in dc rack-rows. airflow analysis is a key consideration during the initial phase of dc sizing since it encompasses all the design and configuration elements that go into restricting or preventing mixing between the cooling air provided to it equipment and the hot air rejected from the it room.","data center, power density, precision cooling, it rack","This paper contributes to fill-in the technical research gaps related to data center facility sizing by analyzing the energy consumption of data center loads. Two key design parameters for a data center are the IT load rating in kW and the physical size of the IT rack equipment in a data hall. To understand from the outset of data center design, three main components (i.e., space footprint, power supply, cooling) are the right things to do at the first time, in which a data center capacity is specified by an average power density per rack (kW/rack) that allows consideration of the key design constraints such as power supplies and thermal requirements. Energy efficiency term by PUE value is also a guideline for improving waste due to oversizing design. To analyze the design proposal optimally, CFD airflow analysis was performed to estimate the temperature distribution, airflow patterns, pressure, and airflow velocity, as well as evaluate the optimum conditions of air distribution for the data center. The results demonstrated the optimal IT rack layout placement to meet the operation conditions inside the IT room following ASHRAE thermal guidelines in conjunction with giving important recommendations in operation of CRACs with the recommended ""air-setpoint"" level bellow of 20ºC. This paper has presented a logical approach to documenting data center space and capacity requirements that provides sufficient detail for a typical DC in Vietnam to assure that performance is predictable. Even data centers with incomplete information and uncertain plans can use this method. To assist users attempting to define a density specification, typical design values have been provided.

85,Potential For Producing Bio Coal Pellets From Brewers Spent Grain As A   Biomass Based Energy Source,,,"Brewery spent grains (BSG) can be value added to bio coal pellets. The percentage conversion of brewery spent grains to bio coal at 250-300 ᵒC and 25 bars was 65.7%. The characterization results of the bio coal showed that its calorific value and fixed carbon is higher than that of fossil coal. The fixed carbon gives an estimation of the heating value. A HAZOP analysis was carried out, process control was done to eliminate the hazards. The Environmental Impact Assessment showed that bio coal production has negligible negative impacts on the environment. The total capital investment needed to start the bio coal plant is USD 7.6 million with 4.6 years as payback period and a 21.7% return on investment. The net present value was positive indicating the economic viability of producing bio coal pellets from BSG.

88,Minimizing Job Tardiness In One-Dimensional Cutting  Stock Problem Using Mixed Integer Linear,"the one-dimensional cutting stock problem is a fundamental problem in manufacturing that involves the preparation of raw materials for production. an example of a cutting stock problem in the industry is steel pipe manufacturing, where the raw material preparation operation requires cutting steel sheets from stock rolls based on job specifications. steel manufacturers usually perform job planning and scheduling on the cutting process to satisfy the production requirement, i.e. job due date, from subsequent operation. the key performance measure is job tardiness. in this paper, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model to solve the one-dimensional cutting stock problem so as to minimize total job tardiness. a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in performing job scheduling to meet the due dates.","due dates, sizes","and Future Work In this paper, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for the coil-cutting production stage. The model is a variant of one-dimensional CSP, which aims at minimizing total job tardiness. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated by a numerical experiment. The results indicate that our model can generate a cutting plan with minimal tardiness. This implies an opportunity to further extend this model. For instance, our model can be integrated with the scheduling model for pipe-forming production stage to be a unified planning model for steel pipe production industries. Another possible extension of our proposed model is to develop algorithms that generate cutting plans for large problem instances, involving dozens or hundreds of steel pipe orders. j = 10 j = 7 j = 5 j = 1 j = 9 j = 6 j = 4 j = 3 j = 2 j = 8 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 Setup Time Processing Time Stock Rolls Time (min.)

89,"Integration Of Science, Technology, Engineering, And  Mathematics (Stem) In Islamic Education","islamic education has undergone a significant transformation with the development of technology. technology has a major impact on the development of islamic education in the form of the use of technology in learning, both by educators, students, and the development of teaching materials. the need for technology in islamic education is increasingly strengthened by the demands of 21st-century learning and sustainable development goals, in a multidisciplinary context. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) is a multidisciplinary approach that is integrated with technology, which is used as an alternative for achieving the institutional vision of a state islamic university to support graduate learning outcomes. therefore, it is necessary to formulate a strategy to strengthen the institutional vision that develops islamic scholarship, science, and technology in an integrated manner. the purpose of this research is to provide recommendation strategies to policymakers for improving the quality of islamic education in indonesia. the strategic assumption surface and testing (sast) method were adopted in this study through focus group discussions and interviews with selected experts, which included 2 experts and 8 educators. the results of the assumptions are grouped according to the level of importance and certainty in the quadrant graph. this study found that there were 25 strategic assumptions that were formulated to increase the achievement of integrated learning outcomes with science, technology, engineering, and math (stem). the results of the sast method classify strategic assumptions into 4 quadrants. there are 15 items that assume the strategy is at a high level of importance and certainty in quadrant 1 and are a priority for implementation. this research has limitations in determining the priority of assumptions to be applied. further research is recommended to carry out weighing and ranking in selecting the best strategic assumptions by policymakers.","integration, islamic education, stem, learning outcomes, sast 813","The application of the Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing (SAST) method in this research has successfully categorized pertinent strategic assumptions aimed at enhancing strategies for reinforcing the integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in Islamic education. A total of 25 strategic assumptions have been delineated, distributed across quadrant 1, as per this method. Consequently, decision-makers can consider these strategies for augmenting the integration of STEM in Islamic education based on the importance and certainty levels associated with each assumption. Furthermore, this study has identified nine key strategic assumptions. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that this research faces limitations in determining the prioritization of these assumptions. Therefore, it is recommended that future research incorporates weighting and ranking mechanisms to select the most suitable strategic assumptions for proposing to policymakers. These efforts aim to enhance strategies for strengthening the integration of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in Islamic education at the Islamic University of Riau Province.","using strategic assumption surfacing and testing (sast) sri murhayati, hartono, susilawati, khusnal marzuqo faculty of education and teacher training universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau, indonesia sri.murhayati@uin-suska.ac.id, hartono@uin-suska.ac.id, susilawati@uin-suska.ac.id, khusnal.marzuko@uin-suska.ac.id salmaini yeli faculty of ushuluddin universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau, indonesia salmainiyeli@uin-suska.ac.id fitra lestari, muhammad isnaini hadiyul umam industrial engineering department universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau, indonesia fitra.lestari@uin-suska.ac.id, muhammad.isnaini@uin-suska.ac.id lisa rahmadani utami bidang pemberdayaan masyarakat pekerjaan umum dan perumahan rakyat lisa.utami@pu.go.id",
90,Material Cost Prediction By Intelligent Machine Learning  Algorithms To Support The Product Design Process,"during the design process of new products, it would be important to obtain the impact of design decisions in terms of their cost effects. in this way, a rough product cost calculation could be obtained in order to decide whether such a product is worth manufacturing or not. often, companies have an upper limit for manufacturing costs back-calculated from the expected market price, which is to be adhered to in the product design. a large amount of these costs are caused by the used material costs. but how should material costs be estimated if new components that have not been used before are to be handled? obtaining offers for only planned, potentially eligible components on the procurement market is certainly out of the question for reasons of expense and time. especially since alternative components with the same or similar technical properties often exist and the designer has to choose one of them. in order to solve this problem, we investigated whether a good cost estimate or forecast can be realized with the help of intelligent methods. an innovative two-stage technique with clustering and neural nets showed the best results. the basis for this approach is a large data collection of previously supplied components with their specifications and their procurement prices.","price forecast, neural networks",,"lackes, richard professor, dept. of business informatics tu dortmund dortmund, germany richard.lackes@tu-dortmund.de sengewald, julian m.sc., dept. of business informatics tu dortmund dortmund, germany julian.sengewald@tu-dortmund.de","References

91,Corporate Governance And Capital Structure :   Evidence From Indonesian Banking,"the present study aims to examine the influence of corporate governance on capital structure decisions within the indonesian banking sector. the dataset utilized in this research comprises 264 firm-year observations from 24 banks that were publicly traded on the indonesia stock exchange throughout the period spanning from 2011 to 2021. the data are analyzed utilizing descriptive statistics and the generalized method of moments, specifically employing the dynamic panel model. the findings of this study indicate that the level of management ownership and the inclusion of foreign directors on a company's board of directors exert influence on leverage ratios. specifically, the first variable has a positive effect, while the second variable demonstrates a negative effect. this study contributes to the existing literature on capital structure and corporate governance by presenting novel insights into the impact of both factors on capital structure within the financial industry. the aforementioned findings will aid policymakers in evaluating the adequacy of corporate governance changes in bolstering the management of capital structure, particularly within the context of indonesia. the results demonstrate that management ownership and the presence of foreign directors on a company's board of directors have an impact on leverage ratios, with a positive effect for the first variable and a negative one for the second. this study adds to the body of knowledge on capital structure and corporate governance by providing fresh information on how these factors affect capital structure in the financial industry. these findings will help policymakers assess whether corporate governance reforms are sufficient to enhance capital structure management, especially in indonesia.","capital structure, indonesian banks","The present study focuses on the governance of Indonesian banking organizations, specifically examining the impact of foreign directors' composition on the capital structure. The presence of foreign management exerts a detrimental impact on the business capital structure. The results align with the pecking order theory, which posits that firms with a higher proportion of foreign directors are inclined to augment their corporate finance by means of heightened equity or share issuance. The presence of managerial ownership exerts a favorable and statistically significant impact on the composition of a firm's capital structure. According to Jensen and Meckling (1976), the agency theory posits that the possession of management shares might serve as a mechanism to mitigate the knowledge imbalance that exists between the principal and agent. Prior studies have also provided evidence in favor of a positive correlation between managerial ownership and capital structure. In contrast to our initial premise, the variables of management size, number of management meetings, and size of risk committees do not exhibit a statistically significant impact on the capital structure. The aforementioned findings will aid policymakers in evaluating the adequacy of corporate governance changes in bolstering the management of capital structure, particularly within the context of Indonesia.

93,Home Health Care Routing And Scheduling Problem For  Newborns And Mothers:,"the home health care routing and scheduling problem (hhcrsp) has become one of the major consideration for many home health care (hhc) service providers who deliver home and personal care services directly to customers' homes. satisfying customers' needs and caregivers' well-being requires and saving a comprehensive approach that balances the quality of care provided to patients with the well-being and job satisfaction of caregivers. this study has developed a mixed-integer programming model with the aim of minimizing travel distances while simultaneously achieving a balanced workload, meeting clients' requirements, and accommodating caregivers' lunch breaks. for small-scale problems, this study employed cplex software to solve to find the optimal solutions. for large-scale problems, these problems were divided into smaller problems by using (agglomerative hierarchical clustering) ahc and k-meaning algorithms. the obtained results indicate that the combination of the ahc algorithm and cplex yields superior solutions compared to the utilization of the k-means algorithm and cplex via testing randomly generated datasets. the proposed approach is put to the test in a real-world case study conducted in ho chi minh city.","clustering, milp",". Scenario 1: Decrease the lunch break time window [bb, ab] of a caregiver from [11.5, 13.0] to [12.0, 13.0] Scenario 2: Decrease the client’s time window [𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖] from 30 mins to 15 mins only. Scenario 3: Increase the client’s time window [𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖] from 30 mins to 45 mins. Scenario 4: Increase the client’s time window [𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖, 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑖] from 30 mins to 45 mins as well as Shorten the lunch break time window of a caregiver [bb, ab] from [11.5, 13.0] to [12.0, 13.0]. Figure 6. Comparison between 4 scenario and original case From the result above, we can see that scenario 3 had a good impact on the objective, especially when it caused the cost paid for daily wage of all caregivers to drop to almost 10%. The more flexible the time window, the more decrease in final solution. On the other hand, scenarios 1 and 2 make the objective increase compared with the origin while scenario 4 did not show much effect on the final results. It can be seen that when I consider the hard time window for client (only 15 mins) in scenario 2, the model required more caregivers to ensure all clients are being served without violating their time windows and skills’ requirement. However, in order to afford this case, not only did the travel cost increase 8.87% but also the total caregivers’ daily wage increased to nearly 14%, resulting in the 13.74% increase in the final objective. Therefore, for further recommendation for the improvement, in the case the company wants to decrease the total travel distance and total cost, they should consider the flexible time window to reduce the number of caregivers required. However, in practice, it seems unreasonable since no clients are willing to wait or accept more than 30 mins late. This case somehow decreases the clients’ satisfaction. On the contrary, if the company wants to improve customers’ satisfaction, they change into the hard time window (no more than 15 mins) rather than flexible time window like the original case. Obviously, it will make their cost increase significantly since more caregivers will be required. 7. Conclusion This study introduces a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model aimed at resolving the Home Health Care Routing and Scheduling Problem for Newborns and Mothers, while accounting for caregivers' lunch breaks. The primary objective of this model is to minimize overall cost. The resulting optimal solutions take into account constraints time windows and client requirements. To validate performance of the proposed approach, a real-world dataset consisting of 156 clients from an HHC provider in Ho Chi Minh City, offering home and personal care services for newborns and mothers, was utilized. To further enhance the model's applicability, two clustering algorithms, namely Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) and K-Means, were employed to divide the data into smaller clusters based on distance. Routings for these clusters are optimized by CLEX. Following the optimal results, AHC emerged as the more effective approach. This methodology can be implemented in various settings where similar routing and scheduling challenges exist. For future research, it is recommended to extend the proposed model to address scenarios involving unexpected delays in caregivers' travel or situations where clients might need to add more service during service time. 0 500000 1000000 1500000 Origin Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 Comparison between 4 scenarios and original case Total cost Paid cost Traveling cost 876","a case study in ho chi minh city nguyen thuy bich ngoc school of industrial engineering and management international university thu duc city, viet nam ngocnguyens2001@gmail.com ha thi xuan chi school of industrial engineering and management international university thu duc city, viet nam htxchi@hcmiu.edu.vn pham huynh tram school of industrial engineering and management international university thu duc city, viet nam phtram@hcmiu.edu.vn","References

94,Improving Forecast Accuracy With Hybrid Time Series  Forecasting And Machine Learning Methods,"pharmaceutical industry is instrumental to the well-being of people around the world as it deals with the discovery, development, production and marketing of drugs and medications, which are one of life’s necessities. recently, there is an emerging phenomenon that some hospitals in vietnam must suppress their operation due to the deficiency of medical supply, and thus affecting patients who are in the need for treatment. one of the factors contributing to the situation is the incapability of providing these commodities on time from pharmaceutical companies, which results from their inaccurate forecasting. this paper investigates the application of machine learning algorithms in time series forecasting, specifically focusing on support vector regression (svr) to improve forecast accuracy. it evaluates the performance of two time series models, including arima and holt’s trend, and three types of svr, including linear kernel, polynomial kernel, and radial basic function (rbf). the evaluation is based on the mean absolute percentage error (mape) metric, which measures the accuracy of the forecasts. the study then proposes hybrid models that combine svr with traditional time series models via ensemble methods and compares their performance with the individual models. finally, a case study of a pharmaceutical company is performed to assess the impacts of these methods. the results demonstrate that the hybrid ensemble method achieves lower mape values compared to the individual models. these findings offer promising insights and highlight the potential of the proposed hybrid models in improving forecast accuracy.","forecast accuracy, svr, mape","This paper aimed to address the forecasting challenges in the pharmaceutical industry by exploring and evaluating various forecasting methods. Through a comprehensive analysis of individual forecasting methods and the development of a ensemble approach, valuable insights and improvements in forecast accuracy have been achieved. The analysis of individual forecasting methods highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate methods based on the characteristics of the data and the underlying patterns. The findings emphasized the need to consider factors such as linearity, trend, and non-linear patterns when choosing the most effective forecasting method for each product. The homogeneous ensemble approach, specifically by adjusting the stopping boundaries for the Empirical Mode Decomposition process and aligning it with the specific characteristics of the data, the homogeneous ensemble achieved the most optimal MAPE. This underscores the significance of adjusting the stopping boundaries appropriately to extract relevant linear and non-linear patterns for improved forecasting accuracy. In summary, this paper contributes to advancing forecasting practices in the pharmaceutical industry by providing valuable insights and practical frameworks for enhancing forecast accuracy. The findings have important implications for decision-making and strategic planning in the pharmaceutical sector, enabling more informed and accurate demand forecasting. It is important to acknowledge that forecasting is an ongoing process, and there is always room for further refinement and improvement. As a recommendation, it is crucial for future research to address the limitations posed by the limited availability of data for model training in this study. The dataset used here covers a short period, which may restrict the models' ability to capture long-term trends and account for unforeseen patterns that could emerge in the future. To enhance the forecasting models' accuracy and generalizability, researchers should aim to collect more extensive and diverse datasets. Including data from a broader timeframe and covering a wider range of scenarios and market conditions can improve the models' robustness and applicability. Moreover, incorporating data from different geographical regions or market segments can help address potential biases and further validate the models' effectiveness in various contexts. Furthermore, it is essential to explore and integrate additional data sources that may provide valuable insights into the pharmaceutical industry's demand dynamics. This could include external factors such as macroeconomic indicators, regulatory changes, public health events, and other relevant variables that influence drug demand. Leveraging such data can enrich the forecasting models and enable them to adapt to dynamic and evolving market conditions. Moreover, the use of advanced machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms should be considered in future research. These approaches have the potential to extract more complex patterns and relationships from the data, leading to more accurate and robust forecasting models. 889","a case study of a pharmaceutical company diep tran thao vy, pham huynh tram, and ha thi xuan chi school of industrial engineering & management international university, ho chi minh city, vietnam vietnam national university, ho chi minh city, vietnam ielsiu19095@student.hcmiu.edu.vn, phtram@hcmiu.edu.vn, htxchi@hcmiu.edu.vn","References

95,Analysis Of Priority Decision Rules Using Mcdm Approach  For A Dual-Resource Constrained Flexible Job Shop,"in the dual-resource constrained flexible job shop problem (drcfjsp), two different types of resources, such as workers and machines, are required to process each job's operations. the analysis and assessment of priority decision rules for scheduling production jobs in drcfjsps is the primary goal of this work. the evaluation criteria in this research consists of demand, due date, cycle time, number of operations, and setup time. then, a set of priority rules for development is chosen after a review of the literature, including composite dispatching rules (cdrs) and multi- criteria decision making (mcdm)-based priority rules like preference selection index (psi), and proximity index value (piv). the weights of criteria are obtained by fuzzy stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (fuzzy swara). discrete event simulation (des) model is developed to assess the performance of the drcfjsps with different rules. numerical examples and real-world problems (with 114 jobs, 28 machines, and 23 people) are used to determine the best-performing prioritization rule. for all cases, the cdr considering processing time, least work remaining, earliest due date were found to be the best. the psi-based rule is in second rank for large-scale case. overall, the suggested approach yields solid results and is easy to adapt to real-world scenarios.",,"In this research, hybrid MCDM-based priority rules were created as an innovative solution to the DRCFJSP. The MCDM approaches are used with a Fuzzy SWARA method to calculate criteria’s weights. Job prioritizing was accomplished using two MCDM techniques, i.e., PSI, and PIV. A DES model is also built to assess the DRCFJSPs' efficiency metrics. To evaluate the effectiveness of the CDRs and MCDM-based priority rules, we used numerical instances of small scale and a case study of large scale. For all cases, the CDR considering processing time, Least Work Remaining, Earliest Due Date (R1) were found mostly outperforming the MCDM-based priority rules for almost every performance metric. The PSI-based rule is in second rank after the R1 for large-scale case. However, the MCDM- based rules offer the flexibility to change the ranking criteria and the optimal weights depending on the expert's knowledge. The performance of the shop floor may be enhanced by using MCDM-based priority rules for complex issues involving numerous factors, such as demand, due date, setup time, cycle time, and the number of operations. The suggested technique is straightforward and user-friendly in practical settings. The research's drawback, however, is that for the MCDM method, it fails to automatically update the new criteria information once each operation is completed, which prevents the simulation from automatically updating the new job rating. This can be solved by integrating VBA coding in Arena, which will be addressed in our future work.","scheduling by simulation method cao hoang bao long, pham hoang nam quynh, pham huynh tram, and ha thi xuan chi school of industrial engineering and management international university, ho chi minh city, vietnam vietnam national university, ho chi minh city, vietnam ielsiu19040@student.hcmiu.edu.vn, ielsiu19066@student.hcmiu.edu.vn, phtram@hcmiu.edu.vn, htxchi@hcmiu.edu.vn",
96,Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Using Multi-Criteria   Decision Making And Simulation,"in manufacturing system, a developed form of flow shop known as a hybrid flow shop system (hfs) allows the simultaneous operation of many identical machines on each stage. duplicators are used to scale up a factory, increase output, balance a production line, or reduce the impact of a bottleneck. several industries, including automotive, accessories and electronics, make extensive use of hfs. this study addresses the scheduling among machines in the hfs by applying the discrete event simulation (des) modeling in conjunction with priority rules based on multi- criteria decision making (mcdms) and composite dispatching rules (cdrs). the model aims to reduce the makespan, mean flowtime, mean tardiness, and maximum tardiness considering multi criteria namely cycle time, set-up time, due date, order and number of operations. the suggested solution framework combines mcdm approaches, such as the technique for prioritize order by viekriteri-jumsko kompromisno rangiranje (vikor), separately to prioritize the jobs, and with criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (critic) for allocating weights to the criteria.",,"This work aims to solve the HFS scheduling problem by comparing a selected best CDR and a hybrid MCDM priority rule via DES modeling. The selected CDR considers a combination of Earliest Due Date, Least Remaining number of operations, Least Total work content, Least Remaining work content, and Least number of operations. The MCDM employs the CRITIC method to weigh cirteria of due date, cycle time, number of operations, set-up time and demand, and VIKOR method to give priority rank to a job.Three small scale instances and a large scale realworld case are tested. For the makespan performance, the MCDM is found consistently performing well. On the other hand, the CDR surpasses the MCDM in the performance of mean flowtime, min and max tardiness. In our future work, we will consider updating the ranking by the MCDM rule at each new operation, making it suitable for real time application.","lieu nguyen thuy hoang uyen, doan luu kim ngan, pham huynh tram and ha thi xuan chi school of industrial & systems engineering international university ho chi minh city, vietnam ielsiu19211@student.hcmiu.edu.vn, ielsiu19305@student.hcmiu.edu.vn, phtram@hcmiu.edu.vn, htxchi@hcmiu.edu.vn",
97,Increasing Efficiency In The Process Of Loading Goods Into  Containers Through Lean Automation Concepts: A Case,"the tapioca starch industry is critical to thailand's economy and is constantly developing to meet global market demands. tapioca starch producers must refine their delivery strategies to align with customer demands efficiently, with a specific focus on optimizing the container-loading process, which plays a vital role in enhancing product delivery. therefore, the objective of this study is to determine more efficient methods to load products into containers using the lean automation concept. in this study, the researchers examined the shipping process of a tapioca starch factory and found that the current loading process required 82.89 minutes per container. to enhance efficiency, the researchers employed tools such as value stream mapping (vsm), cause and effect diagrams, and the flexsim program to simulate the loading process and identify areas for improvement. the results of the simulation modeling of the container loading process revealed that after implementing improvements, the loading time for goods into containers could be reduced from 82.89 minutes per container to 77.73 minutes per container, indicating a decrease of 5.16 minutes per container or a 6.23 percent improvement. when loading products into two containers simultaneously, the manpower required can be reduced from six to five. additionally, it was determined that the number of forklifts in use could be reduced from two to one. the findings of this study offer valuable insights for planners engaged in warehouse and logistics operations. they can serve as a practical guide for improving the efficiency of loading goods into containers.","tapioca starch, flexsim simulation","The findings of modeling and simulation research can be used to guide improvements and increase the efficiency of the container loading process. It was discovered that using a product conveyor belt can help reduce time, labor, and the number of forklifts used in the work process.

98,Experimental Investigation On Phase Change Material Based  Circular Pin Fin Heat Sink For Cooling,"heat management of electronic device is now rapidly upgrading and considered challenging due to the increase of power and decreasing size of the electronic device. due to the economic cost, system complexity and operating conditions, the traditional cooling methods are quite impossible. that is the reason why using of phase change material (pcms) in passive cooling system is considered as a great alternative in recent years. hydrated salt and paraffin, which are known as organic phase change material (pcms), has been greatly recommended in energy storage component due to its high latent heat, non-toxicity and very low melting temperature. using the pcm energy storage and cooling systems lead to a significant volume reduction to store the same amount of energy compared to sensible heat storages. the experiment attempts to illustrate the difference in heat transfer for a heat sink with and without paraffin wax at different power level.","pcm, heat sink, cell phones",The experimental investigation performed aimed to investigate the effect of paraffin wax also evaluate the effect of paraffin wax also evaluate the of volume fraction of paraffin wax and pin fin of PCM based heat sinks for heat input 934,"electronic equipment mir rahimul isiam, md. shahriar shikder and dr. kazi afzalur rahman department of mechanical engineering chittagong university of engineering and technology raozan, 4349, chittagong, bangladesh peyal03@gmail.com, sssakibss@gmail.com, afzal@cuet.ac.bd",
99,Supplier Selection Of Equipment Components For The  Construction Of Nuclear Facilities: Ahp-Based Approach,"supplier selection is one of the most influential decision an organization can make towards their operational efficiency. however, this activity can become highly resource-intensive in the absence of a structured framework, especially in supply chains involving large numbers of components. this research aims to utilize risk assessment as a tool to screen for construction equipment components that should be considered for re-sourcing to new suppliers. the severities of risks are evaluated by cost of poor quality and occurrence by the frequency of nonconformities. high-risk components were selected for a change of suppliers. multi-criteria decision-making – analytic hierarchy process (mcdm-ahp) is then used to determine the suitable weights of 12 supplier evaluation criteria between four different managers. suppliers with the highest results are selected. once new suppliers are selected, a second risk assessment is conducted to review the impact of the change in suppliers to the cost of poor quality and frequency of nonconformities.","supplier selection, risk assessment","The result of this research shows that when risk assessment is used to analyze the risk level from the supply chain of 62 equipment components based on the total cost of poor quality and number of nonconformity reports, only 7 components were rated as high or very high risks. However, these 7 components constituted 61% of all the total cost of poor quality generated. Therefore, new suppliers must be selected for these 7 components. In the selection of suppliers, evaluation criteria and sub-criteria must be defined while considering the risk assessment. The criteria were classified into four categories: quality, service, delivery, and costs. The criteria were selected from both established literature and consensus between experienced personnel in the field of procurement, quality assurance, supplier quality, and planning. Experts from each of the relevant fields determined the weight of each evaluation criteria through the use of AHP. All participants understood the context and relevance of the exercise with respect to the current quality issues faced by the organization in the supply of construction equipment to the nuclear industry. As a result, quality and service criteria received the higher weight at 47.8% and 25.3% respectively, while delivery and costs were weighed lower at 14.3% and 12.6% respectively. From the supplier evaluation criteria, 6 suppliers were analyzed. It was observed that all previous suppliers with a risk level of 3 or higher scored below 50% in the new evaluation metric, while their new suppliers all scored above 80% with their higher level of quality and service, despite their higher initial prices. Once the sources of components at level 3 or higher risks have been changed to new suppliers with higher evaluation scores, a revaluation of the risk level is conducted. The total cost of poor quality between the 7 parts was reduced by 80.87%, and the frequency of nonconformities have reduced by 87.64%. The second risk assessment revealed a reduction in risk level of the 7 components. 1 component is now classified in the acceptable risk category, 5 in the low-risk category, and 1 in no-risk category. This research demonstrated the utility of risk assessment as a tool to screen and prioritize high-risk components to be re-sourced with weighted supplier evaluation criteria through AHP to reduce the cost of poor quality and frequency of nonconformities in equipment components. This type of approach is especially useful for organizations trying to improve the quality amongst a wide range of externally sourced components with limited resources. The level of severity and occurrence can be tailored to a different acceptance tolerance for a better fit with an organization’s needs and available resources. 947","integrated with risk assessment thippawan phongnontachai, jittra rukijkanpanich department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, chulalongkorn university bangkok, thailand thippawan.phongnontachai@gmail.com, jittra.r@chula.ac.th","References

100,Enhancing Map Design For 3-Dimensional Spatial Data  Based On Integration Of 4Ir Geomatics Technologies,"spatial data is an integral product and part of human livelihood as society becomes more spatially enabled. spatial data in form of maps and location-based services has become an integral part of the public’s livelihood in the information society. maps have been historically created through the traditional cartographic process which targeted customers or audiences with competence in map reading. as such, these maps present geographical phenomenon in complex ways that are not easy to decipher by the novice user, and are of thus limited use. the novice user requires maps that are highly visual and interactive to easily interpret their content and make informed decisions rapidly. the basic data sets that are created by national mapping agencies such as topographic and cadastral maps have not transformed over centuries while society requires value added easy to use map products. the fourth industrial revolution (4ir) brings a wide array of technology for capturing and processing new forms of spatial data which can be integrated in the design of new and innovative map products. this requires transforming of the traditional cartographic process to enable the design of a wider array of products and services. the aim of this study is to explore a map design procedure that utilises 4ir technologies and multiple geo-visualisation aspects through supply chain mapping. results reflect that changing geo-visualisation techniques within map production improves communication and supply chain mapping can create avenues for the design of a wide array of geospatial products.","map design, design theory, geo-visualisation","Often products that have been created for a niche of specialist are often restricted regarding development of alternatives, variations and new products. This has been largely the situation with geographic information or geospatial products and services where surveyors, geodesists and geographers among other few specialists have been custodians of the data. Present day, the majority of the public worldwide uses maps or some form of location based service such as google maps, WhatsApp location, navigation applications among others. While the design theory has not more tailored for the manufacturing industry, this study demonstrates that, it can also be utilized in the cartographic industry where geospatial products and services are manufactured hence accepting the hypothesis H0. Additionally, the study has demonstrated the use of supply chain mapping in modelling processes involved towards producing an information based product or service, that is nowadays mostly in digital format, hence accepting Ha. The aim of this study was to provide insight to a map design procedure that incorporates multiple 4IR technologies and geo-visualisation aspects. This was achieved through application of supply chains to the design process. The geographic information supply chain needs to be agile to respond to changing customer needs and new options that arise due to improvement of technology in the 4th industrial revolution. This design however, introduces possible challenges. The greatest negative consequence to increased availability of map data is information overload. This increased availability of geographic information can be taken advantage by providing different geo-visualisation options for users to enrich the quality of information that users view. It is the role of the geomatics practitioners to structure the product design processes in a manner that provide multiple product and service options that are easy to use.","edward kurwakumire lecturer geomatics department tshwane university of technology pretoria, south africa kurwakumiree@tut.ac.za",
101,Biogas Treatment And Upgrading Techniques  Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"biogas treatment, cleaning (removal of minor unwanted components of biogas), and upgrading (removal of co2 content) leads to a more valuable renewable energy resource called biomethane which is composed of ch4 (95– 99%) and co2 (1–5%), and no h2s. biogas is a mixture of gases whose composition is a function of mainly the process control and the properties of the substrate used. biogas is a renewable energy resource making it a valuable energy resource for multiple applications. biogas is a product of the anaerobic digestion process with many applications a renewable energy resource. the main component of biogas with energy value is methane, but biogas has impurities like moisture, carbon dioxide, siloxanes, hydrogen sulphide, siloxanes, hydrocarbons, oxygen, ammonia, oxygen, carbon monoxide and nitrogen whose presence is undesirable as they reduce the calorific value of biogas and create operational problems in the energy systems. this necessitates cleaning and upgrading of biogas to produce biomethane or clean biogas. this study is a comparative analysis several technologies used biogas cleaning and upgrading to biomethane. upgrading of biogas is possible removal of ipurities other than methane to get biomethane which has several applications as a substitute for natural gas in thermal and electrical power generation. purification or cleaning includes removal of moisture (h2o) and hydrogen sulphide (h2s) from raw biogas. after treatment, biogas can be used directly to produce as a fuel or upgraded further by removal of carbon dioxide. biomethane is a versatile biofuel with significant potential as a transition fuel. commercially available technologies for purification of biogas are primarily meant for co2 removal, but they can remove other impurities. the pressurized water scrubbing is the most used technique for removal of co2 from biogas. amine absorption method is preferred for use in smaller biogas production and in in applications with cheap heat sources while membrane permeation method has grown, because of availability of highly selective and low-cost polymeric materials.","biogas, biomethane, purification, carbon dioxide","Biogas is a gaseous product of the anaerobic digestion process with several potential applications as a renewable source of energy. Methane is the main component of biogas with energy value is methane, but has impurities like moisture, carbon dioxide, siloxanes, hydrogen sulphide, siloxanes, hydrocarbons, oxygen, ammonia, oxygen, carbon monoxide and nitrogen whose presence is undesirable as they reduce the calorific value of biogas and create operational problems in the energy systems. Biogas treatment and purification technologies will enhance the performance and wider application of biogas by upgrading it to biomethane for applications like fuel for vehicles and hydrogen production. Biomethane will also find more applications in applications where electrification in the short term is not possible e.g. heavy industry, long-distance transport and aviation industry. For applications like renewable natural gas for injection to gas grids, the upgrading facilities should achieve high methane purity and be located close to existing natural gas infrastructure. Application of biological techniques has increased as a result of their low cost and increasing efficiency in the removal of H2S but the physical-chemical technologies currently dominate the market for biogas cleaning with H2S adsorption on activated carbon being the most used process to remove H2S in biogas. Use of salts or iron oxides in situ is a common practice for cleaning biogas for heat boilers while bio filters are common in H2S removal for use in combined heat and power (CHP) units in heat and power generation. To attain very low concentration of H2S, in biomethane production, requires H2S removal in combination with removal of CO2 has to be done. Commercially available technologies for purification of biogas are primarily meant for CO2 removal, but they can remove other impurities. The pressurized water scrubbing is the most used technique for removal of CO2 from biogas. Amine absorption method is preferred for use in smaller biogas production and in in applications with cheap heat sources while membrane permeation method has grown, because of availability of highly selective and low-cost polymeric materials. Circumstances that may be unique or specific to a project and raw biogas capacity may significantly affect the cost of different upgrading technologies.","industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke; moseskabeyi@yahoo.com oludolapo akanni. olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa",
102,Sugarcane Bagasse And Cane Trash As A Fuel  Moses Jeremiah. Barasa Kabeyi,"sugarcane bagasse is a by-product milling sugarcane and it is an important fuel resource for the sugar industry. bagasse is a fibrous, has low density material and has a wide range of particle sizes with high moisture content. sugarcane bagasse (scb) is among the most abundant agricultural residues globally in sugar producing countries. bagasse is mainly used as a fuel for cogeneration by the sugar factories, but has other applications like ethanol production, paper and pulp manufacture, biogas production and charcoal briquettes manufacture. the falling electricity prices and reducing global sugar prices due to excess sugar stock in the world market have made bagasse a very attractive fuel for grid-based electricity generation and supply making it a feasible diversification pathway for sugar factories. this study identifies the various physical, chemical, and thermodynamic properties of bagasse and sugar cane trash as fuels in the sustainable energy transition. the study recommends various policy initiatives to promote the use of bagasse and cane trash as a fuel particularly in heat and power generation. proposed measures include attractive feed in tariffs for cogenerated heat and power, tax incentives and measures to encourage investment, and a flexible power purchase agreement that recognizes the unique challenges facing the sugarcane manufacturing like unsteady supply of cane and hence inconsistent milling and fuel supply. bagasse has various pathways for exploitation as an energy resource i.e., direct combustion in boilers to produce heat for steam and power generation, anaerobic digestion to produce biogas and pyrolysis and gasification to produce syngas. syngas and biogas can further be upgraded to produce biomethane which has significant energy and process applications as a substitute of natural gas. bagasse has got three e major components, namely pith, fiber, and rind, key words: bagasse; cane rash; bagasse cogeneration. introduction sugarcane is a major crop in many countries globally grown commercially for the production of sugar abundant. sugarcane plant has one of the highest bioconversion efficiencies with ability to efficiently fix solar energy, to yield up to 55 tons of dry matter annually per hectare of land under cultivation. the harvested sugarcane leaves behind cane trash as the cane is transported to a sugar factory where it is crushed to extract juice at the mills or the diffuser leaving behind energy rich fibrous bagasse as the sugar is taken to the process house for sugar making(m. kabeyi & o. olanrewaju 2021; kabeyi 2020; kabeyi 2022). sugarcane bagasse is a renewable feedstock used for power generation and manufacturing cellulosic ethanol in among other applications(kabeyi 2020) . the energy potential of bagasse produced is more than enough to meet the heat and electricity energy needs of a traditional as well as modern sugar factory, making sugar factories ideal for grid based decentralized power generation. the main challenge facing many traditional sugar factories is that the existing technology adopted is inefficiently designed maximize bagasse burning as a disposal strategy and energy supply limited energy for the factory use (ike 2013; m. j. b. kabeyi & o. a. olanrewaju 2022c). the global price of sugar and petroleum products have shown variations since 1973, but the long term outlook shows a gradual increase fossil fuel prices and stagnation, in the price of sugar(paturau, 2012). this scenario explains, to a large degree, global interest in diversification by the sugar industry which shows that optimal use of sugar production 989",,,"moseskabeyi@yahoo.com; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban, south africa oludolapo akanni.olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban, south africa",

106,Future Of Urban Logistics In Singapore:   A Foresight Methodology,"the objective of urban logistics can be defined as finding efficient and effective ways to transport goods in urban areas. although urban logistics is extremely important for a city, as it delivers goods to residents and ensures adequate supplies in stores, it may potentially generate social, environmental, and economic externalities on the urban landscape. because of these opposing factors, designing and managing an urban logistics system is quite challenging. on top of that, due to the ever-changing technological landscapes, various uncertainties, and driving forces present in the system, its development cannot be projected simply by extrapolating past and current trends. to achieve a sustainable urban logistics future, planners and stakeholders need to develop a well-informed, long- term understanding of urban logistics to address challenges that lie beyond the horizon. in this paper, we introduce our ongoing foresight study and discuss the significance of adopting such tools in planning for the future of urban logistics where a high degree of uncertainty is present in the system.","urban freight, future, foresight, scenario planning",,"seyed mehdi zahraei school of business singapore university of social sciences, singapore zahraei@suss.edu.sg sougotam ghosh school of business singapore university of social sciences, singapore sougotam@suss.edu.sg",
107,Factors Influencing The Adoption Of Online Advertising  Within Podcast Episodes Among Generation Z,"the study is an approach on the quantitative method. accordingly, the survey is conducted on 246 respondents who are gen z (10-25 years old) and living at ho chi minh city (vietnam). based on the qualitative method with literature review and expert evaluation, six factors of entertainment, informativeness, irritation, credibility, narrative engagement, and social aspect are explored and employed in the research model. the quantitative method of exploratory factor analysis is applied to test how a relationship between six factors and attitude toward podcast ads and between attitude toward podcast ads and the adoption of online advertising within podcast episodes. in parallel, the group testing is also taken into account of the study, this is a support to confirm which group of gender, income, and online time are more involved in the adoption of online advertising within podcast episodes.","online advertising, gen z, podcast","Gender Independent sample T test 0.307 Not different between male and female Income (three groups) Analysis of Variance (ANOA) 0.603 Not different between and within groups Online time (hours/day) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 0.546 Not different Conclusion and recommendations Research results of 246 respondents in the age group of Generation Z give a general picture of their behavior. Attitude towards podcast ads is depended on impacts of informativeness, credibility, narrative engagement, irritation, and social aspect. In which irritation has a negative impact. In addition, a significant impact of attitude towards podcast ads on the adoption of online advertising within podcast episodes is confirmed. It's also important to note that, different genders, incomes, and time spent online watching and listening to podcast ads, don't all have different views on the adoption of online advertising within podcast episodes. As resulted, some recommendations should be considered. Firstly, a successful podcast adds requires an understanding of who are target audience. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to their interests and preferences. This will help the company choose advertisers and products that align with your audience's needs and interests. Secondly, be mindful of the frequency and placement of ads. Too many ads can be overwhelming and lead to listener drop-off. Consider spacing out ads throughout your episode or concentrating them at the beginning or end. In sum, Encouraging audience to embrace online advertising within podcast episodes requires a strategic approach that maintains their trust and keeps them engaged. Here's how the company can make the adoption of online advertising more appealing to your podcast audience:","in ho chi minh city (vietnam) tu ngo dan thu undergraduate student, ueh-international school of business 17 pham ngoc thach street, vo thi sau ward, district 3 ho chi minh city, vietnam email: 22003190@student.westernsydney.edu.vn",
108,Sustainable Supplier Evaluations And Order Allocation With  Multiple Products Using Machine Learning,"this study is to propose a framework for sustainable supplier evaluation and optimal allocation of orders for multi- product and multi-period. in order to forecast demand, the study employed a machine learning algorithm. concurrently, an integrated mathematical programming model, encompassing four crucial sustainability factors, is formulated. this model effectively allocates purchase orders to suppliers based on the outcomes of the evaluation process. the model also accommodates the distribution of orders across various time frames and diverse product categories. subsequently, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model are assessed through sensitivity analysis via a real-world case study implemented within an authentic supply chain setting.","demand forecasting, order allocation","This study proposes an framework for sustainable supplier evaluation and allocating orders for a multi-product spice company. The findings demonstrate that each product is supplied by two different providers, with orders aligned to meet demand, ensuring all requirements are fulfilled. When changing the weights of the criteria so that cost-related criteria are more emphasized, the model gives out a much lower total purchasing cost, but also values that are less desirable in other criteria. It is also observed that changing the minimum value number of suppliers results in better average defective fractions, timely delivery rates, and environmental scores at the expense of increased purchasing costs and higher risk of supply disruption. The model proposed in this study covers the fundamental aspects in sustainable supplier selection and order allocation, and can be applied in not only the spice industry but also other fields as well. This paper, however, does have some limitations. First, all parameters are considered to be constant, and data uncertainty is omitted, which can be inaccurate in practice. Second, the sustainable issue of supply chain interruption is only dealt with by requiring at least two suppliers for each product, while the social issues focus solely on the supplier element rather than all stakeholders of the supply chain. Hence, additional techniques for dealing with this problem should be developed. For future research, the forecasting methods should be compared to other algorithms and techniques for more accurate forecasting. Fuzzy numbers should be used to estimate uncertain input parameters, meaning that some constraints and objective functions could also be fuzzy. Lastly, since the sustainable issues in supplier selection and order allocation comprise various aspects and hence can be complicated, it is recommended that the model consider these aspects more deeply to further emphasize the importance of sustainability in the supply chain.","huynh uyen my, ha thi xuan chi, and pham huynh tram school of industrial engineering and management international university, ho chi minh city vietnam national university, ho chi minh city myuhuynh1906@gmail.com, htxchi@hcmiu.edu.vn, phtram@hcmiu.edu.vn",
109,A Cutting Plan Of One-Dimensional Materials To Reduce  Loss With Matlab Software,"this study aims to address the one-dimensional cutting stock problem (1d-csp) by developing an optimized approach for designing cutting plans for one-dimensional construction materials with the primary goal of minimizing material waste during the cutting process. the methodology involves the implementation of a matlab algorithm based on linear programming principles and uses data derived from previous studies to formulate efficient cut-off plans. the investigation entails an analysis of the collected data from relevant studies, focusing on total material consumption and loss within the cutting plans. the study begins by considering foundational variables, which encompass the length of the standard linear inventory, the required lengths for each type, and the overall quantity of required lengths. these parameters are then processed using matlab software to establish a solution through linear programming. the comparative analysis involves evaluating the collected data to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model. this comparison encompasses the assessment of standard linear inventory utilization, material utilization effectiveness, and the residual waste generated during the cutting process. in comparison to the first relevant research, the developed method yields a material cutting plan with a loss rate of 1.21%, requiring less than one standard linear material inventory—improving upon the original result of 1.24%. similarly, when compared to the second relevant study involving ten cases, the developed method generates a material cutting plan with a loss rate of 6.45%, utilizing fewer than three standard linear materials.","cutting plan, cutting loss, linear programming","and Discussion The goal of the research was to develop a one-dimensional linear material cutting plan to reduce losses during the cutting process. This was accomplished using a Matlab software and included a thorough investigation of 11 case studies.

110,Improvement Proposal Applying Lean Manufacturing In A  Mype: Case Study In A Dental Center,"in recent years, mypes in the health sector have been affected by the sars-cov-2 virus, which allowed the identification of certain deficiencies present in the service model. this case study focuses on dental centers because according to research, it is one of the areas with the highest risk of contagion, which is why they saw the need to implement new procedures that guarantee the safety of the service, which decreased their operational performance. this article proposes an integrated application of lean healthcare in a dental center, managing to improve its performance through the measurement of kpi's. the lean healthcare application improved the performance of dental centers, which was evidenced by the results of indicators such as decreased cycle time and waiting time.","lean healthcare, 5s, vsm, 2020","In this case study, it was identified that the healing procedure is the most frequent; Therefore, the improvements focused on the service flow of this. However, many of the improvements impact the service flow of the other procedures. In line with what was mentioned, there were quantifiable and non-quantifiable root causes, of which all the non- quantifiable ones were solved and the most relevant 80% of the quantifiable ones were selected. These root causes were reflected in the long waiting time of patients; inefficient use of the work area, low service capacity and high number of claims, for these inputs the 5S and VSM tool was selected, although the use of each tool was specifically established for each input, they had a synergistic effect. The deployment of this research followed the DMAIC methodology, which established the stages to follow in logical sequence to achieve improvements, it can be concluded that the use of this methodology helped to maintain order and continuous monitoring throughout the research process. Finally, it was evidenced that these improvements had a positive impact on the financial results of the company, obtaining an increase of 19.49 percentage points in the net margin, for which a demand of 12 patients per day was considered. Likewise, the service capacity amounts to 17 patients; Therefore, if efforts are made to increase demand and work at 100% of its capacity, a net margin of 73.60% would be reached, which increases by 8.02 percentage points with respect to the margin obtained with 12 patients.

115,Strategic Decisions Making Analysis Of The 2015 Paris  Climate Change Negotiation,"the 2015 paris climate change agreement stands as a transformative milestone in climate change negotiations. this historic summit united developed and developing countries in a binding commitment to combat the effects of climate change. notably, even the largest greenhouse gas emitters, china and the u.s., displayed an unprecedented cooperative stance in addressing this global challenge. this study examines the agreement's sustainability, considering the collaborative efforts of both nations. the graph model for conflict resolution provides a strategic framework tailored for complex scenarios involving multiple stakeholders and intricate decision-making dynamics. it forecasts potential compromise outcomes in real- world disputes, offering strategic insights. in this research, the gmcr framework analyzes the conflict among major greenhouse gas emitters during the december 2015 paris climate change agreement. during the 2015 paris climate negotiations, key emitters were identified based on their emissions. the united states contributed about 14.02% of total ghg emissions, while china accounted for roughly 29.18%. developed countries, excluding the u.s., were responsible for approximately 19.52% of ghg emissions, and emerging countries, excluding china, contributed around 9.47%. developing nations collectively accounted for about 0.02% of ghg emissions, constituting approximately 72.19% of global emissions. the u.s. committed to reducing emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels within a decade. however, challenges arose due to legal and political complexities, hindering their target achievement. china aimed to reduce carbon intensity by 60% to 65% from 2005 levels by 2030, increase non-fossil fuel energy consumption to nearly 20%, and enhance forest stock volume by about 4.5 billion cubic meters. china allocated $3.1 billion to support developing nations in addressing climate change. the european union and developed countries aimed for a minimum 40% reduction in domestic emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. unique strategies were adopted; france focused on nuclear energy, and germany prioritized renewables despite challenges like high energy prices. emerging nations invested in renewables, energy efficiency, carbon pricing, and climate adaptation. the agreement acknowledged the differentiation between developed and emerging economies, granting flexibility to developing nations in emissions reduction goals. developing countries submitted nationally determined contributions (ndcs) outlining emission reduction commitments. they pursued policies, programs, and engaged in international mechanisms such as the green climate fund for ndc implementation and climate adaptation. the 2015 paris climate change agreement's dispute exemplified a pivotal moment in international environmental diplomacy. this intricate conflict encompassed diverse interests and responsibilities among nations, particularly china and the u.s., the largest emitters. the graph model for conflict resolution (gmcr) will delve into decision makers' strategies during the negotiation, aiming to reach a resolution. additionally, the prisoner's dilemma, a classic game theory model, will shed light on how rational decision makers, despite potential benefits from cooperation, often make suboptimal choices due to uncertainty and differing interests. this model will depict the behavior of decision makers during the 2015 paris climate change agreement.","game theory, climate change, conflict",,"abdullah alrabghi, yasir aljefri, nawaf sahli, khalid atallah, abdulrahman alsharef department of industrial and systems engineering university of jeddah, jeddah, saudi arabia aalrabghi@uj.edu.sa, yaljefri@uj.edu.sa, nsahli0001.stu@uj.edu.sa, katallah.stu@uj.edu.sa, aalsherif00.stu@uj.edu.sa",
116,From Theory To Practice: The Impact Of 3D Printing On  Supply Chain Configurations And Cost Efficiency –,,,"Our results illustrate that while deploying 3DP(s) allow for different supply chain configurations, it is not a binary choice between one configuration and the other, rather, it depends on the number of facilities where the 3DP(s) are deployed and thus identifying the point where the decision tips from one configuration to the other. Additionally, in our case, the number of printers deployed have a negligible effect on the configuration. Furthermore, since this case study has been conducted in Germany, which is known to have a high minimum wage, and based on our assumption that each printer requires an operating personal, this has led to a labour cost having a significant impact on the 3DP positioning within the supply chain model. Alternatively, if a similar case was to be conducted in a country with lower labour and transportation costs, this might possibly have an impact on the decision. To demonstrate a deeper understanding of the research challenge, we recommend the replicability of our model, through different scenario analysis, where variables such as labour costs, 3D printing costs and transportation costs could be modified within plausible ranges for further analysis. We also recommend the study of carbon footprint of both models as an environmental factor in the sustainability performance. Table 7. Warehouse -Store cost difference table Table 8.

117,"Urban Farming Waste To Energy Community-Based  Adli H. Ibrahim1, Dina Nurul Fitria1,2","to determine if an agriculture venture is viable, it is necessary to conduct a thorough business analysis. the purpose of these studies is to determine the utilization urban farming crops of waste to generate energy (bioenergy). agricultural wastes are the focus of the current research into the production of bioenergy of the biomass variety. the goals of this study are to (1) understand the procedure involved in using waste from farming for bioenergy; (2) identify indicators of the feasibility of using agricultural waste for bioenergy; and (3) develop methods for controlling both internal and external factors that affect this process. mixed-methods research (mmr), return on investment (roi), breakeven point (bep), descriptive statistics, and the strengths and weaknesses (swot) analysis were all employed to analyze the study's data. an evaluation of the potential for agribusinesses to profit from recycling food scraps into biofuel; a case study of rw 06 betawi cultural village obtaining values of 0.85 for r/c and 0.85 for b/c, -14% for roi, and 0.116 for production bep at a price of rp. 8.164 per piece of bep demonstrates the complexity of the internal and external factors that influence the utilization of agricultural waste in rw 06 betawi cultural village. therefore, it can be determined that farming agricultural waste in rw 06 betawi cultural village is not economically viable, according to an analysis of the possibility of its utilization in agribusiness.","waste management, urban farming, bioenergy, betawi village","Based on the findings and prior deliberations, the subsequent deductions have been drawn: The community of RW 06 Betawi Culture Village is formed as a result of the marketing process involving the utilization of agricultural waste. The marketing activities are conducted in collaboration with each regional team (RT) in order to disseminate information regarding the locations where people or peasant groups require fertiliser derived from agricultural waste. The steps of the process involve the coordination between the RT chiefs to provide information. The RT chairman is responsible for disseminating information regarding the recipients of the fertiliser, which may include citizens or peasant groups. Subsequently, the fertilizers can be obtained from the RW office. The recovery process of agricultural waste is characterized by a methodical approach and minimal raw material requirements. The process involved in this study entailed the collection of yellowed leaves, which were subsequently treated with EM4 and melase. The process has several stages. Initially, yellow and dry leaves are gathered and placed into a container. Subsequently, the leaves are subjected to destruction. Adequate water, together with EM4 liquid and molasses, are introduced into the container. The container is then tightly sealed. On a daily basis, the contents of the container are monitored and sprayed with EM4 liquids and molasses for a duration of around one month. The financial implications of utilising agricultural waste in RW 06 Village of Vegetable Culture. Based on the findings, the author can draw the conclusion that the utilisation of agricultural waste is advantageous and justifiable. This is supported by the fact that the R/C ratio is 1.14, while the B/C ratio is 0.14. Additionally, the return on investment (ROI) is calculated to be 14%. Furthermore, the break-even point (BEP) for production is determined to be 87 fruits, with a break-even price (BEP price) of Rs. 6.114 per fruit. There are various factors, both internal and external, that influence the utilisation of agricultural waste in RW Village of Buddhism in 2006. However, these factors lack adequate support from the relevant disciplines, as they are not sufficiently comprehensive. Additionally, the local population lacks the capacity to sustain the environment, and the nature of environmental development is insufficient. External considerations encompass the presence of a substantial need for fertiliser, which is readily recognized by parties exhibiting irresponsibility.Future Research The utilization of agricultural waste within the RW 06 Rural Rural Behavioral Culture should be sustained in order to enhance performance and promote the overall well-being of the community. In light of this, the following recommendations are proposed: There is a need to raise awareness among the residents of RW06 Betawi Cultural Village regarding the need of environmental sustainability. This can be achieved by fostering a familiarity with agricultural practices, so enabling all people to appreciate the significance of utilizing agricultural waste. There is a necessity to enhance the marketing network in order to ensure the dissemination of marketing efforts throughout the entirety of the South Jakarta region. There is a necessity to engage in training program that focus on risk management, financial management, marketing management, and human resource management. In order to facilitate the cultivation of citizens' skills and provide professional assistance in the management of agricultural waste, it is imperative to establish appropriate measures.","department of agribusiness, trilogi university, jakarta, indonesia 1ibrahimadli87@gmail.com; 2 corresponding author: dedinanf@gmail.com",
118,Utilization Of Methane Formed Of Urban Waste  Management (Wasteco) In Mahakam Lestari Village:,"the issue of trash management poses a significant challenge in the region, particularly in urban areas where the quantity of garbage continues to rise. however, the existing waste management strategies are unable to effectively address this escalating trend. within the realm of household waste, household rubbish encompasses both organic and inorganic waste. the former category includes remnants of vegetables and food, while the latter encompasses items such as food packaging, plastic bags, paper, and bottles. additionally, household waste extends to encompass water resulting from various washing operations, among other similar sources. the household waste discussed in this study originates from routine activities inside residential settings, with the exception of certain organic waste and refuse materials. the sanitary authorities collected the household rubbish from their separate regions. once gathered, the home waste is transported to a temporary disposal location, commonly referred to as a temporary processing location (tps). following its transportation from the temporary storage facility (tps), the garbage is further conveyed to the ultimate disposal location known as the final disposal point (tpa). the ultimate destination for waste management is the final discharge location, where waste is disposed of and then reused through recycling and other waste management procedures. one approach involves the conversion of waste materials into methane gas. problem statement. the process of transforming domestic waste into methane gas methane gas is an invisible, scentless, and extremely combustible gas composed of a single carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. methane gas possesses properties that are 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of its capacity to trap heat within the earth's atmosphere. if left unmanaged and underutilised, methane gases have the potential to exacerbate the existing levels of greenhouse gases present in the earth's atmosphere. methane constitutes a significant component of biogas. biogas is comprised of various gases, primarily methane (ch4) and carbon dioxide (co2), with trace amounts of hydrogen sulphide (h2s) and ammonia. ammonia (nh3) is a compound composed of one nitrogen atom bonded to three in addition to hydrogen (h2), the presence of sulphur nitrogen, water content, and carbon dioxide (co2) has been reported. both organic and inorganic waste materials have the potential to be transformed into methane gas, commonly referred to as biogas. methane gas (ch4) is a gaseous compound that is produced by anaerobic bacteria, particularly the methanogenic bacterium. significant quantities of methane gas were detected in the remnants of vegetation, straw, animal waste, grasslands, sedimentary formations, and even straw. method. methane gas is spontaneously generated at the final disposal site through the process of bacterial evaporation, even in the absence of deliberate processing or the inclusion of specific compounds. the burning of methane gas produces thermal energy, making it a viable option for alternative fuel sources or power generation 1156",,,"case study of p.t. pertamina hulu mahakam as pt pertamina hulu energi subsidiary of upstream pertamina elvina winda sagala, dony indrawan2 ,ridwan faizal iwan, frans alexander hukom3 , mira tyas annisa, kris radityorini and dina nurul fitria4 pertamina hulu energi1, jakarta, indonesia, pertamina hulu indonesia2, jakarta, indonesia pertamina hulu mahakam3, balikpapan, east kalimantan, indonesia department of agribusiness, trilogi university, jakarta, indonesia (elvina.sagala@pertamina.com)1 (dony.indrawan@pertamina.com) (iwanrf@pertamina.com)1 (frans.hukom@pertamina.com) (mira.tyas@pertamina.com)3 (mk.kris.radityorini@pertamina.com) 4corresponding author: dedinanf@gmail.com",

Systems thinking is a way of looking at the world that emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things (Jokonya, 2016). It is a useful tool for strategizing and addressing complex problems such as the challenges of ICT integration in Zimbabwe. Applying the systems approach, several strategies can be implemented to effectively use ICT in Zimbabwe for sustainable development. ICT Infrastructure Development: Investing in ICT infrastructure, countries can improve their ability to connect to the global economy and increase their competitiveness in the digital age (Kayisire & Wei, 2016). One of the key problems in Zimbabwe's ICT sector is the lack of adequate and sufficient infrastructure. To effectively integrate ICT, the government must focus on establishing an efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to facilitate connectivity across the country. This involves investing in high-speed networks (Starlink), fiber-optic networks, mobile broadband, and other forms of infrastructure that allow data transfer. Developing Appropriate Policies and Regulations by Government: A bad or unsustainable environment or business ecosystem affects the efficiency and adoption of ICT in any country. Recent research by (Lee et al. 2016) proves that government policies affect ICT development. The research was done to analyse different government policies in USA, Japan, China, and South Korea. The government of Zimbabwe must establish policies and regulations that foster innovation and promote growth in ICT, while also creating a legal framework that safeguards intellectual property. The ICT working environment must be sustainable, and this must be supported in the policies. Encouraging public-private partnerships: A theoretical issue that has dominated the ICT field for many years is that partnerships between the public and private sectors can be effective in driving ICT adoption in many countries. It has been conclusively shown that in countries such as India, the United Kingdom, China, and the USA, public-private partnerships are seen as a strategy for promoting ICT development (Kuriyan & Ray, 2009).These partnerships can help to provide funding for ICT projects, as well as support the development of policies and regulations that promote ICT growth and innovation hence","spur economic development.” hagreaves kumba master of industry engineering student faculty of engineering and the built environment department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban,south africa 22176504@dut4life.ac.za oludolapo akanni olanrewaju head of department and senior lecturer faculty of engineering and the built environment department of industrial engineering durban university of technology durban,south africa oludolapoo@dut.ac.za","References
