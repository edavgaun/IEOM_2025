This article is based on a literature reviews whose goal is to firstly to determine building components that require preventive and predictive maintenance strategy and to determine an appropriate maintenance strategy between preventive and predictive for buildings in South Africa. Conclusions. The primary objectives of predictive and preventive maintenance are to minimise the cost of response to failures and improve asset reliability. Both types of maintenance are considered scheduled maintenance since orders for repairs are prepared well ahead of the actual date of maintenance. Preventive maintenance is conducted on a regular basis whereas predictive maintenance is scheduled according to equipment conditions. Predictive maintenance entail monitoring the state and productivity of tools utilizing advanced technology and data analysis. Its objective is to anticipate possible faults and enable proactive maintenance procedures, as a result of mitigating unexpected downtime. Conversely, preventive maintenance entails planned inspection cleaning, and repairs which aims to stop faults prior to happening. It develops maintenance schedules based on past performance and manufacturer guidelines to ensure consistent service and handle observed hazards. Findings. Both preventive and predictive maintenance play an important role on the components of the building, more specially because the most building comprise of preventive and predictive elements which requires maintenance of different strategy. Preventive strategy is mostly important because it has components that predictive strategy is not applicable to such as foundations, paint, roof, tiling etc. Secondly preventive maintenance is significant because it can also be applicable to other building components that requires predictive strategy. Recommendation. The primary objective of this study was to determine an appropriate maintenance strategy between preventive and predictive for buildings in South Africa. This included determining building components that require preventive and predictive maintenance strategies. Based on the literature both strategies play different roles on the building both having an essential impact on the operation of the building. It is therefore advisable that both strategies be considered as follows. • Preventive maintenance should be applied to components that require inspections and monitoring such as foundations, roof, wall, paint, tiles doors, windows, doo frames etc. • While predictive maintenance should be applied to components that makes use of advance technology and analyse data from many systems and parts of the structure","an investigation into appropriate maintenance strategy between preventive and predictive for buildings in south africa maphutha letsau khutso department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg. rsa letsaukhutso@gmail.com morena william nkomo and stephan molusiwa ramabodu department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg. rsa mnkomo@uj.ac.za, molusiwar@uj.ac.za",
