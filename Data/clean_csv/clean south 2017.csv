0,Game Of Patterns: An Approach For Solving Mixed Integer  Nonlinear Optimization Problems,"this article presents a novel direct search method of optimization, game of patterns (gop) method, so- called by the author, for solving unconstrained mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems. the gop method is based on: a set of Œ∑ random patterns search, which initially forms the set of Œ∑ active players, namely, ‚Ñã [], ‚Ä¶ ‚Ñã  ; and a game rule framework. at each kth game round, each th active player ‚Ñã [ ] will explore inside his own pattern at the current kth round. the strategy of each th player is given by a random quantity  [ ], which will allow each player to explore inside his own pattern by a set of  [ ]trial points. at the beginning of each kth game round, each active th player bets  [ ] according to his budge me for each round. at the end of each kth round, the player that has identified the best objective function value is considered the winner of the kth round, therefore the rest of active players must pay off to the winner their bets. this process is recurrently repeated until that has been disqualified  ‚àí1 players from the game. it is worthwhile to point out that any player will be disqualified if his balance account  [ ] is less than his budget me for the current kth round.",game theory,"The GoP method has shown us to be a good enough heuristic method for identifying at least a local optimal solutions to mixed integer nonlinear optimization problems. Preliminary results have allowed us to figure out the GoP method can be used for solving mixed integer nonlinear global optimization problems. However, we need to study some converge properties of the GoP method first. An experimental scheme will be proposed for tuning the parameters of the GoP method for improving its performance. In order to keep developing the method, we shall also research others discrete distribution for choosing the strategy of each player for improving the competition among the players. A. Appendix A set of mixed integer optimization problems are here shown for testing the GoP. A notation is defined for each problem, which allows us to define the dimension of the problems in ‚Ñù' √ó ‚Ñ§(. A.1 Goldstein-Price problem Although the Goldstein-Price function is defined in the two-dimension real numeric field, we have used it for testing the GoP method, due to the fact this function has been frequently used to test global optimization algorithms (Shi and √ìlafsson, 2000). Let k($) denote k($) = [1 + l$() + $(m) + 1n m(19 ‚àí14$() + 3$()m)m ‚àí14$(m) + 6$()$(m) + 3$(m)m] ‚àô[30 + l2$() ‚àí3$(m)n m J18 ‚àí32$() + 12$()mO m + 48$(m) ‚àí36$()$(m) + 27$(m)m] , (7) which is our objective function of the constrained optimization problem, subject to: ‚àí2.5 ‚â§$(t) ‚â§2, ‚àÄ V ‚àà{1,2}. Using penalty functions, the problem can be expressed as follows: min‚àà‚Ñùu #($) = k($) + ‚àë 2 vt($(t)) m t/ , (8) where k was fixed at 10i, and vtl$(t)n = maxl‚àí2.5 ‚àí$(t), 0n + maxl$(t) ‚àí2,0n , ‚àÄ V ‚àà{1,2} (9) Solution. The global minimum is located at $S = (0, ‚àí1)x, and a value of #($S) = 3.

3,"Bogota, Colombia, Oct 25-26, 2017   Challenges And Opportunities In Computing Logistics","revenue generation of a logistics company depends on how the logistics cost of a shipment is calculated. logistics cost of a shipment is a function of distance & speed of the shipment travel in a particular network , its volumetric size and dead weight. logistics billing is based mainly on the consumption of the scarce resource (space or weight carrying capacity of a carrier). shipment‚Äôs size or deadweight is a function of product and packaging weight, dimensions and flexibility. hence, to arrive at a standard methodology to compute accurate cost to bill the customer, the interplay among above mentioned physical attributes along with their measurement plays key role. this becomes even more complex for an ecommerce company, like flipkart, which caters to shipments from both warehouse and marketplace in an unorganized non-standard market like india. in this paper, we‚Äôll explore various methodologies to define a standard way of billing the non-standard shipments across wide range of size, shape and deadweight. those will be, usage of historical volumetric / dead weight data to arrive at a factor which can be used to compute the logistics cost of a shipment, also calculating the real/contour volume of a shipment to address the problem of irregular shipment shapes which cannot be solved by conventional bounding box volume measurements. we‚Äôll also discuss certain key business practices and operational quality considerations needed to bring standardization and drive appropriate ownership in the ecosystem.","logistics, logistics cost, volumetric weight, deadweight, contour volume",,"cost in e-commerce supply chain pramod ghadge flipkart internet private ltd. bangalore, karnataka 560034, india pramod.ghadge@flipkart.com swadesh srivastava flipkart internet private ltd. bangalore, karnataka 560034, india swadesh.srivastava@flipkart.com",

5,Blood Fractionation Chromatography  Mason Chen,"fractionation is important to understand someone‚Äôs health. how we can simulate blood fractionation through a simple, inexpensive ink spread experiment more about blood fractionation and liquid chromatography. cotton will spread on ink the most because it has the most pores. pilot ink spreads fast because it is water-based (low viscosity). higher temperatures should result in more spread because of lower viscosity. we measured the ink spread by taking the average between high and low ink mark points. we check our measurement repeatability and determined our sample size. the results repeatedly showed that nylon was the material with the least ink spread, with water not spreading at all, pilot ink barely spreading, and india ink spreading very little. for polyester, water spread much better than nylon. it was clearly shown that higher temperatures meant more spread. we heated the cotton cloth only since using heat transfer from the water to the ink is too long and the water vapor would block the pores from absorbing the ink. we learned more about using statistics graphs and tables. we also learned how to control the experiment and determine the sample size through teamwork building. we would thank our teachers and parents for advising.","chromatography, viscosity, pilot ink",This project has designed ink spreading experimental and demonstrated the ink spread property to simulate the blood fractionation. It‚Äôs very critical to control the measurement repeatability and quantify the spread distance. The cotton cloth has a better spread behavior over Polyester and Nylon due to its better media pore affinity. Pilot Ink is also over India Ink due to its lower viscosity. Heating the cloth over Ink can better control on temp factor and improve the ink spreading. Confidence interval statistics and Power Test sample size are applied in order to meet the project budget limit.

6,Optimize Road Closure Control In Triathlon Event  Zonghuan (Jason) Li,"the triathlon is an olympic event that affects the entire city. this stem paper is to manage the road closure time of a triathlon event in any city who may have a triathlon event. in order to quantify the road closure impact to meet 5.5 hours of closure time, authors have developed three different models: (1) ideal scenario, (2) practical scenario, and (3) potential scenario. in the first ideal scenario, authors applied minitab descriptive statistics and box plots to optimize the event schedule and sequence among three triathlon sports (swim, run, and bike). in the second practical scenario, authors have managed the risks such as: pre-event preparation time, award ceremony time, dependency on gender, age, category factors, 2000+ players, safety/health, etc. in the last potential scenario, we have further optimized the zone close and open period. we can minimize the zone wasted usage (waiting for players) based on the worst case scenario. the biggest selling point of this paper is not just on the closure cost reduction, but also on the safety/health protection as well as promoting customer service and local business. this event may be completed on the event day, but our excellent customer service can attract more visitors to join the next city event. key words: triathlon, descriptive statistics, minitab, model, non-parametric 1. introduction triathlon is a multisport event consisting of sequential swim, cycle, and run disciplines performed over a variety of distances1. the purpose of this paper is to build an accurate model to manage a triathlon event in a city. there is one concern / restriction; the road closure time for the triathlon event has to be less than or equal to 5.5 hours in order to minimize the impact to the local people and business. we used data from 2017 himcm competition. in order to make that happen, we need to build a model that could tell us critical information like when we should hold the event, how are we going to arrange the sequence among the three sports etc. we will apply minitab descriptive statistics, and three models to optimize the road closure time and area. 2. building three models three different models were constructed for three different scenarios; one being the ideal scenario, assuming that no unexpected events such as injuries, weather concerns occur. therefore, the first ideal model may not be practical and needs certain improvements the second model is the practical scenario, in which we consider the possible risks such as injuries, effect on local traffic and life overall, weather concerns, age dependency etc. we will take those into account and consider possible changes to the arrangement of the event in a practical sense. 37",,"We will start Triathlon event with swim, then run, and bike based on the cycle time distribution and safety consideration. In order to meet 5.5 hours of road closure time requirement, we need to apply 2 disqualify rules to shorten the event duration. We will also hold the award ceremony in the end, and we will not separate male and female players or by age factor, as our model shows that there is no significance in doing so. We will take safety risk as top priority. 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 04:1 5:00 04:00:00 03:45:00 03:30:00 03:1 5:00 03:00:00 02:45:00 02:30:00 S 0.0162352 R-Sq 0.0% R-Sq(adj) 0.0% FINALTM FINALTM = 0.1323 - 0.000036 AGE 42","25 longview court, hillsborough, ca 94010 jasonlzh2001@gmail.com mason chen 2187 morrill avenue, san jose, ca 95132 mason.chen.training@gmail.com","References

8,Biomechanical Based Athletic Potential  Assessment System,"athletic records are broken year after year, and the limits of human performance continue to be debated. just as soon as we think something can‚Äôt be done, someone comes along and shows us that it indeed can be done. it is revealed that having fast and slow twitch muscle fibers may determine what sports athletes excel at and how they respond to training. human muscle fiber type may influence what sports we are naturally good at or whether we are fast or strong. muscle fiber types can be broken down into two main types: slow twitch (type i) muscle fibers and fast twitch (type ii) muscle fibers. these distinctions seem to influence how muscles respond to training and physical activity, and each fiber type is unique in its ability to contract in a certain way. if it is possible to determine the proportion of these fibers, it helps for the early prediction of human capability for the selection of right event. slow twitch fibers help enable long-endurance feats such as distance running, while fast- twitch muscles fatigue faster but are used in powerful bursts of movements like sprinting and the proposed a prototype aims at finding which muscle fiber type is predominant and in that way foster the development to improve the capability of individuals,by evaluating the fast and slow twitch muscle fibers. predominance is found based on analyzing those parameters which differentiates slow and fast twitch muscle fiber. although many elite athletes are blessed with the right genetics for their sport and a great training routine, even recreational athletes can make the most of their abilities with optimal conditioning. 52 (c) ieom society international",,,catherine cleetus sahrdaya college of engineering & technology india,
9,A Compromise Programming Approach To Welding Flux  Performance Optimization,"welding flux design is a multi-objective optimization problem with several conflicting objectives. the traditional welding flux development is unwieldy process involving lengthy and costly, trial and error experiments and the optimum welding flux formulation is not guaranteed. this paper proposed a methodology that will prescribe an optimal welding flux formulation that is the closest to the ideal flux with minimum cost and experimental effort. response models developed by kanjilal and co-investigators were used to determine the optimal flux formulation using compromise programming. analytical hierarchy process was used to determine the weight (wj) to reflect the relative importance of each criterion. the response models for the weld metal properties, were optimised individually to determine the ideal points and to set up the payoff matrix. the payoff matrix developed for the eight criteria showed that two criteria were complementary while others were conflicting. the side plate ferrite and charpy impact strength were the two complementary criteria. the lp distance metric was used to determine the flux formulation for varying values of the p and wj. compromise programming is an efficient method in determining the welding flux formulation thereby eliminating the problem faced by the traditional method.","welding flux, payoff matrix, physics",Compromise programming model has been proposed for welding flux development for submerged arc welding. The approach is useful for determining the best compromise flux formulation when various conflicting performance criteria are considered. The weld metal responses such as microstructural and mechanical properties in submerged arc welding have been optimized. The proposed method eliminates the problem experienced by the traditional welding flux development to give the best balance among several conflicting quality criteria. The welding flux designer can use different weight structures to explore trade-off options before choosing the formulation that best suits his needs. This approach is also useful for identifying complementary and conflicting criteria.,"adeyeye a. d.

10,Recycled Aggregates For Green Concrete  Abrahams Mwasha And Rakesh Ramnath,"in this paper a fuller and thompson equation and gradation curves were applied to 100% recycled coarse aggregates (rca). a total of 300 samples of concrete made up 100% rca were analysed and tested at 7, 14 and 28 days according to bs en 12390-3, 2002. the average compressive strengths achieved for the recycled aggregates concrete was approximately 83.0 mpa, the highest ever recorded compressive strength from the concrete manufactured using 100% recycled course aggregates.",high strength,"and Recommendations This paper has demonstrated that recycled aggregates can be used to manufacture high strength concrete. Using high strength concrete manufactured using recycled concrete aggregates promotes sustainability this is because it is environmentally friendly and the landfills are relieved from concrete debris as well as both embodied energy and embodied pollution is reduced. The aim of this paper was set out to determine whether by applying particle packing optimization to recycled concrete aggregates and pre-soaking duration of the recycled aggregates would result in high strength concrete. It was found in this paper that gradations calculated according to the Fuller equation results in an aggregate combination with highest packing density. Having graded the natural and recycled aggregates according to the Fuller and Thompson (1907) equation/gradation charts has proven to result in an aggregate combination that carried the highest packing density when compared to combinations above and below this gradation curve. It was found that natural aggregate concrete produced the highest compressive strengths (106.2 MPa) followed by the HSRA concrete (82.7 MPa) and then the LSRA concrete (76.9MPa). These results are superior to those obtained from the published research on using recycled aggregates as shown in Table 7. The high compressive strength might have been induced about by the utilization of micro silica. Micro silica like other pozzolanic materials leads to a reduction of the size of the crystalline compounds, particularly, calcium hydroxide, consequently, there is a reduction of the thickness of the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) in high-strength concrete. The densification of the interfacial transition zone allows for efficient load transfer between the cement mortar and the coarse aggregate, contributing to the strength of the concrete. For very high- strength concrete where the matrix is extremely dense, a weak aggregate may become the weak link in concrete 76","department of civil and environmental engineering university of the west indies st augustine campus trinidad and tobago amwasha@yahoo.com, rakeshramnath@hotmail.com","References

11,Development Of An Effective Maintenance Concept For  Enhancement Of Competitive Advantage: A Case Study Of East,"due to global competition, many organizations are coming up with ways of sharpening their competitive edge. this has been achieved through cost leadership, differentiation of goods and services and lastly, through quick response to the needs of the customers. to respond to these market requirements, manufacturers are using high-tech equipment. they are also adopting new material control methods such as just-in-time philosophy. set-up costs are also being minimized to a minimum. all these factors are shifting the focus to maintenance since unreliability and availability of manufacturing equipment will result in high maintenance costs, low profitability, low production and an increase in customer dissatisfaction. at east african portland cement company, the raw mill plant has led to the above problems which in turn lead to negative feedbacks from the customers and as a result, there is need to develop a maintenance concept that will respond to the challenges mentioned above. consequently, in this research an analysis of various the maintenance concepts were investigated. overall equipment effectiveness of the raw mill plant was evaluated and analyzed. downtime analysis was also done to establish the major causes of low plant availability. from the research, it can be deduced that east african portland cement company requires a harmonized maintenance concept regarding inspection, regular maintenance; repair and overhaul, scheduled and preventive maintenance of the main components as well as environmental auditing during operation to ensure that the plant is fully operational and efficient. total productive maintenance concept therefore has been identified as key to the meeting of organizational objectives of the company. a customized framework of total productive maintenance deployment at east african portland cement company has been developed with six step transformation steps used in embedding high performance culture. it is expected that an implementation of this project will lead to a reduction in failures, time to perform a repair and an elongation in the mean time between failures hence higher plant 79 (c) ieom",,"The Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) has been analyzed for three financial years (2010/2011, 2011/2012, 2012/2013) and it was established that the achieved OEE value has a huge variance compared with the targeted OEE value of 90%. By comparing with the world- class value for OEE which is 85.41%, there was no single month in which the targeted OEE value was achieved for the 36 months period It was also established that the three major causes of low availability of the Raw mill plant are downtime due to production (scheduled cleaning, start ups, rework), works (planned shutdown maintenance) and mechanical breakdown. A Pareto analysis reveals that a reduction in the downtime of the three can greatly reduce the overall downtime on the raw mill hence resulting into improved availability A customized framework of TPM deployment at EAPCC has been developed to improve Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) to 85% and this will result into improved productivity and profitability. The developed customized framework of TPM deployment at EAPCC could be adopted by other similar manufacturing plants and also be used along other literature. Comparative analysis of the various maintenance concepts has been done and OEE methodology explored to determine the need for TPM deployment. By developing an effective maintenance concept that binds together all the maintenance policies, maintenance actions and strategies for maintenance, the number of stoppages in the raw mill will greatly be reduced by increasing the mean time between stoppages. This will increase the monthly production for the company as a result of improved raw mill availability and reliability. With increased production, the revenue will be greatly increased resulting into increased profitability. 92 (c) IEOM",african portland cement company japheth ombogo east african portland cement kenya,"References

12,Surface Profile Of Objects For 3D Printers By Fringe Pattern  Javier Cruz Salgado,"fringe projection entails projecting a fringe pattern or grating on an object and viewing it from a different direction. it is a convenient technique for contouring objects that are too coarse to be measured with standard interferometry. fringe projection is related to optical triangulation using a single point of light and light sectioning where a single line is projected onto an object and viewed in a different direction to determine the surface contour (case et al. 1987). the fringe patterns are projected on to the object surface and the deformed grating image is captured by a ccd camera for subsequent analysis. phase shifting techniques have been employed to determine the phase value. the phase variation is achieved by using a linear translation stage incorporated to the grating. in this paper, the surface profile of objects for 3d printers is determined by using fringe pattern. biography javier cruz salgado bs, industrial engineering, universidad tecnol√≥gica de le√≥n, march 2007. ms, manufacturing and industrial engineering, ciatec/conacyt, august 2012. phd manufacturing and industrial engineering 2015, ciatec/conacyt. intern at materials research department ciatec 2011-2012. research stay at illinois institute of technology in the department of applied mathematics 2013. ¬© ieom society international 103",,,"research and technological development department, universidad polit√©cnica del bicentenario (upb), silao, guanajuato 36283, m√©xico jcruzs@upbicentenario.edu.mx",

15,Reducing Outbound Transportation Costs: A Case Study  Edgar Granda And Bernardo Villarreal,"the problem of decreasing truck transportation costs for mexican firms is of great interest and a challenge due to the currently deficient supply structure. this work deals with the case of leading mexican tobacco manufacturer that requires a reduction of its outbound transportation cost under a declining market scenario. the approach applied to achieve the objective includes the elimination of important transportation wastes through mathematical modeling techniques. truck fill loss and distance travelled in excess are identified as the main wastes existent in the transportation of finished product from the manufacturing plant, located in monterrey, to three regional warehousing hubs, and then, from these to 70 distribution centers located throughout the country. the application of location and/or routing models imbedded into a decision analysis scheme and supported by a gis system is carried out to obtain the solution to several scenarios developed by the management of the company. results and advances of their implementation are provided.",shown in figure 1,"As initially mentioned, the problem of concern in this paper is the reduction of outbound transportation cost. The firm of concern is a leading producer and distributor of tobacco products to its hubs and DC¬¥s across Mexico. All the outbound transportation of FG is carried out completely by external suppliers. The management in charge of distribution and logistics of the firm decided to establish the objective of reducing inbound transportation. The scheme used to define the improvement strategy for reducing inbound transportation cost is based on the stages suggested by Di Vece et al., (2015) and Moore (2006). In summary, this document briefly describes the efforts that are part of the first three stages: price negotiation, streamlining operations and optimization. The impact of the implementation of the initiatives is estimated as a reduction of 9% of total outbound transport cost.","universidad de monterrey san pedro garza garcia, n.l., m√©xico edgar.granda@udem.edu bvillarreal_1@hotmail.com",

In the world of Big Data, there are no perfect algorithms which can provide a ‚Äúcatch all‚Äù solution to any given problem. Using several Data Mining tools together to cross-validate study results enables the student researcher to make more extensive inferences on their data by considering the data through multiple points of view. Ultimately, this offers the possibility of a more meaningful study conclusion, but choosing the right Data Mining tools or algorithms for the problem is critical for success so as to minimize the risk of algorithm bias. The Data Mining results in this paper sever as a powerful framework to help instructors to manage exam grading for multiple choice exams. By more accurately detecting cases of cheating on these exams, the use of a comprehensive exam question format can be avoided, saving Instructors‚Äô exam preparation time and grading time. The authors have identified three tables where students were very likely to have cheated. The prediction accuracy should be very reliable since the answer choice correspondence patterns were identified using various data mining tools (Correlation, Clustering, Heat Map, and Principal Component Analysis) and achieving statistical significance. These students have a poor defense against claims of cheating, based on the extraordinary correspondence between their answers on the exam! The same Data Mining concept and algorithm choices can be applied to many other applications to uncover otherwise hidden patterns such as in: Sports Analytics, Customer Relational Management, or Biostatistics.

This allowed us to reduce the costs of maintaining inventory and, in particular, to minimize obsolete inventories, also increasing turnover. Today products have a very short lifecycle, which is not covered by most inventory models, but more and more often find sales structures based on innovation, reducing the life cycle of products and demanding a low level of inventory. The techniques proposed here help to reduce inventory costs by approximately 67.40%, compared to the methodology used by the company to estimate the economic lot.

27,Trade-Offs Between Environmental And Economic  Objectives In Closed-Loop Supply Chains,"during the last decades, environmental management has become a matter of prime importance in business, derived from the need of responding to pressure exerted by different types of stakeholders (e.g., regulators, ngos, or consumers). in particular, an instrumental perspective in academics has addressed the analysis of how the implementation of environmental strategies impacts the economic performance of firms. the mainstream of environmental management literature has followed the win-win paradigm, in which environmental and economic objectives can be achieved simultaneously. however, given the multifaceted and complex nature of the relationships between economic and environmental objectives under the framework of sustainable development, it is argued that trade-offs are the rule rather than the exception. therefore, this work aims at developing a conceptual framework for the analysis of the trade-off between environmental and economic objectives in the context of closed-loop supply chains. this framework will help to understand the emergence of trade-offs between environmental and economic objectives of firms during the adoption of advanced environmental practices, such as reverse logistics. it also aims at exploring how collaboration among different agents in the supply chain can help decision makers to manage these trade-offs.",reverse logistics,,"oscar fabi√°n vel√°squez rodr√≠guez, phd (c) universidad nacional de colombia bogot√°, colombia ofvelasquezr@unal.edu.co carlos eduardo moreno mantilla, phd systems and industrial engineering department universidad nacional de colombia bogot√°, colombia cemorenoma@unal.edu.co",

Based on the results of the simulation modeling the stations with large queue or high resource utilizations like shoulder attach, sleeve attach and with low utilizations that is below 50% utilizations like 2nfl1a, 2nfl1b, operator 11b, operator 11a, quality checker 1 and quality checker 2 are bottlenecks in the production lines. The bottleneck recognized are eliminated or minimized using reassigning of the existing resources the operators and machines, to optimize the resources as much as possible. Finally, a new model was developed using opt quest model of arena with different types of scenarios by considering the constraints of the resources and controls and responses of the results. Therefore, the line efficiency has been increased from 72.556% to 75.3% without buying machines and the line can be produced 650 t-shirts with 16-man power. Therefore, they can produce this amount of t-shirt. This computer model can be applied to similar or different multifaceted manufacturing industries wishing to analyze and advance the performance of the production system. Hence, this research invites other interested researchers to make similar researches to improve the apparel industries to improve their productivity using optimization simulation modeling. The company will save the unnecessary salaries that allocated for the lines with an average of 518,400birr/year for 16 lines of assembly lines.","(case study on maa garment and textile factory) aregawi yemane1 bahir dar institute of technology, industrial engineering, bahir dar, ethiopia aregawi_yemane@yahoo.com, serajul haque2 bahir dar institute of technology, industrial engineering, bahir dar, ethiopia serajull@gmail.com iv√°n santelices malfanti3 universidad del b√≠o-b√≠o, departamen to ingenier√≠a industrial, concepci√≥n, chile isanteli@ubiobio.cl",

33,Storage Location Allocation Model For A Just In Sequence  (Jis) Production System,"for the automotive industry, satisfying the specific demands of customers using differentiation strategies in product and service has become successful in increasing competitive global markets. therefore, supply chain management and logistics capabilities play a key role in achieving competitive advantage. one of the key success factors for automotive companies is to have tier 1 suppliers that have the logistic capability to provide the wide variety of components using just in time. the present paper focuses on a storage location allocation problem for a level 1 supplier company with a just in sequence production system. the problem is defined with linear programming formulation to find the optimal allocation of items at a minimum operating cost. key words: jis, inventory, storage location, allocation, tier 1 supplier 1. introduction with constant innovation and increasingly demanding customers, manufacturing companies require strategies that generate a competitive advantage in order to meet customer needs and compete in an evermore globalized economy. this has led to the majority of companies producing a wider range of products and customization. these changes have created inevitable challenges and presented new optimization issues for many manufacturers. due to intense competition, companies are looking for operational efficiency through supply chain management and logistics optimization, as most companies include multiple suppliers, multiple manufacturers, multiple customers, different products to manufacture, as well as multiple issues in uncertain environments (gholamian, mahdavi, tavakkoli- moghaddam, & mahdavi-amiri, 2015) (mirzapour al-e-hashem, malekly, & aryanezhad, 2011). a factory is usually equipped with more than one production line to produce various products, which raises the problem of how to effectively allocate limited resources to manufacture each item in order to maximize profits, another of the basic problems to be companies are faced with the uncertainty of demand, since it affects the production system of a company generating problems in the planning and scheduling of production, as well as in inventory management (ho & fang, 2013) (altendorfer, 2014). for the automotive industry, meeting the specific demands of customers using differentiation strategies in product and service has become successful in increasing competitive global markets. therefore, supply chain management and logistics (acs) capabilities play a key role in achieving competitive advantage. one of the key success factors for automotive companies is to have tier 1 suppliers who have the logistical capability to provide the wide variety of just 277",,"In this study, we investigated a Storage Location Allocation Problem (SLAP), the problem is defined with a linear programming formulation to find the optimal allocation of items at a minimum operating cost. The instance to be solved is a real problem of a supplier company level 1 of the automotive industry, in addition to working with a production system Just In Sequence. When applying the model in the picking area, savings of approximately XXX percent of daily trips from the locations to the buffer (picking) were obtained. The resolution of the model took less than a minute, despite being a combinatorial problem. This shows that the model can be applied in the company to make operational decisions of storage, due to the low computational time that demands to solve the more complex situation that it has. Finally, the nobility of the model and the operations of the company allow to carry out another study considering 1) the costs of transport from the place of arrival of the orders to the warehouse, to the storage locations of each order, 2) costs associated with distances Between the units of the same order that are stored in different locations, 3) the storage capacity of each location, and 4) the time of transfer of the components of the locations to the picking area or production line. 287",edmundo salazar logistics and supply chain management universidad popular aut√≥noma del estado de puebla barrio de santiago #17 sur 901 c.p. 72410 edmundo.salazar@upaep.edu.mx jos√© luis mart√≠nez logistics and supply chain management universidad popular aut√≥noma del estado de puebla barrio de santiago #17 sur 901 c.p. 72410 joseluis.martinez01@upaep.mx,"References

35,Exact Optimal Solution Of A Critical Chain Project  Management Problem,"a solution method is developed for obtaining an exact optimal solution for a critical chain project management scheduling problem. critical chain project management aims to adhere to a target due date as well as to shorten the makespan. the problem is both simple and practical, yet continues to interest scholars and practitioners given the potential for improved scheduling. the traditional approach for solving this problem is based on a compromising policy called ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. since existing methodology can be reduced to a combinatorial problem, an optimal solution must exist for a project. hence, our approach is to obtain the exact optimal solution based on minimizing the estimated makespan. given reduced task processing times, precedence relations, and assigned tasks per each resource, we obtain the processing sequence for each resource. the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear-programming. an optimal solution can therefore be found using a general-purpose solver. application to a scheduling problem is demonstrated to highlight the viability and performance of this approach.",good enough,,"hiroyuki goto and alan murray department of geography university of california at santa barbara uc santa barbara, santa barbara, ca 93106, usa goto-h@hosei.ac.jp, amurray@ucsb.edu",
36,Design And Calculations Of Kinetic Energy Harvesting  System For A Decelerating Train,every moving object possesses kinetic energy. whenever it has to stop or reduce speed this kinetic energy has to be dissipated hence energy is lost from the system. this is the case with every mode of transport. with trains due to their mass the amount of energy lost is at a larger scale. various methods have been developed by train manufacturers and other energy specialists in a bid to recapture this energy from the train. though these may be successful in some respects they have some significant short comings. one of the most salient of these is that these methods have mechanisms which limit them to electric and electric hybrid trains. this paper is concerned with the development of a system of harvesting kinetic energy from trains which is independent of the source of traction energy. the system is based on the concept of flywheel energy storage.,"design, kinetic energy, harvesting","The flywheel energy recovery system discussed and developed consists of many components which are every pivotal in the transfer of energy. More attention has been turned on developing the flywheels hence energy transfer mechanisms are lagging behind in development. Different arrangements of the already existing kinetic energy recovery systems have to be explored, as this may lead to better compatibility and wide application. In the design here presented there is much development need to meet the required performance of the system. Further research has to be done in the following lines ÔÉò Acceleration of the flywheel Due to the high amounts of energy to be harvested from trains the flywheels used have a relatively large mass and therefore have high inertia. This calls for the development of mechanisms to enable quick take off for flywheel.

38,Relevant Risk Factors Linked To Musculoskeletal Discomfort  In Workers Of Meat Processing Industry,"work-related musculoskeletal disorders (wmsds) represent one of the most common occupational diseases that affect large numbers of industrial workers. the aim of the study is to identify relevant risk factors associated with the existence of musculoskeletal discomfort or pain, according to the affected body part. a transverse field study was conducted, on a sample of 174 workers of three venezuelan meat- processing industries. the standardized nordic questionnaire was used for the identification of wmsds and the data mining methods cfssubseteval and consistencysubseteval were used for the selection of the relevant factors, which are available in weka. a wmsds prevalence of 77% was found; excels the shoulders (49.4%) and back (47.1%) as the body parts that affect most workers. the factors that presented the greatest correspondence with the discomforts of the shoulders are postural overload, repeatability, psychosocial demands and time working in the same task. in the case of the discomforts of back, the factors selected are postural overload, lifting of loads, pushing or pulling loads, low social support and the medical history. the multifactorial etiology of wmsds was confirmed.","occupational health, risk factors, data mining, workers","The most commonly affected body parts in the industrial sector studied were the shoulders and back, as reported by 86% and 82% of the workers consulted, respectively. Then follow the hands/wrists (55%), the neck region (51%), the lower extremities (39%) and the elbows/forearms (23%). The most important risk factors associated with the presence of musculoskeletal discomfort reported by workers were identified, which corresponded not only to biomechanical variables, but also to psychosocial and individual variables. Shoulder discomfort were related to higher level of risk due to postural overload, a higher level of risk due to repetitive movements, more unfavorable exposures from the point of view of psychological demands, and greater time working at the position. Back discomfort were associated with higher levels of load manipulation (lifting and pushing or pulling), higher risk of postural overload, more unfavorable social support and the medical history related to musculoskeletal discomfort. The biomechanical risk factor with the greatest impact on musculoskeletal discomfort was postural overload, being associated with the presence of discomfort at the shoulders, back, neck and hands. This risk factor represent the aspect that needs the most attention in the industrial sector considered. On the other hand, the psychological demands to which the worker is exposed was the psychosocial factor that was associated with a greater number of discomforts,","mervyn m√°rquez and miguel m√°rquez industrial engineering department national experimental university of t√°chira san crist√≥bal, venezuela mervyn@unet.edu.ve, mmarquez@unet.edu.ve","References

Buying new machinery is costly and the cost of transporting it into the country is also high. During use all machines are bound to face problems and repairs. For imported machines the spare parts are almost always never available and need to be imported as well. This may lead to prolonged downtime in the case of repairs which require the machine to shut down. Every hour a machine is not in use, considerable amounts of money are lost and the for line production, the whole line is disrupted .design modification may be implemented in conjunction with the application of appropriate technology which makes use of locally available technology that decentralized, labour intensive and small scale. Local engineers may be used to come with the engineering design modifications to counter act problems and increase efficiency of machines. When design modification is implemented successfully, even the availability of spare part will not be a problem anymore. Parts may then be made available locally for the local design. With the availability of spare parts maintenance can be done and implemented successfully. Design modification and import substitution work hand in hand in providing alternative solutions for companies suffering through the poor performance of the country‚Äôs economy at large. As per observation, there are a lot of old machines at ZXY and other companies in Zimbabwe. Instead of engaging the money consuming new machine procurement, the implementation of the initiatives shown below is bound to have a positive result on the national industries when implemented correctly. Figure 4. New way of design 5.1 Conclusion The three practices below work hand in hand and each stage requires specifically trained personnel to carry out the required tasks. The adaptation of these initiative will be beneficial to the country as services and goods would be made available locally. At a time when the country is face with the highest levels of unemployment, this is an opportunity for job creation in the industrial sector. This also has an advantage of preserving the country‚Äôs foreign currency reserves. The most obvious advantage is that it will save a lot of money compared to trying to buy new machinery. 6.","case study for zxy, zimbabwe tawanda mushiri department of mechanical engineering university of johannesburg p.o box apk 524 johannesburg south africa tawandanda.mushiri@gmail.com, tawandamushiri123@hotmail.com romana e mundondi department of mechanical engineering university of zimbabwe p.o box mp167 mt pleasant harare zimbabwe cae.ethelr@msn.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg p.o box apk 524 johannesburg south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
43,Design And Fabrication Of A Pedal Powered Washing  Machine,"washing clothes is one of the essential parts of life. we all wash our clothes either by hands or by machine. a washing machine is a device designed to wash laundry such as clothes and sheets. in these days there exists a wide variety of washing machines in the market and there is stiff competition among the manufacturers. these washing machines cost between $350 to $750 depending upon functions and features. all of these washing machines are powered by electricity and the basic principle of operation is by creating a turbulent flow of the detergent around the dirty clothes. almost 60 percent of our population lives in rural areas where it is impossible to use electric powered washing machines, mainly due to the unavailability of electricity or the absence of the machine itself due to high costs of purchasing a new washing machine. washing clothes by hand is laborious, strenuous, takes a lot of time and leaves one breathless. this paper intends to directly address the problems faced by people in the rural areas when washing clothes by designing and fabrication a pedal powered washing machine. the machine can also be used in urban areas to save electricity and also to exercise. the machine does not require electricity or an engine but uses human power. the transfer of human energy through the use of a foot pedal and crank mechanism is what is known as pedal power. this is the mechanism that has been used to propel bicycles. the paper designs and fabricates the pedal powered washing machine. experiments are conducted in order to determine the optimum operating conditions. ¬© ieom society international 355",,"and Recommendations When any detailed design has been done, it is easily understood that no product/design get at its best or 100% efficient in its operation. There should always be opportunities for continual development and improvement. As shown, despite the fact that the selected concept proved to obtain satisfactory results, it could be still be improved to obtain a higher effectiveness of efficiency in the discharge of the intended duty. Although the working model of the pedal powered washing machine was fabricated and implemented, there is a scope of further work in the project which has not been undertaken. There are a number of ideas where the loss of power can be reutilized and the design can be modified for better performance. The energy wasted during washing can be utilized in most fruitful way by using it in another household machine which would work simultaneously as the washing goes on. The capacity of washing can be increased so that more clothes can be washed, thus utilizing the wasted energy. It would be more efficient to store energy using a flywheel and use the energy when needed.

47,An Exploratory Research About Lean Manufacturing  Implementation And Behaviors Of Multi-Level Leadership,"the culture of lean implementation is considered as a key element for its long-term sustainability and leaders play a crucial role, since they are responsible for influencing individuals and teams. this article aims at empirically examining the relationship between the behavioral orientation of leaders from different hierarchical levels (middle managers and frontline leaders) and the implementation phase of the lean manufacturing (lm) roadmap. the proposed method relies on both qualitative and quantitative fronts since it combines the results of semi-structured interviews with lean experts and a cross-sectional survey with 225 leaders from different brazilian companies that are undergoing lm implementation. the study bridges a gap observed in the literature regarding lm implementation, as it enables the identification of the relationship between multi-level leadership styles and the implementation phases of lm roadmap. the findings support the existence of a transient leadership style orientation along the lean implementation and provide evidence that there is not a single best leadership style for lean implementation.",,"This research suggests two major findings. First, the contextual does matter with regards to leadership style orientation along the LEM roadmap phases, although not all variables matter to the same extent. Overall, in companies with higher levels of LM practices implementation, the contextual variable that must be mainly observed by senior managers and directors is the number of followers that both Middle Managers and Frontline Leaders are responsible for. Despite results show that this association may not always happen as expected, senior management must take into account this variable and the current phase of the lean implementation in order to better comprehend the desired behaviors of these hierarchical levels. Hence, this comprehension allows companies to plan and design the organizational structure (size of teams and hierarchy levels) according to expected outcomes for the LM implementation. Further, the identification of context‚Äôs influence on leaders‚Äô style orientation helps senior management to anticipate leadership development initiatives in order to fulfill the current LEM phase requirements and outputs. Secondly, our findings support the existence of a transient leadership style orientation along the implementation of the LEM roadmap phases. Such behavioral shift is evidenced in terms of task and relation orientation and may vary according to the hierarchical level. Therefore, contrary to previous research (e.g. Dombrowski and Mielke, 2014; van Dun et al., 2016), this study provides evidence that there is not a single best leadership style for lean implementation. Actually, the best style orientation appears to be contingent and depends on the maturity of the LM implementation (LEM roadmap phase) and the respective role of the leader (Frontline Leaders and Middle Managers). This research has some limitations. First, respondents were all from companies located in Brazil; their answers might be linked to national issues. Thus, this limitation restricts the results to this social and economic condition, indicating that diversifying the sample would help providing wider and more generalizable results. Second, the sample size effectively confirmed only the effects of some contextual variables and it was not possible to verify all variables. The influence of the variables that were not significantly associated may exist in a lower level. If that is the case, larger sample sizes can highlight those effects. Additionally, our results are limited to only three leadership contextual variables. In real case scenario, leaders are exposed to several contingency factors that may influence their behavior and the effectiveness of them during the evolutionary process of LM implementation. Third, the establishment of subsets of LM practices according to LEM roadmap phase was based on practices mainly applied within manufacturing companies. A wider comparative study among companies that are implementing the lean thinking would avoid any potential error on the assessment of practices. Future studies could include additional variables or use multiple levels of analysis, such as systems dynamic, to capture the composed influence of those variables that were not tested at this study along time. Further, results for leadership behaviors at more advanced phases of lean implementation were not convergent. The misalignment between ideal behaviors and actual styles preferences may feature an additional opportunity for future research.","guilherme luz tortorella, diego de castro fettermann and carlos ernani fries department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina campus trindade, c.p. 476, florian√≥polis, sc 88040-900, brazil g.tortorella@ufsc.br, d.fetterman@ufsc.br, carlos.fries@ufsc.br",
48,Stochastic Inventory Control And Distribution Of Blood  Products,"inventory control in perishable products supply chain is one of the biggest challenges today, especially for medicines and blood products supply chain. shortage can increase the mortality risk at hospitals, on the contrary, high levels of inventory could generate wastage of these resources. this paper studies the problem of inventory control and distribution of blood products. this study determines the number of blood units to be processed by the blood center and the number of units of blood products to be ordered by hospitals to minimize the total cost and the shortage and wastage levels in blood supply chain. two optimization models are formulated: a mixed integer linear programming (milp) model for known demands and a stochastic programming (sp) model for the case where demands are uncertain, considering multiple periods, types of blood and life time of products. datasets are generated to evaluate the efficiency of proposed models for a multi-hospitals single-blood center system. an algorithm is developed to simulate the supply chain and evaluate the mathematical models. the results show that the sp model obtains lower expected rates of shortage and wastage compared to the deterministic model. in this last, demands are approximated by their mean values.",optimization,"This document presented a study to optimize the blood supply chain for a single-blood center multiple-hospitals system considering products of 8 different blood types. The challenge of inventory control and distribution of perishable products, especially blood products, inspired us to start this research. A deterministic and stochastic programming models are developed to minimize the total cost and the shortage and wastage levels in blood supply chain within a planning horizon. Datasets are generated to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed models and an algorithm is used to simulate and evaluate the results from mathematical models. One of the challenges of stochastic programming is the size of the problems and the resolution of these in reasonable computational times. For future research related to the blood supply chain modeled as a multi-stage problem, it is proposed to evaluate scenarios reduction methods. In addition to this, approximation methods can be used such as the L-Shape Method or Cutting Plane Approximation in the case of multi-stage problems.

49,A Global Multiregional Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment  Of National Energy Production Scenarios Until 2050,"the global increasing energy demand have made governments more environmental conscious, yet there are also impacts on society and the environment. the triple-bottom-line sustainability assessment and autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) methods are used for projecting the impacts on environment, economy and society until 2050 by electricity production sectors in turkey from 12 different energy sources, under business as usual (bau) and renewable energy development (red) scenarios. in this regard, three sustainability indicators greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions, wages and taxes are quantified based on electricity production from renewable and non-renewable resources using a high country and sector resolution exiobase, which is a global multiregional input-output (mrio) database. the results showed that in comparison of bau with red scenario, ghg emissions associated would be 84% less in red, wages will be 23% less and taxes would decrease by 22.4% under red plan by 2050. in addition, energy sources responsible for the highest ghg emissions per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced are found as biomass, coal, waste and oil. however, coal and biomass contributes to high wages and tax on products purchased. this research provides important insights for policy makers to make more informed decisions considering environmental, economic and societal performance of electricity production policies.",energy policy,,"murat kucukvar1, nuri cihat onat2, muhammad ali haider3, mohammad abdullah shaikh3 1department of mechanical and industrial engineering, qatar university, qatar 2transportation and traffic safety center, qatar university, qatar 3department of industrial engineering, istanbul sehir university, istanbul, turkey kucukvar@qu.edu.qa, onat@qu.edu.qa","References

Although the objective presented seems very specific at first sight, the process of analysis involved a holistic understanding of the operations of the transport and traffic department of the company. The process improvement methodology DMAIC guided the actions involving the application of techniques and basic concepts of industrial engineering. Those goes from descriptive and inferential statistical analysis and process redesign, to implementation of simulation of discrete event models to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposals in a dynamic and uncertainty environment. The clarity of the exposure of the current situation and the justification of the proposals to the managers in the company allowed several of them to be quickly approved and implemented, so in this report it is possible to observe not only simulated or estimated results but real ones. 7 Bibliography Azor, J.

62,Effects Of Ambulance Dispatching And Relocation Decisions On  Ems Quality,"when a call for a service is received by an emergency medical services (ems) provider, a decision must be made on which vehicle to send to provide assistance. the dispatched vehicle becomes busy and the system‚Äôs preparedness to attend a new call decreases. therefore, to increase this value, idle ems vehicles could be relocated among the standby sites. this study aims to evaluate the effect on the critical performance measures of the system, the sequential application of a dispatching mathematical model and a relocation model, taking into account the operational requirements of an ems provider in colombia. four scenarios were simulated during a period of maximum activity to evaluate the dynamic state of the system given by the dispatch and relocation decisions. dispatch decisions should follow the most common rule -dispatch the nearest vehicle- or the optimal solution of a dispatching model. relocation options were either doing nothing and following the optimal solution of a mathematical relocation model. both models consider the fleet and the services heterogeneous, and look for to improve the system‚Äôs preparedness level. the simulated system showed improvements in response times and preparedness levels of up to 54% when the dispatch follows the solution of the mathematical model and no relocation occurs.","ambulances, dispatching models, relocation models, preparedness","are a call for EMS provider companies to consider the use of operations research models to improve their quality performance. During the simulation, the probability of vehicle breaking or maintenance was not included. During the selected horizon, no emergency calls were received. 5 Conclusions The performance measures of the most critical calls -the urgency ones-, were found to be significantly affected by both, the dispatching and relocation methods. In particular, the preparedness of the system and the response times for to handle urgency calls were the most sensitive performance measures. The scenario that reports a better performance for a period of peak activity of the EMS provider under study was to dispatch an ambulance according the optimal solution indicated by the mathematical model without relocating idle vehicles, because the times between call arrivals are very short. Then, an EMS provider should consider alternatives to the most common rule of assigning the vehicle closest to a call. It will be necessary to study other scenarios, with less demand, to verify if the use of the mathematical model to relocate can influence favorably the average times of response and the preparation of the system. It was found that the use of optimization models, such as those used in this work to dispatch and relocate EMS vehicles, can improve not only the average response time but also the system preparedness to handle new calls, especially when major services are requested priority.

65,Accuracy And Precision Of The Drag And Rolling Resistance  Coefficients Obtained By On Road Coast Down Tests,"studies on energy efficiency in vehicles require as input data values for the drag (cd) and the rolling resistance (fr) coefficients obtained under real operational conditions of the vehicles. frequently, these values are unknown for the case of cargo and passenger transportation vehicles, which are the largest consumers of fuel among ground vehicles. the accepted measurement methods for the determination of cd and fr are expensive and are still being questioned for their low capacity to reflect the real operational conditions of the vehicles. this work evaluates the level of accuracy and precision of cd and fr obtained by on road coast down tests, which is an easy to implement and affordable alternative method to obtain those coefficients under real operational conditions. we added to this method the influence of the road grade and the use of the generalized reduced gradient technique to minimize the differences between the speed obtained by an analytical model, where cd and fr are an unknown, and the instantaneous speed measured during cost down tests conducted following the testing protocols recommended by the sae j1263. this combined method was applied to a sample of 19 vehicles. the obtained values of cd and fr showed an average accuracy error < 5.2 % and an average precision error < 6.1%, that are acceptable for studies in energy efficiency in vehicles.",vehicle performance,"Currently there is need for an affordable and easy to implement methodology to determine Cd and Fr values, under real conditions, and with acceptable levels of accuracy and precision for studies on energy efficiency in cargo and passenger vehicles. To address this need we proposed the use of on road coast down tests with the use of modern speed measurement technologies (GPS) in combination with the generalized reduced gradient method, and the inclusion of instantaneous road grades effects. Multiple coast down tests (>10) over a sample of 19 vehicles, and the use of the generalized reduced gradient technique, showed that this combination generates Cd and Fr results with accuracy levels and precision appropriate for studies on energy efficiency in vehicles. The average accuracy error was < 5.2% and the average precision error was < 6.1 %. This methodology generates Cd values that encompass all the forces opposing to the motion of the vehicle and are proportional to the square speed, and Fr values that embody all the forces that are proportional to the vehicle speed, irrespective of whether those forces correspond to aerodynamic forces or to the rolling resistance forces, respectively. These values reflect the real average performance of ground vehicles at speeds below 120 km/h.

This paper has explored the efficiency and success rate of Agile project management in Non-IT sectors and shows a quantitative analysis of different success factors. Our findings reveals that the range of Agile used in a project does have a statistically significant impact on all five dimensions of project success, meeting project budget goals, scopes and requirements, client satisfaction, end user satisfaction and overall project success. The main challenges the organization faced while implementing agile project management techniques are in budget and schedule estimation, for minimal documentation, waste management and contractual issues. The main advantages of agile approach are rapidness, information integration, flexibility and collaboration. From the survey conducted, around 82% of the total respondents revealed that they are aware of the agile project management methods used in the organization. Other respondents from consulting firms are unaware of the agile methods and also some employees in the lower level management of the companies implementing agile are unaware of agile methods.

70,Renewable Energy Growth Pattern And Correlation With  Co2 Emissions In Brics Nations,"fossil fuel emissions have become a major concern for many countries worldwide. the adoption of renewable sources of energy is vibrant with sophistication in the field of renewable automobile engine technology innovations. many countries have been investing large amounts of money in improving their economy and as result of this, co2 emissions is increasing exponentially. so, the fossil fuels are being used at a faster rate and we are definitely going to run out of them faster than expected. investing in other greener forms of energy becomes very important in such a situation. many countries have come together in this regard and have stated making policies and holding meetings regularly to check the damage. but the reforms that have been taken have not been very effective as they have not lead to the required results. the aim of this paper is to sketch out the growth pattern of renewable energy in recent past and to find its correlation with co2 emissions in brics nations. data from the past 15 years for all the brics nations is taken and regression analysis is done with co2 emissions to determine the impact of one on another. results show that shifting to greener forms of energy is not the only way to reduce co2 emissions. recommendations are also suggested for renewable energy adoption and usage for each of the brics nation.","renewable energy, co2 emission, brics","1. Brazil Brazil should use the resources properly with regards to renewable energy as they have a lot of potential which will allow shifting to wind and solar power to reduce carbon emissions from power. Brazil should target 42.7 GW of wind and 23.6 GW of Photovoltaic, and 44.9 GW of other renewable by 2030. Adding to greener projects will strengthen urban and rural populations, which will provide them with better idea about the energy sector. In this way, people become energy makers themselves and gain economically which will in turn increase the energy efficiency. More fossil fuel extraction by the Brazilian government would lead to many problems and one of that being financial losses which will happen because of climate change. Brazil should try to be below the global per capita average for carbon emissions in 2020 and CO2 emissions should be limited to 1Gigatonne by 2030. Deforestation should be reduced in Amazon forest and Cerrado regions. Higher funds should be put in public transport which is needed to limit fossils use in infrastructure. 2. Russia Russia should try to reconsider options and set ambitious goals in renewable energy production and get rid of all the legal barriers which will help in implementing energy efficiency technologies. They should try to orient state subsidies from new oil and gas withdrawal and also from nuclear in different way which will favor renewable energy and energy efficiency. Russia should try to increase the speed of development of the domestic system which is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, and find a method which will regulate greenhouse gases. Also, start new international renewable energy plans with neighbouring countries like China, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan etc. 3. India India should focus on creating effective financing layouts for easy energy access by trying to varying the climate negotiations. Sustainable energy is not accessible to 1.2 billion people around the world but India has promised to deliver 24 hours power supply to everyone by 2019 and the best way to do this is to use distributed renewable energy. Coal mining should not be done from forests and these activities should be prohibited. Government must try to impose restrictions on mining in forest areas to extract coal otherwise the climate would be badly impacted. The government must make plans which include the fact that we will run out of fossils and nuclear energy, and how to change to renewable energy. 4. China China should try to set a ruthless coal consumption threshold for the years 2016 ‚Äì 2020, and make sure that every province has its own target and this target should be prepared taking into account coal consumption in 2014. China should make all the changes required to take the national CO2 emissions to the peak level much earlier than 2030, maybe even as early as 2025. They should change structure of its power generation system so that growth of renewable energy should not be stopped, and solar power production is increased.

75,Occupational Risk Management (Orm) Applied To  Ergonomics,"(12 font) the goal of orm is to manage risk, not to eliminate risk, so work can be accomplished with minimal impact. each person has a role to play in managing risk and each of these roles is vital to the success of the organization. risk cannot always be avoided; it is better to manage risk and use orm to prevent loss. orm involves five steps: (1) identify hazards; (2) assess the hazards; (3) make risk decisions; (4) implement controls; and (5) supervise and watch for change. this is deliberate orm and requires time to plan the process. time critical orm (tcorm) involves quick process and a set of skills to ensure proper execution of a plan or event; exactly what is required in the field and involves 4 steps: (1) determine what can go wrong or is changing; (2) determine what can be done; (3) acting to correct the situation(s); and (4) telling the right people. the application of tcorm will be presented through short case studies where ergonomic opportunities‚Äô were identified (what could go wrong); immediately implementable approaches were identified (what can be done); implementing the approaches (act to correct the situation); and evaluate their overall effectiveness (telling the right people).","best practices, risk evaluation, risk prevention, work practices",,"lawrence j. h. schulze, phd, pe, cpe department of industrial engineering university houston houston, tx, usa ljhs@uh.edu",
76,Wind Farm Maintenance Scheduling Model And Solution  Approach,"wind energy has become an important source of energy in the last years, proven to be an alternative to fossil power production. the advances in technology have allowed to exploit this resource in new environments. while offshore wind farms projects are growing at important rates, onshore farms are still the main contributors of this energy source. however, challenges to make wind farms projects profitable are still prevailing. in this context, maintenance activities have an important impact on energy production and operational costs. a linear optimization model is proposed to solve a maintenance scheduling problem for onshore wind farms. the model includes classical key concepts such as availability and revenues. moreover, it includes technicians crew costs which are relevant when the maintenance operator is not the farm responsible. therefore, a multi objective scheme is used to solve the problem via the epsilon constraint method. preliminary results on modified instances previously used in the literature show that an approximation to the pareto front can be found for small instances.",onshore wind farms,"This paper introduces a new model to solve the wind farm maintenance scheduling problem in the onshore context. The proposed model considers the multi objective nature of the problem, taking account of both costs as well as the energy production/utility. The problem is solved using an ILP embedded in an epsilon constraint algorithm. Results show that an approximation to the pareto front can be found to small instances previously used in the literature. Still, the complexity of ILP problems make that most of the solutions found by the algorithm cannot be proven to be Pareto Efficient. Improvement in the computational times and performance of the ILP considering the cost objective must be conducted in our future work. Nevertheless, as shown in a detailed example, one can see the importance of considering multiple objectives. In fact, the augmentation of costs can have significant consequences in the amount/utility of energy produced. Our solution approach can thus give the decision makers an important source of information to plan and perform the maintenance activities. Undergoing work considers new variants of objectives as well as approximation methods to deal with bigger instances. Indeed, the stochastic nature of the problem makes a daily roll-over approach suitable, thus, faster approaches are necessary to apply this type of models. Moreover, we are currently considering the inherent stochasticity in task times. Certainly, times to perform a task might not be completely known prior to the problem solution, therefore, solution methods must consider this aspect to create robust and reliable solutions.

77,Study Of The State Of Implementation Of Logistics Trends In The  Hospital Of Medell√≠n City,"this paper presents the diagnosis of the state of implementation of processes and technologies for the supply chain management of hospitals in medell√≠n, in order to determine the level of competitiveness of hospitals in the city with respect to world class hospitals. first, a bibliographic search process was carried out to determine the most used logistics trends in hospitals in different countries. all this followed by an analysis of the literature review and, finally, an instrument was designed and applied to a representative sample of hospitals in medell√≠n, where four important subjects were evaluated: stock, information systems, optimization and continuous improvement. this study found that the most used logistic tools in hospitals in medell√≠n are: lean manufacturing, standardization of processes, stock control, among others. however, in the analysis performed by quadrants, it is evident that there are opportunities for improvement in the methodology used by hospitals to develop their logistics activities, since 80% of the sample has a low positioning factor and therefore a globally uncompetitive logistic level.","hospital logistics, medell√≠n","‚Ä¢ In this paper we classified the publications found in order to identify the subgroups in which the trends are implemented. It is possible to perceive that these methodologies are applied according to the resources and needs of each hospital, evidenced in the proportionality of publications that focus on the improvement of processes and technologies. ‚Ä¢ One of the contributions of this project is to know and identify the literature review of hospital logistics, it was found that the countries that have shown the most interest according to the number of disclosures are the United States and United Kingdom with seventeen and eight publications respectively. In the same way, it was found that lean manufacturing and mathematical modeling are the most common logistic trends in the literature which are implemented in different departments of the hospital such as warehouse, emergency, surgery, and external care and support. 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 4 5 Factor of global positioning per institution Score Complexity 2 Complexity 3 Complexity 4 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 1 2 3 4 5 Factor of global positioning per institution Score Complexity 2 Complexity 3 Complexity 4","sara melguizo melguizo production engineering department universidad eafit medell√≠n, colombia smelguiz@eafit.edu.co juan gregorio arrieta posada production engineering department universidad eafit medell√≠n, colombia jarrieta@eafit.edu.co","References

81,Software As A Service Google Apps In The Internal  Communication Of The National University Of San Antonio,"the internal communication in public universities is an unexplored field, however the previous investigations considered to internal communication as a strategic element and essential to the success of an organization. you can improve internal communication using digital channels that enhance and simplify the variety of traditional channels. the objective of the research is determined what extent applications in the cloud of google apps for education improve internal communication between members of the university community. the results of the research reveal that the use of the software as a service google apps does not substantially improve internal communication among members of the university community. however, we have identified some factors that prevent the use of google apps for education, such as limitations in computer infrastructure, low level of knowledge in computing, limited use of digital tools in academic activities and the absence of a strategic plan for internal communication.",cloud computing,and Future Work The use of the Software as a Service Google Apps for Education does not substantially improve internal communication among members of the university community of the National University of San Antonio Abad of Cusco. The downstream communication is unidirectional and there is little feedback in communication. In the upward communication there are difficulties because most of the students feel little informed and listened to by their authorities. In the case of horizontal and transverse communication there is empathy of communication between companions but they encourage informal communication. It uses a variety of traditional and digital media that does not allow a clear conclusion of the type of preferred communication medium.

82,A Multi-Fractal Spectrum Analysis For Online Structural  Health Monitoring,"the nonlinear and nonstationary nature of structural damage brings a great challenge to structural health monitoring (shm). chaos theory and nonlinear time-series analysis domain suggests many effective candidates to capture system dynamic and measure the complexity of dynamical system. from different candidates, this paper focuses on multi-fractal spectrum analysis for online structural health monitoring. results show that the quasi recessive correlation dimension (qrcd) is not only the best fractal dimension for detecting different defect levels, but also it has less computational complexity than the singularity spectrum used for extracting multi-fractal spectrum. on the other hand, the multi-fractal spectrum analysis is an effective damage quantifier for analyzing data which exhibit multi-fractal behavior and it has a better diagnosis capability for monitoring non-stationary process and those attractors which exhibit phase- transition. key words: structural health monitoring; multi-fractal analysis; singularity spectrum; ergodic theorem. 1. introduction and motivation chaos theory and nonlinear time-series analysis domain suggests many effective candidates to capture system dynamic and measure the complexity of dynamical system (moon et al., 1992). from different candidates, this paper focuses on the multi-fractal spectrum analysis for the purpose of structural health monitoring. the importance of the multi- fractal analysis in connection to dynamical system comes from the fact that it is an efficient technique to determine the existence of strange attractors, thus it allows a statistical description of the underlying dynamics system‚Äôs attractor (moon et al., 1992). a more convenient way to describe the global scaling properties of the attractor is by using a spectrum of singularities, which will be discussed in this paper. scaling in chaos analysis almost always reduce the object or pattern into smaller replicas of the original according to a fixed ratio (garnett and williams, 1997). the point ¬© ieom 711",,"In this paper, a multi-fractal spectrum analysis is used for online SHM. Results indicate that the generalized fractal dimension has fairly high computational complexity of ùëÇùëÇ(ùëÅùëÅ ùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëôùëô) for each ùëûùëû‚àà(‚àí‚àû, ‚àû) compared with the QRCD, whose computational complexity of O(N). On the other hand, the multi-fractal spectrum has a better diagnosis capability for monitoring non-stationary process and those attractors which exhibit phase-transition. It should also be pointed out that, for a noisy data, the capabilities of both the QRCD and the multi-fractal spectrum are affected as damage detection features. Based on the characteristics of date, each of the correlation dimension and the multi-fractal spectrum has its own application and practical considerations. In future work, making no assumptions about the data and looking at the dynamical changes within an adaptive sliding window will be further investigated via Recurrence Quantification analysis or/and Hilbert Huang Transform.","mahmoud z. mistarihi department of industrial engineering hijjawi faculty of engineering technology yarmouk university irbid, jordan, 21163 mahmoud.m@yu.edu.jo zhenyu (james) kong grado department of industrial and systems engineering virginia polytechnic institute and state university blacksburg, va 24061, usa zkong@vt.edu satish t. s. bukkapatnam department of industrial and systems engineering texas a&m university college station, tx 77843, usa satish@tamu.edu",
83,Multi-Criteria Analysis Of Advanced Planning System  Implementation,"the implementation of advanced planning systems (aps) software may offers to supply chain management (scm) planning and optimization functionalities to industrial processes. a complete assessment of aps implementation should involve multiple criteria. analytic hierarchy process (ahp) is worldwide multi-criteria analysis method. the benefits, opportunities, costs, and risks (bocr) is a model developed from ahp theory. bocr model allows a flexible analysis and potentially richer as opposed to only costs and benefits analysis. for aps implementation benefits are regarding to customer services, internal business processes and modular architecture issues; opportunities relates to flexibility in adapting to changes, errors reducing, innovation and learning; costs relates to project on budget, project on time and scm costs; and risks are associated with data, process, and user fit. the objective in this paper is to present a model for the assessment of aps implementation",2016). in practice,"The aim of this paper was to assess the APS implementation considering BOCR. The proposed model and the results provided evidences of the APS implementation in a global chemical corporation. In this AHP application, absolute measurement was adopted instead of the original relative measurement: 6 percent points for Production Planning & Scheduling over Demand Planning and 2 percent points for Production Planning & Scheduling over Strategic Networking Planning. These findings evidenced the success of the APS implementation in the studied chemical plant. Finally, by means a real application, this article has illustrated how an APS implementation assessment model should be applied to appraise implementation system. We believe to have made significant contributions to the APS literature. A new approach based on Analytic Network Process is suggested as a further research. Consider the existence of dependence and interrelations between alternatives and apply the Analytic Network Process (Saaty and Ozdemir, 2005).","claudemir l. tramarico, val√©rio a. p. salomon and fernando a. s. marins s√£o paulo state university (unesp) engineering school, campus guaratinguet√° guaratinguet√°, sp, 12516-410, brazil claudemir.leif@terra.com.br, salomon@feg.unesp.br, fmarins@feg.unesp.br",

Industry 4.0 enables continuous resource productivity and efficiency gains to be delivered across the entire value network. It allows work to be organized in a way that takes demographic change and social factors into account. Smart assistance systems release workers from having to perform routine tasks, enabling them to focus on creative, value-added activities. In view of the impending shortage of skilled workers, this will allow older workers to extend their working lives and remain productive for longer. Flexible work organization will enable workers to combine their work, private lives and continuing professional development more effectively, promoting a better work-life balance. This paper discussed key technologies like cloud computing, IoT, CPS for the deployment of a new industrial revolution called Industry 4.0. This new paradigm will benefit from the latest TICC (Information Technology, Communication and Control) technologies associated with greater collaboration among the players in this industrial process. This change is already impacting the industrial area, especially in areas where the product life cycle is small and a constant search for improvement is needed, such as the electronics, automotive and aviation sectors. We need to train trained professionals to work and reason with a more global vision and knowledge permeate in different areas, which will be more closely linked. There is an open field for creating platforms, new or improved protocols, and connections between smart devices that allow you to use these new features in factory environments that are provided in Industry 4.0. You must completely develop new business models and exploit the considerable potential for optimization in the areas of production and logistics.",eduardo.c.moraes@ieee.org herman augusto lepikson federal university of bahia herman@ufba.br,

It is possible to conduct informal collaboration, linking students' projects with industry needs without the need for a signing agreement. This type of collaboration helps to make communication and the transfer of knowledge and technology more fluid. It should be noted that in the future this collaboration must be of a formal type, with some written agreement to help limit the responsibilities and benefits or create a university spin-off. The role of the teachers involved in the project was fundamental in the collaboration. The experience in subjects related to communication with company helped the students to know how to interact with the companies. Teachers also help motivate students during the course of the entire project development. Knowledge of the business environment helped a lot to know a need and served as a starting point for the MicroERP project Finally, knowledge and technology gained was invaluable collaboration.

93,An Examination Of The Motivational Factors Affecting  Workers Productivity In The Jordanian Construction,"construction productivity is of great importance to companies and researchers alike, and motivation is a well-known factor influencing workers‚Äô productivity. however, motivational factors are arguably unique to every country due to the different cultural, economy, and social- technological factors. thus, the objectives of this study is to identify and evaluate the most influential motivation factors affecting labor productivity, and to assess the importance of these factors from the construction workers‚Äô perspective. a structured questionnaire survey was sent to multiple construction sites in two major cities, amman and aqaba. from the returned responses, sixteen motivational factors were identified and statistically analyzed by calculating the average, standard deviation, and the importance index of each factor. the five highest motivation factors were shown to be personal growth/career improvement; pay on time; decision-making ability; decent and respectful job, and rewards/promotions. results from the study indicate that workers valued personal growth and improving their career more than having a higher pay and getting financial rewards. the study concluded that if organizations pay particular attention to these motivational factors it will increase workers‚Äô productivity, which will also improve project delivery and improve staff retention, which in return will improve the organizational standards.","productivity, motivation, construction, operatives",,"industry ghazi moh‚Äôd al-abbadi school of energy, construction and environment coventry university coventry, cv1 5fb, uk alabbadg@uni.coventry.ac.uk, alabbadgg@gmail.com george agyekum-mensah school of energy, construction and environment coventry university coventry, cv1 5fb, uk george.mensah@coventry.ac.uk",

96,Implementation Of A Metaheuristic In A Simulation Model For  Programming In A Port System,"this paper studies the problem of programming the ships loading to the bulk, in port systems. identical loaders called shiploaders must attend bulk carriers. when programming the ships, the charterer tries to minimize the incurred penalization cost when the laydays is breached. the charterer will be penalized based on the amount of time that passes from the ending of the laydays until the beginning of the bulk carrier loading. this problem is analyzed as a berth allocation problem ‚Äì (bap), which is an np-hard problem. different metaheuristics have been implemented to address this type of problems. in order to explore the uncertainty in the bulk carrier loading, a metaheuristic is implemented on a simulation model. the metaheuristic simulated annealing (sa) was integrated using flexsim software 7.7.4 to address the uncertainty of the loading times in the programming of the ships. the results were compared with previous work where only genetic algorithms had been applied, without simulation. it was demonstrated that the simulation and the simulated annealing minimized the breach of the laydays facing the uncertainty associated to the operation from the maritime port to the bulk carriers, bearing in mind more real instances.","simulated annealing, simulation, maritime ports",,"daniel mendoza, jairo rangel and zulay sarmiento industrial engineering department universidad del atl√°ntico km 7 antigua v√≠a a puerto colombia, barranquilla, colombia danielmendoza@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, jrangelredondo@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co, zsarmiento@mail.uniatlantico.edu.co",

98,An Analysis Of Engineering Education Impact On Brazil¬¥S  Micro Regions,"engineering education has been, as a part of the hrst, a significant factor according the ocde in correlating to gdp. previous studies demonstrate that the shortage of engineers in a country as vast as brazil need to be understood in a microregional scenario and shows that the microregions with hei¬¥s are often the only ones that can leverage their development indexes (hdi_e and hdi_r). not only are the differences in the country great on a region by region approach, but spillovers and hei¬¥s products need to meet local demands. based on the bibliographical review and raw government and official data analysis this study concludes that there is a significant impact factor on a city ability to leverage its development if a hei is placed and the spillover factor for the remaining cities of the same microregion is also present. this study also concludes that the quality of an hei is also important to assess the amount of leverage it will be able to achieve.",,"Both Tables 2 and 4 displays that the impact follows a similar path in both HDI_I and HDI_E results. On both cases, the highest impact in leveraging the development was the Capital factor as previously discussed. Followed by the capital we can the presence of an HEI will have better results on the city and the findings of Drucker (2016) are supported that the impact and spillover are present locally. An important information is that the quality of the HEI also has an impact on the HDI indexes. On both comparisons, the cities that were categorized on the CH+ were in average better than the cities categorized on CH-. This points to a conclusion that not only presence, but quality is important. Finally, CIH category has a better result than CNH, showing once again that the impact and spillover effects on microregions is pertinent and the need to consider local impact is necessary to properly develop the country. When analyzing the possibility to leverage the participation, we can take a closer look at the South macro region of the country, which is the region that can leverage its GDP when compared to the Northeast region. It has half the population - 14,12% against 27,37% (PNUD et al., 2013) - but a better GDP participation - 16,2% against 13,4% (IBGE, 2014) and the coverage of HEI impact can be a determinant factor for it as well as the number of abled engineers (CONFEA, 2016).

108,A Costeffective Collaborative Inventory Management  Strategy Between Non-Competitor Companies A Case Study,"this paper introduces a collaborative strategy in the supply chain that demonstrates potential to reduce management inventory costs, through the coordinated replenishment of multiple items from non- competitors vendors. the proposed approach is an extension of the classical joint replenishment problem (jrp) denominated as stochastic collaborative joint replenishment problem (s-cjrp) since considers normally distributed demand and real world constraints. this research presents two main problems: the first consists in determining the frequency in which each vendor should replenish its products considering a limited transport and storage capacity. a heuristic procedure has been used as effective methodology for solve it. the second problem deals with the problem of allocate the benefits given by the collaboration in a viable and stable way. this problem was modeled as a cooperative game for ensuring fairness among participants. the shapley value was used as a method for allocation, which allows a balance between the contribution and gain sharing for the players. a study case is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of this strategy, providing economics benefits.",,"This paper proposes a collaborative strategy where non-competitor companies can share logistical resources and fixed costs related to manage inventories. Trough a study case was demonstrated that a potential cost reduction can be achieved. The model is especially useful for companies with limited resources because it provides the opportunity to achieve increase of capacity and exploitation of economies of scale. On another hand, the strategy allows improving the efficiency of companies with overcapacity thanks to a better use of resources. The tests showed that players with similar conditions; demand and operational costs, can obtain comparable benefits by forming coalitions, but the coalitions formed by player with heterogeneous conditions could be unstable. In these cases, the players who contribute with little charge and large costs can achieve high cost reductions, even more that big players because they take greater advantage of the resource of the first ones, while the latter achieve little benefits. The selection of players and the formation of coalitions should be more widely studied. Future research must consider the possibility of multi objective function; where the main propose is not reduce costs. Another important topic is the accuracy of the space required, since this paper considered that the products are packed in boxes or units of load with regular and standard forms. This assumption can significantly alter the results if there are products with irregular shapes.","carlos oteroa cjotero@uninorte.edu.co ren√© amayaa ramaya@uninorte.edu.co adepartment of industrial engineering universidad del norte, a.a. 1569, barranquilla, colombia",

112,Project Critical Path Assessment In Production  Environments By A New Interval-Valued Fuzzy Decision,"critical path assessment plays an important role in production project management in order to schedule and control of the projects. in fuzzy sets theory, it is often difficult for an expert to accurately quantify his or her opinion as a number in interval [0,1]. therefore, it is more appropriate to indicate this degree of certainty by an interval that is why interval-valued fuzzy sets (ivfss) are used to better address the uncertainty of real world production projects. also, a new multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) method based on fuzzy preference relation under ivfss is developed. moreover, entropy method is extended by means oneaa distance between each point from nearer and farther point among ideal points under ivfss. finally, an application about production projects is solved to better illustrate the calculation and capability of the proposed method.","production projects, entropy","In this paper, a new multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method based on fuzzy preference relation concept has been developed. Main advantages of the proposed method for assessing critical paths in production project management was strength and weakness scores based on relative comparisons using fuzzy preference relation, and relative comparison of the performances of production project paths. Also, interval-valued fuzzy sets (IVFSs) provide more degree of freedom to cope uncertainty of real world production projects that is why the MCDM method under IVFSs has been extended. Moreover, a new IVF entropy method by means of distance between distance between each point from nearer and farther point among positive ideal point and negative ideal point concepts under IVFSs has been presented. An application about critical path selection by considering efficient criteria such as time, cost, risk, quality and safety by using the proposed method has been solved to better illustrate its capability.

114,Online Platform For Measuring The Lean/Green Maturity  Level Based On The Slg Method,,,"The combined use of the Lean and Green production systems is a trend and has aroused the interest of many authors. However, Lean/Green maturity assessment models are at an early stage and need further study to provide a reliable response for the companies. The SLG model makes an important contribution to this area of research by presenting a set of metrics that are easy to implement by companies of different sizes and industrial sectors. The SLG metrics are based on the literature and the model recommends that its can be validated by specialists. The small number of metrics as well as the simple set of variables that compose them makes possible the adoption of the SLG model by a wide set of companies. The online platform that is presented in this study makes possible the use of SLG, since this model uses calculations with a higher level of complexity, which increases the reliability of the model, but makes it difficult to use it without a support tool. The radial graph that the platform generates also allows the quick visualization of the critical points that the company must address in order to increase its level of Lean/Green maturity. For future studies we suggest improvements in the tool interfaces, to make its use easier and more intuitive. In addition, together with the radial graph, the tool can provide indications about what needs to be improved for the company reaches the next level of maturity, according to the result obtained through the analysis. Evaluations of both the SLG model and the platform should be conducted through case studies in companies of different sizes and industrial sectors to bring to light possible failures and make possible the improvement of both.

115,Analysis Of The Strategies For Incorporating The Informal Waste Collectors‚Äô  Into Formalized Systems:  Engineering Management Perspective,"waste is now considered a valuable resource and the waste management call is shifting from waste disposal to waste utilization and resource management. in order to achieve the call for waste utilization, a number of players are involved in the waste management arena. this study analyses the strategies for incorporating the informal waste collectors (iwcs) into a formalized systems. a number of studies suggesting the integration of the informal waste collectors into formalized systems were analyzed. the study provides evidence that in most developing economies, waste recovery is performed by the informal waste sector (iws) and that there is need to integrate the iws into formalized systems. suggested strategies attributing an engineering management approach are identified. further, the studies indicate that, there is need for an empirical research on the strategies for integrating the informal waste collectors into formalized systems from an informal waste collector‚Äôs perspective.","engineering, informal, integration, management","of these strategies is purely qualitative and isolates the quantitative proof of the informal waste sector. Analysis of the strategies from an engineering management perspective, a number of studies suggested strategies from that perspective. Gutberlet (2008), Chaturvedi (2011), Sembiring and Nitivattanon (2010), Atienza (2010), Storey et al (2015) and Fei et al (2016) recommended strategies such as; sustainability: long term perspective, producer responsibility, packaging reduction, Collection and channelization mechanism; secondary raw material quality improvement; Appropriate technology; Economic and technical assistance; Continuous collection of reliable data on recyclable waste; Training; Price Advantage; information platforms setups and recycling systems layouts optimization. These strategies have an engineering management perspective to achieve sustainable waste recovery and management if properly implemented. Engineering concepts such as reverse logistics can be designed for the recovery of waste. However, integration between the formal and informal waste sector as well as the community and manufacturing industries should be established in order for the recovery system to be sustainable. Further, the identified engineering strategies can be incorporated in the recovery system of waste using engineering concepts of reverse logistics. 5. Research Gap A number of strategies regarding informal waste sector integration have been recommended together with workable frameworks. However, most of these studies developed these strategies in isolation of the voice of the informal waste sector. The methodology used was purely qualitative and did not focus on the IWS as the main respondents to the suggested strategies. Therefore, the next studies should develop workable and quantifiable questionnaires based on some of these strategies and empirically assess the informal waste sector. Further, future research should focus on designing recovery systems that integrate the engineering solutions to the constraints faced by the IWS in the recovery of waste. 6. Conclusion The benefit of integrating the informal waste sector into formalized systems is for all stakeholders. In order to achieve sustainable recovery and maximize on resource utilization, waste management stakeholders; service providers, service users and local authorities should properly and carefully implement these suggested strategies. During the implementation of these strategies, it is important that the views of all stakeholders are considered for effective and workable solutions. The informal waste sector should not be isolated in decision making as they are the major waste recoveries and recyclers in developing economies. Therefore, the identified strategies from an engineering management perspective should be considered during the formation of questionnaires for investigating sustainable strategies for incorporating the IWS into formalized systems. Once the strategies are designed into a questionnaire, they should be empirically analyzed so that, there placement in the integration system is validated.

122,Environmental Sustainability: Abatement Of Co2  Emissions From A Calcination Plant In Zimbabwe,"a small calcination company is starting up in zimbabwe. the main challenge at the company is the abatement of carbon dioxide (co2) emissions. there are 2x3 tonne kilns that have just started operating and are releasing flue gases directly into the air. data was collected through visits to the calcination plant and interviews of key personnel. research into how co2 can be removed from the flue gas before it can be released into the air was carried out with specific reference to the plant. the results showed that environmental sustainability is achievable by minimising the emissions of co2 into the environment and reducing energy and material inputs. addition of chimneys to the kilns will increase draught column and preheating of limestone hence raw materials utilisation will improve. addition of an exhaust will make collection of co2 more convenient. as the flue gas is collected it is made to pass through an amine system that then captures co2. the collected co2 will be sold to companies that use it as a raw material. addition of vermiculite insulating material between the brick layers will improve insulation and energy is utilised. steel reinforcements to the kilns will extend their life span as well. key words: calcination, carbon dioxide, vermiculite, greenhouse gases 1. introduction 1.1 calcination calcination is essentially the process of converting (by burning) limestone into lime. it results in quicklime, calcium oxide. hydrated lime or calcium hydroxide is produced by reacting quicklime with sufficient water to form a dry white powder. the residue is called quicklime or caustic lime. pure quicklime is white and amorphous or crystalline. the specific gravity is 3.2 and melting point 25780c (brady g. s., et al, 2002). lime is employed by a wide range of industries for innumerable uses. it is used widely used in the following industries: steel industry, waste water, cleaning of industrial gases before they are released into the air, paper, paint, ink and plastic industry, cement manufacturing, sugar refineries and gold refineries. 1.2 background ‚Äì jmk trading company in zimbabwe many companies in the industry are slowing down even shutting down due to a number of challenges and mainly the economic challenges facing the country. however a new company, jmk trading (jkmt), has just started up in gweru. the main line of production is the calcination of limestone producing limestone. the company employs 20 people at full capacity and all reporting to 1 manager and owner of the company. the main challenge at jkmt is the emissions of greenhouse gases. there are 2 x 3 tonne kilns, shown in figure 1. as seen in the picture these gases are being released into the air directly. there are no measures in place yet to mitigate the greenhouse gases that are being emitted directly into the air. (mashavakure, 2016) ¬© ieom society international 1077",,"Proposed Solutions to JMK Trading Company 3.1Energy & Material Utilisation and CO2 Capture The most urgent requirement at JMK trading company is taking care of the environmental concerns. These will be achieved by minimising the emissions of greenhouse gases into the environment and aiming at reducing energy and material inputs. 1. Addition of chimneys to the kilns. This will increase draught column hence preheating of limestone as shown in Figure 14. The energy and material utilised will then reduce while achieving the same output. Figure 16 is also showing the exhaust, when this is added to the kilns the capture of the flue gases, hence CO2 becomes much more convenient. As the flue gas is collected it is made to pass through an amine system. Amines will react with the CO2 to form water soluble compounds. Thus CO2 is captured from the stream with a low CO2 partial pressure. This technique will produce a relatively pure CO2 stream. AEP solution is giving hope of better CO2 absorption properties, but more work is still being done on its physical properties. At this time Amines systems would work the best.

123,Improving The Efficiencies Of Pelton Wheel In Microhydro Power Plants,"most micro hydro power systems (mhps) in developing countries, are not delivering their best possible power output due to sub-optimal design and construction of their various components. for existing mhp plants the turbine is much more adaptable to retrofit than any other part of the mhp while keeping the overall project cost per kilowatt produced within acceptable range. therefore this becomes a feasible cost effective strategy to improve the efficiency of a hydro- turbine with the effect of improving the overall efficiency of the system. this research showed that the main factors that affect efficiency of pelton wheel turbines, which are commonly used in southern africa, are the fabrication processes; material used; the control of the water jet movement and flow rate. the fabrication process and the material used determine the roughness of the turbine produced. the roughness determines the friction which in turn affects the efficiency of a turbine. current fabrication processes were compared to other processes such as laser and electron beam cutting and welding, pressure die casting, investment casting and milling. these processes and use of stainless steel resulted in the least rough finish. this gave an overall increase of 20 ‚Äì 25% on the turbine efficiencies.","hydro-power, pelton, turbine, efficiency","& Recommendations This study has revealed that turbines of better efficiencies can be manufactured, made available for MHS and the projects remain financially viable. This was achieved through the comparison of current fabrication methods used at the NGO to methods used by different suppliers of turbines. Even though the better efficiency turbines are more expensive than the ones being used currently the overall benefit is clear. More electricity is generated hence the cost per unit kW actually decreases making the projects even more viable. The financial viability of a project was determined by the project cost per kilowatt produced. Use of better efficiency turbines will make it possible to harness more electrical power from the same resources. The NGO is highly recommended to consider investing in processes that produce turbines with higher efficiencies such as: ‚Ä¢ Pressure die casting of turbines. They may be cast as whole turbines or as segments made up of a number of buckets. ‚Ä¢ Investment casting of whole turbines. ‚Ä¢ CNC milling of Pelton buckets. ‚Ä¢ Cutting of Pelton runner and Cross-flow runner and blades using CNC laser, CNC plasma. ‚Ä¢ Electron beam and laser welding of blades to runners.","l k gudukeya faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa loicekmg@gmail.com c mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References:

124,The Impact Of Risk Management Process On Supply Chain  Performance: An Exploratory Case Study In A Beverage,"there is increased recognition of supply chain management (scm) by organisations globally, in order to gain a competitive advantage. the benefits of implementing a structured quality management system are well documented. the purpose of the study is to propose a logical approach to evaluating and managing risks in the supply chain. the investigation focused on an exploratory case study approach based in a beverage manufacturing organisation. the study investigates the impact of iso 9001:2015 on supplier performance which leads to customer satisfaction and ultimately organisational performance. a pilot study was conducted as iso 9001:2015 is a recently revised standard. the hypotheses were tested using a multiple regression analysis and it was found that there is a strong positive relationship between the predictor variables and dependent variables. the results of the regression analysis validates that supplier performance and customer satisfaction have a strong impact on organisation performance. a risk analysis was conducted using four phases of the risk management process and no critical risk factors were identified. preventive measures and corrective action plans were implemented for risk factors with a medium to low rating.",iso 9001:2015,"From an academic perspective, the study contributes a conceptual risk assessment framework. ISO 9001 confirms that the supplier organisation is robust and has effective systems deployed for the management of supplier and customer needs. The organisations should build on relationships with suppliers in order to maintain an effective and efficient quality management system. The results of the study shows that supplier who provide raw materials and items to organisations, significantly affect the quality of the final product and leads to customer satisfaction. The risk management process was an exploratory study conducted in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of suppliers focusing on the risks associated within the supply chain. Poor supply chain performance could lead to poor quality of goods and services. 6.","manufacturing organisation n. sukdeo department of quality and operations management university of johanneburg gauteng, south africa nsukdeo@uj.ac.za",

It was found that the determinants of the working environment have a significant impact on employee satisfaction. Employees whom are satisfied with their jobs, understand the type of impact that their performance will have on productivity in the organisation. Satisfied employees tend to be more efficient and motivated to do their jobs, this will lead to enhanced work performance and increased productivity. Improvement in employee work performance, adds value to productivity processes. The results of the study indicated that employees are highly satisfied with their jobs as this was due to good remuneration, fairness of treatment, conducive working conditions, greater job security and more training and development.

127,The Role Of Total Quality Management (Tqm) Practices On  Improving Organisational Performance In Manufacturing,"organisations in south africa now, more than ever before, need to introduce total quality management (tqm) in their organisational culture to provide outstanding products and services to their customers. although tqm has been introduced to improve organisational performance, it is perceived that some organisations have not accomplished much over the years. achieving results by implementing tqm is challenging and depends on (i) leadership, (ii) employee involvement, (iii) customer focus, (iv) strategic planning, (v) supplier relations, (vi) process management and (vii) information analysis. these principles must be incorporated in the organisational performance measures in terms of (i) quality improvement, (ii) product/service quality, (iii) customer satisfaction, (iv) employee satisfaction and (v) supplier performance. current research in both the manufacturing and service industries in south africa reveals that tqm does have an influence on the five organisational performance measures and plays an important role in the performance and success of an organisation.",2013] [dale,,"and service organisations. nita sukdeo department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg gauteng, south africa 2001 nsukdeo@uj.ac.za jan-harm pretorius and andre vermeulen school of engineering management university of johannesburg gauteng, south africa 2001",
128,Implementation Of Lean Manufacturing System To  Eliminate Wastes On The Production Process Of Line,"the main purpose of manufacturing industry is to produce goods economically in order to gain profit and be able to deliver products on time. ineffective and efficient production processes lead to non-current production. lean production systems help companies to be competitive, especially in terms of reducing waste (waste) that occurs in their operations. this study aims to reduce production waste in one automotive company by using waste relationship matrix (wrm), waste assessment questionnaire (waq) and value stream mapping (vsm). activities in the automotive industry is to design, develop, manufacture, market and sell motor vehicles in the world. the three methods are intended to identify and analyze the waste (waste) that occurred and make improvements to eliminate waste. from the research results obtained type of waste ""form"" is waiting and motion. while the type of waste ""to"" the inventory. the three types of waste is the greatest procession to occur in the process of assembly trimming on the production line of daihatsu sigra 1.5 l 3nr-ve, dohc dual vvt-i at pt. astra daihastu motor. then performed the improvement implementation by using wrm and vsm method obtained the results of waste efficiency that occurs in the type of waste from the motion from 17.65% to 15.75%, waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and lead time down from 14.202 minutes to 12.322 minutes in one assembly process trimming. some suggestions for improvements made are the implementation of the fifo system (first in first out), improving changes in movement and movement of workers, and line balancing on the assembly line trimming process lines of automobile production processes.",,"is the work of the operators in all three WIPs at point (AT-06, AT-03, AT-04) and (AT-06, AT-07, AT- 08) is not balanced. For that to balance the work of the operator so there is no waiting time the authors suggest to combine these three machines with the concept of first in first out or FIFO and Line Balancing for the division of workload on each operator so that the system works will be balanced in one line prduksi assembly electronic components This car. From the implementation results applied to PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor Training Center, the result of the repair of the original waste waiting 15.88% decreased to 13.12%. From the results of these improvements on waste reduction and waiting waste impact on the total lead time of this car trimming assembly process. Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 becomes the time for 11 assembly process that is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 4. Conclusions Based on the results of research with the method of Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM) and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) can be drawn the following conclusions: 1. Waste identification result using WRM (Waste Realtionship Matrix) and VSM (Vakue Stream Mapping) method on assembly trimming process resulted 3 biggest waste that happened that is Inventory, Motion, and Waiting. 2. Waste type ""from"" that is Motion and Waiting has the largest percentage of 17.65% and 15.88% which means that waste Motion and Waiting if it happens then have a large enough effect to cause other waste that will increase the production lead time. 3. Waste type ""to"" the Inventory has the largest percentage of 18.24% this indicates that waste inventory is the waste that most affected other waste. 4. From the improvements made to eliminate waste motion & waiting is by improving the FIFO system (First in First Out), Improving changes in the movement of workers, and Line Balancing in the assembly trimming process produces some efficiency such as: ‚Ä¢ Reduced Motion waste from 17.65% to 15.75%, and ‚Ä¢ Waste Waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and ‚Ä¢ Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 into the time for 11 assembly process is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 5. Recommendations For future research related to the current research, the authors provide some suggestions as follows: 1. Preferably the object of research is not only limited to the area of assembly trimming course because this area is only one of the whole 5 line car production process. 2. Conducted an overall analysis with regard to factors in other production lines because there is a possibility in the process of production of the car there is another waste that occurs therein. 3. Created simulations with software with several production process scenarios to determine the impact or benefit of any repair recommendations and for the purpose of saving the cost of checking the improvements made.","assembling electronic car components with wrm and vsm method [case study in production process of daihatsu sigra type 1.5 l 3nr-ve, dohc dual vvt-i] muhammad department of industrial engineering (ie ui) faculty of engineering industrial engineering department fakultas teknik - universitas indonesia, depok 16424 tel: (021) 78888805. fax: (021) 78885656 muhammad42@ui.ac.id yadrifil department of industrial engineering (ie ui) faculty of engineering industrial engineering department fakultas teknik - universitas indonesia, depok 16424 tel: (021) 78888805. fax: (021) 78885656 yadrifil@eng.ui.ac.id","References

129,Maintenance Performance Measurement Gaps In  Manufacturing Enterprises: Translation To Management,"maintenance performance is crucial for the viability of many manufacturing organizations as the maintenance status of equipment has a direct impact on manufacturing performance. in turn, the manufacturing performance has a colossal effect on business performance generally as many manufacturing enterprises‚Äô survival is hinged on manufacturing output. the significance of high maintenance performance need no over-emphasis as costs for manufactured goods can spiral out of control only because of low equipment reliability. whether maintenance performance is measured as a direct or indirect business objective, it is irrelevant as it can affect manufacturing performance output momentously if it goes unchecked. thus, for equipment intensive manufacturing enterprises, it is imperative that the maintenance performance is measured and tracked to prevent any downward trending slant. thus this research was carried out to unravel the significance of measuring and monitoring maintenance performance and the value derived from such measurements. the feedback loop to performance improvement need to be further pursued to enable consistent maintenance improvement.",feedback loop,"In essence, the crucial aspect unveiled is that maintenance performance should never be established in isolation from the business strategic thrust. Equipment reliability, and therefore maintenance function performance can derail the overall business performance if not managed properly through effective performance measurement. Customization of performance indicators at various levels of the enterprise will ensure a synchronized business performance with all levels contributing their worth. Human factors also need to be considered as employee buy-in is essential for the success of the MPM scheme. Employee learning and understanding is crucial and many good systems fall through the hands of implementers because of lack of understanding of the value derived or benefits attained by embarking on such business processes. Leadership commitment is always essential to envision the organization towards the right performance attributes and the business leadership need to drive the MPM program. Adequate resources need to be allocated to ensure the requisite infrastructure for data collection and analysis is availed at all levels, e.g. CMMS and computers hardware. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 Monthly‚Ä¶ Monthly‚Ä¶ Monthly‚Ä¶ Jan 2016 Feb 2016 Mar 2016 Apr 2016 May 2016 Jun 2016 Jul 2016 Aug 2016 Sept 2016 Oct 2016 Nov 2016 Dec 2016 Jan 2017 Feb 2017 Mar 2017 Apr 2017 May 2017 Jun 2017 Jul 2017 Aug 2017 Sept 2017 Oct 2017 Nov 2017 Dec 2017 Monthly‚Ä¶ 2017‚Ä¶ 2018‚Ä¶ 2019‚Ä¶ HRS Date T‚Ä¶ PLANT MTBF YTD","system peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

130,Equipment Reliability Curtailment Due To Brinelling Of  Rotating Equipment,"industrial equipment‚Äôs reliability is affected by various aspects, but the fact that over 90% of industrial equipment utilize rolling element bearings makes the reliability of bearings of crucial significance to the overall equipment reliability in industrial plants. one of the major causes of failures for rolling element bearings is brinelling. rotating equipment are prone to the impacts of true and false brinelling, and the industrial impact of brinelling has compelled bearing manufacturers to research extensively on ways to minimize the impact of brinelling on industrial equipment. recently, there is an upsurge of patented greases and equipment designs all done with the objective to minimize or eliminate the effect of true and false brinelling on industrial rotating equipment. this research was carried out to evaluate the measures applicable to curtail the effects of brinelling on rotating equipment reliability. literature review was carried out to reveal measures necessary to prevent or alleviate the impact of brinelling on rotating equipment and then followed by a survey to ascertain industrial practices relevant to preventing brinelling.","false brinelling, true brinelling, fretting corrosion, indentation","Because of the essentiality of bearings to industrial processes, anything that drastically reduces the bearing life (L10) which is depicted by the overall sum of revolutions that a bearing accomplishes fittingly under prescribed environments before any failure ensues, should be curtailed in order to improve equipment reliability (Gurumoorthy and Ghosh, 2013:111). With relevance to heavy equipment, slight flaking or spalling incurred on the bearing might not be reflected as an instantaneous functional failure and the bearing lifespan may be extended with appropriate maintenance action, but it may not be so with small bearings (Gurumoorthy and Ghosh, 2013:110). This research has explored one of the phenomenon that affect industrial processes especially in the advent of using quite a number of rotating equipment. Brinelling ‚Äì true and false is a phenomenon that is currently affecting industrial operations and quite a number of bearing manufacturers are involved with research in pursuit of fighting the problem of false brinelling,. These efforts are evidenced by recent patented greases like the SKF patented grease for reducing false brinelling by 50% in 2016, and designs in wind turbines to protect the equipment from false brinelling. Further studies need to be pursed to find ways to further reduce false brinellling as this failure mechanism is costing industries due to reduced equipment reliability in the event of malpractices that excludes maintaining equipment to prevent false brinelling. Bearing life need to be extended and all actions that are relevant to improve rotating equipment life need to be adhered to. 7.","peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
131,Six Sigma: A Product Differentiator In The Market For  Manufacturing Industries,"global competitiveness has compounded pressure on a lot of organizations to perform in their own local markets as competitive products are landing in the markets with enhanced features and competitive prices. many businesses embark on business improvement approaches to extricate themselves from the competitive jungle that they find themselves in, by deploying superior or cutting edge methodologies like six sigma. six sigma‚Äôs success in saving companies millions of dollars has been proven for a very long time and its relevance as a product differentiator in the product market is still valid currently. the basic creeds of six sigma are able to carry an organization to competitive advantage if it is successfully implemented by an organization and the results are measured as per the methodology. this paper‚Äôs aim is to unravel the product differentiation prowess of six sigma in the market and its capability to render competitive advantage to the business through its performance attributes. a comprehensive literature review was done pertaining to the basic tenets of six sigma and its applicability in the manufacturing industries. published articles and recent books on six sigma were reviewed to extract the dominancy and relevance of six sigma as a business competitive tool. with many business improvement approaches at the disposal of manufacturing organizations, the literature review and case study sought to unveil the underlying advantages embedded in applying the six sigma approach and why it is still the option of choice. organizational decision-makers are granted a platform to evaluate the six sigma practices and the limitations posed by ineffective implementation.","six sigma, differentiation, product market, appilicability","SS is has been deployed efficaciously by organizations that have displayed market leadership for their products, it therefore means that any business that meaningfully embarks on SS is setting itself for market or global preeminence. SS is a regulated approach and it is branded by the pursuit of the DMAIC and DFSS schemes. Deviation from the tenets of the structural approach is tantamount to executional miscarriage of SS. Also, the impact of the application of SS was assessed for a chemical manufacturing business in South Africa and the successful implementation of SS projects rendered competitive advantages as quality differentiation was realized in the market and the company grew in terms of cost effectiveness, delivery performance, customer satisfaction, market share and positively impacting on other stakeholders like employees and shareholders. Apparently, documented organizations present a conducive atmosphere for SS application than undocumented organizations, and in this respect, the business warranted that their ISO 9001 QMS certification was fully exploited for guaranteeing the systematic application of SS projects. This research signifies that SS is an effective approach in differentiating the businesses‚Äô products in the market and that it can be used effectively by any organization to attain competitive advantage in the market place. Above all, SS can be compiled into a compendium of enterprise-wide strategic toolbox, to attain organizational goals to counteract market threats posed by competitors, and as such, further research into the strategic flexibility of SS need to be further pursued to harness its contemporary fit with prevailing strategic thrusts. 7.","peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
132,Priority Rules Performance Analysis As A Ga Initial  Population For Rcmpsp,"solutions to resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem (rcmpsp) were traditionally based on priority rules (pr) heuristics, and meta-heuristic approaches such as genetic algorithms (ga) and evolutionary strategies are recently proposed. in order to improve performance of these solutions, this paper solves the centralized rcmpsp using priority rules (pr) heuristics as best-case scenario for ga initial population. using recently improved heuristics, this research analyze 12 well known priority rules on 14 different sets of simultaneously scheduled multi-projects commonly found in literature, with some generalized characteristics such as activity on node, deterministic durations, limited global resources and minimum total makespan (tms) as objective. furthermore, in order to evaluate the initial population performance, experimental results are compared, in terms of tms and average project delay (apd). analysis results shows that ga approach can lead to better solutions in some cases, in terms of tms and apd, using an improved initial population.","rcmpsp, genetic algorithms, priority rules",", recommendations and future work 6.1 Conclusions This study deals with the Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (RCMPSP) and the use of initial populations for AG, using solutions commonly found in literature (PR heuristics). In order to improve performance of these solutions, this research analyze 12 well known PRs on 14 different sets of simultaneously scheduled multi-projects, with some generalized characteristics such as activity on node, deterministic durations, total global resources and minimum Total Makespan (TMS) And average project delay (APD) as objectives. For TMS, the best PRs are MS, MINLFT and EDD, with TMS averages of 202.00, 202.29 and 203.86 for all 14 instances. For APD the best PR were MINLFT, MS and EDD with averages of 53.58, 55.02 and 55.29 respectively. Finally, for the computational time Tc, the best rules were TWF.EST, WPP and SASP, with 18.06, 18.33 and 18.57 seconds respectively. In general, the best PR, with which all performance measures can be minimized, is MS (Maximum Successors). This PR is activity-based, that is, it takes into account the attributes of the activities and not their use of resources. The good behavior of this PR in all performance measures is due to the fact that by prioritizing activities with the greatest number of successors, it is indirectly given a ""transitivity"" priority to all the activities below the network, reducing the possibility of delays. As for AG, the results showed a better solution for instance 113, both for MS method and TMS performance measure, as for APD and MS, MINLFT and EDD methods. This proves that it is possible to achieve better solutions starting from a previous improved initial population, obtained by the best PR according to the goal sought by the portfolio or program manager. 6.2 Future work The scope of the study is to improve and analyze the solution performance of different PRs as the initial population for GA. However, there are numerous possibilities to analyze that could improve the solutions found. Here are some possible future research lines: ‚Ä¢ In case of a tie, the criterion used as a tie breaker is random, but different PRs may be used as a second or third rule. These results can then be used to run AG and try to get better solutions.","germ√°n eduardo giraldo gonz√°lez full time professor unidad de proyectos escuela colombiana de ingenier√≠a julio garavito bogot√°, ak.45 no.205-59 (autopista norte), colombia german.giraldo@escuelaing.edu.co c√©sar miguel ord√≥√±ez calder√≥n project manager ‚Äì integrarq sas graduate student ‚Äì unidad de proyectos escuela colombiana de ingenier√≠a julio garavito bogot√°, ak.45 no.205-59 (autopista norte), colombia cesar.ordonez-ca@mail.escuelaing.edu.co diego camilo aristizabal gonz√°lez project management consultant for construction companies ‚Äì freelance graduate student ‚Äì unidad de proyectos escuela colombiana de ingenier√≠a julio garavito bogot√°, ak.45 no.205-59 (autopista norte), colombia diego.aristizabal-g@mail.escuelaing.edu.co jonathan xavier castellanos trujillo it director ‚Äì technosoft solutions sas graduate student ‚Äì unidad de proyectos escuela colombiana de ingenier√≠a julio garavito bogot√°, ak.45 no.205-59 (autopista norte), colombia jonathan.castellanos@mail.escuelaing.edu.co","References

133,A Linear Programming Model For Integrated Baked  Production And Distribution Planning With Raw Material And,"a linear programming model for integrated production planning study for methods, procedures and practices of a south african bread producing firm. the study considers the entire planning activity in the firm as an integrated process involving several closely related functions. the mathematical modelling considers production costs, production throughput rates, customer specifications and demands, sales process and facility capacities and designs an optimal production planning. the firm produces two perishable products that should be stored for fixed periods. there is a series a of vehicles responsible for delivering the products from the firm to distribution centers in specific quantities. computation of results and analysis reveals that the integrated methodology is feasible and practical.","production planning, baking industry","In this research, we were presented formulations for integrating production planning and distribution Scheduling of baked products within a supply chain. The problems are in relation to the supply chain network (a single manufacturing facility and multi delivery centers). There is also a fleet of internal vehicles that is in control for transporting the products from facility to distribution centers. In each period of Scheduling, a vehicle can at most make a single trip to a distribution center. The produced items are perishable, that is they can be stored for only a fixed period. The manufactured capacity is limited and there can be no shortage in distribution centers. The decisions to be made in each scheduling period are product quantities, distribution centers that should be visited, and the levels of inventory to be delivered. Based on the above a linear programming and a balanced transportation model where developed formulated. The proposed method is efficient considering solution for quality and time performance. In addition, it can provide robust results. In addition, it is proven that the complexity of the proposed method depends on linear multiplication of three parameters, number of distribution centers, vehicles and Scheduling period. The studied program also contains some limitations into decision making for other companies within this industry. Therefore, it can be concluded that the linear programming model for integrated Baking production and distribution Scheduling with raw materials considerations, is working well rather than independent production to distribution. 6.","routing consideration. magano molefe m. molefe department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg bunting road, auckland park po box 2006, rsa mmolefe@uj.ac.za",
134,Future Center For Energy Sector Of Ostrobothnia! A Smart Choice  Towards Organizational And Societal Innovative Improvement,"the study presents an attempt to offer a feasibility cum analytical review aimed to suggest the establishment of future center at the ostrobothnia region for energy sector‚Äôs support. the study is formulized on the basis of the method of community need assignment as well as the support of the concept of emotional intelligence. the results of the research analysis confirmed the potential of establishing of the `energy future center` for the sector‚Äôs uplift as well as sustainability. 1. introduction the current research paper is a feasibility cum analytical review aimed to investigate following research dimensions: ÔÇß worth of supporting a proposal on the establishment of `energy future center` for energy sector of ostrobothnia, a region located in western finland. ÔÇß ways to achieve attention of small and large scale energy companies to initiate a two way communication process. to obtain the above research objectives, the author tries to highlight and justify the location of ostrobothnia as a suitable venue for the establishment of innovative future center(s). the fact behind selecting the referred region is its vital resources [i.e., long term industrial history of the area, existing infra-structure, communicational facilities and the presence of the majority stakeholders (i.e., companies, researchers, funding and regulatory authorities) confirming the area to be the best choice. the paper further throws light on the process of `need assessment` of the ostrobothnia energy companies. the core idea is to find out the ways to initiate a healthy `communication process` on the basis of `contextual intelligence and emotional intelligence` to make the message more strong and appealing for the target population. later, the concepts, relevance, and significance of `future centers¬¥, with regards to the european as well as ostrobothnia locations will be highlighted on the logical ground. in the end, a list of the energy sector companies located in ostrobothnia, with regards to their size and nature of operations are placed. the final stage of the paper helped in arriving at the list of challenges or the areas of interests` for the ostrobothnia companies to build a strong base for initiating a healthy mutual communicational process. 2. ostrobothnia region and energy sector the region of `ostrobothnia¬¥ identified as a historically significant region situated in western finland. it is considered most picturesque western coast. this region holds great potential, due to having strong energy sector infrastructural. 2.1 strong spread of energy industry according to the estimated projected figures, there are more than 120 businesses in the ostrobothnia region that operate as energy technology subcontractor. furthermore, these energy sector companies are operating with an approximated total of 12,000 as their work force, and are contributing to the national economy through a remarkable turnover of around 7.5 billion euros. 2.2 research opportunities in ostrobothnia region the area is well served through the strong network of universities, training centers and research institutes. university of vaasa, vamk, university of applied sciences, hanken, vaasa energy institute are few prominent names to start with. ¬© ieom society international 1222",,,through proactive leadership syeda asiya zenab kazmi phd. researcher. asiyakazmi@hotmail.com,"References

135,Removal Of Methylene Blue Using Mango Seed Derived  Carbon,"when mangoes are consumed or processed, their peels and seeds are generated as waste. the waste is an environmental concern, but it is a natural and renewable resource. in this project, a process was developed to convert mango seeds into carbonized adsorbents. the effectiveness of mango seed-derived carbon in removing a dye from water was evaluated. water containing methylene blue was treated with mango seed-derived carbon. the concentration of methylene blue in the water before and after the treatment was monitored by a do-it-yourself ‚Äúspectrophotometer‚Äù.","mango seeds, carbon, methylene blue, water","A carbonization was used to convert mango seeds into carbon at 500 ¬∞C under nitrogen protection. Two adsorption experiments were conducted with changed variables, and the results show that the mango seed derived carbon can remove methylene blue from water. Surface atoms of the adsorbent are partially exposed so the adsorbate molecules can be attracted. Methylene blue molecules can adhere physically to the surface of the carbon, and are separated from water. Through the adsorption equilibrium experiment, the results concluded that the solutions with lower concentrations of methylene blue became clearer, almost like water. The equilibrium relationship between the amount of methylene blue adsorbed per unit mass of carbon (Qe) and the equilibrium concentration (Ce) showed that Qe increases with Ce initially, and it gradually levels off. Eventually when the concentration is so large, the amount of methylene blue adsorbed by the carbon stays relatively the same. The carbon has reached its adsorption limit and is no longer able to adsorb more methylene blue. Through the effect of amount of adsorbent experiment, the data and graphs show that as larger amounts of carbon were used in the experiment, more methylene blue was adsorbed, and the water became clearer. As the amount of carbon increases, the % removal gets more steady and flat as it slowly approaches 100%. After a certain amount of carbon was added, the line became completely straight. These two experiments show that the methylene blue concentration and the amount of carbon in the solution play a big role in the process of removing methylene blue from water. In the future, the accuracy of the spectrophotometer needs to be improved. Different methods of carbonization and activation will be investigated.

136,An Investigation On The Causes Of Derailments In The  Loccomotive Industry,"the aim of this project is to investigate the causes of derailments in the locomotive industry. the focus is on a specific locomotive yard. several derailments have occurred on this line and an investigation is critical in finding out what is causing these derailments. the primary objectives of this research are to determine whether the use of poka-yoke devices can be utilised in managing derailments, and to further investigate the applicability of poka-yoke devices. past evidence from literature points out that railway derailments have a huge impact on operations, production and the employees‚Äô health and safety. data is collected from a population of 60 employee‚Äôs. the investigation provides a recommendation of using poke-yoke devices to detect potential failures in an operation and the cause of erratic process behavior with the objective of minimizing and avoiding freight derailments. the analysis of results revealed that 66.67% of derailments at the yard were caused by operational failures (human errors), while 16.67% is caused by infrastructure failures, rolling stock and other failures contribute 8.33% of failures which lead to derailments. this paper contributes to the continuous discussion on processes failures reduction in the locomotive industry.","poke-yoke, derailments, mistake proofing","Derailments are the most common type of train accident on each track type, and most of trains derailed due to points related accidents. Poor adjustment of points and equipment failures are the primary causes of train derailments within the yards, whereas the use of switches and switching rules has a substantial effect on derailment frequency on siding and yard tracks. The interactive effects of derailment speed and accident cause affect train accident frequency and severity. With the implementation of poka-yoke devices TFR will improve its overall operational capabilities if these devices are being put to work. This will minimise or rather avoid derailments and help find root causes as to why TFR is experiencing such setbacks.","magano molefe m. molefe department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg bunting road, auckland park po box 2006, rsa mmolefe@uj.ac.za manti silase m. silase department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg bunting road, auckland park po box 2006, rsa silasem@uj.ac.za","REFERENCES

WCS is an advanced version of TPM, and without understanding the TPM fundamentals one cannot implement WCS effectively. The only difference between TPM and WCS is that WCS is TPM that is gunning for best practices and modeled for implementability. Therefore, it is time to move from TPM and start embracing WCM and WCS as they are contemporary strategies that exude more benefits than TPM. Further research need to be taken on exploring the deficiencies and limitations of WCS and thereby recommending further improvement actions to make it more robust and adaptable to a diversity of firms. 6.","peter muganyi department of engineering management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa peter777.muganyi@gmail.com charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",

146,Organic Solid Waste Treatment And Its Deposition Through  Sewage Net. Technical And Financial Analysis For Domiciliary,"in this work, it is intended to address the problem of urban solid waste (usw) progressive generation and the decreasing spaces availability for its deposition. based on this situation, main objective is to analyze the technical, economic and financial viability of an usw-organic-fraction-treatment home automatic and continuous system implementation, applied in buenos aires city, argentina. in terms of the selected methodology, the following technical aspects are firstly studied: - domiciliary system (composter) analysis in its two possibilities of final result: i) deposition through sewage net, considered for apartments, ii) compost for amendment purpose, considered for houses. - system implementation viability within buenos aires from studies and field measurements. based on the technical analysis, economic and financial study has the objective of proving the significant saving for the city government that the reduction of organic waste fraction can potentially generate. in order to obtain these results, some of the considered economic aspects are: - definition of the budget able to be saved. - costs and utility generation since the domiciliary system implementation. - choice of a rate of return to calculate the net present value of the project. regarding the conclusions, the main one is the verification of viability of this implementation in buenos aires.","waste digestion, composting, compost production","The main objective of the USW management is to recover the highest percentage of waste obtaining value, either through recycling, composting or incinerating to generate energy. It is established as necessary the separation at origin, and as a regulatory policy are used methods of benefits and punishments for which the regulation fails. Buenos Aires propitiates the separation at source (recyclable and non-recyclable) but the percentage of waste disposal is relatively high, and little or no value is obtained. The local context of waste generation reflects the need to manage solid waste in an intelligent way, with careful selection and sustainable development in the use of technologies, establishing a relationship between society and the authorities that manage waste. This forces the participants, both government and society, to commit to the ecosystem. Throughout this study it was wanted to revise the final deposition options resulting from the treatment of domestic composting in terms of its technical and economic analysis. As for the technical verification, the option of disposal by sewer, it was possible to verify that there is an affinity relationship between sewage sludge and organic waste compost which not only generates the acceleration of the digestion process of these sludge, but also Improves its final quality by having it added nutrients and purifying biota in this way. The important thing to emphasize also is that the stabilized compost that would dump in the cloaca will not add gases to those already generated by the anaerobiosis, since the organic fraction of the RSU already enters treated. The same happens with the measurement of organic fraction, which would not increase when the organic matter is already digested. As far as the possibility of obtaining the compost as a fertilizer from the technical point of view, it is verified that, either for its personal use in amendment of gardens or for commercialization with the agricultural sector, this type of use generates a benefit for whom it produce. As for the economic aspect, it was wanted to verify that in this project would generate a saving for the government of the City to reduce the organic fraction of the garbage, and that there would be no loss of capital in any exercise from the implementation of the project. The implementation of the composter in sync with Buenos Aires's building renovation gives the government a saving in all fiscal periods, allowing part of these funds to be distributed to training, publicity and subsidies to house dwellers, favoring the latter decision to increase the benefits every year. Although a horizon of confidence was determined for the 3-year project values, after this time, an ex-post analysis could be done to evaluate the existing conditions. In light of the results obtained on both the technical, economic and financial aspects, the domestic installation of the composter is convenient for the reduction of the USW in Buenos Aires, generating savings in the City budget. It is hoped that this project will serve as a guide and pilot test for the development of the same type of plan in other cities of the country, and tomorrow we will be able to insert Argentina into the global commitment to the future of our and the next generations.","treatment systems. willson, victoria; calcagno, facundo mart√≠n; boeykens, susana p.; caracciolo, n√©stor universidad de buenos aires, facultad de ingenier√≠a, chemistry laboratory of heterogeneous systems (laqu√≠sihe), buenos aires, argentina laquisihe@fi.uba.ar","References

Current leading industrial solutions are coming from additive manufacturing domain as many supporting software has been built on cloud from the beginning. Similar functionality can be built to support traditional manufacturing processes such as cutting, milling, extruding, welding and assembly operations in various industries. The experiences from 3D printing and other advanced digital manufacturing should be enhanced for other manufacturing technologies. The CloudEcosystem prototype model designed shows that a generic data model support the key requirements for three different portal types. The main challenges are handling the interactions between customers, designers and manufacturers in a common system and provide a mechanism for handling product design, order fulfilment and quoting processes in an efficient and automated way. Cloud based architectures allow an efficient ‚Äúmanufacturing as a service‚Äù infrastructure with separation of multi-tenant global part with factory level software entities. Three identified portal types are all possible scenarios for implementing manufacturing as a service. Further research should be paid on techniques supporting manufacturing license handling and safe intellectual property rights in a distributed ecosystem.

Java was used to successfully simulate pi, it was concluded that the sample size impacted the result, determined that only needed 6 digits of pi, and the code was shortened even though the accuracy improved. For the future, another goal will be added, which is to measure the computation time for each of the codes, then compare them. The Sphere Method did not work as well as the other two Methods. After some investigating, the root cause of this was found. First, the Monte Carlo Method with the Upper Triangle Method were compared. The concentration of the dots was higher within the same sample size for the Upper Triangle Method. However, that wasn't the only reason. The further away the dots were from the circumference of the circle, the less accurate the value of the data was. The Upper Triangle Method took care of these outliers by limiting the location to the upper half. This concludes that the accuracy is also dependant on how the data is to the circumference. The results from the same sample sizes in the Monte Carlo Method and the Sphere Method were compared. The Monte Carlo Method did have the outliers, but the error was exponentially increased after using the Sphere Method.

154,Creating A Sustainable Zimbabwean Film And Television  Industry,"this article unveils the current situation in zimbabwean film and television industry based on its history, regulatory laws, digitalization and the new technological innovations. the paper attempts to conceptualize on how to create a viable and consistent film and television industry in zimbabwe. based on the secondary sources and random interviews with filmmakers, it was observed that more research is required to strengthen the zimbabwean film and television industry in order to produce quality films and compete with the current market demand. the industry needs qualified personnel to run companies effectively, investment to produce films, new equipment to operate efficiently, co-productions with other countries to exchange skills, and public support especially from the government and the citizens to promote the sales of the film for it to become sustainable. furthermore, the industry needs to take measures to establish a well-defined policy that promote films in zimbabwe and accommodate foreign investment in order for the industry to develop.","sustainable, digitalization, film, television","and Recommendations This article provides a comprehensive overview of a Zimbabwean film and television industry and a detailed breakdown of challenges and opportunities associated with the creation of sustainable film industry in Zimbabwe. The paper discusses ways to develop and create a sustainable film industry so that it can actively participate in the Zimbabwean economy as it has the potential to create employment. Although there are many problems to be addressed in the film and television industry, filmmakers should try to improvise the use of technology, handle film crew, and collaborate with international counterparts to run the project successfully. Film and television, as media and a form of communication, have a great impact on other forms of communication like advertising, hence its success has positive influence on all other industries. For instance, a television advert showing popular actor using a mobile phone or showing off the latest unique advanced features of the phone may prompt viewers to purchase the phone. Another example is the film making a song or singer popular, a very good example is ‚ÄòMy heart will go on‚Äô from Celion Dion in the movie Titanic. If the suggested initiatives are embarked on, the industry is poised to grow significantly over the next decade. The fact that the government is advocating for digitalization shows that there is a green light for the future of the industry and this could lead to employment creation resulting in the economic growth. Even though the government institutions and other commissions like BAZ have a crucial role to play, it is in the hands of film practitioners to take the most decisive impact for this revolution. It is, therefore, essential for the authorities together with Zimbabwean filmmakers to have constant conference to pave a way forward to ensure that the legislative laws allow potential media companies to privately set up televisions broadcasting satellites and find ways to accommodate foreign investors. Having foreign investors will promote exchange of information and skills, and open new markets for the television programs such as films from our own locally produced productions. This will position the industry into a global radar, and fundamental to this is the creation of international exposure and recognition, which will maintain a well-developed film and television industry in Zimbabwe. It is suggested that the filmmakers should come up and run a pilot project together which will unfold the relevance of film industry in Zimbabwean economy and its positive impact to other industries and its contribution to the nation. This pilot project mandate will have to convince, attract and unearthing the value of the industry to the investors and the positive impact that the industry have in the growth of the economy and in creating employment, especially for the youths. This can be arranged in the form of a documentary showing other successful film and television industries or feature film instead of using research articles.

155,Strengthening Operations Management In Zimbabwean  Film Industry,"this article discusses the importance of operations management in film industry and examines how operations management affects the processes of filmmaking that leads to the production of good quality films. the study also seeks to find effective methods of strengthening operations management in the zimbabwean film industry. an intensive review of literatures was conducted to assess the processes of production and distribution of films, and it was observed that there is a need to improve the operations management of film industry in zimbabwe. most companies are operating without operations managers, thus resulting in poor quality productions and services.","film industry, quality production, therefore","Film is a powerful mean of the world recreation and an artistic work that should be seriously considered in Zimbabwe. Film genres, such as documentary, have become a teaching tool in academic institutes to deliver information to students on history, science and other disciplines. It is a service that entertains and educate, which frames how other countries perceive the country. The Zimbabwean film industry is lacking proper operations management, which is resulting in poor quality products and hence the industry is losing its audience. The film industry needs to strengthen operations management in order to create a viable film industry and compete with international film companies.
