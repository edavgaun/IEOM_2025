0,Analysis Of Scientific Initiation In Brazil With Emphasis On  Regional Disparities And Distribution Between Public And,"the advance in the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge around the world has been causing an increase in public actions to contribute to decision makers at specific levels of competence. within this context, this study aims to analyze the impact of investments in public policies at the beginning of the academic research chain in brazil, that is, scientific initiation and regional disparities about it. this research has a qualitative nature and is based on information obtained from the national council for scientific and technological development. as a result of this analysis, it was found that, despite the existence of a legal basis that protects the north, northeast and midwest regions, regional disparities are still critical. additionally, the participation of private higher education institutions in the scientific initiation scholarship system is still low, which is mainly due to the low quality of the projects presented by these institutions. thus, more effective actions to reduce disparities and increase the quality of research in private higher education institutions, such as, for example, the use of clear criteria and scripts in the notices for the evaluation of research projects, must be adopted by the governmental sphere of public policies to foster research in brazil.","public policy, that is","When analyzing the information on investments in public policies for scientific initiation in Brazil, in the existing model, we find that, despite the legal basis that protects the North, Northeast and Midwest regions, regional disparities are still critical. In addition, the participation of private HEIs in the scientific initiation scholarship system is still low, which is mainly due to the low quality of the projects presented by these institutions, especially due to the low focus of these HEIs in the research field. Thus, more effective actions to reduce disparities and increase the quality of research in HEIs must be adopted by the governmental sphere of public policies to promote research in Brazil. In this sense, the objective of the research was met by making a critical analysis of the impact of investments in public policies at the beginning of the academic research chain in Brazil, that is, scientific initiation and regional disparities about this process. The research found difficulties in compiling the total of scientific initiation proposals submitted by all HEIs in the country, due to their scope and diversity. Thus, the analysis points to the need for a more in-depth study of the mechanisms that guide the distribution of resources for scientific initiation in Brazil.","private institution fábio aquino da silva1 geisa meirelles drumond2 marcelo jasmim meiriño3 mirian picinini méxas4 engineering school fluminense federal university niterói, rj, brazil faquin98@gmail.com1, meirellesdrumond@gmail.com2, marcelojm@id.uff.br3, mirian_mexas@id.uff.br 4 haydée maria correia da silveira batista civil engineering department federal university of rio de janeiro rio de janeiro, brazil haydeemcsb@gmail.com",
1,Blockchain Technology And Supply Chain:  An Application Review,"the market of oil and gas encompasses long-term, high-risk projects, which leads companies to search for solutions that can bring more reliability and efficiency to their processes. blockchain technology has emerged in the financial market but has expanded to other fields where one of the most promising markets for its use is in the supply chains of materials and services. by means of bibliographical research, it has been possible to identify the main applications of this technology, as well as to evaluate its current stage of deployment and its main aspects. it was possible to investigate replacement automation, modelling of logistics and supply operations, digitalization, costing, payment systems and smart contracts, which from a pool of several hundred publications, demonstrated to be the most important ones about the usage of blockchain in the supply chain.","blockchain, oil and gas",,"alexandre do valle faria professor and research fluminense federal university rio de janeiro, brazil e-mail: avalle.faria@gmail.com carlos eduardo r. b. barateiro department of engineering estácio de sá university macaé, brazil e-mail: cerbb@terra.com.br josé rodrigues de farias filho professor and research fluminense federal university rio de janeiro, brazil e-mail: fariasfilho@gmail.com",
2,Reducing Imposter Detection Time Of Web Applications  Using Continuous Authentication,"mouse dynamic-based behavioral biometrics can provide an extra layer of security for web applications while ensuring the usability of the application. it also minimizes the password-sharing issue faced by web-based service providers. researchers have achieved this with two different models, namely continuous authentication (ca) and periodic authentication (pa). pa model authenticates the user regularly after a set of actions or a certain time duration whereas ca model authenticates the user after every single action. these models are evaluated based on accuracy metrics such as false acceptance rate (far), false rejection rate (frr), and area under the curve (auc). however, the imposter detection time is also an important factor for evaluating ca and pa models. the main two metrics that have been introduced related to imposter detection time are the average number of genuine actions (anga) and the average number of imposter actions (ania). according to the literature, most of the ca models have been developed to authenticate the user while using the computer for general purposes. however, only a few models are have been proposed to authenticate users when they are using web applications. further, the data sets that are used to develop the above ca models are also classified into two categories as web application-based activities and general application-based activities considering the way of data collection. patterns and variations that occur naturally when users are interacting with their web applications using mouse are called web-based mouse dynamics which are mainly captured during navigating, and reading. among the few research conducted on web application-based mouse dynamic continues authentication models, the imposter detection time-based matrices such as anga and ania have not been considered. this paper we therefore present an approach to increase the confidentiality of web applications using a continuous authentication model optimized to reduce imposter detection time based on the user’s mouse dynamics. the proposed approach first identifies the best mouse movement features to reduce the number of mouse movements and based on those identified features, then a ca model is developed to reduce the imposter detection time. bogazici mouse dynamic dataset is used for the training and development of the ca model since this data set contains the details such as timestamp, pointer position, and interacted application. the input data set is trained using the best models that are identified from the literature, particularly the ones with high performance for accuracy and minimal block size. finally, an evaluation is conducted related to the accuracy and response time, and those models are compared with existing models to identify the most optimal model for web applications which reduces the imposter detection time based on mouse behavior.",mouse dynamic,,"h.p.n. hettiarachchi, b. jayawardena and k. wijayasiriwardhane department of industrial management, faculty of science, university of kelaniya, sri lanka priyakanisal@hotmail.com, buddhikaj@kln.ac.lk, thareen@kln.ac.lk",
3,Impact Of Supply Chain Collaboration On The Tanzanian  Agri-Food Supply Chain. Intervening Effect Of Partner,"this study aims to explore the antecedents of supply chain collaboration (scc) and then the relationship of the multidimensional construct of scc with supply chain performance. the paper also delves into the mediating and moderating impact of commitment and transactional cost economics at the nexus of scc and supply chain performance. a theoretical model and associated hypotheses were established, drawing upon the systematic review of the extant literature, transactional cost economic and resource-based theories. the model was empirically validated using structural equation modelling on survey data from 635 managers of the agri-food supply chain in tanzania. results revealed that the most influencing scc antecedents in the agri-food supply chain include incentive alignment, goal congruence, joint knowledge creation, and decision synchronisation. we also find that scc as a higher-order construct significantly positively impacts supply chain performance (scp). further, the mediation-moderation test shows that the impact of scc on supply chain performance is partially mediated by partners commitment while significantly moderated by transactional costs management. supply chain partners who manage transactional costs recognise potential problems, monitor deviations, and halt the possibility of partners taking advantage of the relationship, enhancing better performance. our study synthesised social exchange, resource based-view, transaction cost economies and resources dependency theories to explain how supply chain collaboration affects supply chain performance. as a result, supply chain collaboration construct and transaction cost economies have also been improved. this study is one of the first to uncover the role of transactional cost management in moderating the relationship between collaboration and supply chain performance. the findings show that chain partners who manage transactional costs recognise potential problems, monitor deviations, and the possibility of partners taking advantage of the relationship, resulting in better performance. furthermore, this study addresses the literature's recurrent demand for broadening the analytical unit beyond dyadic relationships. as a result, this study broadens the scope of collaboration research beyond specific business and buyer-supplier relationships to a three-stage supply chain. the results inform managers that full benefits of collaboration can be reaped when firms share accurate, complete and relevant crops/products information, share ownership of expensive resources, especially agricultural equipment, storage and transport facilities; and set goals on issues such as transport and storage efficiency, production/sales efficiency and projected level of returns. regarding collaborative communication, this study verifies that open and frequent adjusted and standardised two-way, multilevel correspondence is, for the most part, a better way of enhancing joint decisions and inter-connections. the causal influence of supply chain collaboration on supply chain performance is partially conveyed through partners commitment. therefore, supply chain managers are advised to institute a commitment ethos in their respective organisations to enhance performance.",supply chains,,"commitment and transaction cost management bajjet sylvester naresho, imran ali and delwar akbar school of business and law, central queensland university australia. bajjet.naresho@cqumail.com, i.ali@cqu.edu.au, d.akbar@cqu.edu.au",

6,Optimal Truck Dispatch Scheduling Of Ready Mixed  Concrete: A Case Study From Bolivia,"the use of scheduling techniques in ready mixed concrete (rmc) firms in bolivia is a complex problem. the authors developed a linear model for a bolivian rmc firm taking into account the research context. this model integrated rmc truck dispatch data to decide the optimal rmc supply schedule. the authors used historical dispatching data, interviews, and field measurements to build a database and characterize the firm's demand to build an optimized model. a solution algorithm using solver from excel was developed to efficiently solve the optimal rmc supply scheduling problem. afterward, the solution was compared using actual operational data. the results show that the solution algorithm increases rmc supply efficiency and saves costs.","efficiency, scheduling, optimization","Our study makes two contributions to Latin American and Bolivian literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to develop an optimized RMC supply model. Second, based on Feng et al. (2004) and Albayrak and Albayrak (2016), we propose an optimized supply model for RMC firms. Hence, our findings suggest the usability of optimized models in developing countries, such as Bolivia. Specifically, we developed a flow chart to develop the optimized supply model, performed semi-structured interviews with the firm's mixer truck operators, and collected historical information on truck supply cycle times. Next, using the collected information, we determined the average supply cycle times, and thus we created an optimized linear transportation model based on Feng et al. (2004) and Albayrak and Albayrak. Afterward, we used Solver from Microsoft Excel to solve the model. Then, we performed simulations of both current and optimized supply models using different demand values, districts, and jobs. Later, we implemented the solution in a Microsoft Excel Worksheet to automatically and optimally assign clients to trucks, RMC plants, truck departure and arrival times to construction districts, RMC loading and unloading times, and truck departure and arrival times to RMC plants. Next, we validated the model using random demand values to compare the historical and optimized supply cycle times. The optimized supply model decreases average supply cycle times by 28%. Moreover, our optimized model reduces the RMC supply costs from 10 to 7 USD/m3. All studies have limitations, and ours is no exception. First, future studies can increase the accuracy of our results using RMC geospatial data to develop better scheduling models. Second, our study context was in Cochabamba, a small city with a concentration of construction sites in specific districts. Future studies can determine if our model shows similar performance in bigger cities where construction sites are evenly distributed. We expect that our model will inspire future researchers in Bolivia and Latin America to develop optimized RMC supply models according to the context where they live.","boris christian herbas-torrico jorge andres enriquez-reyes exact sciences and engineering research center (cicei) bolivian catholic university cochabamba, bolivia bherbas@ucb.edu.bo; enriquezjorgeandres@gmail.com",

8,Effort Optimization Model In Warehouse Manual Picking.  Case Study: Tusan Distribuidores,"a recurring and expensive operation in company’s warehouses is the picking. operators who execute this activity perform repetitive physical movements and carry objects constantly, which can trigger musculoskeletal disorders. adittionally, there is a great consumption of energy by the operators, which could have negative consequences in the long term. health damages could reduce the quality of the company’s service and productivity due to the increase in absenteeism of the personnel because of the recovery. the objective of the investigation is the application of an optimization model to reduce energy consumption during picking through the redistribution of product lines within a warehouse. the warehouse under study belongs to a peruvian distributor with several lines of products for mass consumption. the applied model will be the one proposed by diefenbach & glock. the data of the current situation taken were: demand, average weights per line, efforts, distances and locations, which were coded in “a mathematical programming language” (ampl) and solved using the cplex solver. the results show 4.4% reduction in energy expenditure compared to the current distribution and 6.0% compared to randomly generated distributions. finally, the optimal distribution by product lines is presented as a result of the modelling that reduces effort.","picking, optimization model","As picking involves repetitive motion and loading products, it may lead to the development of musculoskeletal disorders and to considerable energy expenditure, which may ultimately bring about negative effects on human health.

9,Machine Learning In Finance: An Application Of Predictive  Models To Determine The Payment Probability Of A,"in the last decades, private debt collection has become an important industry in ecuador. debt collection agencies are organizations that manage the process of collecting money from delinquent debts and their performance is often measured by the collection success rate. however, determining which clients will repay their liabilities is a complex process and many times subjectively judged. machine learning (ml) models have been successfully implemented on the financing sector for various applications, however a limited amount of work has been published in the prediction of a client´s debt payment probability. in this study, ml models are trained to predict a client´s payment probability to an ecuadorian debt collection agency the first three months after signing a payment agreement. specifically, a feedforward neural network, logistic regression, and gradient boosting ensemble models are implemented using the semma data mining methodology, which comprises the steps of sample, explore, modify, model, and assess. furthermore, by analyzing the results of the models, relevant features that determine whether a costumer will pay or not its debt are identified. the results show that neural networks perform better than the competing models in terms of classification accuracy.","neural networks, machine learning","In this work, a study was conducted in an Ecuadorian Debt Collection Agency to develop a ML model that predicts the clients that will pay their debt after signing a payment agreement. The problem was formulated as a supervised classification problem, following the SEMMA methodology for data mining projects. In the exploratory data analysis, the distribution of the variables was analyzed as well as the relationship between them. On the modify step, the null values were treated, and a forward stepwise selection method was used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and select the most important variables. On the model phase, the SMOTE oversampling technique was applied to the unbalanced data set to reduce the disproportionality of the minority class during training. A logistic regression, gradient boosting ensemble, and neural network model were implemented due to their interpretability and capability to model the response variable. The models were evaluated in the assess phase using the metrics of sensitivity, precision, specificity, ROC curve, and AUC. The results show that the neural network model outperformed the competing models in the prediction of the first- and second-month payment, while the gradient boosting performed best during the third month prediction in terms of sensitivity. Hence, it is recommended to use a neural network to classify customers based on the overall performance on the three months. Furthermore, it was found that the variables that affects if a client will pay the next months after an agreement are transferor, qualification in the risk center, education level, and purchase value. The DCA should put emphasizes in analyzing these variables before buying a debt and determining with which clients to sign first the payment agreement.","client andrés buitrón, celeste rodríguez, maría baldeon calisto universidad san francisco de quito, usfq, colegio de ciencias e ingeniería, departamento de ingeniería industrial and instituto de innovación en productividad y logística catena-usfq, diego de robles s/n y vía interoceánica, quito, ecuador 170901 abuitronc@estud.usfq.edu.ec, mcrodriguez@estud.usfq.edu.ec, mbaldeonc@usfq.edu.ec sebastián bonilla universitat politecnica de catalunya- barcelona tech, facultad de matemáticas y estadística, carrer de jordi girona, 31, barcelona españa sebastian.bonilla@estudiantat.upc.edu",

12,Technologies Applied To Public Administration. A Perspective Of  Digital Government A Global Level.,". from the 1990s, the public administration introduced in its activities the intensive use of technologies to make its processes more efficient. the goal is to provide better services to citizens. since then, and derived from the new information and communication technologies, governments have evolved towards their digitalization. in this context, this article shows the evolution of digital government at a global level based on the comparison between countries with the highest degree of development in this area. likewise, the most advanced cases in the application of new technologies in public administration are shown.","digital government, e-government, information",". Throughout this paper, what is meant by electronic government and its evolution in digital government has been analyzed. It was observed that this began with greater force in the United States and in traditional economic powers such as Canada, France, Germany or the United Kingdom. However, in recent years there has been a trend where Asian countries (South Korea, Singapore), oceanic (Australia, New Zealand), Nordic (Denmark, Sweden, Finland) and even ex-Soviet republics such as Estonia have taken the lead in this matter. This is because they have been able to channel the use of new information and communication technologies (blockchain, social networks, electronic votes or artificial intelligence) in their public administrations. The tangible application examples are a sample of the way in which the governments of these countries have not stagnated in the use of personal computers, cell phones or the internet. What is exposed in this article is focused on the countries that are spearheading digital government. More questions remain to be answered: what happens in other less developed regions such as Africa or Latin America? Of course, their progress is much less. But, without a doubt, they will also deserve a specific study.

20,The Natural Language Processing (Nlp) Algorithm  Integrated With Fmeca Analysis Applied In The,"global electricity consumption has continued to grow rapidly. this growth of consumption shows that energy will be one of the major problems in the future. maintenance of the energy supply is essential, as the interruption of this service leads to higher expenses, representing substantial monetary losses and even legal penalties for the power generation company (azam et al,2021). hydroelectricity is the basis of the brazilian energy matrix. therefore, it is clear the need to maintain the availability and operational reliability of hydroelectric plants, so as not to compromise the continuity and conformity (quality) of the electrical energy supply to the end consumer. ensuring availability along with the reliability of hydroelectric plants can be maintained by employing appropriate maintenance policies that reduce the likelihood of failure or even eliminate its root causes, preventing failure from occurring. the aim of this paper is presenting a proposed smart maintenance system model that integrates natural language processing (nlp) algorithm and fmeca (failure mode, effects & criticality analysis) database automated by power bi® for the development of consistent maintenance plans for hydrogenerators assets. this integrated innovative tool can identify the operational subsystem chronic failure modes supporting industrial managers to incorporate tasks aimed at strengthening and increasing the maintenance plan consistency in blocking failure modes before them occurrences. this work was applied to a case study in a 525 kv transformer of a hydrogenerator unit type francis to demonstrate its use and contribute to its understanding.","nlp algorithm, fmeca","Hydroelectricity is the basis of the Brazilian energy matrix. Therefore, it is clear the need to maintain the availability and operational reliability of hydroelectric plants, so as not to compromise the continuity and conformity (quality) of the electrical energy supply to the end consumer. Ensuring availability along with the reliability of hydroelectric plants can be maintained by employing appropriate maintenance policies that reduce the likelihood of failure or even eliminate its root causes, preventing failure from occurring. This paper proposed an innovative and automated tool which contributes to ensuring the assertiveness in decision making to develop adequate preventive maintenance plans. This approach was applied to a maintenance case study of a 525Kv elevator transformer of a hydrogenerator unit type Francis to demonstrate its use and contribute to its understanding. As a main result, the smart maintenance system development using NLP algorithm integrated with FMECA database assists in a consistent maintenance plan development, which aims to anticipate failures and eliminate their causes. Thus, it is possible to determine and prioritize assertively the maintenance actions, ensuring availability and reliability operational to the energy generation process. In addition, it enables better maintenance planning decision-making, directing pieces, material, human and financial resources to execute the exact maintenance actions that mitigate the chronic failure modes. Consequently, it is expected that this study will contribute to researchers and professionals in the field of maintenance in improving decision making in industrial planning in electric energy generation systems.

39,Using Fuzzy Logic In Manual Test Script Authoring Effort  Estimation In Software Test Planning,"software testing effort estimation is a critical phase in software project management. software testing is an integral part of the software development lifecycle (sdlc). it ensures that requirement specifications are met before a product is deployed. accurate test estimation is crucial to the on-time delivery of a project and ensures that it meets resource constraints. in this study fuzzy logic is used to estimate the manual test script authoring effort in the test process. matlab software is used to design the fuzzy logic system that would calculate the duration of the scripting effort. the variables considered were test complexity, test script reusability, and number of test scenarios. the crisp output is the effort estimation in hours. the delphi method was used to collate the ratings of each expert for the parameters of each membership function in each variable. the linguistic rules were defined after. crisp inputs for each project were applied to the model and the output was compared with the actual effort duration of previous projects and expert- based estimation. the results showed that the mean absolutive relative error (mare) of the fuzzy logic model has performed better than the expert-based estimation technique. thus, the fuzzy logic framework may be used as a decision support tool in manual scripting effort estimation. this study is the first to explore the effort estimation in manual test script authoring. this model could serve as a baseline to test engineers, test leads, project managers, and business analysts.","software testing, effort estimation, manual testing",,"ralph andre c. roque, klint allen a. mariñas, michael n. young, and yogi tri prasetyo school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines racroque@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kaamarinas@mapua.edu.ph, mnyoung@mapua.edu.ph, ytprasetyo@mapua.edu.ph klint allen a. mariñas and yung-tsan jou department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university taoyuan city, taiwan klintallen2011@gmail.com, ytjou@cycu.edu.tw satria fadil persada entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university jakarta 11480, indonesia satria.fadil@binus.ac.id",
40,Assessment And Development Of Vendor Management  System (Vms) Of Company Opq: A Case Study,"vendor management (or supplier management) is a critical activity in which buyers, purchasing staff, or procurement officers are in-charge to execute. it is done to keep the suppliers engaged with the needs of the business and for the suppliers to be aligned with its goals. also, vendor management is purposed to maintain a good business relationship with the suppliers which is beneficial to both the business and suppliers. company opq is a chemical manufacturing company in the philippines that serves various market industries (food, biodiesel, homecare, personal care, crop science, building & construction, etc.) thus, given these large industries being supported and to continue supporting them, the company’s supply base must be taken care of. hence, vendor management system (vms) is one of the programs that administer the supply concerns of the company by managing the suppliers and all concerns associated with them. currently, the vms of company opq is comprised of 2 programs: supplier audit and supplier assessment. the study intends to assess these programs, identify areas of improvement, and create proposed revisions using a method inspired by the systematic literature review (slr). this is done by extracting data from the company’s vms records and procedures and interviews with the internal and external stakeholders who are directly involved in the vms programs. the proposed revisions for the vms programs are believed to fortify the audit coverage questions and more comprehensively assess the supplier’s performance. through this, the maximum potential of the supplier might be unlocked.","vms, supplier audit","Vendor Management System truly keeps the relationship between the organization and its suppliers.

41,Stochastic Dynamic Optimization For Dynamic Scheduling,"we study two classes of dynamic scheduling problems termed as ""allocation"" and ""advanced"" scheduling. in allocation scheduling, arriving jobs either wait in queue, are rejected, or served immediately, while in advanced scheduling, they are scheduled to time slots such as days in a booking horizon. we develop approximate dynamic programming (adp) based on direct search that approximately solves the underlying markov decision process models. we compare the performance of the proposed technique against the myopic policy under various scenarios. numerical results demonstrate that the direct-search based adp yields significant improvements over the myopic policy in all of the problem sets.",communication,"Dynamic stochastic scheduling (DSS) problems are commonly observed in diverse fields. Because of computational intractability, researchers resort to approximation techniques for solving large-sized DSS problems. In this research, we focused on two classes of DSS problems: allocation scheduling and advanced scheduling. We developed an ADP cenetered on direct-search for approximately solving the MDP models of these problems, and compared its performance against the myopic policy. Numerical experiments revealed that it is worth utilizing direct search for these kinds of problems since the resulting percentage improvement over the myopic policy is significantly high. It is worth stating that the performance of the direct search-centered ADP is contingent on the basis functions. Future research may address the performance of direct-search based ADPs using various basis functions.","yasin göçgün associate professor of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and natural sciences i̇stinye university i̇stanbul, turkey yasin.gocgun@istinye.edu.tr",
42,Modelling The Risk Susceptibility Of Agro-Industry Circular  Supply Chain During Major Disruptions: A Life Cycle,"the agro-industry is one of the main contributors to the food supply worldwide. thus, the importance of its supply chain activities (i.e., harvest to fork) is crucial and should not be affected by any delays. however, inevitable disruptions may have an adverse impact on the supply chain activities in the agro-industry, such as natural disasters, climate change impacts, health crises, and technological lags. these risks must be appropriately mitigated considering the fragility and sensitivity of agricultural products to various factors (e.g., temperature, time). however, an assessment for agro-industry risk susceptibility remains unexplored in the literature. thus, this study intends to assess the aversion of the agro-industry to such disruptions through conditional value-at-risk (cvar) based risk control. a life cycle perspective will also be utilized to obtain a systematic view of the circular supply chain. the methodology used will be in two folds: (1) calculate the cvar variable in the agro-industry supply chain and integrate it to the (2) life cycle assessment of agro-industry circular supply chain using the data collected from existing literature. the integrated methodology is utilized in the cassava starch production. the findings of the study show that the average loss at worst 10% volatile price is 15.22%, at worst 5% volatile price is 22.62%, and at worst 1% volatile price is 33.94%. furthermore, the environmental impact assessment conducted revealed that the acidification has the highest kg-equivalent in terms of the environmental impact of the cassava starch production. machineries and equipment utilized in the current production process of cassava starch has contributed immensely to the adverse impact on the environment, specifically in the acidification due to emissions.","agro-industry, risk, modelling","This work integrates the risk susceptibility of agro-industry supply chain in assessing the environmental impact of the said supply chain through a life cycle perspective.

53,Recommendation Of Seating Configuration At Pediatric  Clinic In Jakarta During Covid-19 Pandemic,"covid-19 pandemic has been affected globally as it forced us to change our behavior and daily activities. physical distancing and health protocols as recommended by the authority had become a new norm to prevent human-to human infection for over a year since the pandemic announced for the first time in early 2020. the protocols were applied in all public spaces, included health facilities such as hospital, clinic, and pharmacy. this research is discussing the possibility of seating configuration to help patients of pediatric clinic in jakarta avoiding physical interaction in the waiting area. visitor management in pediatric clinic become more crucial during the covid-19 pandemic as the clinics were attended by infants, kids and adults. proxemics in literature review and field observation were used as basic method to analyze the possibilities and determine the recommendation. the result is explaining how the seating configurations are able to interfering the way people interact each other.","proxemics, interior, furniture, pediatric","and Recommendation In order to fit the new normal living condition, we need to create a new order with various adjustments. With our analysis, we finally came to the conclusion that the most appropriate waiting chairs organization in the lobby of the pediatric clinic. First, considering the waiting chairs which in one set have a straight shape and is a three-seater chair or four-seater chair, should be placed back-to-back. One set of chairs is equipped with a divider that can be shifted according to the needs of people. Second, rather than using converging circular configuration, waiting chairs which in one set have a circular shape and consist of three to four chairs, the seats should be placed in a radiating circular configuration to avoid facing each other. The last and the most recommended set of chairs is the three- seater chair in order to avoid excess seats, because in one patient's family, it is limited to a maximum of three people. Moreover, this recommendation also becomes a new value in design science, especially furniture configuration design with the aim of responding to the new normal situation. This recommendation has several added values based on the idea that Covid-19 will be with us for a long time: 1. It is a solution if the clinic wants to keep using the old chair (existing furniture) without having to replace it with the new one, adjustment is the best recommendation. 2. 3. Responding to the number of patients' families who are children and are accompanied by at least one to two parents. Aims to prioritize comfort among patients, since there are barriers to avoid the direct contact with other visitors. 4. Optimizing the number of existing patients. 5. Produces an optimal circulation area. 6. Contribute recommendations for new seat arrangements, based on alternative forms and other modules. Figure 8.

This theory is a mechanism for managing the strategic sequence of 2-way interactions between customers and service providers (products or services). CEM itself is a holistic approach and involves many parties. Observing the current condition of the automotive industry that still uses traditional methods such as periodic service, checking manually and directly, delivering cars to a garage, etc., then the absence of realtime driving support, are the reasons that pose challenges for the automotive industry in industry 4.0. Until finally the focus of customer experience management for the automotive industry is on a technology called 451 Proceedings of the 3rd South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022","revolution 4.0 wahyu sardjono information systems management department, binus graduate program – master of information systems management, bina nusantara university indonesia 11480 wahyu.s@binus.ac.id haryoto kusnoputranto professor, department of environmental health, faculty of public health, university of indonesia, indonesia haryoto_k@yahoo.com johan school of information systems bina nusantara university indonesia 11480 johanj@binus.edu hargo utomo department of management, faculty of economics and business, universitas gadjah mada indonesia hargo_utomo@ugm.ac.id samudra sukardi post graduate program, study program of management science, faculty of economic and business, university of indonesia, indonesia samudra.sukardi01@ui.ac.id",

59,Application Of Machine Learning Algorithms For The  Prediction Of Payment By Agreement In A Debt Collection,"debt collection from a debt collection agency (dca) has become more difficult due to the pandemic. nevertheless, in the last year the population has incurred in more debts, while there has been a decrease in default loans. this has created an opportunity for dcas to stablish strategies to improve the debt collection process. in this work, the crisp-dm methodology is implemented in an ecuadorian dca to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts a debtor´s payment probability and stablish a debt collection strategy. an unbalanced dataset with 7,447,856 registers is gathered, cleaned, and preprocessed to train a random forrest classifier, gradient boosting machine, logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptron using a random under-sampling technique. the models’ performance is compared using the sensitivity, specificity, and auc evaluation metrics. the best performing algorithm is the gradient boosting machine with a sensitivity score of 0.97, specificity of 0.93, and auc of 0.98 on the validation set. this algorithm also allows to identify the most discriminative features for the prediction, these being the days past due, the day between the acquisition of the account and the default date, the name of the business category, the name of the prior account owner, and the number of direct contacts performed by a robot.",machine learning,"After the pandemic the amount of debt collection and the ratio of people that perform payments has increased. So, for a DCA the analysis of the debt management process is necessary. In this project a ML algorithm is developed for an Ecuadorian DCA to predict the payment probability of debtors using the CRISP-DM methodology comprised of 6 phases. The business understanding phase begun with an approach to the project supervisor in the company for an explanation of the collection strategies and the dataset provided for the analysis. Also, the business objectives for the project were proposed. For the data understanding phase, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed with the categorization of input variables into continuous and discrete, identification of the target variable, analysis of outliers, calculation of correlation coefficients, identification and management of missing values. For the data preparation, specific data manipulation was set in place depending on the models used. Due to the data imbalance on the training set, a random under sampling technique was applied. For Phase 4, the algorithms of RFC, GBM, LR, and MLP were selected for training. For each model a hyperparameter tunning was performed to improve the default performance of the model. Once this step is done, in the evaluation phase the GBM was selected as the best model because it had the highest performance metrics. This model showed the most important features for the classification of the algorithm. 483 Proceedings of the 3rd South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022","company with the crisp-dm methodology martín calero peréz, maría baldeon calisto universidad san francisco de quito, usfq, colegio de ciencias e ingeniería, departamento de ingeniería industrial and instituto de innovación en productividad y logística catena- usfq, diego de robles s/n y vía interoceánica, quito, ecuador 170901 mfcalero@estud.usfq.edu.ec, mbaldeonc@usfq.edu.ec sebastián bonilla universitat politecnica de catalunya- barcelona tech, facultad de matemáticas y estdística, carrer de jordi girona, 31, barcelona españa sebastian.bonilla@estudiantat.upc.edu daniel riofrío universidad san francisco de quito usfq, colegio de ciencias e ingenierías, carrera de ingeniería en ciencias de la computación and the applied signal processing and machine learning research group usfq, quito, ecuador 170157 driofrioa@usfq.edu.ec","References

62,Discrete Event Modeling For Operational Management Of  Restaurants,"models are a tool that allow us to simulate real life systems in a virtual environment to generate scenarios and observe how the system reacts. restaurant management systems incorporate the concepts of revpash and menu analysis to support difficult decisions in pricing, promotions and resource management. in this paper, using arena 14.0 software, a discrete event model was designed that incorporates the above concepts and simulates the operations of a restaurant. based on the proposed model, measures were proposed to improve the restaurant's profitability and scenarios were designed with the possible effects. the value of this proposal lies in the economic advantage that can be obtained with the application of models and menu analysis in restaurant management.","simulation, revpash","This research has documented the simulation of the operational management of a restaurant in Peru. The data used were collected through field observations and with the consent of the company. In that sense, a discrete event model was developed to represent the operations system, quantifying the main variables related to the service offered to customers and the capacity of the premises. The model was used to simulate alternative scenarios of demand variation in the face of the implementation of discounts on the restaurant's dishes during the hour with lowest demand. The results obtained show that, based on the premise that a discrete event simulation model allows improving the operational management of restaurants, this tool does contribute to decision making in the improvement of performance in this industry. As can be seen in the second and third scenarios, the correct use of discounts in the menu leads to an increase in weekly revenue, if the behavior of demand is favorable according to the simulated conditions. With respect to the indicators evaluated, it can be concluded that RevPash is a fundamental indicator in the operational analysis of this industry. Not only does it allow us to evaluate the current situation of a restaurant, but also its direct relationship with revenues and the efficient use of resource capacity allow us to consider it as a business driver. It is important to recognize the limitations of a simulation model and the challenge for future research will be to be able to predict more complex scenarios based on multiple situations. So that the model can contribute to the growth of the industry, especially in times when COVID-19 has stagnated its growth. The reports have been presented to the restaurant's management team with the objective of contributing to its operational management and fostering this growth. Likewise, it is also expected to contribute to the simulation community, especially to users of the Arena Simulation Software tool with modeling situations like those presented in this research.","marcelo caballero industrial engineering degree universidad de lima lima, perú marcelocaballeros99@gmail.com gabriel quesada industrial engineering degree universidad de lima lima, perú gquesada.lopez@gmail.com marcos fernando ruiz-ruiz associate professor universidad de lima lima, perú mruiz@ulima.edu.pe wilfredo yushimito associate professor universidad adolfo ibáñez viña del mar, chile wilfredo.yushimito@uai.cl",

77,Comparison Between Generation X And Generation Y On  The Preferred Retention Factors,"in a rapidly changing business environment, organizations are facing a talent crisis dealing with high employee turnover. changes in the composition of generations in the marketplace have led organizations to understand the majority generation who are already working, namely generation x and generation y. it is important for organizations to know the generation composition and professional characteristics of their employees. this study compares the generation x and generation y on the preferred retention factors including development opportunities, leadership, job autonomy, work environment, and compensation. data collection is conducted through a survey using questionnaire to 352 employees consisting of 116 employees of generation x and 236 employees of generation y. data analysis is performed using independent sample t-test. the study results show a significant difference between the mean score of generation x and y employees. the factors that have significant difference are development opportunities, job autonomy, work environment and compensation, while leadership does not have a significant difference between those generations. this means organization needs to focus on differentiating the employee retention strategies for generation x and y related to development opportunities, job autonomy, work environment and compensation.","generation x, generation y, employee retention, leadership","and Future Research • There is a significant difference between employee retention mean score between Generation X and Y employees. • Employee retention factors that have significant difference are development opportunities, job autonomy, work environment and compensation, while leadership does not have a significant difference between those generations. • The lowest mean score difference for employee retention factor is compensation for both Generation X and Y. This means the expectation of both generations has not been full filled by the organization. • Both Generation X and Y have intention to leave the job in the near future, but Generation Y tends to have less intention to stay in the organization. • Since leadership does not have a significant difference between Generation X and Y, therefore future research should attempt to analyze further about leadership effect as retention factor between those generations. 6. Recommendations • Organization needs to focus on differentiating the employee retention strategies for Generation X and Y related to development opportunities, job autonomy, work environment, and compensation. • The leadership approach in the organization will give the same impact between Generation X and Y. Thus, there is no need to have different strategy related to leadership. • Organization needs to address the fulfillment of compensation expectation for Generation X and Y. Thus, it needs to evaluate the compensation policy.

85,Cost Overrun Factors During The Lifecycle Phases Of  Buildings Construction Projects In The United Arab,"cost overruns are quite common in the construction industry. the phrase refers to extra project costs relative to what was initially estimated. examples of causal factors that can lead to cost overrun include mistakes in design, inaccurate estimations, engineering variations, and reworks. due to the unique nature of construction projects that is characterized by different time-phased stages and quality, cost overrun factors will have varied impacts during different phases of the project lifecycle. although significant research has been done on the topic of cost overruns, the presence of this issue requires more investigation into the root causes in order to develop workable tools and mitigation measures. it is argued here that cost overruns can be more noticeable in countries with rapid growth, such as the united arab emirates (uae). the main goal of this research is to identify the major factors causing cost overruns in uae construction sector projects with the focus on four project lifecycle phases, namely, the design, bidding, construction and defect liability period (dlp). the number of factors that could lead to cost overruns during different phases have been identified in the literature review. a survey was carried out on uae-based projects with consideration for numerous stakeholders, including clients, contractors, and consultants. the study identifies a number of significant factors shaping cost overruns based on a practical evaluation of projects. this research will support future steps towards developing extensive tools to monitor and mitigate cost overruns in construction projects during different phases.","cost overrun, estimation, stakeholders","The research objective was to look into the causes and determinants of construction project cost overruns in the UAE during the design, bidding, construction, and DLP phases of the construction project lifecycle. An extensive literature analysis was conducted to identify cost overrun factors whose impact needs to be accounted for. At the level of the phases discussed in this paper, many factors seem to have contributed to overrun costs in many of the UAE’s projects, and experts have suggested solutions on how to mitigate issues in every phase. Common cost overrun factors during the design phase include delays in modification of designs, lack of communication between involved parties, mistakes and errors in design. While the relative common cost overrun factors during bidding phase have included incomplete design at the time of tender, unclear scopes of work and selection of contractor were based on lowest bidding cost only. Likewise, the questionnaire results suggested that the most common cost overrun factors during the construction phase are changes in the scope (goals, deadlines, and project deliverables), delays in decision making by client, and inadequate consideration of risks. In addition, relevant cost overrun factors during the defect liability period include changes to project made by client after construction, not involving maintenance teams during earlier phases, and poor design leading to issues. Moreover, beyond the literature analysis, this research paper conducted a questionnaire survey distributed to a group of professionals representing construction project stakeholders in the UAE, including clients, consultants, and contractors. Sixty-seven probable reasons of cost overruns in construction projects have been identified and classified into two groups: lifecycle phases and project stakeholders. The relative importance index approach was used to analyse the relevance of these aspects, resulting in the identification of the most significant four factors at each phase of the project lifecycle as per different stakeholders. This research has highlighted the major cost overrun factors in UAE construction projects. The findings have significant implications for the construction industry in the UAE and abroad. In addition, different steps were taken to verify the research findings. Future action includes collecting more data and investigating possible mitigation measures to reduce the negative impact of cost overruns. In order to reduce the study's limitations, we may need to consider the sample size and methodology.","emirates omar afana phd candidate university of sharjah sharjah, uae u18105558@sharjah.ac.ae radhi alzubaidi professor of civil engineering university of sharjah sharjah, uae ralzubaidi@sharjah.ac.ae doraid dalalah associate professor department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, uae ddalalah@sharjah.ac.ae",

89,The Productivity Of Heavy Equipment In Embankment  Work Method On Toll Road Development Project,the purpose of this research is to evaluate the productivity and cost of heavy equipment on embankment work in 27 km toll road development project in dki jakarta–west java area and the cause of the different value of productivity from the planning. this research was conducted with quantitative method and analysed by comparing the calculation of productivity and costs based on survey result and theoretical data in an undisturbed and disturb conditions. this resulted that the productivity and cost of heavy equipment based on theoretical data in an undisturbed condition had better productivity and lower costs than productivity and costs based on survey in an undisturbed and disturb conditions. the different productivity value was caused by the dump truck that did not follow applicable regulations in compaction process and the after-rain condition that creates water puddles on site hence affected the heavy equipment’s productivity.,heavy equipment,"and Suggestion 4.1 Conclusion Conclusion Based on the results of productivity and costs of heavy equipment on 27 km Toll Road Construction project in the DKI Jakarta – West Java Region, the value of productivity in disturbed condition based on survey data has a lower value than the productivity of heavy equipment in an undisturbed condition based on survey data and theoretical data. The following is the conclusion of this research: 1. For the productivity of heavy equipment value, it can be concluded that: the calculation of productivity from observation survey in undisturbed condition is closer to the productivity based on theoretical value and known data values from the equipment’s specifications, but the productivity in disturbed condition is lower than the others. Meaning that more care and preparation is needed to for this, and the calculation on the planning stage need to be more pessimistic to counter the actual outcome of heavy equipment productivity. 2. The cost of productivity from each cycle can be concluded as: the cost in undisturbed condition is close to the calculated cost using theoretical value and known data values from the equipment’s specifications. But the value of those two is still higher than those planned by the project, meaning the planned calculation is most likely overly optimistic. Lastly the cost of productivity during the disturbed condition is higher than the rest, meaning it is very important to anticipate it, and not being overly optimistic on the planned calculation. 3. Another conclusion is that there are factors that cause the difference in productivity values between the planned data and survey data, such as there are several dump trucks that pass the compaction work while it is in progress, so the compactor must repeat the compaction work again. Then, the condition of the field after the rain causes puddles of water on the compaction surface. so you have to add the number of passes from the vibratory roller and sheep foot roller so that puddles are reduced or lost.","m f dewanto, a b putra*, and a.j. pierre civil engineering department, faculty of engineering, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 andi.putra004@binus.ac.id https://civil-eng.binus.ac.id/",

93,A Conceptual Model Of Web-Rooming Intention Of Gen Y  Consumers To Buy Branded Fashion Products,"in recent years, a tendency known as ""omnichannel buying behavior"" has emerged in the global selling of branded fashion products. according to several studies, consumers, particularly millennials, prefer to web-room or review things online before choosing which ones to purchase directly in physical stores. the emergence of online channels and continuous digitization are some of the factors of web-rooming behavior. branded fashion product retailers must widen their awareness of the drivers behind webrooming behavior to successfully implement the omnichannel shopping technique. this study attempts to identify the variables that may affect gen y consumers' intention to engage in webrooming and to create a conceptual framework based on the integrated technology acceptance model (tam) and theory of reasoned action (tra). researchers did a review of the literature from several sources that covered webrooming in the context of purchasing branded fashion products. additionally, this study's conceptual model can be applied to future research.","gen y consumers, conceptual model","In this thorough systematic literature, the contemporary literature on webrooming is discussed in a number of different contexts. In addition, we also specifically address Gen Y consumers as identified in our sample. Nine factors have been discovered by this study as having an impact on customers' intentions to engage in channel switching behavior, particularly when it comes to webrooming to buy branded fashion products. Following a thorough investigation, it was discovered that these frequently occurring factors include the perceived ease of searching for information online, the perceived value or benefit of searching for information online, the desire to touch the product in person before making an actual purchase, the need for direct assistance of sales staff, socialization, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived risk of searching and purchasing online, and level of consumer innovativeness. A thorough literature review of 30 publications from Google Scholar and ScienceDirect was successful in obtaining these factors. We established a conceptual model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which was integrated with the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), in addition to establishing what influences the intention of Gen Y customers to engage in webrooming. Although webroomers were found to be more likely to purchase more items than customers who purchased using a single channel, webrooming was also associated with free-riding behavior. Unfortunately, besides being profitable, this free-riding behavior can also bring losses. If a business doesn't retain consumers throughout channel switching, especially in the context of webrooming, it’s quite possible that lost sales will occur. Due to the fact that the final transaction is completed in a brick-and-mortar store, webrooming only benefits offline retailers. When it comes to offline retailers, a strategy is needed to actively deter webroomers from visiting competitors’ physical stores. There are a number of ways to deal with this behavior, one of which, according to the findings of a literature review, is to improve the shopping experience for customers by using interactive technologies like AR and VR to provide information about branded goods in retail settings. Retailers must convert from transactional stores to experience- based stores in order to appeal to branded fashion product consumers, who highly appreciate experiences. Retailers can also offer unique solutions to people who purchased branded fashion products because this group of customers tends to be technology literate, very intelligent, and short on time (Adams, 2013). Retailers of branded fashion products should make every effort to make it simple for consumers to not only get detailed information about products online but also deal with their inquiries promptly through a website equipped with a virtual assistant feature, etc. in order to ensure that customers are satisfied with the product and eager to visit the physical store to make the actual purchase. When trying to upsell customers, salespeople frequently fail, especially when dealing with millennials. Retailers must therefore empower their in-store sales staff with more flexible and customer-focused techniques.

102,Application Of Lean Six Sigma In Water Testing  Laboratory To Increase Efficiency And Enhance Customer,"laboratory testing is an important process which relies on scientific analysis to identify problems with services or a product. it provides analytical data on the quality of a product or service to support other process depending on the type of the industry. laboratory test results impact many areas of our daily lives since the results produced are often used as the quality control of the product or a service. this study examines root courses of why the laboratory under study was failing to meet customer’s service level agreement (sla), and how those bottlenecks can be resolved through the application of lean six sigma (lss). the study seeks to identify critical factors within the laboratory and customers’ perception about services they receive. the research design used in this study is based on qualitative research. brainstorming sessions and questionnaires were used to collect data about the causes leading to lack of fulfilling customer demands. lss tools were then applied to minimise or eliminate wastes in order for the laboratory to operates effectively. finally, personnel surveys were conducted to verify the effectiveness of lss implementation and customer surveys were conducted to assess the level of satisfaction after lss application. after application of lss, the results showed that the laboratory is now working in a lean environment, meeting customer demands while producing accurate and credible results timeously. it can, therefore, be concluded that bottlenecks were the cause on not meeting customer demand and they were eliminated through lss application. key words lean, six sigma, laboratory testing and water 1. introduction water testing laboratory (wtl) is one of the departments within the organisation under study, which focuses primarily on the provision of analytical services such as testing water and water quality compliance in support of internal customers (regions) within the organisation’s area of supply. these services are also extended to external customers (district and local municipalities) the results obtained from the laboratory assist in optimising water treatment plants, compliance in terms of final drinking water that is distributed to consumers as per water services act no. 108 1997 water national legislation and meeting sans 241:2015 drinking water standard requirements. this research is very significant as wtl plays a vital role in water sector, hence not producing valid, credible results timeously will affect end users at home who consume water since decisions cannot be made without the final test results from wtl. currently the wtl is struggling with high volume of customer complaints due to service level agreement (sla) not being met, recurring customer complaints/non-conformances, occurrence of variable lead times which proceedings of the 3rd south american international industrial engineering and operations management conference, asuncion, paraguay, july 19-21, 2022 © ieom society international 822",,"The root causes of not meeting customer SLAs as well as of not working effectively were identified through brainstorming teams and they were regarded as waste as per LSS concept. This exercise was a success since waste were addressed by means of LSS application. LSS was applied on each waste identified in order to improve the efficiency of the laboratory and its operations. This was a success as the method failure, number of non-conformances, credibility of results as well as meeting of SLA was improved. Customers SLA are now being met, which was the major problem within the laboratory with the customers having to optimise the Water Treatment Plant and comply with Water Services’ Act and SANAS 241 based on the results obtained from the WTL. Since the SLA’s are now being met, customers are now making sound decisions in terms of water quality and plant optimisation so that the community can consume clean and safe water without any outbreak. Based on the customer surveys conducted with both internal and external customers, the application of LSS has enhanced customer satisfaction. The number of non-conformances has decreased gradually which were derived from the customer complaints. The survey results from customers and WTL personnel, WTL has improved its processes through application of LSS and the laboratory is now working in a lean environment with improved processes. The entire laboratory is now working effectively and efficiently, and personnel seem to be pleased with the results obtained from LSS application is now performing well in terms of meeting customers SLA’s, delivering accurate and reliable test results, working in a lean environment effectively, however the current need to be sustained with measures put in place.",satisfaction nomalungelo magwaza department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg south africa malu.magwaza@gmail.com dr anup pradhan department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg south africa anupp@uj.ac.za,
103,The Influence Of Pro-Environmental Behaviour On The  Leadership For Sustainability Among Employees In Jakarta,"green business has been a detrimental topic to the current industry in almost every sector possible. cases of pollutions caused by business that accumulated over the years caused damages that might be irreversible if not changed. a transition into a more sustainable future is needed and as such need actions that help adapt and motivate people to work towards that transition. on its own, pro-environmental behaviour helped in implementing actions that adapts to this transition, however, there is a need to see the influence these behaviours have on leadership for sustainability. knowing the influence the variables have, helps us in knowing what actions we should take in order to make this transition going on more smoothly. with the help of knowing how much one variable influences the other, wae can make changes accordingly that helps adapting and motivating these kinds of behaviours easier. to accomplish the purpose of this study, the researcher carried out a survey towards employees in jakarta with the perspective that they are occupying most of the current consumer market as well as business owners. the methods that we use on analysing these data’s will be using rasch measurement model and linear regression analysis that will show the reliability and validity of the data gathered as well as to confirm the hypotheses test done. the research findings are first, mainly where it is proven that pro-environmental behaviour have a significant influence on leadership for sustainability. second, the respondents with high degree of leadership for sustainability are also accompanied with respondents with high degree of pro-environmental behaviour, and the other way around. lastly, most of the respondents have high leadership for sustainability and high pro-environmental behaviour. the practical implication of this study is people that have the vision of a better, more sustainable future, usually always shows to have behaviours that helps the environment. most of the people in the recent days have been showing that and working actively towards it. thus, this could serve as an opportunity from businesses to make products or services that helps in helping these people transition to a more sustainable future and at the same time helps decreasing the environmental impacts they have. in this study, the questionnaires were filled out by 221 respondents which later deducted to eliminate non-valid responses. a total of 191 respondents were the respondents with valid responses. study regarding green business practices is currently on the rise, thus there haven’t been much of these studies in the recent years and there haven’t been much of studies that compares the variables of green business like this.","green business, asuncion",,"maria grace herlina* senior lecturer, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 *corresponding author: herlina01@binus.edu rivaldo senior student, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 rivaldo001@binus.ac.id",
104,Corporate Social Responsibility And Eco-Efficiency:  Impact On Firm Value In The Indonesian Manufacturing,"climate change is one of the most widely debated issues in the world. this is mostly because of the rise in greenhouse gas emissions during the industrial revolution. the corporation publishes a social and environmental responsibility report as a form of corporate responsibility. the authors of this study want to explore how csr reporting, carbon emissions disclosure, and eco-efficiency applications affect corporate value. the objects under consideration are 55 manufacturing corporations listed on the indonesian stock exchange, with an emphasis on the industrial sector (idx). spss 26 multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the data. according to this study, csr has a considerable negative impact on corporate value. furthermore, disclosing carbon emissions has a substantial detrimental impact on the companies' values. the same applies for eco-efficiency, which reduces firm value. this finding demonstrates that csr, carbon emissions transparency, and eco-efficiency do not affect the enterprise value computed by pbv. the three independent factors investigated had little effect, especially on swings in the company's stock price.",eco-efficiency,"The purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between CSR, Carbon Emission Disclosure, Eco- Efficiency and enterprise value. The aim of this research is a manufacturing business specialising in the industrial sector that is listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. This study demonstrates that the first hypothesis on the company's disclosure of CSR has a negative and substantial influence on the company's worth. The second hypothesis demonstrates that disclosing carbon emissions has a negative and considerable impact on corporate value. Finally, the third hypothesis demonstrates that the company's eco-efficiency has a negative and considerable influence on its value. The three independent factors under consideration do not influence the company's worth, notably the rise and fall in the company's imminent share price. This suggests that implementing and disclosing CSR, disclosing carbon emissions, and promoting eco-efficiency in Indonesian enterprises with a focus on industry would not boost enterprise value, especially when deciding share prices. The results of company value studies continue to change depending on whatever proxies or indicators are utilised to quantify the variable. This study has a lower sample size since the researcher solely used manufacturing in the industrial sector in this investigation. It is envisaged that additional study would strive to widen the spectrum of business sectors, both to other company sectors listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange and to firms operating outside the Southeast Asia area. Furthermore, the criteria utilised by researchers while processing sample data might have an impact on the study outcomes. As a result, it is envisaged that future studies would widen the criterion.","sector anisa putri mutiara sicard, nadia talitha salsabila tanjung, holly deviarti, s.e., m.b.a accounting department, faculty of economics and communication bina nusantara univesity jakarta, indonesia, ina anisa.sicard@binus.ac.id, nadia.tanjung@binus.ac.id, bunda_mustafa@binus.ac.id",

Starting from the values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors possessed by each individual to the eight governments in a country. When viewed from the discussion above, the number of food losses has decreased due to changes in technology that are increasingly adequate and scientific. However, the issue of food waste has increased due to the behavior patterns of the community itself. The issue of food waste and loss has been regulated in the SDGSs in point 12.3 concerning the reduction of food waste and this is in accordance with the Rpjmn of the Government of Indonesia, where food waste can be reduced in 2025, in Indonesia it can be reduced by 30%-70%. With the existence of PP No.81 of 2012, it is hoped that the community can apply the 3R (Reuse, Reduce, and Recyle) program so that food waste can be reduced and decomposed correctly.","belief norm neisya aulia undergraduate student binus university, jakarta, indonesia neisya.aulia@binus.ac.id galuh dian prama dewi lecturer & researcher binus university, jakarta indonesia galuh.irbinus@gmail.com",

107,An Empirical Study Of Student Acceptance Toward Saas Based Academic Information System: An Extended Utaut,"software as a service (saas)-based academic information system has become a new trend in system procurement in universities, particularly in indonesia. with the various advantages of saas-based academic information systems, many universities have decided to switch to this service model. factors influencing college student acceptance toward saas-based academic information systems were examined using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (utaut) model that was modified by adding trust (tr) and quality of service (qs) variables. data were collected from 338 college students and analyzed with generalized structured component analysis (gsca). this study reveals that the significant predictors of saas-based academic information systems are performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating condition. further results and discussions are discussed.","cloud computing, extended utaut","This research examines the factors influencing college student acceptance toward SaaS-based academic information systems with an extended UTAUT model with Trust (TR) and Quality of Service (QS). The hypothesis testing results show that only four got strong support among the seven hypotheses proposed. This research has theoretical and practical contributions. Theoretically, this research is the first to combine Quality of Service and Trust as extended factors in UTAUT model to measure the adoption of a SaaS-based academic information system in higher education. Even this factor founded not significantly affect student acceptance. Further research needs to add other factors to further determine the factors that affect student acceptance of SaaS-based academic information systems. In practical contribution, this research finding can be one of the considerations for management and vendors in implementing the system in universities. Such as the facilitating condition factor, which was very influential in increasing the use of the system by students.

114,Private Company New Share Acquisition Analysis Using  Monte Carlo Simulation: A Case Study,"new share acquisition in the form of equity investment is a corporate action that enables a company to grow inorganically due to new capital used for expansion and the investor/acquirer market position & technology. besides, consolidating two entities generally will create more value from the investor perspective than two separate entities due to the synergy effect. this research will develop a hypothetical case study of a new share acquisition done by a telco company in indonesia. the model and concept can be applied in real acquisition situations. monte carlo simulation will be used to analyze the acquisition cash flow and determine the effect of synergies based on the revenue increase, market positioning, and cost-saving in the financial acquisition model. those synergies effect will treated as the variable of the monte carlo simulation. the study aims to minimize the risk of failed m&a by determining if the result of the consolidated acquisition model projection will achieve the pre-determined acquisition success factor metric such as investment internal rate of return (irr), and the acquirer’s potential market capitalization/net present value (npv) after acquisition. this simulation produces the probability of achieving those targets and helps the investor manage the risk of unsuccessful acquisitions.",,"The experiment shows that the acquisitions do not significantly impact the acquirer's potential intrinsic value based on the improvement in their cash flow. It is because the size of the acquisitions and the synergy value is insignificant compared to the entire market capitalization of the acquirers. However, the return on the invested capital itself is quite significant. Besides, this study offers a unique way to analyze a post- acquisitions financial performance effect. It shows that the risk/uncertainty of the pre-determined NPV/Market Capitalization success metrics is not being achieved so that the risk can be minimized. The reason of it because of the very small acquisitions size itself compared to the acquirer’s company valuation.","ryan alimhamzah department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui, depok 16424, indonesia ryan.alimhamzah@ui.ac.id arian dhini department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui, depok 16424, indonesia arian@ie.ui.ac.id",

Then, using Michlet software was determined the optimum distance between both hulls and calculated the hydrostatic parameters of the boat. The main part of the study consisted in the design of electric propulsion system composed of the photovoltaic and energy storage systems and the electric motors. As on average the solar array covers less than a half of the energy consumption of the boat traveling in a weekly cycle between two towns distant of almost 250 km on the Paraguay river, the remaining electricity has to be provided from the grid through charging stations located in the deserved ports. The economic assessment was made using the method of Present Value of Costs (PVC) of the propulsion system for the solar boat comparing it with the same boat design using 2 ICEs. Despite of an investment more than 10 times higher for the solar system, it came out that its PVC for 10 years´ period is 3 times lower.","paraguay river denis cuevas, renato orué and jean-claude pulfer laboratory of mechanics and energy, faculty of engineering national university of asuncion campus san lorenzo, paraguay renatorue10@gmail.com denis.cuevas@outlook.com jcpulfer@ing.una.py",

125,Maintenance Of Ecosystem Services Combined With Wind  Generation As An Alternative To The Decommissioning Of,"ecosystem services sustain life and biodiversity, in addition to making resources available to humans, and it is common for ecosystems to develop into structures created by man over time. this is the case of oil platforms, especially fixed ones, which according to brazilian legislation, must be decommissioned at the end of the viability of oil production, but which may not be thinking about the loss of biodiversity. this work proposes a solution that maintains ecosystem services and still has financial potential to generate clean and renewable energy from the winds. for this, a proposal is built based on climatological, geographic, and wind power generation market data that seeks to demonstrate the financial viability of the specific case of the robalo 1 platform, which is located about 50 kilometers from other platforms to be decommissioned, in the sergipe-alagoas basin, brazil. it was found that when minimally valuing ecosystem services such as artificial reefs and integrating wind generation for the non- decommissioning of the fixed platform substructure, from the point of view of net present value, the project proves to be viable.",,"The meteorological data used indicate that the offshore wind generation, 118 m from the surface, has adequate speed for the operation of wind turbines, so even for a c wind turbine, in terms of energy generation, the use of wind turbines as an alternative to decommissioning of platforms proves to be viable, as it allows reducing dependence on other energy sources, especially if we think of a distribution structure for the municipalities of Pacatuba and Pirambu, which are very close to the lease and could benefit directly from the public energy network. It should be remembered that the premises tested here assess the generation of a single isolated platform, and the financial additional for ecosystem services was restricted only to the artificial reef in the dimensions of the Platform, without considering the adjacent areas that integrate the coastal ecosystem services and that, if the extraction of the Platform occurs, its biological relationships may have a negative impact. Even so, without considering image gains, the permanence of the structure proved to be economically viable, since from an economic point of view, it is necessary to consider more than the positive NPV, but also the social and environmental impacts. As this work presents some restrictions, it is expected that in future works, the analysis of a wind farm will be developed that integrates the platforms that are close in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, that the technical, economic and environmental viability will be tested, that others will be evaluated. aspects of ecosystem services and that a more detailed cash flow is developed by proposing a minimum value for offshore wind auctions observing the model of other countries.","fixed platforms douglas vieira barboza petropolis school of engineering fluminense federal university petrópolis, rio de janeiro, brazil douglasbarboza@id.uff.br marcelo jasmim meiriño department of civil engineering fluminense federal university niterói, rio de janeiro, brazil marcelojm@id.uff.br sérgio ricardo da silveira barros department of geoenvironmental analysis fluminense federal university niterói, rio de janeiro, brazil sergiobarros@id.uff.br",
126,Artificial Intelligence As Support For Product Companies  Servitization,"servitization has been implemented in different sectors, highlighting the growing interest of manufacturing companies in this type of strategy, where they are challenged to rethink their offerings to develop and deliver product-service systems. in addition, the literature has devoted special attention to the process of digital transformation of industries and companies, especially in the context of the so-called industry 4.0, a process that has been supported by the implementation of basic technologies such as artificial intelligence (ai). however, although the potential for applying ai in services has been demonstrated, there are still no studies that guide product companies in the use of ai for servitization. thus, this study carries out a systematic literature review to identify and analyze the existing literature, thus obtaining a broader view of the topic. the results showed that ai has been applied in several back and front- office solutions, but predominantly in support activities. also, challenges were identified for the implementation of the technology, such as the need for base technologies and the understanding of the requirements for the new type of contact that ai provides. still, it was possible to identify that the literature approaches the solutions in a very generic way, not deepening the type of ai applied nor how the implementation is done, being very superficial from the point of view of the implementation of ai solutions in servitization.",servitization,,"jassen rodrigues da silva* jassen.rodrigues@ufrgs.br alejandro germán frank* ag.frank@ufrgs.br *organizational engineering group (núcleo de engenharia organizacional – neo), department of industrial engineering, universidade federal do rio grande do sul, brazil","References

128,Waste In The Transportation Process Dedicated To The  Offshore Chain In An Oil And Gas Company,"implementing lean system tools in the road transportation process is a way to make the process happen with less human effort, equipment, time, and space, allowing for planned transportation logistics. the limited use of lean thinking in the trucking industry and the paucity of practical studies suggest that there is no clear understanding of the benefits of how lean thinking can support improved operations in this industry. thus, this study aims to identify the waste in the transportation process dedicated to the offshore chain in a company in the oil and gas sector, through a real case study, adding guidance on the limited research conducted in this field. this is a complex process where possibilities for competitive improvement lie for the internal logistics area of the company under analysis. the offshore supply chain case study was composed of multiple theoretical and empirical data collection methods, such as scoping review, focus groups, and participant observation. the field analysis allowed us to clearly identify the waste existing in the process in the studied area. we conclude that this work explored the applicability of lean tools to reduce waste in road transport through a real case of intervention, resulting in the identification of waste present in the process and in a concrete action plan for the implementation of automation of activities and treatment of the points identified with a minimum estimate of reduction of downtime in monetary value of r$ 128,477.17 in two weeks of operation.","road transportation, logistic, lean transport, waste elimination","Was observed that the Lean philosophy already has its place in the management of companies and, when applied, arises with possibilities to motivate new academic studies, as well as to generate work environments with leaner processes. This paper explored the applicability of Lean through a real intervention case, resulting in important identifications for noticeable improvements in the dedicated transportation process. It can be said that Lean is not easy to implement. However, the field research allowed us to anticipate benefits, to visualize important barriers to dealing with problems that would occur in the long term, and to help the operation's professionals recognize the need for a lean service structure suitable to implement in their processes. Finally, the study, by operationalizing the conceptual framework, presented a useful practical approach to reduce resource waste and increase operational value. The treatment of the waste analyzed adds value by allowing contracted resources to be used in such a way that they can be dimensioned in critical and/or emergency demands and that they do not delay the delivery of essential materials for maritime activities, highlighting the company's end activities such as production and exploration of oil and gas, emphasizing that the non-delivery of transported materials can lead to extremely high economic losses for the company under study. It also improves the capacity gain and performance of the contractors involved in the process to perform the main activities with the desired quality and reduces contractual costs for the company. In addition to discussing the application of lean thinking in the trucking industry, the paper also contributes to the lean and logistics literature by using principles of lean application in this industry. The limited research conducted in this area, as has been highlighted through this article, will hopefully inspire scholars to further study lean thinking in transportation operations and explore its compatibility with other traditional methods such as mathematical modeling, operations research, simulation, and Industry 4.0. By doing so, a better understanding of this area will also be achieved, from which more effective strategies for improving transportation operations can be formulated. It is concluded that the process mapping technique was useful in identifying the waste and it is suggested that the process should continue to be monitored and that a lean ""future state"" resource matrix should be developed and implemented to improve the activities of the studied process and that in the authors' view the study performed highlights that this area is an important area for future research, and also suggests that a much more differentiated approach to understanding the role of digital technologies in operations and supply chain management is needed along with Lean philosophy.","joici mendonça muniz gomes master's student in logistics industrial engineering department, pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro (puc-rio), rio de janeiro, rj, brazil joicimmuniz@gmail.com rodrigo caiado industrial engineering department, pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro (puc-rio), rio de janeiro, rj, brazil; rodrigocaiado@puc-rio.br taciana mareth accounting sciences, university of vale do rio dos sinos (unisinos), porto alegre, rs, brazil tmareth@unisinos.br",

The results of this research can be summarized as follows: 1) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, the current ratio does not affect the company's value. 2) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, the capital structure has a positive and significant effect on company value. 3) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, return on equity has a positive and significant effect on company value. 4) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, the company's size has a positive and significant effect on company value. 5) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, the company's size can strengthen the effect of return on equity on company value. Based on the results of the research, there are several suggestions, as follows: 1) For investors, in conducting stock analysis using the price to book value approach, it is recommended to pay attention to financial ratios, especially the debt-to-equity ratio, return on equity, and company size. These three factors can be used as considerations for investors in investing. 2) For company management, to increase the price to book value, the company needs to pay attention to and increase the debt-to-equity ratio, return on equity, and company size because the three factors have a positive and significant influence on price to book value.

130,The Effect Of Corporate Ownership Structure And Board  Size On Earnings Management Of Non-Financial Companies,"this study examines the effect of corporate ownership structure and board size on earnings management for a sample of 30 non-financial firms registered on the indonesia stock exchange from 2013 to 2016. earnings management is measured by discretionary accruals using modified jones model. the corporate ownership structure is measured with managerial ownership and institutional ownership. this study also uses three control variables: return on assets, financial leverage, and firm size. using multiple regression analysis, the results show the relationship between board size and earnings management is negatively significant. however, managerial ownership and institutional ownership have no significant effect on earnings management. the findings also reveal that return on assets and firm size has a significant positive effect while financial leverage has a significant negative impact on earnings management.",board size,"is made by looking at the p-value of 0.0121, which is below the 5% significance level. The coefficient of the Board Size variable is -0.006382. Board size has a negative effect on earnings management because the increase in board size will increase supervisory measures. With the increase in supervision, the chance of earnings management practices decreases. On the contrary, the decrease in board size will lead to lesser supervision, therefore increasing the chance of earnings management practice. This result is consistent withAygun et al. (2014) and Xie et al. (2003) research. 4. Effect of Return on Assets on Earnings Management Based on the regression carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the return on assets of the non-financial companies that are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2013 to 2016 has a significant positive effect on earnings management. The conclusion is made by looking at the p-value of 0.0001, which is below the 5% significance level. The coefficient of the Return on Assets variable is 0.328694. Return on assets positively affects earnings management because managers want to make the company’s year on year more stable. If the increase in return on assets is high, a sharp fluctuation might show. A sharp fluctuation is not good for the company. Therefore, earnings management is implemented to make year on year look more stable in the eye of the public. This result is consistent withAygun et al. (2014) and Guna and Herawaty (2010). 5. Effect Financial Leverage on Earnings Management Based on the regression carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the financial leverage of the non-financial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2013 to 2016 has a significant negative influence on earnings management. The conclusion is made by looking at the p-value of 0.0083, which is below the 5% significance level. The coefficient of the Financial Leverage variable is -0.048447. Financial leverage has a negative effect on earnings management because if leverage is low, then interest expense will also be low. If interest expense is low, then net income will be high. If net income is high, the company will have to pay a larger amount of tax. Therefore, managers implement earnings management to avoid paying a larger amount of tax. Therefore, the implementation of earnings management is low because it is already tax saving. This study is consistent with Aygun et al. (2014) and Yuliana and Trisnawati (2015). 6. Effect of Firm Size on Earnings Management Based on the regression carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the firm size of the non-financial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2013 to 2016 has a significant positive influence on earnings management. The conclusion is made by looking at the p-value of 0.0672, which is below the 10% significance level. The coefficient of the Firm Size variable is 0.011180. Firm size positively affects earnings management because the larger the company, the higher the investor’s expectations of them. Not only that, but the management must also be able to maintain the company in certain positions. With these pressures, management will always implement earnings management to meet all of the company’s interests. This study is consistent withDaljono (2013). 5. Conclusion and Suggestion Based on the result of the hypothesis test, it can be concluded that: 1. Managerial ownership has no significant effect on earnings management. 2. Institutional ownership has no significant effect on earnings management. 3. Board size has a significant negative effect on earnings management. Based on the result of hypothesis test and research limitations, there are some recommendations: 1. For investors and creditors, not focus only on information regarding the earnings generated because there may be the accrual component that is arranged by the manager’s considerations for personal gain. Besides earnings, investors and creditors also need to pay attention to other non-financial information, one of which is the implementation of good corporate governance to make a decision. 2. For the company to be willing to evaluate the results of the company’s performance. A better implementation of good corporate governance is needed to reduce earnings management practices. 3. For future researchers, to use a longer study period to better illustrate the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable. Future research also recommends adding or using other independent variables to Proceedings of the 3rd South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022","listed on indonesia stock exchange in 2013-2016 gifta gelyana accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 yen sun accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 yensun@binus.ac.id","References

132,Factors That Influence Voluntary Switching Auditors In  Manufacturing Companies Listed In Indonesia Stock,"the purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of change of management, financial distress, public accounting firm size, percentage of roa change, client size, going concern audit opinion and audit tenure on voluntary auditor switching. this research uses the logistic regression method, which uses secondary data from manufacturing companies with observation years from 2012 to 2016. the result of the research indicates that client size and audit tenure influence voluntary auditor switching. while the change of management, financial distress, public accounting firm size, percentage of roa change, and going concern audit opinion do not affect voluntary auditor switching. (rtp).","auditor, financial distress, manufacture, switching","1. Management change does not affect voluntary auditor switching. These results are supported by Astrini & Muid (2013) and Kurniaty (2014), which state that management change does not have a significant effect on the replacement of PAF. So, it can be concluded that the presence or absence of management change does not affect the occurrence of voluntary auditor switching because, ultimately, the management and PAF can renegotiate. 2. Financial distress does not affect voluntary auditor switching. The results are supported by Aprillia (2013) and Salim & Rahayu (2014), which state that financial distress does not significantly affect auditor switching. So, it can be concluded that financial distress is not a factor that influences the occurrence of voluntary switching auditors because companies experiencing financial difficulties do not make changes to the accounting firm because it will require greater audit costs to understand the business model from the start. 3. PAF size does not affect voluntary auditor switching. This is supported by the research of Salim & Rahayu (2014) and Astrini & Muid (2013), which state that the size of PAF does not affect the change of PAF. Then it can be concluded the size of the PAF is not a factor that influences the occurrence of voluntary auditor switching because as long as the PAF provides good and reliable audit quality, the company tends to maintain the old PAF. 4. The percentage change in ROA does not affect voluntary auditor switching. This is supported by research conducted by Wea & Murdiwati (2015), and Yanti (2016) found evidence that the percentage change in ROA does not affect the auditor switching or the change of PAF. Then it can be concluded that the percentage change in ROA is not a factor that affects the occurrence of voluntary auditor switching because the company does not always switch to a new Public Accountant Firm in any condition. In addition, the long relationship between the company and the old client is another reason. 5. Client size influences voluntary auditor switching. This is in line with the research of Kurniaty (2014) and Wea & Murdiwati (2015) state that the company's size influences the change of PAF. Then it can be concluded that client size is one of the factors that influence the occurrence of voluntary auditor switching because companies tend to make changes to the new PAF to show the suitability between company size and PAF size. 6. Going concern audit opinion does not affect voluntary auditor switching. The research conducted by Arsih & Anisykurlliah (2015) states that going concern opinion does not influence the change of PAF. It can be concluded that the going concern audit opinion is not a factor that influences the occurrence of voluntary auditor switching because the company receives a going concern opinion is an opinion on the company whose business continuity is doubtful even though there is a management plan to resolve the problem in the company. With that opinion, the company will try to improve performance. 7. Audit tenure affects voluntary auditor switching. It can be concluded that audit tenure is one factor that influences the occurrence of voluntary switching auditors because the longer the audit engagement period, the greater the tendency of client companies to make changes to PAF. Because of the regulations that limit it. 8. Based on the results of simultaneous management change, financial distress, PAF size, the percentage change in ROA, client size, going concern audit opinion, and audit tenure have an effect on auditor switching. Simultaneous test results show the number 0.000> 0.05, meaning the overall variables in this study are jointly able to influence auditor switching voluntarily. With the limitations in this study, here are some suggestions for the development of further research and researchers: 1. For the next researcher, replace or not be limited to the often-used independent variables. 2. For further researchers, use the object of research that is more diverse and not limited to manufacturing companies. 3. Further research uses other measurements in the calculation of the variables used in this study. 4. Subsequent research uses a longer observation period to get better results.

133,"The Effect Of Term Debt Short, Investment In Fixed Assets,  Board Size, Networking Capital, Leverage, Firm Size And","this study aims to analyze the effect of short-term debt, investment in fixed assets, the board size, net working capital, leverage, firm size, and return on assets toward cash holding for consumer goods companies in indonesia. using the purposive sampling technique, only 27 of 45 consumer goods companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange were selected as samples. with the sample data usage period between 2013 and 2016, the total sample used is 108 firms. the data analysis method used is panel data regression with a fixed-effect model using eviews 9. the results of the hypothesis show that short term debt, investment in fixed assets, and return on assets have a significant impact on cash holding with a positive direction relationship. meanwhile, the other independent variables have an insignificant impact on cash holding.","board size, cash holding, firm size","From the analysis results, it can be concluded that short term debt, investment in fixed assets, and return on assets have a significantly positive effect on cash holding, whereas the board size, net working capital, leverage, and firm size do not significantly influence on cash holding. The advice that can be given is: 1. For companies From the results of this study, it is expected that companies can pay more attention to the level of liquidity by maintaining optimal cash holding levels. If the cash owned by the company is too large, it is recommended to invest a portion of the cash into securities and profitable projects. 2. For further researchers For researchers interested in researching the same topic, it is recommended to expand the research sample to other sectors both in Indonesia and outside Indonesia so that the results can better explain the factors that influence cash holding more broadly. Further research is also suggested to extend the research period so that the results can better reflect the company's condition in the long run and consider other factors that influence cash holding beyond the variables in this study.","return on assets on cash holding in goods consumer sector companies listed in indonesia stock exchange yunivur sutrin sudharyanto accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 yen sun accounting department, school of accounting, bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 yensun@binus.ac.id",
134,Analysis Of Factors That Influence Buying Interest In Halal  Innovative Products: Study Of Body Lotion Brand Product,"this study aims to determine the effect of spiritual intelligence, product attributes, product innovation, product attributes, and product innovation moderated by the company's reputation for buying interest in body lotion product hf. this study uses a quantitative method and uses a questionnaire as the data collection technique with 75 samples by using convenience sampling. data analysis is using pls-sem with smartpls 3 software. the results obtained from this research are product innovation significantly influences purchase intention. this result also indicates that to increase the customer's interest in buying the product, companies must pay attention to the aspects of product innovation.","company reputation, product attributes, product innovation, purchase intention","From the results of the analysis and testing that have been carried out, there are several conclusions as follows: 1. Spiritual intelligence, product attributes, product attributes, and product innovations moderated by the company's reputation do not significantly influence buying interest. That way, it means that there are still other factors beyond the variables examined in this study that affect buying interest. Based on the results of the path coefficient, sorted from the variables that have the strongest to the weakest influence on buying interest are spiritual intelligence variables, moderated product innovation, moderated product attributes, and the last is the product attribute variables. 2. Product innovation significantly influences buying interest and consists of several dimensions, namely relative excellence, compatibility, communicability, product benefits, innovation attributes, and behavioural change. The strongest dimension is the attribute of innovation, while the weakest is behaviour change Based on the results of this study, the owners and managers of consumer goods businesses must understand that product innovation plays an important role in influencing consumer buying interest. In accordance with the study results, it shows that the hypothesis stating that buying interest is influenced by the product innovation variable is accepted. Product innovation is an important thing that must be considered by the owners and business managers, where innovation can be a major weapon of the company to attract consumers to buy and improve company performance. The study's factors of spiritual intelligence, product attributes, and company reputation did not significantly influence consumer buying interest. However, this does not mean that businesses do not need to pay attention to these three factors. Even though the study results indicate that the three factors are rejected, this does not mean that these factors do not influence at all. Although, indeed, in the context of this study, these three factors lack a significant influence, these factors can support companies in increasing consumer buying interest. In addition, these three factors are also interrelated with product innovation to attract consumer buying interest. There are several suggestions for further research. Most of these suggestions are proposals and recommendations related to research limitations. The proposals include: The next researcher should conduct research in several other regions in Indonesia with a broader scope, especially in big cities, to better cover the entire Indonesian community. The next researcher should allocate more time to collect more data from digging deeper into understanding and getting a more diverse picture in terms of the characteristics of respondents. This research model can also be modified for further research purposes by adding other variables, such as promotion or consumer behaviour, or adding a hypothesis to test the effect of each independent factor on the dependent variable. The modification will give new results and add insight. The next researcher can conduct research with different research objects, such as body lotion with other brands besides HF or product categories other than body lotion, to produce a new finding that is different from the results of this study.","dea christy andreanie management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 elidjen management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 elidjen@binus.edu",

140,Eco-Behavior Methods In Interior Design For Rehabilitation  Center For Children’S Survivors Of Violence,"violence against children has become a problem that is still found in society. this condition may lead to fatalities in children. the indonesian government is expected to contribute, to reducing this problem significantly, not only to prevent it but also to provide appropriate facilities for child survivors of violence. child violence is any act committed against a child that caused the child to suffer either physically, psychologically, sexually, or neglected. the impacts of these kinds of violence will affect physical and psychological trauma in children. a rehabilitation center for child survivors of violence should provide facilities that involve program activities during the rehabilitation period. an eco- behavior method is a therapeutic process that presents a social environment to interact with children and their parents as survivors of violence. eco-behavior has specific activities to be considered in designing an interior of a rehabilitation center. it is an interesting study case in supporting a sustainable human environment. the research was conducted through the design process of planning the interior design of a rehabilitation center for child survivors of violence. data was collected from literature study, web observation, and interviews regarding the program activities that comprise the interior design process. the result of this research is an interior design presentation in three- dimensional perspective drawings that specifically provide facilities for children’s recovery process. it is expected the applicative the on of eco-behavior the method in rehabilitation center interior can facilitate the children to improve tr behavior as to support every process for trauma from both physically and psychologically.",eco-behavior,"The rehabilitation center for children’s survivors of violence provides psychological services, therapy to change negative thoughts into positive thoughts, as well as a means of playing and learning while undergoing psychological therapy. This facility is supposed to support the children to recover and overcome their trauma. The healing process is supported by facilities that involved circulation, ergonomic – anthropometric, and space requirements as aspects to consider in interior planning. A rehabilitation center is established by applying the concept of Healing with Earth. The eco-behavior concept is applied through the nature inspiration that is brought into the interior space to support the healing process. Natural colors are applied to walls, floors, and ceilings to create a spacious area. The ambiance of each facility is to support the user to feel at ease, relaxed, and calm during the rehabilitation program. Based on the concept the main facilities in the rehabilitation center for children’s survivors of violence are: (1). The playing area, (2). Planting Therapy room, (3). Art Therapy room, (4). Group Counseling room. Those activities are carried out together, aiming to restore children’s social skills. These rooms have an important role in the healing process during the rehabilitation program that presents a social environment.

141,Proposal For The Location Of Facilities With A Humanitarian  Approach,"the evaluation and measurement of the impact and efficiency of supply chains in the management of social problems have become one of the areas that currently demands immediate attention, and that includes the implementation of humanitarian logistics actions; all due to the role played by factors such as economic performance and social sustainability that allow work on the design of government strategies and policies to address the problems faced by those communities in vulnerable situations. in this article, through a case study, a proposal is presented based on the identification of the vulnerable population with high levels of marginalization, analyzing the routes and infrastructure available for distribution, and calculating the real distances of movement between locations, to finally describe some models for locating facilities based on qualitative techniques. the objective of this work was to make a proposal for the design of a facility location model considering qualitative and quantitative variables as a basis for applying a facility location model in humanitarian logistics. the results of this proposal allow the identification and select common characteristics in the target population to design the distribution network, allowing to determine those strategies that should be implemented in humanitarian logistics.",supply chain,"Considering that each time, the theme of distribution and supply becomes more and more remarkable in tasks designed to safeguard human life and the conservation of the environment; At the same time, attending to emergencies that derive from global problems such as poverty, hunger and the most recent, of course, the COVID-19 virus pandemic. Identifying common characteristics in the target population when designing the distribution network will allow determining those strategies that should be implemented in humanitarian logistics, given the broad field of opportunity that opens up before an in-depth study on the subject. For example, suppose a high degree of insecurity is detected in a community food. In that case, the strategy should include mitigating this social problem through different types of breakfasts with nutritional values necessary for this population. In future stages of this project, the integration of this proposal with a Vehicle Routing with Time Windows (VRPTW) model is sought, ensuring that deliveries are made promptly at the established times, which leads to an improvement in the level of service to the community. Jointly, humanitarian logistics has, for its sound, to provide the necessary means to act in any situation that represents a risk to life, health, or the environment, coordinating efforts and drawing up action plans that avoid an increase in human and material losses.

142,Effect Of Sample Rate On Frequency Values In Sinusoidal  Signals,"analog signals are generally expressed by sinusoidal waves, where sinusoidal waves are the basis for all forms of analog signals. the important parameters of the sinusoidal signal equation are frequency (fn) and sample rate (fs) which are formulated with the equation x(t) = sin 2πfnt. the time parameter in the t variable in the sinusoidal equation is the duration of data collection for the sinusoidal signal. frequency data in this study uses two models, namely the first model with a frequency value of f1 = 0.25hz, f2 = 1.5hz, f3 = 3hz and the second model with a frequency value of f1 = 0.25hz, f2 = 2hz, f3 = 4.25hz. the sample rate (fs) used for both models is 8 hz with a total time duration of 32 seconds. the method used in transforming the time domain of a sinusoidal signal into a frequency domain is using the discrete fourier transform. the results obtained for the first model, namely the reading of the frequency value of f1 = 0.25hz, f2 = 1.5hz, f3 = 3hz can still be read clearly. as for the second model, the frequency value of f1 = 0.25hz, f2 = 2hz, f3 = 4.25hz can still be read. however, a new frequency appears between the frequency readings of f2 = 2hz and f3 = 4.25 hz, with a frequency value of f = 3.75hz. this is because the use of the sample rate (fs = 8 hz) is smaller than 2 times the signal frequency (2 fn). therefore, the nyquist theory in the case study of the second model does not meet the equation fs > 2 fn.","frequency, sample rate, 2003, taylor","The conclusion of this study is shown as follows: • The use of sample rate (fs) is an influential factor in transforming data from discrete-time domain to frequency domain using Discrete Fourier Transform. • The sample rate (fs) used must be 2 times the value of the structure frequency, to get the real value of the structure frequency of the discrete-time signal. • The number of N data does not affect the frequency value. The smaller the number of N data used in data analysis, the amplitude value at the frequency points decreases.","irpan hidayat civil engineering department, faculty of engineering bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia irpan@binus.edu roesdiman soegiarso civil engineering department, faculty of engineering tarumanagara university jakarta, indonesia roesdimans@pps.untar.ac.id made suangga, riza suwondo civil engineering department, faculty of engineering bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia suangga@binus.edu; riza.suwondo@binus.ac.id",

The analysis of the theoretical principles provides a significant perspective towards a transformation in the process of management by competency that favors the improvement of environmental competencies in organizations for a socially responsible performance towards the environment. Inquiring into the definition of environmental competencies was the result of a theoretical reflection and the use and application of tools to build a new definition that will help organizations meet their objectives and goals and increase their competitiveness and business efficiency from an environmental perspective. This study still has some limitations. First, the scope of the research has a current tendency to correspond to certain databases, which were examined from previous studies; however, the addition of available literature in books and conferences may yield a diversified view on definitions. Second, the studies can be expanded by examining the new definition of environmental competencies from the perspective of organizational for the environment and environmental values, which would improve the conceptual elaboration. Third, in the selection of variables, there may be other factors that influence environmental competencies, and their consideration may not be exhaustive. For future work, the temporal scope of the study will be expanded, and more representative variables will be selected to refine the current study.","yiselis rodriguez vignon master's student industrial engineering department, pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro (puc-rio), rio de janeiro, rj, brazil yiselis.r@yahoo.com carlos alejandro díaz schery master's student industrial engineering department, pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro (puc-rio), rio de janeiro, rj, brazil calejandro.schery@gmail.com rodrigo goyannes gusmão caiado industrial engineering department, pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro (puc-rio), rio de janeiro, rj, brazil rodrigocaiado@puc-rio.br fernando luiz cyrino oliveira industrial engineering department, pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro (puc-rio), rio de janeiro, rj, brazil cyrino@puc-rio.br luis felipe scavarda industrial engineering department, pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro (puc-rio), rio de janeiro, rj, brazil lf.scavarda@puc-rio.br",

146,Bee Deli Box: A Better Solution For Food And Beverage  Delivery Box Based On Authorization,"the increasing number of covid-19 cases has proven to have a significant impact not only in health area but also on the global economy. tenants/restaurants are not allowed to accept dine-in customers if there are many confirmed cases of covid-19 in their area. delivery solutions can solve the dine-in problem, but customers face other problems that can occur when food/beverage is being delivered: the delivery person opens the package and eats it without the customer's acknowledge and some even spit on the food/beverage. these overwhelming incidents have an impact on lowering the level of customer trust to buy food/beverage from tenants/restaurants because covid-19 is an infectious disease that uses air as a medium that attacks the respiratory system and can also spread through droplets of saliva. we developed an innovative delivery box solution called beedelibox (better delivery box) which can keep food/beverage hygienic while been delivered to customers. internet of things (iot)-based delivery box is specially designed to be opened only when the customer gives the authorization to delivery person to open it. this novel solution can keep food/beverage hygienic when delivered to customers.","pervasive, internet of things, delivery box","and Recommendation Sealed package at least can reduce the possibility of food/beverages from being eaten/spitted by the delivery person and being contaminated during the delivery process. An innovative delivery box solution called Bee Deli box (Better Delivery BOX) which contains pervasive technology can solve these problems. This innovative solution can keep food/beverage hygienic when it delivered to customer, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The IoT-based delivery box is uniquely built to be opened only when the customer gives the authorization to delivery person. This solution prevents the package from being opened/consumed without customer’s permission/acknowledgement and stay hygienic during delivery. For future work, a password-based door lock using a keypad door lock can be added to Bee Deli box. After the delivery person arrives at the destination but there is no internet connection on Bee Delibox, he/she can ask the customer for a passcode to be entered into the keypad door lock.

148,Gender Dynamics In Environmental Literacy Of East Java  Millennials,"environmental literacy is one of the most effective ways to get a grasp of a society’s understanding of climate change and other related environmental issues. to understand the learning and behaviour changing process, this research looked at gender dynamics that differentiate men and women when perceiving environmental problems. the environmental literacy of east java millennials was grouped into nominal, functional, dan operational categories. the result showed that around half of the respondents (both genders) were in the intermediate level. the main difference was that more than a quarter of the women were in the highest literacy level, twice higher than the men’s percentage. it showed that in general women are more knowledgeable and willing to change their behaviour for saving the environment.","gender dynamics, millennials",", there were more women with higher environmental literacy compared to men. Although women tend to be more literate than men, it is still possible to increase men’s environmental literacy in various ways. Previous research found that East Java millennials from both genders agreed that the most effective environmental campaigns are from social media in the form of visual and audiovisual content [15]. With these two findings, the government, NGO, and other private sectors could create a better strategy in making environmental campaigns targeting the millennials. From the content perspective, we could specifically target the majority of millennials in the functional category. Instead of merely trying to increase their knowledge, the emphasis should be on behavioural change. 36% 51% 13% Men Environmental Literacy Nominal Functional Operational Proceedings of the 3rd South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022","lila nathania, siswantini, and aguira fortuna communication science department, faculty of digital communication and hotel & tourism bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia lila.nathania@binus.edu, siswantini@binus.ac.id, aguira.fortuna@binus.ac.id rosilawati sultan mohideen and ilya yasnoriza ilyas faculty of communication and media studies universiti teknologi mara cawangan melaka, malaysia rosilawati729@uitm.edu.my, ilyaisyraf@uitm.edu.my","References

149,Automatic Clothes Retriever (Acr),"as a tropical country, indonesia is located below the equator and has sunshine all year round, the sun's rays have been used to dry wet clothes after people wash their clothes. however, with climate change happening, the current weather is difficult to predict. there are many chances of clothes getting wet due to unexpected rain. especially now that people are busy at work and clothes are hung unattended. to solve this problem, many projects have been carried out, such as standalone clothes drying system, web-based drying clothes system, and the most advanced is clothes drying system that recycle ac heat waste as source of heat. in this paper, automatic clothes retriever (acr) equipped with mobile apps-based monitoring system was made. using the esp32 as the main controller, ldr, rain sensor, limit switch, motor, fan and heating lamp, the acr will automatically recognize the weather and retrieve-out or retrieve-in the hanger to protect clothes from unexpected rain. as a result, acr managed to respond to weather change, by retrieve- inning the clothes hanger in 14.82 seconds with 10 kg clothes on it. during the experiment, the maximum energy consumption of acr was measured, which is 0.289kwh in one hour with full load in the system.","clothes retriever, esp32, automatic","Based on the experiments and measurements in this project, ACR can retrieve-in or retrive-out the hanger automatically depends on the weather conditions. The LDR and the rain sensor need to be set correctly in order to response the weather changes. Based on the experiment, the LDR on the ACR needs to be set to a digital value below 1000 to indicate sunny conditions, and the rain sensor needs to be set to a digital value above 3000 to indicate whether it is a rainy day. While a digital value above 1000 on the LDR indicates dark conditions and a digital value below 3000 on the rain sensor indicates a rainy day. ACR consumes quite much energy in maximum load, it is 0.289KWh in one hour. Different load on the hanger affects the time for ACR to retrieve-in or retrieve-out the hanger completely. Heavier load will make ACR takes longer times to retrieve-in or retrieve-out hanger completely. ACR can withstand more than 5kg, based on the experiment it is recommended that user only put 10Kg load on hanger, so ACR can retrieve-in the hanger completely in 14.82 seconds if the rain occur. By using ACR, user can dry the clothes, control the hanger, monitor temperature, humidity and movement of the hanger from their smartphone.","rico wijaya, ivan alexander, adira dzaky, and muhammad faisal fadhil computer engineering department bina nusantara university jakarta barat, dki jakarta, indonesia rico.wijaya@binus.edu, ialexander@binus.edu, adira.dzaky@binus.ac.id, muhammad.fadhil002@binus.ac.id",

151,The Effect Of Thermal And Natural Lighting On The  Working Environment In Heritage Building,"the process of batik using canting is essential in producing handwritten batik and requires supportive space conditions because it requires skill and takes a long time to process. this study aims to see how the characteristics of space affect the process of batik with canting in a semi-open canting workstation in the traditional batik house of go tik swan, surakarta. observations of changes in behavior and space characteristics are carried out within a specific time using the time and motion study method. the characteristics of the space observed are lighting, thermal, and humidity. at 14.00 wib, the recorded natural lighting level was 562 lux, and the temperature was 35.3 0c, while the humidity factor was 55.7%. as a result, there was a shift of batik artisan from the front area to the back area of the workstation. changes in batik artisan behavior occur due to thermal discomfort, which causes batik artisan to move to a lower temperature area with lower lighting levels. therefore, it can be concluded that lighting and thermal factors directly affect the behavior of batik when doing their work.","canting, handwritten batik, heritage building, natural lighting","and Future Research Based on the analysis of spatial factors, space characteristics, and the solar movement, it can be concluded that there is a relationship between thermal and natural lighting on changes in the behavior of batik artists, as follows. • The division of zones and functions of space in the Go Tik Swan batik house is well structured, namely residential and retail, performance areas, and workshops and services. The well-planned concept is also reflected in the division of workshop space following the production flow. A building is a pavilion type (semi-open), making the wall opening optimal for natural lighting and air circulation. A free-standing wall in the workstation area is an anticipation of natural factors such as sunlight. Thus, it can be concluded that the Go Tik Swan batik house is well planned. • The batik artisan work and sit in a specific order with the stove at the center. Because they have the same type of work, sharing the hot wax on one stove is common. Sharing and collaborating in traditional batik work continues to be preserved, one of which is through the canting process. • Environmental factors influence batik artisan's behavior. For example, when the thermal comfort of the batik artisan is disturbed, she prefers to move her position and distance (displacement) to a work area that is more acceptable to her body, even though the work area has a lower level of lighting than the previous work area. As a result, batik artisan is better able to adapt visually well. However, this research is only a case study taken and observed in a specific time frame. Thus, more in-depth observations and analyses of other cases are still needed in Go Tik Swan batik house or other batik houses with the same type of typical buildings. Nevertheless, this research is the basis for further research that explores the problem of batik artisan posture and the minimum required area for batik artisans in a canting workstation. This study also states that the Go Tik Swan batik house is a cultural heritage building those functions as a traditional batik workshop, aims to preserve the architecture and the intangible cultural heritage, traditional batik tulis process, and Batik Indonesia motif.","case study: the batik artisans in the canting workstation of go tik swan rachmi kumala widyasari interior design study program, school of design bina nusantara university bandung, west java, indonesia rachmi.widyasari@binus.ac.id agus sachari and andar bagus sriwarno product design study program, faculty of art, and design bandung institute of technology bandung, west java, indonesia agus_sachari@fsrd.itb.ac.id, andarbugs@fsrd.itb.ac.id gregorius prasetyo adhitama interior design study program, faculty of art, and design bandung institute of technology bandung, west java, indonesia prasetyo@fsrd.itb.ac.id",

159,The Potential Of Rainwater Harvesting As An Optional Water  Supply Of Building Xyz,"harvesting rainwater to supply the water demands is a growing trend as a viable option to augment the water supply system in the philippines. increasing water demand has triggered an initiative to look for an alternative water supply providing sustainable water management. the paper aims to assess the rainwater harvesting potential and storage requirement for the operation of building xyz. rainwater harvesting potential for the building will be quantified using a 10-year worth of rainfall data from the philippine atmospheric, geophysical, and astronomical services administration (pagasa). the average annual rainfall in metro manila is 2785.6 mm. building xyz has a roof area of approximately 500 sqm. the researcher shall identify the rainwater harvesting potential of the residential building xyz located in metro manila philippines and conduct a water demand forecast using a naïve forecasting model. the water demand of building xyz was forecasted by utilizing a naïve forecasting method that resulted in an absolute percentage error of 16.23%. the rainwater harvest could provide 15 toilet flushes during the driest season and 320 toilet flushes during the rainy season in each unit of building xyz.",forecasting,"The rooftop rainwater harvesting in building XYZ show very good potential in relation to the average rate of precipitation in Metro Manila. Approximately 1405.31 cubic meters of water can be harvested in building XYZ with its 593.52 square meters of roof area. The month of February shows the lowest rainwater harvest as expected because of the summer season in the Philippines while the month of October has the highest rainwater harvest because it is in the middle of the rainy season. The rainwater harvest for building XYZ is considered to be a non-potable type of water that can be used for toilet flushing and landscape irrigation of building XYZ. The water demand of building XYZ was forecasted by utilizing a naïve forecasting method that resulted in an absolute percentage error of 16.23%. The forecasted water demand was compared to the average monthly rainwater harvested and evidently, it cannot wholly support the water demand of the building rather it could complement the needs that could involve non-potable water. The rainwater harvest could provide 15 toilet flushes during the driest season and 320 toilet flushes during the rainy season in each unit of building XYZ. Also, the harvest would be 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC Water Consumption Month Water Demand Forecast Water Demand Naïve Forecast Proceedings of the 3rd South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022","rombert brian b. malate, klint allen a. mariñas, michael n. young, and yogi tri prasetyo school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila 1002, philippines rbmalate@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, kaamarinas@mapua.edu.ph, mnyoung@mapua.edu.ph, ytprasetyo@mapua.edu.ph klint allen a. mariñas and yung-tsan jou department of industrial and systems engineering chung yuan christian university taoyuan city, taiwan klintallen2011@gmail.com, ytjou@cycu.edu.tw satria fadil persada entrepreneurship department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university jakarta 11480, indonesia satria.fadil@binus.ac.id","References

160,Feed Formulation Problem In Peruvian Aquaculture: A  Mathematical Programming Approach,"the aquaculture industry in peru, in recent years, has been growing by 14.4% between 1998 and 2018, and has become popular among small entrepreneurs due to the climate conditions and extensions of water offered by the peruvian territory. feeding represents between 40 and 60% of the total costs and this figure is increases by 80% in small-scale or family productions, therefore, there is a need to implement an adequate feeding program for aquaculture. the objective of this research is to develop a linear programming (lp) model that allows the optimization of the fish feed formulation by manufacturing a balanced meal using locally available inputs. authors like v.o. oladokun and a. jhonson (2012) have managed to make a similar model in the poultry sector, achieving a 9% reduction in feed costs. information was collected from scientific articles and journals on nutritional content, ingredients, and alternatives fish feed consumption; the cost of the ingredients has been obtained using current market information. the mathematical model contains 10 decision variables and 11 restrictions, which was conducted with solver on excel. the fish farm used in the case study allowed us to collect the necessary information for the resolution of the model and the analysis of the optimal results. the optimal solution of the pl model reveals a reduction in feed costs with the new formulation compared to the feed used by fish farmers. the analysis of the optimal results allowed us to see how the total feed costs could be affected by the implementation of the sensitivity analysis with the monte carlo simulation.","fish farms, feeding, formulation, costs, linear programming","Aquaculture is a growing industry in Peru that will be particularly important as a source of healthy food and to avoid the destruction of natural ecosystems. This study was able to improve the feed cost of tilapia fish farms with local inputs and the assistance of a liner modelling software. Tables show the nutritional values of all the inputs used and considered in the fish feed formulation; most of them are quickly found in Peruvian territory. It is showed that there is a considerable decrease in feed costs while using the feed formulation model and your own food than buying it from a seller or company.

This study was able to identify and show the differences in scientific research on the restaurant supply chain before and after the pandemic in internationally recognized databases. It showed that the number of publications has gone from less to more in relation to a global event with high impact in recent years. and is expected to continue to do so in the coming years: However, there is no evidence of a large number of publications in relation to the restaurant supply chain to Covid 19. It shows that research published in both periods shows different approaches in relation to current trends.","covid-19 pandemic in the period 2010-2022 francisco alejandro au chui facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, peru 20161801@aloe.ulima.edu.pe (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8222-0669) gonzalo alejandro paz loo facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, peru 20162372@aloe.ulima.edu.pe (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5071-6582) yvan jesus garcia lopez facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, peru ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9577-4188)",
163,Portfolio Management Of Social Projects: A Case Study In  Ifsp 2021,"since 2020 there has been a continuous study of portfolio management in the technical high school course of electronics in ifsp sorocaba in the course of integrated project. in 2021 the second stage was developed with the participation of non-governmental organizations (ngos), that often do not possess the knowledge, the manpower nor the techniques to bring to life their projects. this paper continues the research of 2020, with the lessons learned on that case study cycle presenting new ideas to overcome the difficulties and obstacles noticed by the project teams during that year and by the portfolio management team, with the purpose to increase the overall performance by meeting the ngos expectations and to achieve better results focusing on solving the 2 biggest issues of 2020 – communication and ngo selection. at the end of the year the objectives were achieved, however new issues arose during the 2021 cycle – both new problems and new variants of existing problems – that were not expected. as a conclusion the 2021 edition showed an increase in performance of the individual projects and the portfolio management.","project management, in the 1950´s","Regardless of the situation, change or preparation the management of Portfolio will always experience new and unexpected problems and issues as showed in section 5.1. The human factor cannot be isolated nor ignored from the decision-making process and the longer a Portfolio Manager has contact with the problems the more experienced and better planner he or she will become. This is an important lesson learned in the two years this project has been running so far and has helped the Portfolio Management team to develop. The lack of communication caused by a lack of leadership (in project 2) and the lack of the ability to get all students to embrace P5 were the major factors that contributed to the failed individual projects. The new research conducted in 2021 proved effective in solving the follow-up issue, with only 5,33% of activities facing delays. As for the selection criteria of the NGOs the scores were better considering the 2020 cycle, showing improvement, however it was possible to determine that even though it did improve in 2021 it is still one of the major obstacles in the 3-year project and thus this is the risk factor that will be removed from the 2022 cycle when the students and the Portfolio team will face a new challenge of Social Entrepreneurship as described in section 5.5. In the face of the adversities in 2021, the roll of the Portfolio Manager when considering projects with NGOs should be to plan focused not only on the theory of PMBoK (or other project management theory), but also in organizational structure and especially in the human factors and relationships between the members.","anne karolyne de almeida lima and vitor mendes caldana federal institute of sao paulo (ifsp) – sorocaba campus sorocaba, sao paulo, brazil anne.karolyne2003@hotmail.com ; vitor.caldana@ifsp.edu.br",

165,Iso 55001 In Brazil: Why Few Companies Are Practicing The  Standard?,"effective and efficient organizations use their asset management to resolve competing priorities and ensure that long- term benefits are not sacrificed for immediate needs. implementing iso 55001 allows organizations to lead their operations orderly, creating value and improving their results and income. in brazil, however, the standards are still little known and used by companies. on the iso website about organizations certified with the 55001, only eight brazilian companies appear on the list. regardless that linking asset management to corporate strategy is relatively new, brazilian companies have not been accumulating achievements with this standard. therefore, through a survey with experts and open interviews with consultants in the area, this study seeks to answer why asset management standards have little adherence in brazil. this research suggests that the main reason for the standards' non-accession is that the brazilian companies have a culture of immediacy. any process that will generate results in the medium and long term is not always a priority since the daily demands in the short time are very high, taking up all the employees' working time. so, the companies cannot deliver sustainable results.","iso 55001, asset management","This research was specially formulated for companies whose physical assets represent the revenue-generating infrastructure. They are the assets that support the organization and, therefore, are essential to the ability to remain competitive. However, the survey shows that many participating companies do not have a clear AM policy, do not have procedures that help AM, or know the standard that could help them start activities to manage their assets better. Many professionals in the area do not even know the standard.

The main reason for the standard's non-adoption and consent is that the Brazilian entrepreneurs have a culture of 
immediacy. Any process that will generate medium- and long-term results is not always a priority. Companies do not 
have solid and organized strategies to support AM since daily demands are very high and take up all the employees' 
time. Thus, people cannot organize themselves to deliver a sustainable result, the opposite expected by AM. Instead, 
effective and efficient organizations use their AM to resolve competing priorities and ensure that long-term benefits 
are not sacrificed for more immediate needs. In Brazil, ISO 55001 is far from the enthusiasm and success promoted 
by ISO 9001. 
 
As the survey was designed especially for manufacturing companies, many professionals did not want to answer it 
because they understood that their company did not align with the research. So then, there is a suggestion for a 
complete survey, a specific study for consultants, and another for ISO 55001 certified companies.

168,Impact Of The Preschool Program On The Socio-Connective  Variables Developed By The Beneficiary Children: The Case Of,"early childhood is a crucial phase in the construction of the individual. it is a period of rapid development that leads to the acquisition of a battery of skills on which future physical and psychological constructions will be based. investments in early childhood are effective when they begin as early as possible. this means starting with the children at an early age to ensure that they benefit fully from educational opportunities and are well prepared for parenthood later in life. the purpose of this study is to assess the impact of early childhood education programs. the context chosen is public preschools, located in rural areas of morocco. this work proposes a sequential methodology based on a conceptual analysis based on the sor paradigm ""stimulus-organism-response"", and an empirical methodology based on estimation by structural equations. thus, the results of this work confirm the existence of a positive and significant relationship between the components environment of the preschool program and the skills acquired by the beneficiaries of its programs. therefore, the results argue for the generalization of preschool education in rural areas with the support of public provision. providing preschool education to those currently excluded is considered an efficient and equitable investment.",preschoolers,"As a conclusion, and through the research within the SOR paradigm, we have accepted that there is a positive and significant relationship between the internal and external environment of the programme and the skills acquired by the preschool children. This relationship is significant for each individual construct. That is, the variables measuring the internal and external environment are significant. The results argue for the widespread provision of preschool education, particularly in rural areas, with support for public or community provision. Offering preschool education to those currently excluded is considered an efficient and equitable investment. In this regard, it should be noted that policies to improve equitable access to quality preschool education in rural areas, particularly for girls aged 4-6 years, are very limited and, if they exist, are most often offered in traditional structures. To remedy these shortcomings, government policies must expand the provision of quality preschool education services that promote safety, inclusion and sustainable outcomes, either through the creation and/or equipping of preschool facilities in areas of need, and according to standards that guarantee the quality, accessibility and sustainability of its infrastructure and teaching materials, and also through actions to strengthen teachers qualifications and working conditions, or awareness raising and information sessions that promote playful learning for young children at home, which supports the stimulation of learning in the family environment and which, in the event of local school closures (such as in the case of natural disasters or pandemics), offers a means of mitigating learning losses. Care should also be taken that tools are in placeto allows to maximise the impact of preschool reform on access to better quality education for all children, notably by (i) continuing the expansion of a network of high-quality pre- schools, (ii) improving the quality of educational processes and focusing on pedagogical practices in the classroom, and (iii) improving the measurement of children's cognitive and non-cognitive development. The present status of preschool educators must be reviewed in order to enhance and perpetuate the profession of educator, especially in rural areas, by providing bonuses to staff working in these precarious environments.","rural morocco soumia ettahri phd student faculty of law, economics and social sciences ibn toufail university kénitra, morocco laboratory of economics and management of organizations soualae@gmail.com rachid hasnaoui professor faculty of law, economics and social sciences ibn toufail university, kénitra laboratory of economics and management of organizations rachid3c@gmail.com",

171,Industry 4.0 Solutions Network For Wire Harness Test  Equipment Industry,"in recent years there has been an increasing competitiveness in the automotive sector with companies having to respond to an increasingly diverse choice of customers. additionally, the incorporation of several technological features in cars and the consequent dependence on several electrical systems has increased the complexity and demands of the wire harness manufacturing and testing process. the high variability that these products present has required the production of test equipment highly diverse and, therefore, with a high customisation factor. the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies has proven to confer flexibility to production processes, increasing their efficiency, without compromising quality, production costs and product manufacturing cycle times. thus, the application of this type of technologies in the industrial context of the production of harness test equipment could prove beneficial. this paper aims to propose a solution network composed by industry 4.0 technologies and based on the internet of things concept, which, in the context of manufacturing methodologies, could make the productive system more efficient and less prone to failures. as a case study, a wire harness test equipment company was analysed.","mass customization, industry 4.0","The need to satisfy increasingly diversified customer requests without compromising the efficiency of the production process and without increasing costs has become a huge challenge for organisations, namely the automotive industry. Mass customisation strategies, combined with the technologies of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, have been widely adopted for this purpose. The main objective of this paper was to propose a network of Industry 4.0 solutions, based on the concept of Internet of Things where all the machinery is connected to each other, and to the company's database, through the network, storing in real time the data generated in the factory. Technologies such as QR code, RFID and Computer Vision System were incorporated into the network of solutions, in order to streamline the activities of the machining process, making it more efficient and less prone to failures. Furthermore, through this network and the data generated by the multiple equipment it is possible, through statistical and artificial intelligence software, to carry out trend studies aimed at improving the company's performance in the market. Although it has some limitations, this network can be adapted to similar processes comprising a range of industries, especially in the context of highly customised production. 1455","angela neves department of mechanical engineering polytechnic institute of viseu 3504-510 viseu, portugal aneves@estgv.ipv.pt radu godina unidemi, faculty of science and technology (fct) universidade nova de lisboa 2829-516 caparica, portugal r.godina@fct.unl.pt elisa s. rosa artsoft business software it services and it consulting, telheiras, lisboa, portugal eso.rosa@campus.fct.unl.pt eduardo m.g. rodrigues inesc-id & instituto superior técnico, sustainable power systems group av. rovisco pais 1, 1049-001 lisboa, portugal eduardo.g.rodrigues@tecnico.ulisboa.pt joão c.o. matias govcopp, unidade de investigação em governança, competitividade e políticas públicas universidade de aveiro campus universitário de santiago, 3810-193 aveiro, portugal jmatias@ua.pt","References

173,Regenerating Innovative Behavior   In Non-Profit Organization,"the government's civil service officers are linked to efforts that benefit the broader public sector services, assisting in the successful delivery of government services through innovative behavior and service excellence. the primary objective of this study is to ascertain how to regenerate innovative behavior from a knowledge-based public service perspective by examining the mediating roles of service behavior and two independent variables; service orientation and social capital. this study focuses on officials from the ministry of internal affairs. a systematic questionnaire was used to collect primary data based on the literature review. using smartpls (partial least square) 3.28 software to test the model's hypothesis. the pls-sem analysis is a two-step procedure that evaluates the measurements and ends with evaluating the structural model. the research findings indicate that service behavior can mediate between service orientation and social capital, promoting innovative behavior. furthermore, these findings imply that the emotional support provided by social capital can contribute to the capacity of public sector officers to innovate sustainably.","innovative behavior, social capital, service behavior","Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, has had tremendous economic development since emerging from the late 1990s Asian financial crisis. The research findings aim to bolster Indonesia's economy even more by increasing the country's human capital competitiveness on a global scale. Based on the results of the SmartPLS analysis, the empirical evidence shows that service behavior is a mediating variable between service orientation and social capital on innovative behavior. Additionally, the research findings indicate that service behavior can mediate between service orientation and social capital, thereby promoting innovative behavior. Furthermore, these findings imply that the emotional support provided by social capital can contribute to the capacity of public sector officers to innovate sustainably. The study's limitations include the public sector's small sample size. Furthermore, the research findings are based on responses to a questionnaire survey provided by organizations' representatives. To increase the significance of the research, a more in-depth examination of the organizational issue should be conducted. In addition, it is critical to situate the investigation within another public sector context so that generalizable findings can be drawn from those samples. Finally, another study is required to ascertain how training efficacy is incorporated into the public sector's strategic plans. The training is specifically in excellent service-oriented development and employee career plans.","maria grace herlina* hardijanto saroso dicky hida syahchari senior lecturer, management department binus business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 *corresponding author: herlina01@binus.edu hardijanto.saroso@binus.edu dicky.syahchari@binus.edu",

192,A Literature Review On Digital Transformation In The  Construction Industry,"purpose: the goal of this study is to systematically examine research reference trends related to digital transformation in the construction industry from 2016 to 2022. this research will focus on the development trend of digital transformation research in the construction industry on google data-based scholar. design/methodology/approach: a mixed method approach was used in this study, combining bibliometric methods and a literature review. from 2016 to 2022, 43 international publications with the keyword digital transformation in the construction industry were sourced from the google scholar database via web scraping. findings: according to the findings of this study, studies on digital transformation in the construction industry are dominated by several fields of study such as architecture, construction, management, engineering, digital technology, hotel industry, industry policy, financial, business, and economy. according to the findings of this study, there are at least four major perspectives that are commonly used when discussing digital transformation in the construction industry. however, this does not imply that no other perspectives are used in addition to these findings. research limitations/implications: the research's limitation is the scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the google scholar database. the recommendations in this study can be used as hypotheses in the future, in addition to research with broader literature sources, and comprehensive and in-depth follow-up research can be conducted. the study's findings are expected to be useful to academics researching digital transformation in the construction industry.",systematic review,"Based on the findings and discussion of this study, it is concluded that the highest growth development in the topic field of digital transformation in the construction industry occurred in 2021, reaching 21 articles or an increase of up to 150 percent between 2016 and 2022. Furthermore, the review reveals that the majority of the journals that discuss the issue of digital transformation in the construction industry are science and engineering journals. This research also demonstrates that there is no dominant journal or publisher addressing the issue of digital transformation in the construction industry. This means that research in this area is still dispersed across different journals or publishers. Furthermore, development maps are classified into 24 clusters based on co- occurrence and keywords. This review, on the other hand, summarizes the research trend of digital transformation in the construction industry into four major issues. First, based on the research location, it's worth noting that the majority of the countries or cities that have served as research locations in the last six years have been Sweden, Nigeria, China, Malaysia, London, the Netherlands, and Russia. Meanwhile, based on the research approach used, the results of data analysis show that the majority of the research employs an empirical study approach and a case study. The selected locations are generally objects that implement digital transformation in the construction industry or locations that have been assessed or analysed as having the potential to implement digital transformation in the context of the construction sector. Comparative analysis and causal relationships are two examples of research methods used. In other words, some studies compare the loci under study to objects that have successfully implemented digital transformation. Furthermore, several studies have been conducted to examine the impact of implementing digital models on a variety of factors, including efficiency and productivity. In this field, descriptive qualitative methods are still the most commonly used approach. Although quantitative methods are still used, particularly in case studies to assess the success of digital transformation. Third, in terms of context or research scope, studies related to include architecture, construction, management, engineering, digital technology, hotel industry, industry policy, financial, business, and economy. Finally, this study discovers that at least four main perspectives are dominantly used when discussing digital transformation in the construction industry. However, this does not imply that no other perspectives are used in addition to these findings. Of course, many unexplored perspectives remain unexplored because they are not dominant perspectives. This is especially true when one considers how some researchers tend to use multiple approaches. As a result of this analysis, the contexts that are frequently discussed are also interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary issues. The scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the Google Scholar database, is the research's limitation. In the future, it is strongly advised to conduct research using a broader literature source. Furthermore, the findings of this study can be used as hypotheses, and comprehensive and systematic follow-up research is being conducted. The findings of this study are expected to serve as a resource for academics researching digital transformation in the construction industry.","johan arifin student of doctor research in management, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 johan.arifin@binus.ac.id mohammad hamsal binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 mhamsal@binus.edu asnan furinto binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 afurinto@binus.edu rano kartono binus business school doctor of research in management, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia, 11530 rano.rahim@binus.edu",

198,Computerized Relative Allocation Of Facilities Techniques  (Craft) Algorithm Method For Redesign Production,"pcl company is a small - medium enterprises industry engaged in the printing sector in indonesia. the pcl company's production floor's layout problem is crossing production lines. it can hinder workers from doing production, and the long-distance between machines creates an alternating current which causes time and energy to be wasted in moving materials. workers are hampered and make long distances. this research aims to redesign the production layout to improve the production flow and minimize material handling distances in the production process in printing. data processing is carried out using (craft). the craft method is done by swapping areas in the initial layout to find a better solution based on the activity relationship chart (arc). the area exchange on the arc will lead to a layout close to the minimum material handling distance. the result of the calculation of material handling for the prefix layout is 20,432 meters. alternative layout 1 has a material transfer distance of 5,849 meters, while alternative 2 has a material transfer distance of 7,095 meters. alternative layout one was chosen as the best proposal because it has the smallest total material transfer distance. after that, the selected alternative proposed layout is used for the initial layout in the craft method processing. after processing the data using the craft method, the optimal proposed layout is obtained.","alternative layout, layout design","After processing, then an effective and efficient proposed layout is obtained. Layout redesign is essential to increase productivity and reduce material handling distances. The material handling distance in the initial layout is 20,432 m. In the alternative, one layout is 5.8 m and 7.09 m in alternative 2. Then alternative one is used as the initial layout in the Winqsb application.

200,An Economic Analysis Of The Roles Of Metal Industries In The  National Economy: The Case Of Japan,"this study aims to analyze the roles of metal industries in the japanese national economy. this study applies input- output (io) analysis as an analysis instrument. more specifically, this study employs the parts of io analysis, namely simple output multiplier, simple household income multiplier, index of the power of dispersion, and index of the sensitivity of dispersion as analysis devices. the analysis period of this study is from 1985 through 2005. in this study, the analyzed industries are non-ferrous metals, non-ferrous metal products, metal products for construction and architecture, and other metal products. the results display that, by using both multipliers, the analyzed metal industries did not include in the top five japanese industries from 1985 through 2005. by using both indices, one can argue that the quadrant change on the analysis period was experienced by non-ferrous metals and other metal products industries. interestingly, both industries experienced the change in 2000. on the other hand, the remaining industries did not experience the quadrant movement from 1985 through 2005. in other words, the industries showed consistency in terms of the quadrant position on the analysis period.","metal industries, national economy, io analysis",,"ubaidillah zuhdi faculty of business economics and digital technology universitas nahdlatul ulama surabaya surabaya, east java, indonesia ubaidillah.zuhdi@unusa.ac.id yohan kurniawan faculty of language studies and human development universiti malaysia kelantan bachok, kelantan, malaysia yohan@umk.edu.my rizqi putri nourma budiarti, riyan sisawan putra, hidayatul khusnah, mohamad rijal iskandar zhulqurnain, and agung firmansyah faculty of business economics and digital technology universitas nahdlatul ulama surabaya surabaya, east java, indonesia rizqi.putri.nb@unusa.ac.id, riyan_sisiawan@unusa.ac.id, hidayatul.khusnah@unusa.ac.id, rijal.iskandar@unusa.ac.id, agungfirmansyah009.mj20@student.unusa.ac.id","References

202,Increasing The Level Of Service Through The Implementation Of  5S And Mrp Tools In Smes Marketing Pharmaceutical,"nowadays, peruvian smes, with an initial business model, seek and achieve good acceptance in the market, which is obliged to acquire the necessary knowledge and tools to be able to continue and manage a great change in the growth of the company. in this context, the research aims to implement the tools of industrial engineering to achieve the improvement in the level of service in a pharmaceutical sme. it was decided to perform an external analysis of the company to know how it is compared to others in the same sector and internal analysis to determine its strengths and weaknesses. to identify the problem, a deeper analysis of the process will be carried out using the root-cause tree methodology, in which it is concluded that, due to poor management in the warehouse, there are delays in the attention of orders. for the implementation of the improvement, constructivism has been chosen as the theoretical framework; this choice is made to know in depth the different theories that allow corroborating the benefits that the implementation of the different tools to be investigated have brought to the companies. in this case, the normative networks are studied in two ways, 5s and mrp tools. the methodology used for this purpose is based on a quantitative-descriptive analysis, which frames the registration, analysis, and interpretation of an audit and checklist, as well as the times or processes of the phenomena within the company. finally, after implementing the 5s and mrp tools, the technical validations are carried out through audits and the arena simulation software, respectively.","service level, lean manufacturing, 5s, mrp","It is concluded that the service level increases due to the proportional increase of perfect orders, through the implementation of the 5S and MRP tools. These tools allow for reducing time in the processes, improving order picking, and better inventory control, which had been previously detected as the root causes of the problem tree when the company's initial situation was analyzed. In addition, it is concluded that for the improvement to be successful there must be a commitment of all the people involved in the activity, as well as the feedback is fundamental, since it allows to achieve the efficiency and effectiveness of the tool, achieving a sustainable and not temporary continuous improvement. By having a customer satisfied with the quality of service provided by the company, complaints are reduced and savings for the company, both in the reduction of discounts for orders delivered out of time or incomplete. All the above is related to customer satisfaction being positively impacted. This research will contribute to the 5s and MRP implementation in Peruvian SME’s and show the importance, financial feasibility, and the results of applying the tools to the process and to the warehouse. However, it also shows limitations and risks, such as, the organizational culture and time management problems.

204,The Influence Of Internship And Self-Efficacy On Work  Readiness Among Higher Education Students In Jakarta,"work readiness is an important factor in preparing students to enter the real workplace. the lack of work readiness will make it difficult for students to survive in the contemporary workplace and lead to unemployment. internship and self-efficacy are the keys that will lead the student to succeed in the workplace. this research aims to examine the influence of internship and self-efficacy towards student work readiness. the data were collected from 200 higher education students in jakarta using a questionnaire. only a few studies have been done on this subject, with multiple regression analysis to explain the research phenomenon and to validate the research hypothesis. rasch model was used to clean biased data, converting ordinal data from likert scale questionnaires to interval data, examine the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. the findings show that the internship and self-efficacy directly impact work readiness simultaneously. thus, in addition to academic achievement, the students should have internship experience and high self-efficacy to prepare them to enter the workplace after graduation.","work readiness, internship","Work readiness is an important factor in preparing students to enter the real workplace. The lack of work readiness will make it difficult for students to survive in the contemporary workplace and lead to unemployment. This study aims to examine the influence of internship and self-efficacy towards higher education student work readiness. A previous study has been on this issue used Multiple Regression Analysis to describe the study phenomena and test the validity of research ideas. The Multiple Regression results indicate that the internship and self-efficacy have a statistically significant direct effect on work readiness simultaneously. According to this study's findings, many students agree that their internship experience and self-efficacy can better prepare them for work. In addition, to support student work readiness, companies should open many internship programs to provide broad opportunities for students to gain work experience and foster self-efficacy. Also, universities must provide other activities to improve student work-readiness and self-efficacy, such as workshops, career seminars, and industrial visits. There are still certain limits to the research. First, there is still a lack of respondents who fill out this research questionnaire. So, if the number of respondents obtained can be more, this research will be more widespread. Second, researchers can add some other supporting variables and change population, such vocational high school students to gain more varied study.

205,Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem With Heterogeneous  Fleet For Distribution Of Fuel Products In The Eastern,"equitable use of fuel products must be carried out by the indonesian government, especially for the eastern region of indonesia where most of the natural conditions are in the form of the sea. since consumer requests on the islands come in at different times, fuel product deliveries are made in response to local demand, and occasionally the cargo hauled is not entirely full. another challenge in shipping by ship is crew costs and the increase of fuel prices, thus making the company try different operational strategies. in addition, the open water conditions around september to early march are in choppy conditions, making the company spend more fuel costs, and of course it will require more costs as well. the company that distributes fuel products to consumers has three depots, twenty consumers, and twenty vessels with different capacities. under these conditions, the problem will be solved by using a multi-depot vehicle routing problem using a heterogeneous fleet and binary integer programming. at the initial stage, the solution to the routing problem is expected to get the smallest distance, determine the ship that will carry out the transportation and determine the customers to be served. the purpose of the study is to meet consumer demand with minimum transportation costs and calculate the number of emissions caused by the distribution of fuel based on routes and sea conditions. this study resulted in 13 of 20 vessels owned by the company assigned to the delivery of fuel. when sailing in choppy sea conditions, the transportation cost increase by 16.70 percent, and emissions co2 increase by an average 17.28 percent when compared with calm water conditions.",heterogeneous fleet,"A mathematical model has been developed using the Multi Depot Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem (MDHFVRP) and the results obtained are to deliver fuel products to 20 consumers, which was originally carried out using 20 ships, after arrangements were made, 13 ships were proposed to make the delivery. The need for transportation costs for all ships on one calm sea voyage is Rp. 1,906,182,121 if using MDO, Rp.1,828,171,223 if using B30 and Rp. 1,879,993,728 when using LSFO, and transportation costs will increase by 16.70% if sea conditions are choppy, and CO2 emissions produced are 286.93 tonsCO2e when using MDO, 172.8 tonsCO2e when using B30 and 279.44 tonsCO2e when using LSFO and will increase by an average of 17.28%.

Based on the results of the research that has been done, the Competition variable has a significant positive effect on Business Sustainability because it has a T-Statistic value greater than 1.96, namely 1.983 and a P-Value less than 0.05, namely 0.047, in line with the statement Prasanna (2019) which states that competitive advantage can help companies survive in the global market with the help of technological innovation. As mentioned in our research, the technological innovation in question is Digital Transformation. Carrying out digital transformation (Digital Transformation) is considered as an adaptive form of MSMEs to changes in the business environment considering the very rapid growth of technology to be able to increase competitiveness competitively (Competition) against its competitors so that business sustainability (Business Sustainability) can be maintained. Based on the results of the research that has been done, the Customer variable has a significant positive effect on Business Sustainability because it has a T-Statistic value greater than 1.96, namely 2.490, and a P-Value less than 0.05, namely 0.013, in line with the statement Strenitzerová, M (2018) where customer satisfaction and customer loyalty are considered as one of the main indicators of success that contributes to the sustainability of a business. The term consumer (customer) is the king of being a necessity that MSMEs must consider. Implementing technology into business is an action to keep up with changes in consumer behavior (customers) along with technological developments. So, MSMEs should carry out digital transformation (Digital Transformation) because consumers (Customers) influence the development of a business, so they must learn and adapt to what MSMEs want and need.. Based on the results of research that has been done, the Financial Technology variable has a significant positive effect on Business Sustainability because it has a T-Statistic value greater than 1.96, namely 5.962 and P-Value less than 0.05, namely 0.003, these results in line with the opinion (Gomber. P, 2017) but according to several other researchers, these results still need to be reconsidered considering that FinTech is a new thing in the business sector. Therefore further research is needed on these results (Al Hammadi, 2019), (Jamil. N, 2019). MSMEs must also adapt to changes in business models, such as changing the conventional way of transactions using cash to being cashless. Therefore, MSMEs must be able to follow the development of Financial Technology and implement it. For example, providing payment methods via an e-wallet such as OVO, GO-PAY, and QRIS. This is also related to the reduction of direct contact related to the current COVID-19 pandemic Based on the results of the research that has been carried out, the variable Utilization of Big Data Usage as a moderator Customer does not have a positive and insignificant effect on Business Sustainability because it has a T-Statistic value smaller than 1.96, namely 1.137 and P- The value is more than 0.05, which is 0.255. It tends to weaken the relationship between the Customer (X2) variable and the Business Sustainability (Z) variable. However, the research conducted by (El Hilali. W, 2020) using Big Data as an intervening or mediating variable got results contrary to this research. MSMEs should use Big Data because it contains qualitative information related to market conditions and market demand and information about consumers (customers), such as what Proceedings of the 3rd South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022","alexander adinata; fabien nicholas sutedja; haryadi sarjono binus business school undergraduate, management department bina nusantara university, jakarta 11480, indonesia. alexander.adinata@binus.ac.id; fabien.sutedja@binus.ac.id; haryadi_s@binus.ac.id","References

In addition, it is possible to generate a reduction in picking times by applying the 5S strategy and the ABC technique to the spaces within the warehouse. Also, a better replenishment process is generated after the optimization of inventory turnover using the ARIMA forecasting method and economic order-lot planning (EOQ). Therefore, the proposed model would improve the current scenario of the case study on which the research was carried out; however, better results can be obtained if it is supported by another prediction method such as the exponential smoothing used in this case study.","alisson consuelo lozano chavez and jean mora cabrera universidad de lima, escuela de ingeniería y arquitectura, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20170865@aloe.ulima.edu.pe , 20162298@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima, instituto de investigación científica, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",

Moreover, this research confirmed the positive relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. From the management perspective, this research suggested several action plans that could be implemented by telemedicine services providers to improve their customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. Research Limitation and Suggestions for Future Research First, there’s a gap between initial target respondents (150 respondents) and the valid responses (102 respondents). There might be an issue with the representativeness of the sample since the valid responses are limited. Future research should provide more valid responses to represent the population. Second, the moderating effect of demographic factors and education in this study has not been considered, the results of the effect of demographic factors and education on telemedicine customer satisfaction and customer loyalty would provide better insights in future research. Lastly, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction have been measured in terms of system quality dimensions (ease of use, response time, security) and service quality dimensions (responsiveness, assurance, empathy). Future research might explore other important indicators i.e efficiency, fulfilment, perceived usefulness, customer trust, and brand perception for further investigation.","asnan furinto doctoral research management bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia. afurinto@binus.edu. dewi tamara* executive strategic in management bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia dtamara@binus.edu adhietya saputra executive strategic in management bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia adhietya.saputra@binus.ac.id tri febriantono saputra executive strategic in management bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia tri.saputra001@binus.ac.id *corresponding author",

229,Redesign Of A Workstation In The Cutting Area Of A Company  In The Textile Sector To Increase Productivity,"peru stands out as a country with a textile industry in constant development, which has made world-class brands set their eyes on its productive quality. likewise, in order to achieve the growth of these industries, the workers of these industries have to work long and arduous hours, without taking the importance that is due, in some cases, to the well- being and comfort of each worker. ergonomics allows to identify the environment that helps to avoid occupational diseases and productivity. a workstation in the right conditions allows an increase in productivity since the human resource is something very important and is not yet fully prioritized by all industries. in the present work, the ergonomic factors of a cutting station, as well as its physical conditions of lighting and noise, are considered in order to redesign it. the objective of this project is, through the implementation of appropriate ergonomic and physical conditions in a workstation in the cutting area of a textile company, to increase productivity and reduce the risks of occupational diseases. an analysis of the three postures that caused the most fatigue to the operators was carried out through the erp (rapid postural evaluation) method, in order to identify the level of performance required and the improvements that the station needed. in addition, five kpi's were used to measure productivity before and after the redesign and identify its increase. the results obtained were positive, as an increase of up to 20% in productivity and in the level of operator satisfaction was evidenced. this work will serve as a guide to be implemented in future stations in the textile industry and provide a clear methodology for evaluating ergonomics and measuring productivity.","ergonomics, productivity, workstation","With the present research work, it can be concluded that the redesign of a station taking into account the ergonomic factors of this, allows an increase in productivity, since workers are a fundamental part and the level of satisfaction and safety of themselves to work in an area that presents the optimal conditions and without risks. The activities carried out in good conditions allow the operator to increase his productive capacity. Likewise, there is a reduction of future occupational disorders or diseases due to repetitive tasks that may cause discomfort for long periods of work in inadequate postures that affect any limb. Through the applied study, it was possible to verify that, although the concept of ergonomics is an important factor in the optimal performance of the collaborators; however, many companies still do not internalize such factor as part of what is offered in the workstations of the workers. There is still a long way to go to reduce the high level of indifference towards ergonomics and employee satisfaction for the benefit of their performance. It was observed that the inadequate arrangement of workstations, in such a way that it does not consider the order of the operations performed, generates losses of productive time in transporting raw material to each of the plants.","midori lara arana and allison vivar guillen industrial engineering student universidad de lima lima, peru 20162175@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20162651@aloe.ulima.edu.pe rafael villanueva flores industrial engineering universidad de lima lima, peru rvillan@ulima.edu.pe",

234,Production Line Improvement Analysis With Lean  Manufacturing Approach To Reduce Waste At Cv. Tmj,"cv. tmj (tuah mujolai) is a company engaged in manufacturing that produces door frames, window frames, and tables. this research focuses on the manufacture of door frame products where this product always has ordered every month. in the production process, the make-to-order system is implemented. based on the results of initial observations made by interviewing the company's owner and direct observation, it is known that there are indications of related problems. namely, waste or nonvalue added activity in the production process such as excessive processes, delays, defective products, and transportation. therefore, to reduce the waste that occurs, it is necessary to apply a lean manufacturing approach that uses several tools such as value stream mapping (vsm) to visualize the flow of materials from raw materials to finished products and root cause analysis (rca) to find the root cause of the waste that occurs until the end. waste can be reduced or eliminated.","lean manufacturing, waste","Based on the processing that has been carried out by the researcher, the conclusion that can be drawn is that the product under study is the door frame because the demand for each month is always more. From the analysis of the Current Value Stream Mapping, the known wastes are, defect, waiting, overprocessing, and motion. The cause of the Waste is analyzed using a fishbone diagram. Proposed improvements to be able to reduce or eliminate Waste that occurs is to inspect the machine before the machine is used, such as making a maintenance report card and machine maintenance procedure sheet, as well as making a production control card. After the implementation of lean manufacturing and recommendations for improvement, Future Value Stream Mapping is made, then after VSM is described, it is known that the comparison of the actual lead time value is 2,490 and the actual process efficiency cycle is 69.40%, while the proposed lead time value is 1,959 and the proposed process efficiency cycle is 88, 20%. So that after improvements are made, the production process is more efficient where the production time reaches the target and consumer demand.","uses value stream mapping (vsm) and root cause analysis (rca) methods misda yanti student at industrial engineering universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau 11850220466@students.uin-suska.ac.id fitriani surayya lubis, nazaruddin, muhammad rizki, silvia, sarbaini assistant professor industrial engineering universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau fitrisurayya@gmail.com, nazar.sutan@uin-suska.ac.id, muhammad.rizki@uin-suska.ac.id, silvia@uin-suska.ac.id, sarbaini@uin-suska.ac.id",

236,Proposed Improvements To The Chip Raw Material Control  System Using The Continuous Review System,"each region has its characteristics of traditional food, snacks, and drinks. one example of traditional processed products is generally made from raw materials of tubers such as cassava and sweet potatoes and also processed from fruits and flour (sari and nurrizati, 2018). through optimal inventory control, companies can meet consumer needs on time and minimize the cost of raw material inventory to achieve company goals (lahu, e.r., 2017). this research focuses on controlling the inventory of raw materials for chips, which will later be useful for minimizing inventory costs to affect the company's benefits. the purpose of this study is to describe raw materials inventory by determining the number of ordering lots and calculating the optimum total inventory cost for the company. the method used is a continuous review system and a periodic review system by collecting data related to the cost of raw material inventory at the ukm tungku sanjai minang maimbau. the results obtained are the total cost of raw material inventory, the optimal order lot size of raw materials by comparing the q and p methods, and the total cost of raw material inventory. the calculation of the two methods is then compared to get the best method for controlling the inventory of chip raw materials.","material inventory, inventory cost, asuncion","The conclusions from the results of the research that have been carried out are as follows: 1. The supply of raw materials for chips at the UKM Tungku Sanjai Minang Maimbau often experiences overstock and stockouts. As in the raw material for cassava/yam, the company experienced a shortage of raw materials or stockout in May 2021, namely -65 sacks, August 2021 and November, namely -5 sacks. Banana raw materials also experienced overstock in January 2022 and February 2022, resulting in bananas being damaged due to being stored in the warehouse for too long this resulted in disruption of the production process for making chips. company can increase. 2. he results of the calculation show that the most optimal number of order lot sizes is using the continuous review system (Q) method where the total inventory cost is more efficient than the company's method and the periodic review system (P) method. For cassava/yam raw materials, the order time follows the reorder value of 29 sacks, for taro the reorder value is 25 sacks, for potatoes the reorder value is 23 sacks and for niali bananas the reorder value is 23 sacks. 3. The actual total cost of inventory at the SME Furnace Sanjai Minang Maimbau is IDR.2,669,342,494 which is obtained from the sum of the inventory costs in one year for raw materials for cassava/sweet potato, IDR 519,371,985, taro IDR.580,132,566, potatoes IDR 837,757,223 and bananas IDR 732. 080.720. To minimize the company's inventory costs, calculations are carried out using the continuous review system (Q) and periodic review system (P) methods where the calculations that have been carried out show that the continuous review system (Q) method produces the minimum total inventory cost of IDR 2,652,784,376. obtained from the sum of the cost of supplying raw materials for cassava/yam IDR 521,150,253, taro IDR 574,828,241, potatoes IDR 840,607,581 and bananas IDR 716,198,301. 4. By calculating the inventory control of raw materials for chips at UKM Tungku Sanjai Minang Maimbau using the continuous review system (Q) and periodic review system (P) the total cost of raw material inventory can be minimized if using the continuous review system (Q) method, which is equal to IDR.2,652,784,376 compared to the periodic review system (P) which is IDR 2,657,780,219, while using the company's policy it is IDR 2,669,342,494. So from the results of the total cost of inventory using the continuous review system (Q) method, it can save 0.62% or around IDR 16,558,118. So that the best inventory method in making decisions for controlling the inventory of raw materials for chips in UKM Tungku Sanjai Minang Maimbau is if the company uses the continuous review system (Q) method.","and periodic review system methods mutia anggaraini student universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau pekanbaru, indonesia 11850222291@students.uin-suska.ac.id nazaruddin asistant professor universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau pekanbaru, indonesia nazar.sutan@uin-suska.ac.id muhammad rizky asistant professor universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau pekanbaru, indonesia muhammad.rizky@uin-suska.ac.id fitriani surraya lubis asistant professor universitas islam negeri sultan syarif kasim riau pekanbaru, indonesia fitriani.surraya.l@uin-suska.ac.id",

Based on the research findings, if users get a good experience with their experience in using/shopping at Tokopedia, it will be able to stimulate these consumers to shop again/reuse Tokopedia in online shopping. This finding is in line with the findings of research conducted by Fahrevi and Satrio (2018) which found that the higher the level of service quality provided by e-commerce to customers, the higher the decision to make purchases online. Customers will have a good view of your business and more confidence in their ability to make purchasing decisions when you provide them with high-quality service. 6. Conclusion The findings of the research lead one to the conclusion that the Product Review and Service Quality variables simultaneously and partially affect the Purchasing Decision variable.

246,Why Service Climate Matters For Supply Chain Adaptability  And Resilience Of Logistics Service Provider: A Study Of,"supply chain adaptability relates to a logistics service provider's ability to adapt to market change regarding strategies, products, and technologies. adaptability is one of the critical aspects of consideration for implementing blockchain technology in the supply chain. at the same time, supply chain resilience refers to logistics service providers (lsp) preventing disruptions and reducing their impact according to their readiness, quick response, and recovery. service climate relates to lsp employees' perceptions about how their companies appreciate them if they provide excellent customer service. in this study, supply chain adaptability is an exogenous variable measured by three indicators: design, operations mix, and physical facility mix. supply chain resilience is endogenous and measured by five indicators: relevant information, timely information, accurate information, collaborative plan, and flexibility. the service climate is a moderation variable measured by three indicators: employees' perception of service quality, proceedings of the 3rd south american international industrial engineering and operations management conference, asuncion, paraguay, july 19-21, 2022 © ieom society international 1962",,,"blockchain applications dicky hida syahchari assistant professor management department, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 dicky.syahchari@binus.edu darjat sudrajat assistant professor management department, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 darjat.sudrajat@binus.edu hardijanto saroso assistant professor management department, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 hardijanto.saroso@binus.edu engkos achmad kuncoro professor management department, binus business school, bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia 11480 eak@binus.edu andre kreie director logistics education - leed kuehne foundation switzerland andre.kreie@kuehne-stiftung.org",
247,Structural Transformation And Productivity Growth In  Morocco,"this paper presents an analysis of structural transformation in morocco and its contribution to productivity growth over the period 1990 to 2018 and highlights two major findings. the first is that there has been an increase in agricultural productivity that has been accompanied by a reallocation of labor to the service sector, particularly trade services. this situation reflects sectoral mobility between activities with low requirements in terms of specific skills, or what is called a structural transformation without industrialization. moreover, it turns out that the main driver of labor productivity gains is intra-sectoral dynamics; indeed, the contribution of structural change to productivity growth accounts for only about a quarter of these productivity gains.","employment, morocco, productivity","The Moroccan economy has experienced a productivity gain of nearly 2.6 percentage points, as an annual average over the period 1990-2018, of which a large part is attributable to the internal component (capital accumulation and technological change), whereas structural change has contributed little to overall labor productivity growth. Thus, the Moroccan economy could have achieved a much higher rate of productivity growth if the structural change had been given greater weight. Thus, accelerating the process of structural change in the Moroccan economy requires catching up on the delay in integrating into the formal sector the labor force absorbed by the informal sector, which still plays an important role in the Moroccan labor market. Indeed, according to the National Survey on the Informal Sector conducted by the High Commission for Planning (HCP) between 2013 and 2014, the informal sector employs 2.4 million people representing 36.3% of non-agricultural employment at the national level and contributes 11.5% to the national GDP. In addition, improving the competitiveness of industrial companies is a guarantee of success to establish a powerful industrial base developing the exportable offer, and being able to meet local demand, relying more on industrial ecosystems and activities that focus on the digital.","abdelghani bensaïd ph.d. student, faculty of law, economic and social sciences agdal mohamed v rabat university rabat, morocco bensabdel@gmail.com taoufiq yahyaoui professor, faculty of law, economic and social sciences agdal mohamed v rabat university rabat, morocco yahyaoui.taoufiqvdp@gmail.com outmane soussi noufail professor, faculty of law, economic and social sciences salé mohamed v rabat university rabat, morocco soussioutmane@gmail.com",

The results found in this study are that board of director, remuneration committee, and risk monitoring committee simultaneously have a impact on the financial performance of the state-owned banks recorded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2010-2020, while partially remuneration committee and risk monitoring committee have no effect on financial performance, but the board of directors has a impact on financial performance. This research is anticipated to add to the existing literature. The authors suggest the next research to to add other sample of banks that not used in the study. Next researchers can add or replace the proxy of the Good Corporate Governance variable with the proxy of the corporate governance committee and replace the proxy of financial performance using Return of Equity (ROE). And next research can use the same independent variable proxy and dependent variable proxy by conducting research on another company industry. For the company, the results of this study can be a consideration for the implementation Good Corporate Governance there must be a board of directors, remuneration committee, and a risk monitoring committee so that the company can run well and improve the company's financial performance or ROA. For investors, should pay more attention to company’s good corporate governance when they want to invest in a company.

It must be combined with methodologies that promote active participation. In this same context, when testing and debugging the students showed that they are highly able to describe the challenge, but a weak ability to observe, review, look for other ways to solve the challenge was observed. This could be because it is necessary to change the focus of how to teach STEAM and use innovative methodologies that encourage problem-solving thinking. In summary, all the students concluded that it was more satisfying for them to develop abstraction and modularization, which means that it was not difficult for them to make decisions and know how to self-organize. In short, the teacher must be prepared to serve as a guide in the process and, as such, he/she must handle the methodology necessary to succeed in the implementation of didactic modules in the classroom. The repetition of the experiment addresses in greater depth the combination of innovative teaching methodologies that develop problem- solving thinking skills in areas yet to be studied. A suggestion for the improvement of the understanding and motivating of the students on the points not achieved is the incorporation of various methodologies of problem-solving, as well as the promotion of the participation of the students in the didactic strategy and the active feedback in the process.","work in progress. derlis ortiz coronel, claudia rolon adjunct researchers facultad politecnica asuncion, paraguay derlis.ortizcoronel@gmail.com , claudiarolon@fpuna.edu.py cristhian coronel adjunct professor universidad nihon gakko fernando de la mora, paraguay cristhiancoro@gmail.com hector velazquez undergraduate student facultad de ingenieria universidad nacional de asuncion asuncion, paraguay hsvelazquez@fiuna.edu.py jorge kurita research professor universidad nacional de asuncion asuncion, paraguay jkurita@fiuna.edu.py",

272,Third-Party Covid-19 Vaccine Distribution Management,"the covid-19 pandemic took the world by surprise, affecting millions of people and families in paraguay and worldwide. we analyze the country's situation after the arrival of batches of anti-covid-19 vaccines to formulate a mathematical model that allows efficient distribution of vaccines to citizens of the central department. even more, maximizing the number of citizens in high-risk situations vaccinated with the help of a third-party company willing to lend its logistics fleet of trucks and drivers. we propose a capacitated vehicle routing problem (cvrp-type) mathematical model to find the optimal travel routes for fair distribution at the lowest possible cost. to solve the model, different parameters must be considered, such as the opening time of the vaccination centers, the drivers' working hours, and the vehicles' capacity, among others. in addition, in the case study, certain assumptions are considered to limit the initial situation before solving the model. one supposition is the demand, considered from july to september, when the country received the most significant number of vaccines. in this work, only the distribution of the pfizer vaccine and all the care it requires was considered since it is the most widely available vaccine in the country. the proposed methodology is valid as a first instance to solve the distribution problem in the central department. it applies to other departments and vaccines for other diseases by changing the appropriate parameters.","logistics, linear programming, cvrp, vaccines","and recommendations 10.1 Conclusions It was possible to design a Linear Programming model, for the correct and fair distribution of vaccines against COVID - 19 to minimize total costs and distribute equitably to each city. The best solution is obtained using 2 trucks with a capacity of 65,000 vaccines and 3 drivers with a final total cost of 768,059 ₲. The results are positive due to the speed with which the entire area can be supplied as well as the minimum costs that were achieved by using resources efficiently and complying with the limitations presented by the third company, which provides its distribution services. and logistics, to support the MSPyBS vaccine distribution management. It is worth mentioning that currently the situation of Paraguayan citizens in the country to which the investigation is limited in terms of the need to distribute vaccines against COVID-19 is not in a state of emergency. However, this mathematical model could be used by the MSPyBS soon for the distribution of vaccines against other diseases, previously modifying the parameters to adapt the model to the new case study and obtain the resolution. 10.2 Recommendations For the efficient distribution of vaccines, in a fair and equal manner, as well as at the lowest possible cost, we recommend weekly distribution in two trucks with a capacity of 65,000 vaccines each. The model is detailed and given the future need for a massive distribution of vaccines, whether for COVID-19, its variations, or other diseases, we suggest pilot testing and application by the institutions that consider the proposed study and mathematical model necessary. In order to obtain plans that adjust to the reality of the moment in which the implementation of the mathematical model is carried out, it is necessary that they have: the definition of the geographical scope of the distribution, the distribution requirements of the vaccine to be transported, definition of updated transportation costs, registration of historical data that may be relevant (population of the area, number of people affected by the disease, among others). For future work that could be developed from the results obtained, it is recommended: Regarding the programming of the mathematical model, analyze the possibility of including in the design all the activities and costs associated with distribution without the collaboration of a third party company, extend the period of time to be considered, as well as the geographical area of study due to the differences that may be found (route conditions, number of vaccinations available) between the central department and the other departments of the country.","nicolás guggiari, pilar heuduck, jorge l. recalde-ramírez and maría m. lópez grupo de investigación de operaciones y logística departamento de ingeniería industrial facultad de ingeniería universidad nacional de asunción san lorenzo, paraguay nguggiari@fiuna.edu.py, pilarheuduck@fiuna.edu.py, jrecalde@ing.una.py, mmlopez@ing.una.py",

274,Post-Disaster Humanitarian Logistics In Natural Disasters:  A Systematic Review,"the purpose of this research is to determine the challenges that hinder the humanitarian logistics (hl) process of natural disasters, the causes of the challenges that often arise from natural disasters, and the methods applied to solve these problems. the methods used in this research are a systematic literature review, publish or perish 7 application (data analysis method), and the scopus search option. the researchers found that the challenges hindering the process of hl are location, network, waste management, and financial funds. causes of these challenges are generally uncertainty, constraints and immobility, limited resources, and failure of minor problems (such as lack of appropriate responses, delay times, personnel shortages, injustice, and conflict/competition). methods that are applied to these challenges mostly consist of mathematical models, the articles that don't use mathematical models usually focus on potential solutions, or already have clear solutions.",,"Based on the research articles selected to be analyzed to answer the 3 research questions (challenges, causes, and methods), it can be concluded that the challenges that hinder humanitarian logistics after natural disasters consist of 4 main challenges, namely (1) location, (2) waste management, (3) networks and (4) financial funds. The challenges most often faced in the topic of HL-PD in natural disasters are location, which is divided into sub-challenges: allocation or distribution, other potential solutions (eg. drones), location of facilities, route problems, and procurement. Causes of challenges hindering the post-disaster humanitarian logistics process are (1) uncertainty, (2) constraints and immobility, (3) limited availability of resources, (4) failure of humanitarian issues: lack of appropriate responses, (5) time delays, (6) lack of personnel, (7) injustice, and (8) conflict/competition. The methods applied to help solve problems that occur after natural disasters mostly use mathematical modelling methods. However, the authors also found that there are certain articles that don't use mathematical modelling (an example is a research article that focuses on a potential solution in drones). The authors’ suggestion for future research prospects is to focus on a natural disaster. This is because this study found that there are currently too many articles that discuss and focuses on earthquakes and natural disasters in general, while there are still many examples of other natural disasters, such as landslides, drought, abrasion (coastal erosion) and so on, and their application to further develop in using mathematical modelling methods to solve problems. Then it can be seen based on the causes of the research, which are network problems, waste management, financial funds, and location distribution, that businesses should avoid the main causes that incite these problems so that they can handle and resolve them more quickly and effectively to help victims of natural disasters. By doing this, businesses can identify the causes of disasters that must be avoided and produce good and quality handling in humanitarian logistics when helping victims of natural disasters.","sambudi hamali, helen purnama hutahaean, kezia audrey widjaja management department, binus business school undergraduate program, bina nusantara university, jl. k.h. syahdan no. 9, palmerah, jakarta 11480, indonesia sambudi_hamali@binus.ac.id, helenpurnama263@gmail.com, keziaaw@yahoo.com",

276,Design And Fabrication Of A Large Gtem Cell For  Electromagnetic Compatibility Testing,"one mandatory requirement for validating new electronic devices and machines is electromagnetic compatibility (emc) tests because any new design can emit or receive unwanted electrical interference, affecting the operation of other systems or devices in their environment. this requirement becomes critical in the case of real-time control systems, electromedical devices, and outer space operations. the gigahertz transverse electromagnetic cell (gtem) is a tool for performing preliminary electromagnetic compatibility tests on new products. it generates a standardized and uniform electromagnetic field in a shielded environment, integrating pyramidal electromagnetic absorbers with large bandwidth. compared to other environments, such as an anechoic chamber, its reduced dimensions and cost make it a suitable test laboratory environment for emc measurements. this article describes the steps to design and build a radio frequency isolated chamber (gtem) with dimensions 4 m long, 2.2 m wide, and 1.5 m high. a literature review of the recommendations is summarized. the design of the mechanical parts and construction techniques are described to generate a construction guide for future interested parties. its critical dimension was analyzed with simulations using finite elements method to match the characteristic impedance of the exciter impedance and guarantee to minimize reflections.",return loss s11,"In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of a GTEM cell for EMC testing small EUT. The design and fabrication pose several multi-disciplinary engineering challenges.

277,Design Of Ventilation And Separation System For Wood Dust  Sawdust In An Industry Using Computational Fluid,"the ventilation of machines from industrial processes allows to control among others, heat and toxicity of the environments. dirty or bad environment is also detrimental to productivity. trafopar s.a., is the first paraguayan factory dedicated to the manufacture and commercialization of distribution transformers. the main use of wood in the construction of transformers is as separating pieces between windings, sections or between these and the core. the proposed system combines local exhaust ventilation and impulse ventilation. the impulsion ventilation system will be through an axial fan and will be in charge of guaranteeing the renewal of the air that will be sucked from the workshop by the localized extraction ventilation system. a localized extraction system with ducts and aerial installation is proposed, with a cyclone as a particle separator, it will be located between the outlet of the main duct section and the fan. using cfd it was possible to validate the functionality of the proposed system. the simulation was carried out in two stages, the first consisted of representing the conditions of the carpentry sector before the implementation of the extraction system, and the second stage consisted of modeling the proposed system. the results of the cfd showed a discrepancy maximum the 12.59% between the values obtained by the cfd and the calculations performed analytically. as the value obtained is less than 15% the analytically obtained results were taken as valid, thus guaranteeing the correct functioning of the system.","cfd, ventilation, wood dust","A combined extraction system combined with a delivery system was chosen. The impulsion system will be through an axial fan and will be in charge of guaranteeing the renewal of the air that will be sucked from the sector by the localized extraction system. A localized extraction system is proposed with circular section ducts and aerial installation, with a high efficiency cyclone of the Stairmand type as a particle separator, it will be located between the outlet of the main duct section and the fan. In order to save the fan blades of the localized extraction system, a G2/MERV 4 type filter will be used in it. The sizing of the components of the localized extraction system was by the dynamic pressure method, for which a total flow of 3182 m3/h and a velocity inside the duct of 18 m/s were used, resulting in a pressure drop of 2080 Pa, which led to the selection of a 5.5 HP centrifugal fan. With the flow requirement of the localized extraction system, the minimum renewal flow of the sector will be limited, values that, once added together, indicate the total air flow that the impulsion system must be capable of injecting. The impulsion system is capable of injecting a flow rate of 3,285 m3/h with a pressure drop of 52 Pa, by means of a 0.25 HP tubular type axial fan. The simulation resulted in a discrepancy of 6.7% between the values obtained by the simulation and the calculations carried out analytically with respect to the total pressure drop of the extraction system; and a discrepancy of 12.59% referred to the flow inside the duct. Due to the fact that both lower values are the maximum established as allowed (15%), the results obtained analytically are taken as valid, thus guaranteeing the correct functioning of the system.

278,Hyperparameter Optimization Of Deep Learning Model For  Short-Term Electricity Demand Forecasting,"short-term electricity demand forecasting represents a fundamental tool for decision-making by entities engaged in electricity management since it allows the development of strategies to meet variations in electricity demand in short periods. the accuracy of predictive models is an important factor for energy operations and the scheduling of energy generation sources to meet the demand at each instant. intelligent models based on recurrent neural networks (rnn) require hyperparameter adjustment. these models have several hyperparameters that substantially affect their performance. our paper implements a long-short term memory (lstm) model and four search methods to adjust its hyperparameters. first, we select the length of historical window and the hidden state size of lstm cells for optimization. second, we draw comparisons between the grid search, random search, a bayesian scheme, and a genetic algorithm. the data set used for training and validation of the model includes hourly electricity consumption and meteorological variables recorded in paraguay from 2015 to 2021. the proposed model was evaluated through numerical experiments with classical error measures such as the root mean square error (rmse), the correlation, the runtime, and the mean absolute percentage error (mape). our comparative study shows that grid search and genetic algorithm give the optimal hyperparameters with high validation accuracy on the test dataset. however, it is important to note that grid search may require much more evaluations and computational resources.","electric demand, forecasting, optimization","In this work, a model based on LSTM neural networks has been developed and characterized to provide a robust 24- hour forecast of the hourly electricity demand for the next day. The influence of exogenous variables with respect to the electricity consumption has been analyzed, resulting that temperature and calendar variables allow an extra contribution to the forecasting problem. The proposed model is constituted for a historical window that allows collecting information from past records. In turn, the dimension of the hidden state and the number of neurons in the hidden layer are determinants for its performance. The choice of these hyperparameters was determined using optimization methods. The methods considered were grid search, random search, genetic algorithm and a Bayesian scheme, called tree of Parzen estimator. Our results indicate that grid search and genetic algorithms can obtain the optimal hyperparameters. However, grid search requires much more evaluations and computational resources to obtain good results. The RMSE and MAPE can vary between 155.3±5.5, and 5.61±0.29 % respectively. The Covid19 pandemic affected the demand dynamics and prediction performance of the model. This model will help power utilities to schedule hourly generation sources for the next day. 7.","félix morales, carlos sauer, hans mersch, diego stalder facultad de ingeniería universidad nacional de asunción asunción, paraguay felixmorales@fiuna.edu.py, csauer@fiuna.edu.py, hmersch@fiuna.edu.py, dstalder@ing.una.py miguel garcía torres data science and big data lab universidad pablo de olavide españa, sevilla mgarciat@upo.es",

280,Natural Light As An Interior Lighting System Through Fiber  Optic Transmission In Paraguay,"this research has carried out the analysis of the efficiency of natural light as an interior lighting system through fiber optic transmission in paraguay as a pioneering alternative to energy demand. for its analysis, the construction of a flat concentrator in the shape of a truncated pyramid was carried out, with a metal support equipped with rotational movements both in the x and y planes in such a way as to manually track the sun. at the light concentration point, a support was placed for the 6mm diameter and 10-meter-long optical fiber that transports the concentrated light from one end to the other. this light transmission was measured with a luxmeter to determine the amount of illumination from the concentration point to the end of the fiber. it has been observed that, for an illuminance of 109,200 lux coming from the source (sun) with an orientation of 40º north and with an inclination of 27º with respect to the normal, the illuminance obtained at the end of the fiber located in a totally isolated room of the source was 21,600 lux at the surface of the optical fiber. in addition, the light beam projected by the optical fiber has an opening angle of 60º. given that the room to be illuminated with the natural light source has artificial light that projects an illuminance of 80,800 lux on the surface of the lamp, it is estimated that 8 (eight) points of natural light will be necessary for said room for adequate lighting.","fiber, optic, natural light, asuncion","Solar light could be concentrated by means of a flat mirror concentrator in the shape of a truncated pyramid, although it was observed that greater concentration can be achieved with covalent mirrors. ⦁ With this concentrator, only 62% of the sunlight from the source (sun) is concentrated, 38% are beams of light that are reflected back to the medium. ⦁ The existing loss in the hub-fiber system is 68% and only 32% is used as a lighting source. ⦁ 8 (eight) points of natural light would be needed to be able to replace the artificial light source, but a mixed system would be needed to be able to provide the system with reliability.","oscar díaz graduate student universidad nacional de itapúa encarnación, paraguay mge.oscardiaz@fiuni.edu.py ramón martínez graduate student universidad nacional de itapúa encarnación, paraguay mge.ramonmartinez@fiuni.edu.py jorge kurita professor and research director universidad nacional de asunción asunción, paraguay jkurita@fiuna.edu.py",

282,Feature Selection Within Time Series Clustering,"in recent decades, the world has experienced a health crisis due to increased infectious disease cases such as covid- 19, dengue, zika, etc. dengue is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by mosquito vectors, mainly by the aedes aegypti. this work is focused on paraguay, where the virus has surpassed 16,000 notifications so far, this 2022. this disease has an incidence throughout the country, which results in a large amount of available data. the time series clustering can find a subjacent structure within a large amount of data, simplifying analysis and interpretation of it. this article contrasts two different clustering methods (shape-based and feature-based), followed by a feature selection procedure. initially, both methods are tested, getting the highest silhouettes scores with the feature-based approach. subsequently, one feature is removed in each experiment and the results are ranked, getting higher silhouette scores by eliminating the least important feature. results show that better clustering is obtained by performing an adequate feature selection through the ranking procedure.","clustering, time series, epidemiology, dbscan, k-means","In the first experiment, it can be observed that using a feature-based representation; better results have been achieved in all three clustering algorithms, standing out the Euclidean distance and DTW metrics. In the second experiment, by eliminating features, such as Cpoints and Mean, higher Silhouette Scores were obtained. When DBScan was tested, the more features were considered, the more the silhouette score deteriorated. These results indicate that feature selection can improve or worsen Feature-based clustering. So, feature selection is important to improve clustering. Hence, at this moment, motivated by the results, the authors are working to improve the DBScan to be more competitive.

283,Natural Language Processing To Improve Information  Retrieval For Meeting Minutes Written In Brazilian,"a multi-thematic document is composed of many subjects in a continuous text. in this context, a meeting minute concentrates very important information such as guidelines and decisions. therefore, it is often used as information source. most information retrieval techniques do not deal well with multi-thematic documents, once it has non- structured data, lack of metadata and little subject delimitation. furthermore, it is hard to assign them the main subject or point to a specific snippet. here we had two main challenges. first, knowing where a subject goes to another, and second, how to identify them. to solve these needs we used text segmentation and topic extraction methods. the text segmentation technique splits a document into segments where each part contains a coherent subject, while topic extraction methods aim to group and describe them. many researchers evaluate these methods using long texts such as concatenation of documents or transcriptions of discourse and multipart meetings written exclusively in english. in this work, we collected a corpus of meeting minutes written in brazilian portuguese which besides being the language less studied, has a more formal and succinct style. as a result, it generates a structure formed by segments represented by descriptors and grouped by topics which adds extra information about the subject that each segment deals with. finally, we present a method to connect the text segmentation and topic extraction methods to improve the performance of information retrieval techniques as well as provide an annotated corpus for this domain.","multi thematic, text segmentation, topic extraction",,"portuguese ovídio josé francisco professor at facens sorocaba, sao paulo, brazil ovidio.francisco@facens.br",

289,Use Of Waste To Obtain Energy In Latin America: A  Systematic Review,"it is forecasted that by 2050, waste generation will increase to 2.2 billion tons per year, this is due to the poor management of waste, leaving approximately 33% untreated residues. along with this, in recent years new energy sources have been sought to replace the use of non-renewable energy. the objective of this study is to identify and characterize the experiences in using the procedures to convert waste to obtain energy. to achieve this, we followed the prisma method obtaining a result of 109 selected articles that were reviewed for the collection of information. thus, obtaining as a result that the application of the methodologies provides valorization of agro-industrial waste, utilization of animal waste, biogas generation and generation of electric energy from waste.","waste-to-energy, renewable energy, waste management","It is concluded that these experiences are characterized by evaluating and characterizing waste-to-energy conversion procedures. It should be noted that not all of them follow the same model; some experiences use large volumes of waste, at a macro level, such as agroforestry waste, livestock, etc. Others are at a micro level, such as obtaining energy from wastewater from a university campus. Finally, there is the pilot test, which could be based on software, on laboratory experiments obtaining small- or large-scale results. It can be observed that for the implementation of the methodologies regarding the social and economic aspect, the impact of the application of technologies in cities with variable population has been seen. It can be observed that for the implementation of the methodologies it is necessary to encourage a culture of recycling, since in this way the waste is used optimally. There are various conversion processes, which can be divided into biochemical, thermochemical and others. The most outstanding processes in the biochemical section are those of bio digestion, but fermentation and hydrolysis are also found. The former being the most used by researchers. On the other hand, there are the thermochemical processes, which are: pyrolysis, gasification and combustion, among them, the most outstanding and efficient is the pyrolysis process, because it generates energy with a higher yield. Finally, we have other processes such as landfill gas capturing gasses from those wastes that have been deposited for many years, generating GHG, so this process captures these gasses and converts them into energy. Another important process is densification, which is a physical process based on compacting waste to generate briquettes or pellets. In closing, the contributions provided by the application of these processes are beneficial, since waste, agro-industrial, agroforestry, etc., is valorized and used to convert energy and thus reduce the environmental impact. On the other hand, it seeks to replace traditional energy sources that generate GHG.","maría julia alva-villavicencio and natalia figueroa-bardalez students facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú 20151595@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20173353@aloe.ulima.edu.pe juan carlos quiroz-flores and marcos fernando ruiz-ruiz research professors facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe, mruiz@ulima.edu.pe",

Furthermore, this study demonstrates that journals with backgrounds or scope areas in sustainability, management, and business discuss the issue of sustainable competitive advantage management extensively. This study, however, discovers that there is no dominant journal or publisher discussing the issue of sustainable competitive advantage management. This means that research in this area is still dispersed across different journals or publishers. Development maps based on co-occurrence and keywords, on the other hand, are divided into 23 clusters. This review also summarizes research trends in sustainable competitive advantage management into four major issues. First, based on the research location, it is interesting to note that the majority of the countries studied in the last ten years have been developing countries such as Colombia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, and Iraq. Although there are developed countries such as China. Second, when it comes to the type of research approach used, data analysis reveals that the majority of the research employs a multiple case study approach. This means that the study can employ one or more case studies. In this field, descriptive qualitative methods are still the most commonly used approach. Although quantitative methods, particularly SEM, causal structural relations, and confirmatory factor analysis methods, are still used.

306,Analysis Of Determining Offshore Worker Schedules In The  Onwj Working Area During The Covid-19 Pandemic,"pt. phe onwj as one of the national oil and gas mining corporate has changed the work cycle for offshore workers from 12:12 (12 working days and 12 days off) to 21:21 during the covid-19 pandemic era. the enactment of the extended days to the point of surpassing 21 working days due to the workers who are unable to work, increasing the workload for offshore workers. to identify the state of physical health of the workers, blood pressure measurements are taken every week for the on-duty workers. the record of the blood pressure performed by on-site doctors showed that the average worker with a 21-days on duty and an extended day is still in the normal range, which is below 120mmhg/80mmhg. the nasa tlx test was performed to identify the level of the workload of offshore workers. out of the 142 respondents in the phe onwj offshore working area, 51% of workers have experienced an extended day. the results of the nasa tlx questionnaire show that offshore workers at 21:21 have an average wwl of 80.68 (high) and workers with an extended day of 84.79 (very high). therefore, an analysis is needed to determine the optimal work cycle during the covid-19 pandemic. analysis of work cycle alternatives using the ahp - expertise judgment method with 4 criteria: mental workload, operational-accommodation costs, health protocol, and operational protocols in the field with 4 alternatives such as 12:12, 14:14, 18:18, and 21:21 by 7 experts. the results acquired that the 12:12 cycle became an alternative with a dominant weight of 0.394 or 39.4% and the 14:14 cycle becomes the second alternative with a weight of 0.24 or 24%.","covid-19, extended day, nasa tlx, ww l",", working on an offshore platform with more than 21 days of work is considered to have a very high workload in terms of mental needs, time requirements, physical needs, performance, effort, and frustration. 5.3 AHP – Expertise Judgement In the AHP – Expertise Judgment test, 7 expertises participated in the assessment of weighing and comparing each criterion. From each weight given by the experts, a combined matrix will be calculated and the determination of the value of the consistency ratio (CR) must be less than 10% to obtain optimal results (saaty, 1990). Table 6 below will specify the result of the combined matrix calculation for the 4 criteria Tabel 6. Combined Matrix Criteria GOAL Workload A&T Fee Health Protocol Ops VE VP VA VB Q max : 4,0333 Workload 1,000 2,241 0,718 1,952 1,331 0,309 1,243 4,017 A&T fee 0,446 1,000 0,359 1,000 0,633 0,147 0,591 4,021 CI : 0,0111 Health Protocol 1,392 2,784 1,000 1,669 1,595 0,371 1,499 4,046 Ops 0,512 1,000 0,599 1,000 0,744 0,173 0,701 4,050 4,303 16,133 CR : 0,0124 Based on Table 6 above, the eigenvector (VP) value for the mental workload is 0.309, accommodation and transportation costs are 0.147, health protocol is 0.371, and field operations are 0.173. The health protocol factor became the dominant criterion with a weight of 0.371 or 37.1% and mental workload became the second dominant factor. The CR value was obtained from the consistency index ratio and the random index (RI) value. The RI value is obtained from the clause of the Oak Ridge laboratory which required the 4x4 matrix size to be 0.09. The CR value is 0.0124 which is smaller than 0.1, thus the weight or eigenvector value of the criterion matrix can be assumed to be consistent and valid. For alternative comparisons, the same calculation method is used for each criterion. For workload criteria with a work cycle of 12:12, 14:14, 18:18 and 21:21 the eigenvector is determined. So does the calculation of the other 3 criteria to obtain the eigenvector value of the alternative combined matrix against the criteria. Table 7.
