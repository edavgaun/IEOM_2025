1,"Electro-Hydraulic Power Steering System For An Automobile  Robin Barua, Md. Mizanur Rahman, Md. Tazul Islam,","automobile steering system is used to steer a car to the desired path. electro-hydraulic power steering system can be found in ford, volkswagen, audi, and nissan cars. in this paper, an energy-saving electro-hydraulic power steering system for an automobile is presented. the proposed technique has reduced energy consumption and improved the steering feel as compared to the conventional. in the proposed technique, the use of a dc motor gear pump instead of engine engine-driven pump ensures a good steering feel at high speed and good steering portability at low speed. the adaptive fuzzy-pid controller reaches the motor speed set point faster than pid hence improving the steering feel compared to the pid controller. the electric and hydraulic power consumption data are collected at 5.23 nm steering torque. the experimental results show that the hydraulic pressure developed in the hydraulic chamber is proportional to motor speed. in conventional controllers, the power consumption increases with car speed but in manual, pid, and fuzzy-pid controller, the power consumption decreases with car speed compared to conventional. the electric power consumption of conventional, manual, pid, and fuzzy-pid controllers at 0-120 km/h vehicle speeds are 5544 w, 1979.8 w, 1915.2 w, and 2017.9 w, respectively. the hydraulic power consumption of conventional, manual, pid, and fuzzy-pid controllers at 0-120 km/h vehicle speeds are 1192.8 w, 349.85 w, 335.72 w, and 361.19 w, respectively.","power steering, energy savings",Energy-saving by electrification of the power steering system has been presented in this paper. It has been found that the conventional controller motor speed response is faster than other controllers but the power consumption is the highest. The power consumption of the PID controller is the lowest but the motor speed response is the slowest. The manual controller has better speed response than PID and fuzzy-PID but it can’t reach the motor speed automatically. The fuzzy-PID is faster than PID and consumes less power than conventional and manual and it can reach the set point automatically at different vehicle speeds. Though it consumes more power than PID it ensures a good steering feel. The steering feel of conventional is not suitable at different vehicle speeds.,"syed masrur ahmmad, saswata dutta, rasel sen institute of energy technology, department of mechanical engineering, department of electrical and electronic engineering chittagong university of engineering and technology (cuet), chattogram, bangladesh premier university, chattogram, bangladesh robi5374@gmail.com, mizanurr340@gmail.com, tazul2003@cuet.ac.bd, masrur@cuet.ac.bd, saswata.an2@gmail.com, rasel.sen.eee@gmail.com",
2,"Supply Chain Management, An Advancement Of Rmg  Growth In Bangladesh","the ready-made garments sector has been the major export sector in bangladesh over the years. the aim of this paper is to identify the influence of supply chain management for better advancement in this sector. unique features like business, wage, time frame, supply chain, and compliances are included in the export-oriented rmg sector which makes it distinct from other businesses. without appropriate supply chain management, the prospect of growth for any business is extremely low. data for this study is collected from secondary sources. in our study, we try to emphasize how rmg aligns with supply chain strategies and collaborates along with the supply chain partners and logistics. according to proper scm procedure, our study tries to conduct the problems, analyze, eradicate, and modify the technologies. the outcome of the study may not be generalized as the data we are going to use from secondary sources.","rmg, bgmea","Our study tries to implement the importance and advantages of structural supply chain management in the RMG sector of Bangladesh. From the correlation part, it can be concluded that there lies a strong interconnection between supply chain management with the advancement of RMG industries. The study shows the significance of RMG industries by its export and employing female workers. While analyzing the data from the source BGMEA, we intended to manifest how the supply chain can influence the development of RMG industries. The previous studies that have been done on this subject discussed the dependence on raw materials, responsiveness, lead time, and also the approach to supply chain management. Whereas, our study emphasizes finding the correlation between top supply chain management and the advancement of RMG industries and establish some hypotheses for further studies. We also try to compare the approach of average and top SCMs in the RMG sector. We come to have top SCM is very influential rather than the average SCM in this sector. We gathered our data from secondary sources which can be considered a limitation of our study and analysis. The purpose of our study is to show the significance of supply chain management in the advancement of the RMG sector of Bangladesh. We analyzed, summarized, and correlated these two parameters. We also state some hypotheses regarding the issue that carries the positivity of this sector. As this is an enormous sector to develop, there are always some potential topics to research in the future like implementing automation on SCM, Supply chain sourcing and logistics on RMG, Integrated Supply Chain on RMG, etc.","s.h. sakib, md. shahidul islam department of industrial & production engineering, shahjalal university of science & technology, sylhet, bangladesh sh04@student.sust.edu, shahidul14@student.sust.edu",
3,Key Parameter Identification Of Linear Congruential  Method In Random Number Generation,"when analyzing real systems, collecting field data can be difficult. therefore, many methods have been developed to generate artificial random numbers. one of the fundamental methods is the linear congruential generation (lcg) method. it can generate random numbers based on the values of its parameters. this paper aims to identify the key parameter that has the highest impact on the performance of the lcg method, particularly in terms of the random number repetition period. to do this, the design of experiment (doe) technique was used, and a model was developed using minitab software. the experiment was conducted five times, and the average was taken for better results. the python code of the lcg method was used to determine the random number repetition period. according to the results of the study, it was found that the parameter ""m"" had the highest impact on the performance of the lcg method, followed by ""a"", ""c"", and ""seed"" respectively.","random number, lcg method, doe, key parameter, python","and Future Research In this study, we have identified the key parameter of the Linear Congruential method in random number generation. The Design of the Experiment technique helps us to perform this analysis and get the results. Python code helps us to determine the repetition period of random numbers. The Excel model helps us to verify whether the repetition period is correct or not. The novelty of this study is finding the degree of effects of each parameter on the random number repetition period of the LCG method. The value of parameter ‘m’ should be chosen carefully as it has the largest impact on the method’s performance. For further study, the number of design of experiment and level of factors may be enhanced to get more accurate results. The interaction between the factors could be analyzed to determine whether a certain pair of factors has a significant impact on its performance.","polash kumar guptho and abul mukid md. mukaddes department of industrial and production engineering shahjalal university of science and technology sylhet 3114, bangladesh polashguptho@gmail.com, mukaddes-ipe@sust.edu",
4,Potential And Challenges Of Bangladesh Shipbuilding  In Contest Of Global,"there are ups and downs observed in shipbuilding growth. united kingdom (uk) was the market leader in global shipbuilding before wwii. after that, japan became the dominant shipbuilding nation in the 1960s and slowly lost its competitive advantage to the promising industrial nation south korea, as they had the advantages of much cheaper wages, a suitable shipbuilding strategy, strong government support, and cheaper currency. south korean shipbuilding overtook japan's in 2003. in 2009, during and after the global financial crisis china became a global shipbuilding leader leaving behind south korea and japan by using the same strategy and technique of the two shipbuilding giants. china utilized the global financial crisis to develop its shipbuilding and they initially targeted the medium and small global market of containers, tankers, and cargo ships. bangladesh is a maritime nation with a glorious shipping and shipbuilding history. however, the country has failed to keep pace with the global shipbuilding race due to a few reasons. we must utilize our potential and opportunities to meet the challenges for sustainable development of the shipbuilding industry. this analytical paper will describe the potentials and challenges of local shipbuilding in a contest of global and will suggest a suitable shipbuilding market for bangladesh. key-word: shipbuilding, block, module, opportunity, challenge, 4ir, introduction shipbuilding is a primitive and labor-intensive industry. conventional shipbuilding was a low-tech industry (hossain et al. 2017). after the invention of arc welding technology, normal steel with insufficient fracture toughness was used in shipbuilding, and that resulted in some ships suffering catastrophic brittle fracture and structural failure. since the 1950s, specialized high tensile strength and tough steel with good physical and chemical properties have been used in the shipbuilding industry (hossain 2023g). modern steel has eliminated brittle fractures in ships (stopford m 2009). distinct beautification and work excellence are found in modern shipbuilding. today’s shipbuilding needs a lot of automation and uses a line production manufacturing process, where a skilled workforce is essential. ship design work, usually known as naval architecture, is finalized ship drawing after ship model testing either in towing tank/basin or cfd analysis. modern shipbuilding makes considerable use of prefabricated blocks or modules, where entire multi-deck segments of the hull are built elsewhere in the yard, transported to the building dock/slipway, and then lifted into place and the fabrication process is done as per the guideline of naval architects. this is known as block or module construction. so, modern shipyards pre-install machinery, equipment, pipes, electrical cables, and all other components within the blocks, to minimize the effort needed to assemble components within the hull, once it is welded together (hossain 2018a). again, incoming 4ir or industry 4.0 will influence the whole maritime sector and new transformations will be taking place in the shipbuilding industry and that will be very decisive in nature (noordstrand 2018). the main goal of shipbuilding 4.0 is an intelligent shipyard that is characterized not only by adaptability, resource efficiency, and ergonomics but also by close integration among ship owners, shipbuilders, suppliers, and other stakeholders both in industry and in value processes (hossain 2023f). bangladesh with its vast and young population has immense opportunity to develop any labor-intensive heavy industry like shipbuilding. local shipbuilding has adequate potential and prospects. however, bangladesh has failed to keep pace with the continuous technological advancement in global shipbuilding. moreover, a few typical problems and challenges have created obstacles to development 40",,,"commodore khandakar akhter hossain, (e), nup, ndc, psc, phd, bn commodore superintendent dockyard and chairman, bn dockyard technical institute, chattogram, bangladesh email: kahossain756@gmail.com",
5,Evaluation Of Prospects And Challenges Of Local Ship  Recycling Industry In Contest Of Global,"the ship recycling industry refers to the process of dismantling and recycling end of life (eol) ships and it’s globally accepted. basically, ship recycling is a significant and green industry, with an average of 1000 obsolete ships being recycled annually. at present global ship recycling industry is dominated by three south asian countries, including india, bangladesh, and pakistan. in bangladesh, the industry started with the dismantling of stranded ships and has since become a large and profitable industry. the industry creates huge employment opportunities for thousands of semi-skilled workers in poverty-prone areas of the country. such an industry has both opportunities and challenges for coastal zone management, as there are environmental, law enforcement, and worker safety issues. perfect green ship recycling as per european standards is always a costly affair. but, viable and almost green ship recycling with the integration of the present usual practice (beaching method) in asian countries is very much possible. despite the limitations and challenges the industry has considerable contribution to the gdp and the overall socio-economic sphere of bangladesh. presently, there have been visible reductions in bangladesh's market share due to strict environmental regulations, while the competitors have experienced increases. it is an analytical study with considerable effort of research work to evaluate the present global ship recycling situation along with the potential and challenges of the local ship recycling industry. key wards ship recycling, compliance, beaching, viable practice, hkc 1. introduction ship dismantling, commonly known as ship recycling, is a naturally sustainable activity, the repayment of which is felt at the global level. ship recycling is a reverse engineering process (hossain 2015) of dismantling obsolete ships to recover reusable materials in a safe and environmentally friendly way (hossain 2017a&b). if we look last twenty years, ships are beaches mainly in a few south asian countries like bangladesh, india, china, and pakistan allowing local yards to dismantle the vessels with moderate prevention measures with more manpower involvement (nikos 2017). those south asian countries are doing a great job as they are recycling obsolete old and eol ships with good efficiency, but in a less professional manner (hossain 2023a&c). for the last two decades, ship recycling yards in bangladesh, india, pakistan, china, and turkey have recycled globally 95% of eol ships in tonnage. the increase in demand for ship recycling has rightly led to an increase in regulatory pressure at both national and international levels. however, beaching as a ship recycling method is mainly used in southeast asia due to geographical advantage and tidal conditions. whereas, constructing and running dry docks is quite expensive, though dry-docking is the safest method. more environmentally concerned countries like the usa and eu usually adopt the dry-dock technique (hossain 2023n&o). however, a few countries in asia and europe have adopted the alongside or pier-breaking approach instead of beaching like turkey or china. right now, aliaga in turkey and a few other places in the eu are the most vocal against the slipway or landing recycling technique with the highest environment-friendly technique (hossain and mohiuddin 2023b). in south asian countries like bangladesh, india, china, and pakistan, eol ships are beaches for dismantling and recycling the vessel while taking advantage of the high tidal surge. however, those countries are doing a great job of saving the environment by recycling obsolete and unused ships with good efficiency, which were earlier buried at the deep sea as we have learned from history (banglapedia 2011). currently, 35% of the shipping tonnage recycled annually occurs on the beaches of bangladesh, employing around 200 thousand workers in the recycling process. moreover, it is estimated that the ship recycling industry generates around us$ 1 billion for the national economy. 53",,,"commodore khandakar akhter hossain, (e), nup, ndc, psc, phd, bn commodore superintendent dockyard and chairman, bn dockyard technical institute, chattogram, bangladesh email: kahossain756@gmail.com",
6,Potential And Challenges Of Artificial Intelligence (Ai) And  Future Consequences,"artificial intelligence (ai) allows computer programs to learn from experience through iterative processing and algorithmic training and represents human intelligence. now, ai has become a hot topic and important debates have risen like, how it might affect the job market and what is the end of global civilization. many people will lose their jobs due ai. on the other hand, few technology lovers think that it will lead to the creation of lots of diversified and interesting jobs. many experts think that it will have a big impact on the workplace and all aspects of human life in the near future. in reality, ai can make jobs more creative, lucrative, and flexible, and will lead definitely to a more creative and skilled economy. however, history says, that advanced technologies are usually starting to take away more jobs than they create, and unfortunately, this trend will continue. nowadays, there have been many ideas for how to solve this problem, and there should be updated education and skill develop program with new schooling system and that need to be introduced very soon. as there isn't enough work for everyone in the world, so the whole lifestyle and education system needs to be changed and to reorganize every aspect to make total human resource development system more purposeful. it is an analytical paper to analyze the potentials and challenges of ai along with the consequences of global future and way forward. key words: ai, ml, algorithm, robot, singularity 1. introduction ai is basically a simulation of human intelligence by machines, especially by computers, to do tasks that usually require human intelligence, like seeing, hearing, making decisions, and translating between languages. sire by apple, alexa by amazon, google maps, and chatgpt by openai are all examples of ai that people use every day (csu2021). since this can be done quickly; far quicker than a human could. today, people realize, ai-controlled self- driving cars (keremgulen2022), are a sign of fact, the future of ai is getting closer, and the concept of a driverless car is no longer the stuff of science fiction. recent studies say that by 2040, there will be about 33 million cars that can drive themselves by using ai. on the other hand, ai in healthcare is become a popular term for the use of ml algorithms and software. again, ai is going to imitate perfectly human cognition in the analysis, evaluation, calculation, presentation, and understanding of complex physical, medical, mental, and healthcare data, or to go beyond human capabilities by giving new ways to diagnose, choose drugs, treat, or prevent disease (mullainathan2022). ai has the ability of computer programs to draw close conclusions based only on the data they are given. ai can examine connections between various types of clinical data and final patient outcomes (coiera1997). ai now affects almost every part of our lives, from choosing what books, goods, electronic household items, or flights to buy online to deciding if our job applications are accepted, if we get a bank loan, and even what care we get for cancer or other diseases (hossain 2023a&f). a lot of big tech companies, like amazon, facebook, and microsoft, have opened new study labs for ai. it's not much of a stretch to say that software now means ai (bbcfuture 2017). peter norvig, google's director of research and a pioneer of ml said, ‘ai has shown that it can do a lot of useful things, like label photos, understand spoken and written natural language, and help find diseases. for example, today, google maps' usefulness to travelers is mostly due to ai. it has allowed us to create detailed road maps in a fraction of the time of any part of the globe. many in the financial sector see a bright future for ai, particularly in the banking sector (brynjolfsson 2017). we may also rely on ai-powered apps to keep us safe and comfortable while we ride bikes, stroll, or take public transportation. 67",,,"commodore khandakar akhter hossain, (e), nup, ndc, psc, phd, bn commodore superintendent dockyard and chairman, bn dockyard technical institute, chattogram, bangladesh email: kahossain756@gmail.com","References:

8,"Optimizing Weight Fractions And Chemical Treatments To  Increase The Shore Hardness Of Woven E-Glass, Woven","the usefulness and promise of composite materials in various industrial contexts have received extensive attention in recent years. chemical treatment and weight fraction modifications are the subject of this investigation into the shore hardness qualities in woven e-glass, woven jute, and kenaf hybrid composite laminates. the key objectives are to analyze how the naoh chemical treatment affects the laminate's hardness and how the fiber weight fraction affects stiffness. our process entails making composite laminates in a range of circumstances, from raw to treated (naoh), and from 20% to 25% by weight. testing the shore hardness of the laminates is a crucial tool for determining their stiffness. according to the findings, naoh chemical treatment improves the shore hardness, which is useful for its enhanced rigidity. the importance of optimizing the weight fraction of the composite design is further emphasized by the fact that raising the weight fraction of fibers typically leads to improved hardness. this study elucidates the value of shore hardness testing for characterizing composites and evaluating the effects of treatment and weight fraction modification. considering the importance of stiffness and durability in numerous fields, research has far-reaching consequences. the research also adds to the field of material engineering by advocating for environmentally friendly options by using natural fibers such jute and kenaf. in sum, the findings of this study deepen our knowledge of composite materials and pave the way for novel, eco-friendly materials and processes.","natural fiber, kenaf fiber, jute fiber, glass fiber",", compare shore hardness ratings for different fibre types and perform further mechanical testing to assess these composites performance. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, the shore hardness study conducted on woven E-Glass, Woven Jute, and Kenaf Hybrid Composite Laminates has yielded significant findings. Notably, the treatment with NaOH was observed to enhance the composite laminate shore hardness consistently, surpassing the raw condition across weight fractions. Moreover, a general trend indicated that 25% weight fractions exhibited slightly greater shore hardness compared to 20%, highlighting the influence of fiber weight percentage on composite laminate hardness and stiffness. Although not explicitly stated in the data, variations in shore hardness among glass, jute, and kenaf fibers were likely observed, offering valuable insights for material selection in specific applications.

9,"Dec 26-28, 2023.  Derivation Of A 3-Degree Breakdown Of Overall Operational","overall operational efficiency (ooe) is the key lever in the apparel/footwear manufacturing industry today which drives the costing, productivity, and optimization of resources. consequently, it is significant to determine the reasons for low ooe to mitigate the risk of higher cost, low productivity, and excess use of resources. in most of the cases, the common practice is to use the 1st degree formula only to calculate ooe which is challenging in case of detecting the root cause for low efficiency. this study deals with this challenge by outlining the three (3) degrees of breakdown of ooe in a manufacturing unit that finally drives to decide which main factor to pull down the efficiency is. the analytical approach formulates the 2nd & 3rd degree of ooe measurements by correlating all the possible parameters by using the conventional theory of ooe (1sr degree ) and introduces the four possible factors of ooe: availability rate, level of performance, quality rate & direct-indirect labor ratio. the correlation was proved later on by the data collection, data plotting on the derived formulas, and further analysis from a manufacturing unit. finally, the macro level to micro level derivation illustrates how an apparel/ footwear manufacturing factory can identify the factors related to low efficiency & take faster decisions on those factors to take the right actions to improve efficiency.","efficiency, availability rate, performance degree, quality rate","This research comes to an end with the formulation of two unique ways of calculating Operational Efficiency along with the conventional 1st degree formula. This 1st degree formula is widely used in almost all of the apparel or footwear factories today. Due to this, most of the manufacturing units are unable to identify the root cause of having low efficiency which makes over utilization of resources thus the costing of the overall operations faces higher and higher levels. This research creates the scope to identify the root cause of low efficiency processes with a quick and logical approach that finally could save the apparel or footwear manufacturing industry from waste of resources and creates cost effectiveness. From the result we can sum up that from the 1st degree OOE, we can only measure the Operational performance by calculating the efficiency. But, when the result indicates the value is too low, it also highlights there are some problems going on with the production. But, from the 1st degree formula, it is difficult to know the real reason behind the problem. So, we finally derived the 2nd degree and after data plotting on the 2nd degree, we found the same Efficiency value as 1st degree. Firstly, this validates the 2nd degree OOE derivation and then, from the parameters, we found the problem is in the Level of Performance since, this value among the four parameters was the lowest. Breaking down the Level of Performance into Three more factors, we finally arrived at our 3rd degree of OOE. The 3rd degree also provides the same OOE which validates the 3rd degree derivation finally. And also, after plotting 106","efficiency (ooe) to identify the main factor of non- efficiency in the rmg/footwear industry md muhibur rahman department of industrial & production engineering shahjalal university of science & technology sylhet, bangladesh muhibrafi12@gmail.com","References

10,Real-Time Battery Swapping Station Recommendation   Using Ensemble Clustering,"sustainable and energy-saving transportation options such as electric vehicles (evs) are becoming increasingly common in our society. this has extended not only to evs but also to real-life transportation such as two-wheelers, bicycles, and scooters. however, in many large cities, the limited capacity of batteries and the number of battery swapping stations (bss) have led to an imbalance between demand and supply. indeed, when drivers go to a bss, there are many cases where the number of fully charged batteries is not available, or the bss is relatively far away. therefore, in this study, we propose a clustering-based recommendation system for electric two-wheeled vehicles. we first consider both temporal and spatial factors (place) to integrate the data by analyzing the demand by time of day for each day of the week in the region. after that, we perform ensemble clustering using bss data installed for electric two-wheeled vehicles in gangnam-gu, seoul, korea. finally, it recommends the bss with the shortest distance without waiting time by considering the current time and location of the driver.",ensemble clustering,,"donghwan shin, taesu cheong school of industrial and management engineering korea university seoul, south korea email: ppuya1212@koera.ac.kr, tcheong@korea.ac.kr",
11,An Ergonomic Analysis Of Working Posture Of Selected  Brick Kiln Workers Using Rapid Upper Limb Assessment,"musculoskeletal disorders (msds) represent a predominant occupational hazard within the global brick kiln industry. poor working posture is one of the primary causes of musculoskeletal injuries in the workplace. this research is intended to investigate the working postures of brick-kiln workers and systematically evaluate the associated risk of injury. digging, mud transferring, mixing clay, molding, and loading are the five main procedures that were considered to examine the working postures. pictures of the various working processes were obtained using a portable camera. two assessment tools rula (rapid upper limb assessment) and reba (rapid entire body assessment) were used to assess the ergonomic risks associated with brick-making processes. the results from this study identified digging, clay mixing, manual molding, and loading operations as high-risk operations due to the prevalent disregard for optimal working postures. in summation, this research underscores the pressing issue of musculoskeletal disorders in the brick kiln sector, primarily caused by suboptimal working postures. carefully implementing rula and reba assessment tools has revealed specific duties with elevated injury risks. this research urges the consistent adoption of proper ergonomic postures by brick kiln workers, thus enhancing workplace safety and overall occupational well-being.","rula, reba","Bangladesh is the world's fourth-largest brick producer. More than 1 million people are working in different brick plants. In ten years, the number of brick kilns will probably rise by 2 to 3 percent due to population growth(Saha and Rahman 2013).The process of brick production is inherently physically demanding, and laborers engaged in this occupation frequently encounter a spectrum of work-related injuries. Within the realm of occupational hazards, it is noteworthy that the brick kiln industry ranks among the most perilous occupations globally, marked by the highest injury rates. Among these injuries, musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) predominate as the most prevalent nonfatal occupational injuries and ailments among workers, particularly those who engage in labor-intensive activities inherent to brick production, encompassing tasks such as brick firing, as well as the loading and unloading of bricks. This study was conducted to ascertain and analyze the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among laborers engaged in brick manufacturing activities in Sylhet, Bangladesh. The research primarily aimed to identify the musculoskeletal effects associated with each specific task involved in brick production, and subsequently determine the potential postures linked to these issues. Furthermore, the study conducted a risk analysis of postures assumed during each brick production operation using the RULA-REBA analysis. This enabled the identification of precarious postures that potentially contributed to musculoskeletal issues.","(rula) and rapid entire body assessment (reba) method mohammad iqbal, md. golam mahmood, and md. rashedul islam department of industrial and production engineering shahjalal university of science and technology sylhet, bangladesh iqbalm_ipe@yahoo.com, mahmood2018334022@gmail.com, rashedul60@student.sust.edu",
12,Total Productive Maintenance: Enhancing Overall  Equipment Efficiency In The Steel Industry,"optimizing operational effectiveness while maintaining product quality is essential in the changing steel companies. this study explores total productive maintenance (tpm) in the context of steel production, highlighting how it contributes to increased overall equipment efficiency (oee) by removing inefficiencies. the most significant losses, mostly chemistry/scrap, and a few others are identified by pareto analysis. this research uses in-depth analysis of the steel manufacturing process to not only identify significant causes of total delays and faults but also to identify the root causes with countermeasures of significant losses using the wwbla (why-why because logical analysis) method. the countermeasures found in the wwbla have reduced overall delays and total faults, resulting in an increase in oee from 79.5% to 80.5%. this study emphasizes the importance of tpm as an important tool for improving productivity, sustainability, and competitiveness in the steel manufacturing industry by integrating it with structured analytical methods.",tpm pillar,"In conclusion, this research pointed to the application of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) within the context of a steel-making melting plant. The utilization of the 80/20 rule proved instrumental in pinpointing critical issues affecting the unit's availability, performance, and quality. After the identification of these major factors, strategic countermeasures were implemented to address and rectify the root causes. The success of this approach is reflected in the improved efficiency of the steel plant's equipment. By focusing on preventive and predictive maintenance, the study underscores the significance of proactive strategies in minimizing downtime and maximizing productivity. This research not only points to the knowledge of TPM but also provides practical insights for industrial practitioners seeking to optimize their operational processes. In essence, the findings highlight the transformative potential of TPM as a methodology for achieving sustainable improvements in equipment reliability and overall operational effectiveness within steel manufacturing units. 8.","of bangladesh joyanta das department of industrial and production engineering khulna university of engineering & technology, khulna, bangladesh email: joydasanta@gmail.com prasis saha department of electrical and electronics engineering. brac university, dhaka, bangladesh email: prasis.saha.5@gmail.com sanatan sushil department of industrial and production engineering shahjalal university of science & technology, sylhet, bangladesh email: sanatansushil014@gmail.com",

15,Development Of Musculoskeletal Disease Risk Factor  Assessment (Mdrfa) Model For The Factory,"musculoskeletal diseases can be dependent on numerous environmental and individual factors. the existing methods leave out several important factors during the calculation of risks. hence, this paper has the purpose to create and examine a way for employees to estimate their own risk of developing musculoskeletal problems employing the musculoskeletal disease risk factor assessment (mdrfa) approach. exactly 112 male cement manufacturing workers participated in this cross-sectional investigation. participants were interviewed to acquire data about their own possessions. information on the objects was gleaned through perceiving their work and talking to them. additionally, they were given the cornell questionnaires for musculoskeletal pain and instructed to complete them out in persian (cmdq). a model was developed using structural equation modeling (sem) effect coefficients. this technique was verified using a linear regression analysis, and the final score was categorized using the receiver operating characteristic (roc). the musculoskeletal symptoms are seen to be considerably influenced by either the individual's own characteristics (total coefficient of 0.27) or by physical (total coefficient of 0.51) and psychological (total coefficient of 0.11). items' computed coefficients were utilized to formulate the mdrfa equation. the ideal cut-off values for the final score of the approach were 14.32, 18.56, and 22.59, creating four distinct categories. the mdrfa approach could adequately explain 73% of risks, but the rapid entire body assessment (reba) approach could only justify 51% of risks. prediction of musculoskeletal disorders relies heavily on personal, physical and psychological characteristics. this methodology may allow for more precise prediction of the occurrence of certain diseases.","msd, risk factors, cement factory",,"workers in bangladesh fardeen islam, mohammad abu shahriar hossain, and kazi humayra shams department of industrial engineering and management khulna university of engineering and technology (kuet) khulna, bangladesh email: islamfardeen@gmail.com, shahriar.ipe17@gmail.com, humayra.kuet.ac.bd@gmail.com",
16,Auxiliary Variables And Two-Step Iterative Algorithms In  Object Detection: A Novel Approach,"this research aims to improve the quality of life for visually impaired individuals by identifying obstacles in an indoor environment using a solution approach. the approach uses a convolutional neural network (cnn) to extract features and detect objects from real-time video. a head-mounted image acquisition device detects objects and provides audio information to the visually impaired. the system processes live video streams frame-by-frame, processing each frame as separate images. the authors incorporate additional variables into a novel two-step iterative approach to solve complex computer vision problems. the proposed method improves computational efficiency and accuracy, opening up promising avenues for future research. the paper also presents a new mathematical formulation of curve and surface reconstitute algorithms by introducing auxiliary variables. moving object detection is crucial for intelligent video monitoring systems, as it allows for accurate extraction of foreground objects. this paper aims to detect real moving objects from un-stationary backgrounds, limiting false negatives and achieving maximum application independence. the model and motion of the target objects are assumed to be unknown. introduce a new mathematical formulation for curve and surface reconstruction algorithms, introducing auxiliary variables and minimizing energy. this approach transforms an implicit data constraint into an explicit convex reconstruction problem, simplifying it. the formulation also allows for more precise parameter settings, ensuring convergence to a minimum. and demonstrate the properties and results of this new auxiliary problem, mainly when the potential is a function of the distance to the closest feature point.","auxiliary variables, object detection","The proposed ODMVI architecture aims to assist visually impaired people by achieving object detection through pre- processing, segmentation, feature extraction, optimal feature selection, and object detection. The model's accuracy and precision were better than those of existing models like CNN + PSO, CNN+WOA, CNN +GWO, and CNN+SLnO. The research presents a novel approach for addressing complex computer vision problems by integrating auxiliary variables and two-step iterative algorithms. The method significantly improved computational efficiency and solution accuracy in object detection, image reconstruction, and semantic segmentation tasks. The method's effectiveness may vary depending on the choice of additional variables and their relationship with the original variables. The convergence rate of the two-step iterative algorithm requires further investigation across different problem contexts. The proposed model is designed to assist visually impaired people daily. 7. Future Work The study explores the application of a proposed method for computer vision tasks, including object tracking, action recognition, and facial recognition. It also suggests improvements in the two-step iterative algorithm and the optimization of auxiliary variables. The study also suggests assessing the method's performance on more extensive and diverse datasets and combining it with other techniques like deep learning algorithms. The study also examines the accuracy of software defect predictions using five NASA data sets. The results show that feature selection techniques can improve the Bayesian net algorithm's accuracy rate by an average of 8%, while the Logistic Regression algorithm's best accuracy is over 93%. Future research could explore further methods for high accuracy and examine the effects of metaheuristic feature selection techniques. Future work will optimize detection time and provide audio notifications, with an Android app for smartphone video capture and a backend server for real-time object detection.","md. habibur rahman, yeasin reza, kawsar alam tanvir, salma akter and afsana akter department of mathematics, university of chittagong, chittagong, bangladesh email: habibur.math@std.cu.ac.bd, rezayeasin@gmail.com, katanvir5@gmail.com, ummesalmacu10@gmail.com, afsanasonia.mathecu@gmail.com",

19,Fair Assignment Of Matchdays In The Turkish Super League  Under A Rest Mismatch Minimization Objective,"turkish super league matchday assignments have been criticized heavily over the years by the stakeholders with arguments regarding economic losses and performance issues. with the objective to improve upon the current scheduling effort by the federation, we develop a multi-objective approach to achieve dynamically fair matchday assignments throughout season that also accounts for the rest time between consecutive matches. given the seasonal fixture, we develop a nonlinear binary integer program that is solved optimally for each round feeding information on previous rounds. our results offer promising improvements over the existing schedule generating better results when a greater degree of weight is given to seasonal matchday distribution fairness rather than obtaining ideal rest time.","or in sports, sports scheduling","Fair assignment of matchdays throughout the soccer season in Turkey has been an active point of debate for more than a decade. Participating teams of the top Turkish soccer league have expressed their demand for an improved matchday schedule in each round of the season raising economic as well as performance concerns caused by the current match assignments. This paper seeks to offer a solution by addressing both concerns. The proxy used to measure the economic balance between the teams is deviation from an ideal seasonal matchday distribution that is equally applied to all participants of the league. Regarding performance, we use a proxy metric that is employed to compute the deviation for each team from some ideal rest time since the last match. Round-by-round minimization of the weighted average of those metrics in a dynamic sequence of calculations by making use of all historic matchday schedule information is the method we propose in this study. The results indicate that the dynamic round-by-round solution approach improves upon the TFF schedule. The best outcome from our analysis is obtained when seasonal matchday distribution metric gets a higher weight in minimization of the deviations. This suggests that maintaining a balance in terms of rest time at the expense of fair assignment of matchdays may challenge efforts to succeed in the latter objective. The trade-off between the two objectives measured similarly by their associated deviation metrics should be well communicated to the stakeholders to reduce potential objections. We also recognize that further refinements could be made to our solution approach in the future to enhance its ability to generate better schedules. Instead of a strict round-by-round solution approach, one may also solve for multiple rounds if information flows in a way to remove uncertainty for several rounds. This should bring not only fairer schedules, but also offer better visibility to the participating teams. Another extension could be the determination of the entire fixture under the set of objectives. Although fixture determination problem has been studied extensively in the literature, matchday determination has been disregarded. We believe future work should fill this gap as well. 237","yasin göçgün department of industrial engineering school of engineering and natural sciences i̇stanbul medipol university beykoz, i̇stanbul, türkiye email: yasin.gocgun@medipol.edu.tr niyazi o bakır department of mechanical & industrial engineering college of engineering sultan qaboos university al-khoudh, sultanate of oman email: n.bakir@squ.edu.om","References

Best combination of the layers was found out by varying the number of Conv2d and Pooling Layers in each block keeping the filters and kernel size fixed. Later best result found out by varying the filters and kernel size. The developed model has overall accuracy of 98.06% and validation accuracy of 88.75% whereas the VGG16 model gives 84.38% accuracy.

For the first indicator, namely waste, with an efficiency rate of 32.13%, this indicator includes the environmental aspect. Furthermore, there is a mean noise level indicator with a noise level of 85.57 dB. For the lighting level indicator, namely with a lighting level of 75 Lux, the value is still below the predetermined standard of 100 Lux for room temperature indicators after measurements are taken for a temperature of 33.8°C. This value also exceeds the temperature standard set by government regulations. And for work safety indicators, they have a low efficiency rate of 50.00%. These results are depicted through the Sustainable Value Stream Mapping chart using traffic lights, which can be seen in Figure 1. Therefore, improvements were made to these five indicators, namely using waste as a planting medium, using earplugs and earmuffs to reduce noise, replacing lamps with higher lighting levels, adding several ventilation and exhaust fans, and using Personal Protection Equipment in production areas. and provide warnings and sanctions for employees who do not comply with regulations.

The three highest wastes occur in the production line based on the weighting results that have been carried out, namely waste defects, transportation, and waiting. 2. Five main causal factors were found in the production process, including man, machine, material, method, and environment. Waste defects occur due to workers' lack of concentration, dirty machines that frequently jam, fabric being cut, poor needle quality, and a noisy work environment. Waste transportation due to moving goods in large quantities still uses trolleys; congested areas create traffic because goods are often moved using human hands, which can hinder traffic movement, and the distance of moving goods is quite far. Waiting occurs due to unskilled workers waiting in turns to use trolleys, setting up the machine for quite a long time, the finished goods transfer area being congested due to piles of finished goods in the finished goods moving area, the product inspection process taking quite a long time due to waiting for the results fabric cutting. 3. The proposed improvement given by the company to increase the value of the process cycle efficiency is maintenance activities, such as making a machine maintenance/checking/repair card, which will be given to the company. Warning signs include warning signs on sewing tables and warning signs on rubbing tables. Additional work facilities, such as additional thread clip scissors and earplugs. Utilization of work facilities, such as elevator facilities, in the company. The proposed improvements can result in a reduction in the total lead time of 13.78 minutes and an increase in process cycle efficiency of 1.65% based on future value stream mapping results. 7. Suggestion In the field of garment production, it is hoped that future research will carry out comprehensive analyses to dig deeper into the ins and outs of waste in the production process. The emphasis is expected to go beyond current exploration and include careful investigation of various types of waste. The focus will primarily be on identifying and mitigating other forms of waste, including but not limited to excess inventory, overproduction, over- processing, and unnecessary movement or motion. By expanding their investigations to cover a broader spectrum of waste elements, this research aims to contribute to ongoing efforts in the industry to optimize production processes and improve overall efficiency. 375","aifa raviva surdadi, ahmad, mohammad agung saryatmo department of industrial engineering universitas tarumanagara, jakarta, indonesia aifa.545200031@stu.untar.ac.id, ahmad@ft.untar.ac.id, mohammads@ft.untar.ac.id","References

33,Customer Demand Forecasting To Reduce The Raw Material  Shortage And Opportunity Cost,"the electronic factories have problems from the inefficiency of producing and delivering products as per customer's order. this is because customer orders ended up being more than forecast in some periods and the factory did not have enough raw materials to produce customer demands. in duration of time, customers have suddenly increased the volume of products. if the factory does not have enough materials and additional raw materials, orders will have a lead time of more than the date specified by the customer to deliver the product. if the manufacturer is unable to produce the product according to the lead time and cost agreement with the customer, this will then affect customer confidence and satisfaction. this would cause customers to move their demand to another manufacturer then affect the opportunity cost. from the past about two years of data (2021-2023), it found that orders ended up being more than customer demands by about 51%. this study aims to reduce the problem of material shortage and opportunity cost by selecting the most impact model and doing regression by the minitab program. the curve fitting regression was used to forecast the demand that was close to the linear line of difference customer orders. the accuracy of the forecast can be decreased to 31% it will use the curve fitting regression for forecast and prepare the material in the future and to avoid opportunity cost.","forecast, shortage materials, minitab program","Based on the results of an experiment that compared actual order data with the original forecast, it was found that customers over-ordered 51% of the demand or loss amounting to about 270000-780000 USD per year. The model can reduce to 31% of customer forecasting demand or a total amount of 100000-170000 USD per year. Curve regression will be used to predict and prepare for future materials, which will help avoid opportunity costs. Figure 9 .

42,Sustainable Agricultural Supply Chain Management:   A Strategic Roadmap For Development In,"the overall geographical location of entire bangladesh has displayed significant agricultural potential with a diversified crop portfolio. however, challenges hinder the growth of the region's agricultural supply chain. this study introduces a comprehensive and sustainable long-term framework for expanding the agricultural sector throughout bangladesh. the research begins by examining the historical constraints that have characterized bangladesh's agricultural economy, including subsistence farming and the dominance of intermediaries. recent infrastructural improvements, such as new transportation networks, have opened up new opportunities for cultivating profitable crops like fruits and spices. nevertheless, transportation remains a major barrier, impacting effective supply chain management and market access. to fully harness the agricultural potential of bangladesh, we propose the implementation of a sustainable supply chain management structure founded on principles of sustainability, efficiency, and traceability. the study identifies sectors such as manufacturing, storage, transportation, packaging, marketing, and information sharing as areas requiring enhancement. combining both quantitative and qualitative data gathered from 100 farmers through questionnaires and interviews, the study highlights issues like low agricultural yields, post- harvest losses, inadequate storage facilities, costly transportation, crop damage during transit and storage, limited market opportunities, and poor information exchange. the suggested roadmap addresses these challenges by promoting improved farming practices, enhanced storage facilities, efficient transportation networks, appropriate packaging, expanded marketing avenues, and improved information flow. the adoption of this approach would lead to a more efficient, profitable, and environmentally sustainable agricultural supply chain throughout bangladesh, benefiting farmers, consumers, and the nation as a whole. collaboration among the local community, government, and commercial sector will be crucial for the effective implementation and overall growth of the region's agricultural sector.","framework, sustainability, efficiency","The envisioned sustainable agricultural supply chain management framework offers comprehensive solutions to the pressing challenges spanning production, storage, transportation, packaging, marketing, and information dissemination across the entire terrain. Besides, the execution of SCM methods must ensure that the flow of data and information between suppliers, distributors, manufacturers, and customers to be completely transparent. (Tajwar et al. 2022).This roadmap seeks to fortify a more resilient and profitable agricultural supply chain by championing sustainability, efficiency, and traceability. It aims to overcome equipment inadequacies, reduce food wastage, and improve efficiency. Neighborhood-based cold storage hubs with frozen vans promise to maintain perishable goods' quality and enable direct delivery. Leveraging railways during challenging weather and a strategic network for transportation minimizes costs and optimizes delivery within the terrain. Integration of proper packaging and traceability ensures freshness and allows for data-driven issue resolution. This approach benefits farmers and consumers alike, enhancing the supply chain's efficiency and satisfaction. Overall, implementing these methodologies promises a transformative impact, fostering sustainable growth and prosperity for all stakeholders involved.","bangladesh's diverse terrain quazi monjur e-elahi, md sanadiule shorif ullash and rawnak labiba noor department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of science and technology (aust) dhaka, bangladesh",
43,Effect Of Alkali Treatment On Mechanical Properties Of  Non-Woven Jute Fiber Reinforced Epoxy Composite,"jute fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites are highly desirable because they can offer sustainable alternatives to traditional materials. researchers have been trying to improve the overall characteristics of these composites in different ways, alkali treatment is one of them. in this study, the effect of naoh treatment on the mechanical characteristics of randomly distributed non-woven jute fiber-reinforced epoxy composites is investigated. the effects of various naoh concentrations (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%) on mechanical properties are investigated by experimentation. the composites were fabricated using hand layup followed by the compression molding method. the treatment of fibers using 5% naoh solution showed a significant improvement in tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile modulus, flexural modulus, and energy absorption while maintaining a tolerable elongation at break. the treatment of fibers using higher naoh concentration caused a decrease in tensile and flexural properties due to possible fiber damage during treatment. fiber treatment using naoh is found to be effective for the enhancement of mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced composites but care should be taken to optimize the concentration of naoh used for fiber treatment.","alkali treatment, tensile properties","and Future Research The effects of NaOH treatment on the mechanical characteristics of randomly distributed non-woven jute/epoxy composites were investigated in this study. A complex link between treatment concentration and some mechanical characteristics was found in this investigation. The composites fabricated using fibers treated with 5% NaOH concentration, in particular, demonstrated a notable improvement in tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile modulus, flexural modulus, and energy absorption. The improvements were attributed to the increased fiber-matrix adhesion brought on by the treatment. The study also identified the threshold for NaOH concentration to be 5% NaOH. Increasing the concentration degrades the mechanical performance of the composites. The treatment of fiber may be a blessing for improving the properties of the fiber-reinforced composite materials but the concentration of alkali solution plays an important role in the mechanical properties of the composites because of the possibility of fiber damage at higher concentration. To further improve the mechanical properties of jute fiber composites, future studies should concentrate on improving treatment parameters, taking into account elements like NaOH content, treatment duration, and alternative surface modification approaches. Future research may concentrate on assessing the environmental sustainability of these composites and investigating eco-friendly treatment options to meet the increasing demand for green engineering techniques. Expanding the usability and economic relevance of NaOH-treated jute composites in various industries can be achieved by investigating their multifunctional capabilities and specialized applications, such as self-healing characteristics or use in automotive and aerospace components.","rajuahammad, md arifuzzaman and md shariful isalm faculty of mechanical engineering khulna university of engineering & technology khulna-9203, bangladesh rajuahammad@me.kuet.ac.bd, arif48@me.ket.ac.bd, msislam@me.kuet.ac.bd",
44,Beyond The Gridlock: A Comparative Study Of Htms And  Atms In Achieving Sustainable Traffic,"urban areas grapple with a formidable challenge to sustainability and quality of life due to traffic congestion. this study examines the intricacies of traffic management in dhaka city, investigating the potential of both the human traffic management system (htms) and automated traffic management system (atms) in alleviating gridlock and fostering sustainable transportation solutions. the inquiry commences with a comprehensive analysis of the existing traffic scenario in dhaka city, pinpointing critical pain points and challenges contributing to persistent congestion. subsequently, the study introduces two primary traffic management approaches: htms, characterized by human-operated systems, and atms, relying on automated technologies. conducting an extensive comparative analysis, this research evaluates the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of both htms and atms within the unique traffic landscape of dhaka city. parameters such as real-time adaptability, scalability, environmental impact, and cost-effectiveness are carefully examined to gauge the overall sustainability of these systems. moreover, the study delves into the social and economic implications of implementing htms and atms, incorporating perspectives from commuters, local businesses, and city planners. the exploration extends to the potential for integrating these systems, proposing a hybrid model that optimizes the strengths of both approaches. the research findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and traffic management authorities in dhaka city, furnishing a roadmap for the adoption of sustainable traffic solutions. ultimately, this study endeavors to shape the development of a tailored traffic management strategy that transcends gridlock, ensuring a sustainable and smoother traffic flow in dhaka city.","cleaner production, furniture industry",,"solutions for dhaka city ibrar amin, ishrakul tahmid, and faiza mahmood aroni undergraduate students in computer science and engineering (cse), american international university-bangladesh (aiub), dhaka 1229, bangladesh ibrarshafin2002@gmail.com, ishrakultahmid@gmail.com, aronimahmood@gmail.com md. mortuza ahmmed associate professor, department of mathematics, american international university-bangladesh (aiub), dhaka 1229, bangladesh mortuza123034@gmail.com",
45,Experimental Design Of An Energy-Saving Egg Incubator  System Using Fuzzy-Pid Controller,"to meet the high demand for poultry production, artificial egg hatching is needed. an incubator is a device that is used to successfully hatch fertile eggs under suitable environmental conditions by regulating the temperature and humidity of the enclosure. temperature and humidity are the parameters that are controlled in hatching egg incubators in the poultry industry worldwide. incubation conditions depend on the hatchability of the birds. inappropriate temperature and humidity levels result in unwanted conditions during incubation. temperature and humidity control in an incubator are critical during incubation. the source of power in an incubator is electrical energy. the proper use of energy is an important factor. controlling the temperature of an egg incubator system can reduce electrical energy consumption. in this research, different kinds of incubators have been investigated and a new energy-saving egg incubator has been proposed. the possibility of the most suitable temperature for hatching an egg is about 35–40 °c; however, the optimum temperature should be kept at 37.5°c and humidity should be kept at 55%–60% during the 21 days of incubation. a normal conventional controller is usually used in local poultry farms. the power consumption was about 56.08 kwh during the 21 days of incubation. for energy savings, a pid control system was used with an arduino uno at mega 328p microcontroller. power consumption was recorded at 44.77 kwh during the 21 days of incubation. for further development of the temperature control of this system, a fuzzy-pid controller is used and simulated, which has improved the temperature rise time and settling time compared to the conventional egg incubator. during the experimental operation, the power consumed was about 41.58 kwh for 21 days of incubation. the result shows that the fuzzy-pid controller can save 14.5 kwh more energy than conventional and save 3.19 kwh more energy than the pid controller is more energy efficient than a conventional controller. however, fuzzy-pid is more energy efficient than a pid controller. finally, it is found that a lot of energy has been saved because of the use of fuzzy-pid instead of pid and conventional controllers.","temperature, energy saving, fuzzy-pid","The Energy-saving egg incubator system has been investigated in this research by controlling the temperature and maintaining the humidity using a Fuzzy-PID controller. For energy-saving operation, the brightness of the bulb is controlled as well as the temperature in the egg incubator system. In the experimental work, the following three controllers are used namely Conventional, PID, and Fuzzy-PID controller. The brightness of the bulb can’t be controlled in a conventional system. Therefore, a PID and Fuzzy-PID controller are used to regulate the voltage as well as the temperature and maintain the humidity in the egg incubator system. The experiment involved gathering 60-minute temperature data for conventional, PID, and Fuzzy-PID controllers. The set temperature was 38°C. For 21 days of incubation, the conventional controller consumed 56.08 kWh; however, PID consumed 44.77 kWh, whereas Fuzzy-PID consumed only 41.58 kWh. The PID has a significant amount of energy savings when compared to a conventional controller, which amounts to 20.05%. The energy savings of Fuzzy-PID compared to conventional controllers amount to 25.83%. The result shows that Fuzzy-PID controllers have lower power consumption compared to other controllers and found effective and efficient method in this purpose.

47,Community Empowerment Consideration On-Site Location  Selection Using Ahp And Topsis Methods,"the company's location can affect the development and continuity of a business, site selection is a strategic plan that is expected to become a company's competitive advantage. the site selection process is not only about finding the optimal geographic point but also about synergy with the company's long-term business plan. recently, a company not only focused on seeking profits, but the awareness about community and environment development around the site location has begun to grow in line with world priorities in managing various resources. the emergence of commitments such as the sustainable development goals makes companies not only focus on business but also on the sustainability of the surrounding community. site selection is a multi-criteria decision-making problem, with the objective of finding the most optimal and profitable location for the company's sustainability, in previous research, site selection has several criteria to be considered such as costs, infrastructure, environment, and economics but did not consider aspects of potential community empowerment in the selection. this research aims to observe the influence of potential for community empowerment in the site selection process of a toy manufacturing factory by using the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) method to weigh the criteria and combine it with the topsis method to determine the ranking of the available alternative locations.","site selection, ahp, topsis","In this research, various criteria and sub-criteria were processed to obtain priorities for selecting the location of the toy factory, taking into account the potential for community empowerment. The criteria related to determining the location include cost criteria with sub-criteria of investment costs and minimum wages; infrastructure criteria with sub-criteria for the availability of transportation modes and utility availability; human resource criteria with job competency suitability; conduciveness criteria with sub-criteria for social conduciveness and general security; logistics criteria with sub-criteria for access to local and imported raw materials, as well as domestic and international marketing access; and community empowerment criteria with sub-criteria for the potential absorption of labor from the surrounding community and the potential implementation of CSR for the surrounding community. Based on the research results, logistics criteria is the criterion with the highest weight of influence, with a value of 27%, compared to the weights of other criteria. Meanwhile, community empowerment criteria have the lowest level of influence with a weight value of 5% in the selection of the location of the ABC factory branch. Based on the AHP- TOPSIS method processing in the research on the selection of the ABC factory branch location, the ranking results show that the alternative location A is the top priority, ranking first with a percentage of 45%, followed by Alternative B with a percentage of 41% in the second rank, and in the third rank is alternative C with a percentage of 14%.","yoga satria and djoko sihono gabriel industrial engineering department faculty of engineering, at indonesia university depok, 16424, indonesia yoga.satria12@ui.ac.id, dsihono@gmail.com",

49,Drone Distribution Model For Emergency Medicine  Distribution To Reduce Delivery Time And Costs:,"the lack of adequate infrastructure for most of the roads and routes in peru has generated a saturation of the roads and longer transport times, which affects the state health sector presenting frequent situations of shortages of medicines for urgent and emergency cases nationwide due to various factors such as the use of ambulances used for the delivery of medicines in a very congested road infrastructure. this research proposes an emergency medicine distribution model to reduce delivery time and costs using drones (remotely piloted unmanned aerial vehicles). the distribution of medicines to thirteen medical posts using 4 ambulances in the northern area of lima was analyzed and the results were compared with the distribution of medicines using 21 drones, providing care to 313,248 emergency cases, demonstrating the reduction of delivery times and costs. it can be concluded that the use of drones as a substitute in the distribution of emergency medications and medical items is a faster and 22 times less expensive means than traditional distribution using ambulances or distribution trucks, demonstrating that the model is viable to be implemented in the northern area of lima.","drones, medical supplies, health logistics","The study has addressed the problem of an inadequate medicine supply system in the northern region of Metropolitan Lima, proposing a medicine distribution system in state medical care centers in the northern area of Metropolitan Lima, using drones which would achieve lower distribution times and costs than the current level. The study carried out four simulations in the same scenario, the first two made a quantitative comparison between a drone and an ambulance; and the last two making an economic comparison, based on the same investment for a system using 21 drones versus an alternative of using 4 ambulances for the distribution of medicine, finding that one drone could attend a total of 15 471 cases, while the ambulance could only attend to 4 238 cases. With 21 drones it is feasible to attend to 313 166 cases, unlike with 4 ambulances it is only possible to attend to only 5,41% of the cases and in this way the distribution of medicines using drones would reduce response times, especially in critical situations providing faster and more effective care. The evaluation of operating costs, including depreciation, fuel, maintenance and permits, showed that the deployment of drones is more cost-effective compared to the use of ambulances. Additionally, the careful selection of the FoxTech Eagle 360 drone, with a lower acquisition cost and greater operating range, contributes significantly to the financial efficiency of the project. Likewise, the cost reduction is evident. In economic terms, serving the target population is viable if drones are used as a means of distribution. In order to meet that objective, 74 ambulances would be required. Consequently, the result was a saving of USD 10 593 921. The operating cost per distance is lower for a drone, obtaining a total of 13,02 USD cents per km compared to the figure of 51,80 USD cents per kilometer that the ambulance presented; That is, there is a difference of 38,78 USD cents per km, which shows that the innovative proposal is more economical. Consequently, the use of drones as a substitute in the distribution of emergency medications and medical items is a faster and 22 times less expensive means than traditional distribution using ambulances or distribution trucks. This demonstrated that the model has viability to be implemented in the northern area of Lima, with a service of thirteen medical posts to a greater expansion, without logistical complexities.","case of the peruvian health sector david kevin jenss senador and pavel alexander flores caycho facultad de ingeniería, carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima, perú 20123253@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20170573@aloe.ulima.edu.pe carlos-augusto lizárraga-portugal research professors facultad de ingeniería, carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima, perú clizarra@ulima.edu.pe",
50,Finding Out The Issues Behind Predicament Of Sugar  Industry In Bangladesh: A Case Study On,"the sugar industry in bangladesh, historically a linchpin of its economy, has confronted significant challenges in recent years, experiencing sustained losses that affect its ability to contribute substantially to the nation's burgeoning economic landscape. this study is a dedicated effort to dissect the root causes of the sector's current predicament, utilizing robust research methods. primary data and information have been meticulously gathered from rajshahi sugar mills, forming the basis for a thorough analysis employing statistical tools such as fishbone diagrams, pareto charts, and 5 why root cause analysis. the results of this analysis unequivocally point to a pervasive lack of raw materials as the primary culprit behind the sector's downturn. additionally, the application of these analytical methods has unearthed other contributing factors that compound the challenges faced by the sugar industry in bangladesh. beyond merely highlighting these issues, the study takes a proactive stance by recommending specific corrective actions to address the identified problems. by presenting a comprehensive picture of the sector's struggles and proposing tangible solutions, this research aims to catalyze the revitalization of the sugar industry in bangladesh. the proposed measures, rooted in a thorough understanding of the statistical analyses, aspire to position the sector for renewed growth and a more substantial role in the nation's economic narrative.","the root cause, fishbone diagram, pareto analysis","In this comprehensive study, various statistical analysis tools are deployed with the primary objective of discerning the root causes behind the financial losses and subsequent shutdowns plaguing the sugar industry. The analytical framework included the construction of a fishbone diagram to systematically identify the predominant factors contributing to the industry's challenges. Subsequently, a Pareto chart is employed to highlight the critical few or root causes that demand immediate attention. To delve deeper into understanding these root causes, a 5 Why root cause analysis was conducted, unraveling the underlying issues and paving the way for targeted improvements. The research successfully pinpointed the fundamental reasons behind the industry's predicament, serving as the foundation for the proposed solutions. In addition to root cause identification, the study extends its contribution by recommending corrective actions aimed at ameliorating the overall situation. By combining these analytical tools, the research not only diagnoses the problems afflicting the sugar industry but also provides a roadmap for effective and sustainable solutions. The identified root cause of the challenges faced by the sugar industry is the shortage of raw materials, which significantly affects the entire production process and subsequently drives up production costs. This shortage hampers the mills' ability to produce large quantities of sugar within a short milling period. Compounding this issue is the fact that the industry operates under government ownership, with the selling authority firmly in the hands of governmental entities. The government's intervention in market control further exacerbates the problem, as producers are directed to withhold their sugar stocks for extended periods, anticipating better selling conditions during challenging times. Consequently, when these sugar stocks are eventually released into the market, the oversupply results in a decline in selling prices. In contrast, during times of ample raw material availability in the past, mills could produce significant sugar quantities, enabling them to both store and sell the product at higher market prices. However, in the current scenario of raw material scarcity, the mills face a dual challenge of insufficient production to meet market demand and the inability to store surplus sugar for strategic selling. This intricate interplay of raw material shortages and government market control underscores the complexity of the issues confronting the industry, necessitating a multifaceted strategy to address both the immediate production constraints and the broader market dynamics shaped by government directives. 548","rajshahi sugar mills tabassum afrin, nayan chakraborty, and md. rakibul islam department of industrial & production engineering rajshahi university of engineering & technology (ruet) rajshahi-6204, bangladesh tabassumafrin172@gmail.com, nayanchakraborty123098@gmail.com, rakib@ipe.ruet.ac.bd","References

53,Impact Of Base Beam Length On Piezoelectric Cantilever  Energy Harvesters: A Numerical Investigation,"the cantilever beam serves as a prominent choice for harnessing strain-based energy through piezoelectric materials. ongoing research is focused on enhancing the output power density from cantilever energy harvesters. most of the prior investigations have predominantly employed fully coated cantilever beams. however, due to the high cost associated with piezoelectric materials, it becomes necessary to explore the impact of altering the base beam’s length while keeping the piezoelectric material's length constant. this investigation aims to ascertain the potential for increasing the output power density using the same length of piezoelectric material. in this study, a comprehensive analysis was conducted, maintaining uniform thickness and width for both the base beam and piezoelectric material. the positioning of the piezoelectric material on the base beam was selected to maximize power output for a specific configuration. recognizing that the power output of a cantilever energy harvester is dependent upon the resonant frequency and optimal electrical load, this study also presents an analysis of these factors. it is found that an increase in the length of the base beam causes a corresponding rise in output power. particularly, tripling the length of the base beam yields a sevenfold increase in output power density.","energy harvesting, cantilever beam","This paper presents the impact of altering the base beam length on the output power density of piezoelectric cantilever energy harvesters, while maintaining a constant length of the piezoelectric material. The findings reveal a direct relation between the base beam length and the output power density, i.e., the output power density increases almost linearly with the increase of base beam length. A threefold increase in the base beam length leads to a sevenfold increase in output power density. Considering the significantly higher cost of piezoelectric material than that of the base beam material, the increase in base beam length can significantly reduce the cost of energy harvesting by improving the output power density. While higher base beam ratios can provide a higher power density, there is a 564","1 md. mohiuddin, 2 kazi mostafijur rahman,ph.d, 2zahir u. ahmed, ph.d, 1 lecturer, 2 professor in the department of mechanical engineering at khulna university of engineering & technology, khulna, bangladesh. 3riaz ahmed, ph.d. 3associate professor, department of mechanical engineering , the university of wisconsin, green bay, wisconsin-54311, united states.","References

54,Utilizing The Analytic Hierarchy Process For Decisionmaking In The Indonesian Marine Police: A Case Study,"within the indonesian national police, the marine police unit plays a critical role in the post-disaster context, providing vital assistance to communities affected by natural calamities, particularly those related to search and rescue operations (sar). to carry out their duties effectively, the marine police must have access to suitable resources, including appropriate ships. therefore, this study aims to identify alternative hospital ships that meet the criteria set by the marine police for their operations. to do this, the study uses the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) method to determine the relative importance of each criterion used to evaluate potential alternatives. by utilizing the ahp method, the marine police can make informed decisions on the selection of hospital ships that will be used for their search and rescue operations. ultimately, the goal of this study is to enhance the ability of the marine police to carry out their duties in protecting the safety and security of the indonesian people. once the calculations were completed based on the 4 established criteria and 13 sub-criteria, the most suitable option for the hospital ship for the marine police was determined and it is the ship 4 out of the other 4 alternatives.","police, hospital ship, ship selection","Building upon the identified need for additional maritime evacuation capacity to support disaster mitigation efforts, this research employed Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques to evaluate four potential hospital ship options for the Indonesian Marine Police Directorate (DITPOLAIR). Utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology, the study analyzed the ships based on pre-determined criteria and sub-criteria aligned with DITPOLAIR's mission and operational requirements. The analysis revealed that Ship 4 emerged as the most optimal choice with value 47.8%, demonstrating the highest overall score amongst the alternatives due to its superior cargo capacity, longer sea endurance, and ability to accommodate multiple helicopter types. This selection aligns with DITPOLAIR's objective of providing efficient and comprehensive disaster response capabilities during natural emergencies. Furthermore, the research highlights the critical role of MCDM tools in facilitating informed decision- making for complex public safety operations. The systematic evaluation framework employed in this study can be replicated for future ship acquisition processes within DITPOLAIR and other maritime safety agencies, ensuring mission-aligned investment in vital disaster response infrastructure.","in hospital ship selection for improved security and functional capacity panji pratama hendra surya industrial engineering department faculty of engineering university of indonesia depok, indonesia panjipratamahs@yahoo.com, panji.pratama11@ui.id farizal f department of industrial engineering faculty of industrial engineering university of indonesia depok, indonesia email: farizal@eng.ui.ac.id",

61,Computer Vision Based Automated Attendance   System Using Face Recognition,"face recognition technology has gained substantial attention owing to its diverse applications. one of the applications includes a face recognition-based attendance system which stands out the most among all the existing attendance systems because of its heightened security and time-saving capabilities. a face recognition system is the process of recognizing an individual based only on their facial traits. this paper proposes a real-time face recognition attendance system that validates the real-time monitoring of the process. opencv has been used to create a haar cascade classifier, which is used to recognize faces. the face recognition algorithm local binary pattern histogram (lbph) has been chosen in this system due to its robustness and better applicability in the real world. this proposed method can identify the faces of individuals effectively from various angles. the results prove the validation of the work through the monitoring of students' attendance.","smart, recognition, attendance, computer","of the class. Following this, the system autonomously identifies and recognizes students in the images, facilitating the recording of their attendance. The results demonstrate the validation of the work through the monitoring of students' attendance. This work involves capturing the student's image, face detection through pre-processing, feature extraction, and person recognition. In the domain of face recognition, the proposed system employs the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) algorithm and the Haar Cascade classifier. The LBP Algorithm utilizes a Histogram, thereby enhancing the precision of face recognition. It is seamlessly integrated with the Haar classifier, which harnesses machine learning algorithm. The Adaboost Learning algorithm selectively picks small features from extensive sets, thereby amplifying the efficiency of the recognition process. The Haar cascade method is chosen for face detection due to its robustness, while the LBPH algorithm is employed for face recognition. Conclusion The proposed automated attendance system applies the concept of Haar cascade and local binary pattern histogram algorithm for face recognition of students. Acquiring student images from the camera, preprocessing for face detection, extracting features, as well as recognizing individuals has offered an effective means for face recognition. The automated process not only reduces the workload on faculty members but also enhances the efficiency of the attendance tracking system. The findings affirm the validation of the work by monitoring students' attendance. The LBPH algorithm has been successfully implied due to its robustness to variations in lighting conditions and facial expressions, making it well-suited for real-time face recognition systems. Notably, the proposed system operates efficiently without necessitating high-end hardware specifications. This proposed system for attendance system allows face recognition in a controlled environment.","abu salman shaikat bharti school of engineering and computer science, laurentian university, canada skt047@gmail.com molla rashied hussein department of computer science and engineering, university of asia pacific, dhaka, bangladesh molla.hussein@gmail.com rumana tasnim, ahmed farhan department of mechatronics engineering, world university of bangladesh, dhaka, bangladesh rumana@mte.wub.edu.bd, farhan1@mte.wub.edu.bd ahsan md. sajid khan bharti school of engineering and computer science, laurentian university, canada anowar hossain mokhtar, md mizanur rahman department of mechatronics engineering, world university of bangladesh, dhaka, bangladesh 1118401522@student.wub.edu.bd, mizanur.rahman@mte.wub.edu.bd","REFERENCES

64,Applying Project Management To Digital  Marketing Platforms,"in this work, we focus on the application of project management processes to digital marketing platforms. the processes we are talking about are mainly oriented toward project charter, content planning, project content management, and finally wbs. according to the pmbok (project management body of knowledge) guide, the use of wbs (work breakdown structures) is extremely useful for breaking down a project into its constituent parts, facilitating evaluation work, ensuring better monitoring of project progress, and checking that final deliverables are in line with initial objectives. the key elements of this breakdown can be summarized as follows: (1) we can do something after the customer enters his email address ; (2) we can offer a coupon in exchange for an email address ; (3) we can do a demo to create a link between what the client wants and how the product can deliver that result ; (4) we can use the platform to find out whom the visitor is, or what they are interested in, and then direct them to the funnel that sells that thing ; (5) we can use the application funnel to entice people to buy the most exclusive high-end products. we can make a demo video of the new product, and then ask customers to join a waiting list for a chance to buy the product in the future. finally, (6) we can use the client’s feedback to learn how to better sell the product in the future.",digital marketing,,"professor afaf bensghir madeo laboratory, high school of technology med first university afafbensghir@gmail.com leila bakhti, phd student. madeo laboratory high school of technology, med first university bakhtileila90@gmail.com professor erramdani mohammed matsi laboratory high school of technology med first university m.erramdani@gmail.com",
65,Exploring The Barriers To Circular Supply Chain  Implementation In The Electric Battery Industry:,"the demand for electric batteries is rising in developing countries like bangladesh due to the increased demand for electric vehicles and energy storage systems. however, electric batteries contain toxic substances such as lead (pb) and sulphuric acid (h2so4) that are extremely detrimental to the environment. hence, sustainability is crucial for the electric battery industries (ebis). to make the supply chain circular, it is necessary to identify the underlying obstacles to implementing the circular supply chain (csc). this study aims to explore the barriers to implementing csc in bangladesh's ebis. related barriers were defined using the pestel (political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal) framework, and the contextual relationship among the identified barriers was developed using interpretive structural modelling (micmac i.e., cross impact matrix multiplication applied to classification technique), followed by a cause-effect analysis of the driving barriers to determine the root causes. lack of sustainable development planning, lack of knowledge about the environment, health, and future generations, lack of coordination among industries and supply chain partners, increased competition, lack of investment in technological innovation, and low quality of circulated products are the root causes of the driving barriers to implementing csc in bangladesh's ebis. government and supply chain partners in ebis must employ a comprehensive strategy for sustainable development. implementation of csc facilitates economic development, environmental enhancement, and job creation.",pestel framework,,"a perspective of developing country md. sajib milki department of industrial engineering bgmea university of fashion and technology dhaka-1230, bangladesh department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology dhaka-1000, bangladesh corresponding author: mdsajibmilki@gmail.com md. ariful islam department of industrial & production engineering rajshahi university of engineering & technology rajshahi-6204, bangladesh",

70,Study The Effect Of Wire Mesh Screen On Solar Chimney  Assisted Natural Ventilation System,"the application of a solar chimney is not restricted to electricity generation; it can also be used for building ventilation. it plays with a mechanism where solar energy is used to enhance the flow rate from the building. three different face areas (0.56 m2, 1 m2, and 2.25 m2) of solar chimney models are designed and developed in the mechatronics engineering laboratory at the world university of bangladesh. the solar heating system is replaced with an electric heating system, and the load is fixed from 1 kw to 2.5 kw, depending on the size of the chimneys. the model chimneys are also modified with a wire mesh screen so that the whole solid chimney can be used as a heat source. about 100 sets of experiments were carried out in the modified and traditional chimneys under different solid chimney heights and heat loads. the solid chimney heights are maintained from 0.30 m to 1.20 m with an increment of 0.30 m. the experimental results show that the volumetric flow rate varies from 0.005 m3/s to 0.014 m3/s depending on the heat load, solid chimney height, and face areas. the minimum volumetric flow rate of 0.005 m3/s was observed in the traditional chimney, whereas the maximum volumetric flow rate was 0.014 m3/s in the modified chimney. furthermore, the modified chimney also exhibits a higher exit air temperature. therefore, it can be concluded that the presence of wire mesh in the chimney enhances the flow rate (volumetric), which is approximately 50 to 80 percent higher than the flow rate in the traditional chimney.","solar chimney, wire mesh screen, ventilation, structural","A chimney model is tested with and without a solid-walled chimney under different heat loads. The model is also tested with and without a wire mesh screen. The maximum draft loss is observed at the model chimney when there is no solid wall chimney or wire mesh screen. In this condition, the air flow rate is also found to be very low compared to other conditions. Although the solid wall chimney enhanced the air flow rate significantly, the maximum air flow rate was observed when the model was introduced with a solid wall chimney and wire mesh screen. The outcome of the model indicates that the solar chimney with a mesh screen and a solid wall chimney has significantly enhanced the flow rate.","md. mizanur rahman, naheen ibn akbar, rezwan us salehen, rumana tasnim and salim sadman bishal, department of mechatronics engineering world university of bangladesh avenue 6 & lake drive road, sector: 17/h, uttara, dhaka - 1230 mizanur.rahman@mte.wub.edu.bd, naheeni.akbar@mte.wub.edu.bd salim.sadman@mte.wub.edu.bd mohammad mashud professor, department of mechanical engineering khulna university of engineering and technology (kuet) khulna, bangladesh mdmashud@yahoo,com",
71,Examine How A Turbine Ventilator Affects   Chimney Performance,"one typical passive ventilation arrangement is solar chimney-assisted ventilation. when a solar chimney is used on its own, there is very little potential benefit. solar chimneys are therefore always used in integrated setups. the determination of this investigation is to examine ventilation performance through the integration of a turbine ventilator and a solar chimney. to facilitate its integration with the turbine ventilator, a small solar chimney is suggested. by heating a solar chimney at a constant heat flux, its performance is investigated experimentally. larger air gaps and higher inclination angles were shown to yield better results. however, after the ideal values of air gap depth and inclination angle, the performance begins to decline. it is advised that the input aperture area be as a minimum twice as big as the outlet aperture area, even if there is no particular relationship between the two. through constant heat flux heating of the solar chimney and/or constant rotational speed of the turbine ventilator, we conduct experimental studies of the combined arrangement for ventilation. the findings show that the solar chimney with a revolving turbine ventilator has the optimum ventilation performance. the suggested solar chimney also demonstrates the potential to experience the flow reversal effect because it operates better without wire mesh than it does with it. all of those findings will be helpful in the construction of solar chimneys in the future, either for prediction or designation, in order to meet the ventilation demand.","solar chimney, ventilation, passive cooling","drawn from these three data is that incorporating wire mesh into the combination consistently results in worse performance compared to the same combination without wire mesh. This demonstrates that the wire mesh cannot improve the chimney's functionality. Althoug, Chu et al. (2012)[17], and Chu et al. (2014)[17] claim that the screen mesh enhanced the solar chimney performance by reducing draft losses. This effect was not observed in this research. This is because of the shape of the chimney. Chu et al. used a circular and square-shaped chimney, whereas in the experiment, a square convergent duct was used as a chimney model. In this case, the wire mesh adds 0.0153 0.0115 0.0126 0.0172 0.0092 0.0126 0.0000 0.0050 0.0100 0.0150 0.0200 Inlet volume flow rate (m3/s) SOLAR CHIMNEY ONLY SOLAR CHIMNEY & WIRE MESH SOLAR CHIMNEY & STATIC TURBINE VENTILATOR SOLAR CHIMNEY & ROTATING TURBINE VENTILATOR SOLAR CHIMNEY & WIRE MESH & STATIC TURBINE VENTILATOR SOLAR CHIMNEY & WIRE MESH & ROTATING TURBINE VENTILATOR 0.0263 0.0181 0.0217 0.0299 0.0136 0.0190 0.0000 0.0050 0.0100 0.0150 0.0200 0.0250 0.0300 0.0350 Inlet volume flow rate (m3/s) SOLAR CHIMNEY ONLY SOLAR CHIMNEY & WIRE MESH SOLAR CHIMNEY & STATIC TURBINE VENTILATOR SOLAR CHIMNEY & ROTATING TURBINE VENTILATOR SOLAR CHIMNEY & WIRE MESH & STATIC TURBINE VENTILATOR SOLAR CHIMNEY &WIRE MESH & ROTATING TURBINE VENTILATOR 718","md. mizanur rahman, enamul hoq, md. sadatuzzaman saagoto, protik barua and farhan mahbub department of mechatronics engineering world university of bangladesh avenue 6 & lake drive road, sector: 17/h, uttara, dhaka - 1230 email: mizanur.rahman@mte.wub.edu.bd, enamul@mte.wub.edu.bd, saagoto57@mte.wub.edu.bd, protik.barua@mte.wub.edu.bd, mahbub3@mte.wub.edu.bd mohammad mashud professor, department of mechanical engineering khulna university of engineering and technology (kuet) khulna, bangladesh email: mdmashud@yahoo,com","References

72,"Investigate How Inlet Geometry Affects Vortex Power  Md. Mizanur Rahman, Mustafizur Rahman, Masud Rana,","the energy demand is increasing day by day and putting pressure on traditional energy sources, which allows researchers to work on alternative energy sources. traditional energy sources and conversion technology are also under threat due to their environmental impact. one kind of environmentally friendly technology that generates power from vortexes created by gravity pulls is the gravitational water vortex power plant. because of its favorable effects on the environment and low hydraulic head need, this kind of power plant is desirable. however, a lack of literature and exposure held back the development of this technique. this study focuses on how the geometry of the penstock affects the power plant's efficiency. we developed an experimental configuration that resembles the low-head river and power plant. experiments revealed that an increase in the feeding breadth of the penstock decreased the power plant's efficiency. it was also discovered that the power plant's efficiency was mostly unaffected by the model's length for the penstock. the power plant's efficiency was determined to be at its peak when the ratio of the basin's diameter to the outflow diameter was within the range of 0.16 and 0.18. ultimately, the power plant's performance was determined to be enhanced by raising the inlet flow rate by the researchers. these results suggested that additional research on this technology is required to fully use low-head sites.","renewable energy, water vortex, alternative energy","Five different entrance flow rates were assessed on the laboratory-sized GWVPP with different penstock geometry and outlets connected. It was found that the GWVPP's efficiency will increase when the inlet flow rate is raised from 5.6 m3/hr to 8.8 m3/hr. Other than that, several hypotheses led to the conclusion that the GWVPP efficiency was barely affected by penstock models A, D, E, and F. More experiments were needed to validate the hypotheses. Conversely, it has been discovered that Penstock Models B and C, with their larger feeding widths, lower the GWVPP efficiency. The optimal diameter range for the prototype was found to be 64–72 mm at intake flow rates of 8.8–8.0 m3/hr. The maximum efficiency of 28.29% was attained with an output diameter of 72 mm and a penstock model D running at a flow rate of 8.8 m3/h. In conclusion, Mulligan and Hull (2010) advise that the output diameter be maintained at a ratio of 0.14 to 0.18 in the GWVPP design, but the feeding width for the penstock should be reduced. Furthermore, the inflow flow rate must be as high as practical given availability.

The following findings were reached from this work based on the Results and Discussion, and a trial was set up to figure out the various machining parameters on Wire Electrical Discharge. For performance measurements supported by Taguchi's optimization process, machining used molybdenum wire 0.25 mm in diameter. The optimized input parameter combinations to encourage minimal Surface Roughness are Pulse on 70 µs, Pulse off 7 µs, and Current 9 amps. Increased mechanical performance is a direct result of the decreased surface roughness and improved microstructural properties. In fabricating spur gears, combining the Taguchi method with SEM analysis has proven to be an effective strategy for optimizing the Wire EDM process parameters. This was achieved through the integration of both approaches. Additional studies could investigate the effect of various materials and intricate geometries on the Wire EDM manufacturing process and the resulting microstructure.","taguchi technique khondoker safin kaosar saad, md omar al javed, zayed ur rahman, tasfia saba, and adib bin rashid department of industrial and production engineering, military institute of science and technology (mist), dhaka-1216, bangladesh safin.kaosar@gmail.com",
74,Numerical Investigation Of Flax/Bamboo Fiber Reinforced  Hybrid Composites Under Tensile Load,"natural fibers are a more environmentally sustainable and cost-effective alternative to synthetic fibers. hybrid composites made from both natural and synthetic fibers have gained popularity due to improved mechanical properties and cost- effectiveness. in this study, we have investigated the mechanical behavior of flax/glass/epoxy and flax/bamboo/epoxy hybrid composites under tensile load utilizing finite element analysis (fea) software abaqus. flax/bamboo/epoxy hybrid composites were compared to flax/glass/epoxy composites using fea software to evaluate their layup configurations. the result reveals that flax/bamboo/epoxy composite deforms less than flax/glass/epoxy composite for the same layup patterns and force applied. the maximum modulus of elasticity of flax/bamboo/epoxy was found 8485.80 mpa which is better compared to the flax/glass/epoxy composite. so, it is possible to use flax, bamboo, and epoxy composites as a more affordable and eco-friendly option instead of flax, glass, and epoxy composites. the use of flax/bamboo/epoxy composites is a viable option in manufacturing various automotive parts like door panels, instrument panels, armrests, headrests, and seat shells.","hybrid composite, tensile properties, stacking sequence","The key findings of this research can be summarized as- • Maximum deformation is reduced by 20.08% and modulus of elasticity is increased by 24.73% for Models FB-1 and FB-2 which suggests that if the hybrid composite is designed like a sandwich structure then the structural stiffness as well as modulus of elasticity are increased. • The maximum von-Mises stress and maximum principal stress for Flax/Bamboo fiber reinforced hybrid composite is higher compared to Flax/Glass fiber reinforced composite which is due to the stiffness of the Bamboo fiber. However, minimum increase is observed for Models FB-1 and FB-2. • Bamboo fiber has the potential of replacing glass fiber as all the hybrid composites with bamboo fibers exhibit better mechanical properties in tensile test.","durjoy roy, md tahmid hasan, md shariful islam and md arifuzzaman department of mechanical engineering khulna university of engineering & technology khulna-9203, bangladesh durjoyroy18@gmail.com, tahmidhasan.kuet@gmail.com, msislam@me.kuet.ac.bd, arif48@me.kuet.ac.bd",
75,Development Of Lightweight Thermal Insulation Board:   A Study On Physical And Mechanical Properties Of,"this study focused on the development of thermal insulation boards by utilizing expanded perlite (ep) and expanded polystyrene (eps) within a lightweight core, in conjunction with a formica sheet serving as the exterior layer. the sandwich specimens were fabricated by employing epoxy resin as a binding material, with the volume fractions of ep and eps being adjusted. a detailed assessment was undertaken to evaluate the physical, mechanical, and thermal conductivity via lee's disc method. the core's flexural strength, modulus, and energy absorption were found to be superior when the ep volume fraction within it was at its ideal level of 100%. as predicted, there was a positive correlation between the thermal conductivity and the proportion of ep particles. significantly greater swelling and water absorption were seen in sandwiches composed of 100% ep compared to those composed of 100% eps. the introduction of ep particles into eps resulted in a reduction in facial wrinkling during flexural failure, as well as an enhancement in deboning and skin delamination. this research study presents significant findings on the behavior of composite materials, which has the potential to contribute to the advancement of thermal insulation technology.",a core,"In this work, lightweight sandwich structures were fabricated using expanded perlite and expanded polystyrene beads with varying proportions. The density, swelling thickness percentage, static flexural strength and modulus, energy absorption, failure behavior, and thermal conductivity of the composite structures were investigated. The findings of the study are summarized as follows: • The density of the sandwich structure has a proportional relation with the EP particles in the sandwich core due to the higher density of EP particles. • Due to higher EP content, it was found that the swelling and water absorption grew higher than that of EPS. The capacity to retain screws perpendicularly and to hold screws in parallel was observed to be lower for the 100% EPS specimen than that of 100% EP. • It was found from the flexural tests that as the EP percentage in the sandwich structures increased, the flexural strength, modulus, and energy absorption increased. With the blending of EP and EPS, cracking and deboning were increased in the specimens. • The long plateau after the peak in the stress-strain curves indicated the high energy absorption capability of the developed sandwich structures. • The flexural properties of sandwich panels including strength, modulus, and energy absorption along with thermal conductivity were significantly affected by the replacement of EPS particles with EP particles. However, the combination of 25%EP particles with 75% EPS particles proved to be an optimum mixer for the improvement in the mechanical characteristics. • The mixer of EP and EPS to manufacture lightweight sandwich structures showed a positive effect in terms of flexural and thermal insulation properties.

81,A Comparative Analysis Of Bangladesh'S Energy Emissions:  Implications For Carbon Neutrality And Sustainability,"in march 2022, bangladesh proudly achieved nationwide electricity coverage. predominantly reliant on fossil fuels, the nation's energy sector faces challenges due to global political crises and a dwindling supply of cleaner fuels like natural gas from domestic fields. consequently, the reliance on less environmentally friendly fuels such as coal and heavy fuel oil (hfo) has escalated, raising concerns about meeting sustainable development goal 7: ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy by 2030. this study fills a research gap by quantifying the electricity generated from various fossil fuels and the associated co2 emissions in bangladesh from fiscal year 2016- 2017 to 2022-2023. data sourced from the bangladesh power development board underpins our analysis, revealing natural gas as the predominant fuel for electricity generation, accounting for 58% of the total. other significant fuels include hfo, coal, and diesel. our findings show a stark emission landscape: in the last 7 years, to generate 74897 mwh of electricity, 10395 kilograms of natural gas resulted in 4.39 tons of co2 emissions, while hfo, coal, and diesel led to 8039165, 9950976, and 2743311 tons of co2 emissions, respectively. notably, coal combustion had the highest emission rate of 1892.586 kg of co2 per mwh of electricity generated. these insights offer a critical lens for policymakers to gauge the distance to carbon neutrality and sustainable energy goals. the evidence supports a strategic pivot towards renewable energy, ensuring that bangladesh's electricity growth trajectory remains sustainable and efficient.","fossil fuel, carbon emission, pollution, sustainability 786","This comprehensive analysis of Bangladesh's energy sector offers a critical perspective on the nation's journey towards achieving carbon neutrality and sustainable energy. While the milestone of nationwide electricity coverage marks a significant achievement for Bangladesh, the reliance on fossil fuels casts a shadow over the environmental sustainability of this progress. The study's findings lay bare the stark realities of the current energy mix and its implications for carbon emissions. The predominance of natural gas as the mainstay for electricity generation is a double-edged sword; it's a cleaner burning fuel yet is in dwindling supply domestically. The shift towards coal and HFO, while addressing immediate energy needs, propels the nation further away from meeting its commitments to international climate goals and Sustainable Development Goal 7. The high CO2 emissions from coal combustion, despite its lesser role in electricity generation, is particularly concerning, signaling an urgent need for policy interventions. This analysis has quantified the emissions from different fossil fuels, revealing that to generate a unit of electricity, coal produces the most CO2, followed by HFO and diesel, with natural gas being the least polluting. These findings point towards an imperative to reassess the current energy strategy. With the global community moving towards greener policies, the continuation of a fossil fuel-dependent energy framework may subject Bangladesh to economic and environmental vulnerabilities. The path to sustainability and the achievement of carbon neutrality demands a multi-pronged approach. It is imperative to increase investment in renewable energy sources, enhance energy efficiency, and develop a robust policy framework that supports a sustainable energy transition. It is also crucial to engage in international partnerships and seek climate finance opportunities to support this shift. Bangladesh's energy sector's future should be envisioned on the principles of sustainability, resilience, and inclusivity. Strategic planning and action today will ensure that the country's energy infrastructure is capable of supporting economic growth without compromising environmental integrity. As the nation moves forward, the insights from this study should inform a progressive energy policy that aligns with both national development and global sustainability objectives. By capitalizing on its renewable resources and adopting innovative technologies, Bangladesh can create a sustainable energy ecosystem that not only powers its economy but also contributes to a cleaner and more sustainable world. The journey towards carbon neutrality is challenging, yet it offers the opportunity for Bangladesh to lead by example in the South Asian region, demonstrating that economic development can go hand in hand with environmental stewardship.","shuvra majumder institute of energy technology, chittagong university of engineering and technology, chattogram, bangladesh email: shuvro.majumder60@gmail.com spandan basak payel, md. tanvir siraj department of mechanical engineering, bangladesh university of engineering and technology dhaka, bangladesh email: spandanbasak@gmail.com, tanvir25392@gmail.com mahbubur rahaman department of statistics, jahangirnagar university, dhaka 1342, bangladesh email: mahbubipe09@gmail.com md kamrul hasan chowdhury department of mechanical engineering, rajshahi university of engineering and technology rajshahi, bangladesh email: iitpeterson736@gmail.com",
82,Optimized Drone Navigation: Integrating Neural Networks  With Ant Colony Optimization For Precise,"the study of sophisticated route-planning techniques is a result of the increasing demand for quick drone delivery services. this study introduces a novel method that blends neural network predictions and ant colony optimization (aco). aco draws inspiration from the way ants use pheromones or smell trails to choose the optimal routes. this aids in determining effective distribution routes, as does the use of neural networks—computer models that learn from data. the affordability of the drone utilized in this study is an intriguing feature. with an arduino nano microprocessor and an mpu6050 gyroscope and accelerometer, the drone can fly steadily and affordably. data from google maps is included into these routes to make them more useful. roads, buildings, and shifting traffic patterns are examples of real-world difficulties that are considered. this method's eco-friendly approach is yet another important benefit. the drone minimizes its environmental effect while covering a greater area with less fuel thanks to its fuel-optimization system. this blended model's preliminary testing yields encouraging findings. this method provides higher fuel savings and faster delivery times than conventional routing approaches. this study offers a thorough analysis of this combination approach, emphasizing how it may become the new norm for reasonably priced drone delivery.",mpu-6050,"The dual strategy of combining NN with ACO solves a lot of the problems that drone delivery systems have historically encountered. In addition to providing accurate delivery time forecasts, it optimizes routing, increases safety, and increases energy economy. Because of this, the solution not only increases the effectiveness of the delivery process but also provides a greater degree of safety and dependability, overcoming a number of problems that previous drone delivery systems had. The evolution of autonomous drone deliveries has advanced significantly with the combination of ACO and NN, offering more effective and environmentally friendly last-mile delivery options.","and fuel-efficient delivery routes arnob paul, rafat ferdaush dept. of electrical and electronic engineering, shahjalal university of science and technology sylhet, bangladesh. arnob26@student.sust.edu, rafat59@student.sust.edu",

85,Interrelation Of Lipoprotein(A) Concentrations With The  Intensity Of Recurrent Coronary Strokes In Cad Patients,"cardiovascular diseases impose a major threat to public health in the developing world. bangladesh, in the midst of an epidemiological transition from communicable to non-communicable diseases, is witnessing a rising prominence of lp(a). while higher lp(a) is widely identified as a substantial threat for coronary artery disease (cad), it is not regularly assessed in clinical practice. an investigation of higher lp(a) levels in persons with ldl-c can aid in identifying the risk of cardiovascular disease. people at high risk for cad may be identified through evaluation for increased lp(a) when coupled with ldl-c. this study addresses the interrelation between higher levels of lp(a) and the risk of cad at a variety of ldl-c levels. the study was conducted at the bangabandhu sheikh mujib medical college hospital in faridpur, bangladesh which included 100 patients who were classified into low-lp(a) and high- lp(a) catagories. these groups have been compared with the frequency of mace and ace. one of the key findings demonstrate that ace and mace were higher in the high-lp(a), particularly when ldl-c was 1.4 mmol/l or higher, according to subgroup analysis that further subdivided patients based on ldl-c levels. nevertheless, the relation ceased to exist if ldl-c were below 1.4 mmol/l. in short, the results establish lp(a) as a viable noninvasive screening method for predicting cad and prompt the development of lp(a)-reducing therapies as an emerging concern.","cad, coronary strokes","Elevated Lp(a) levels are linked with repeated CAD, particularly in the presence of higher LDL-C levels. Nevertheless, it should be acknowledged that this correlation might differ in cases where LDL-C are exceptionally low. Patients who have both LDL-C values of 1.4 mmol/L or more and higher Lp(a) levels should be recognized as highly risky group. These patients necessitate extra interventions to lower LDL-C. Therefore, it is recommended that Lp(a) can be used as an alternative noninvasive diagnostic technique to forecast the degree of coronary artery blockages, thus allowing for its use before considering more invasive procedures. The study recommends that assessing Lp(a) levels can be beneficial in determining the risk level and planning personalized treatment, especially for individuals with distinct LDL-C and Lp(a) profiles. Furthermore, the request for future randomized studies emphasizes the necessity for more study to determine whether reducing Lp(a) levels can offer extra advantages in preventing cardiovascular events, particularly in individuals who have reached their LDL-C goals. This highlights the changing nature of cardiovascular risk evaluation and the significance of taking into account several indicators, such as both LDL-C and Lp(a), when providing treatment.","with assorted ldl-c levels hasnim naznin hima intern doctor bangabandhu sheikh mujib medical college hospital faridpur, dhaka, bangladesh hasnimhima122@gmail.com foyez ahmad department of mechanical and production engineering islamic university of technology (iut) board bazar, gazipur, dhaka, bangladesh foyezahmad@iut-dhaka.edu",

By varying pitch length, it was observed that lower pitch length provides better HER and 0.04m pitch length has the optimum heat transfer characteristics. Six (06) fins per turn of the GHE coil provided a HER of 184.844W, which decreases if the fin number is increased more than 6. Copper as fin material provided more satisfactory HER than aluminum and polyethylene. Moreover, increasing the fin length beyond 0.07m did not provide a satisfactory increase in the HER value. The HER increased by about 14.5% for the copper-made circular fin with 0.04m pitch length (Model-02) than without fin model.","using variable fin characteristics md aasef azhar khan department of mechanical engineering khulna university of engineering and technology (kuet) khulna, bangladesh email- khan.aasef@gmail.com merajul islam department of mechanical engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology (buet) dhaka, bangladesh email- merajulislam.me.kuet@gmail.com g m ismail hossain department of mechanical engineering lecturer, sonargaon university dhaka, bangladesh email- gmismail016@gmail.com torikul islam department of biomedical engineering new jersey institute of technology newark, nj, usa email- tp389@njit.edu",

This is the most popular method for estimating the frontier for assessment of efficiency. DEA may categorize yarn suppliers into effective frontiers and average frontiers, as well as identify role models. All effective frontiers result in a convex curve, while ineffective DMU`s lie inside the curve. Other Supplier can find their role models by determining the shortest distance from these effective frontiers. The frontiers that are less effective can understand the reasons why this is happening and how to become more effective. In addition to this, the management team can learn which supplier to prioritize over others while making cost effective decisions. As a result, this research is aimed at demonstrating the application of DEA through study, showcasing its potential to aid businesses in making well-informed and efficient supplier decisions.","dipon roy department of industrial engineering southern illinois university edwardsville, edwardsville, il 62026 dipon.roy2013@gmail.com imtiajur rahman department of industrial & production engineering shahjalal university of science & technology, sylhet, bangladesh imtiaz.aaman@gmail.com",

104,Elucidating Characteristics Of Porous Twisted Tape  Inserts On Heat Transfer In Internal Pipe,"heat exchange is a common operation in many processing industries, such as petrochemicals, refineries, pharmaceuticals, thermal, chemical, and integrated industries like food, dairy, and sugar. various passive techniques, such as twisted tape, hitrain wire matrix mold, and others, find extensive use, as they are inexpensive and simple to use. the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of utilizing a porous density (pd) twisted tape insert in place of a standard twisted tape on heat transfer performance. it is assumed that the fluid flow is turbulent, incompressible, and steady. the energy loss resulting from fluid motion is disregarded, but the flow and heat transfer processes are thought to be fully developed. the twisted tape inserts in the trial will have a twist ratio of 10 and a reynolds number range of 5,000 to 12,500. there will be three distinct densities of porosities in the twisted tape geometry such as highly dense, low dense, and without porosity twisted tape. solidworks was used to create the solid model's geometry, while ansys was used to create the fluid model and perform the simulation. the objective was to evaluate the hydrothermal performance of porous-density twisted tape inserts with varying perforation ratios in the tube, ranging from low to high density, in comparison to normal twisted tape.","heat transfer rate, nusselt number, nanofluid, friction factor","The study's main objective was to evaluate the effects of twisted tape inserts with a porous density (PD) on heat transfer efficiency in a closed conduit using numerical methods. Plain tubes, normal twisted tapes, and high and low porosity tapes were all compared in the study. Twisted tape inserts improved heat transmission and fluid mixing between the center and edge fluids by increasing circumferential velocity. In comparison to alternative inserts, high porosity twisted tape demonstrated superior thermal conductivity and produced lower temperatures. High porosity twisted tape had larger pressure drops, which expanded the pressure ranges. When considering various types of twisted tape with varying Reynolds numbers, high porosity tape consistently had higher Nusselt numbers. A higher friction factor and a higher pressure drop were observed in the high porosity twisted tape. According to the study, high porosity twisted tape outperformed low porosity and conventional twisted tape inserts in terms of efficiency, greatly enhancing the performance of the twin pipe heat exchanger. For high porosity twisted tape, the Particle Efficiency Coefficient (PEC) was highest over a range of Reynolds numbers. 0.000 0.200 0.400 0.600 0.800 1.000 1.200 1.400 5000 7500 10000 12500 Performance Evaluation Criteria (PEC) Re PEC High TT Low TT Regular TT 1010","flow of heat exchanger md radwanul kabir1, joy ganguly1, md sanney ul alam1, md. shariful islam1 1department of mechanical engineering, khulna university of engineering & technology, khulna-9203, bangladesh shuvo.redwan3.14159@gmail.com , joyganguly97.sghs@gmail.com , sanneyulalam.kuet@gmail.com , shariful05031@gmail.com","References

110,A Comprehensive Analysis And Ranking Of Barriers To  Implement Lean Practices In Chemical Management Of,"the leather tanning industry is essential to bangladesh's economy, significantly boosting employment and economic growth in the country. more than a million bangladeshis work in this sector, which provides chances for both skilled and unskilled labor.but the chemical management component of tanneries carries inherent hazards, hence existing approaches need to be reassessed and redesigned. however, there are significant obstacles to improving the tanneries' working conditions and productivity in the chemical management part. to develop productivity and safety, lean is an option that needs to be explored more widely in the tannery context. through interviews with industry expertsand a careful evaluation of the body of current literature, this study has identified potential barriers to starting lean practices in the chemical management of the production floorafter the literature review, the barriers are analyzed using the mcdm tool to rank them according to the collected data. the barriers will be ranked using the best worst method. in order to overcome these significant obstacles and enable the successful adoption of lean techniques for sustainable chemical management in bangladeshi leather tanning, policymakers, tannery owners, and development organizations can benefit significantly from the information provided by this study. 1051",,"Safe chemical management has become a clearly demanding topic for Bangladesh's tannery sector as a result of the industry's struggles to meet the demands of international brands and buyers due to its non-compliance with regulations regarding unsafe chemical handling, which results in the loss of customers, reputation, work orders, and negatively impacts the health of workers (Hossain and Hossain 2023). After reviewing many articles, the authors found that no specific studies have been done for lean implementation in chemical section as Lean production is one of the powerful transformations that has been widely explored and practiced by a meaningful number of organizations worldwide (Belhadi et al. 2018). Moreover, Lean offers various benefits for industry practitioners, such as preventing rework and addressing safety concerns in addition to enhancing customer satisfaction and meeting quality standards. Nevertheless, the benefits of Lean have not yet been well understood by industry practitioners for several reasons, such as the cost of using Lean tools or the lack of experience in Lean implementation (Demirkesen and Bayhan 2022). Thus this study focuses on identifying the major barriers for implementing successful lean practices in the chemical management, weighing and ranking them using MCDM’s Best-Worst method tool. Within this context, 8 main factors were identified such as successful communication, Stakeholders Cooperation, Environmental Performance, Technical Capabilities, Lack of management commitment, Organizational Policy, Operational issue, and Finance barriers that are liable for chemical management deviation in Bangladesh tanning industry. After finalizing the factors or barriers from literature review, few tannery industry experts were selected for their feedback about the selected barriers. In the context of Bangladesh, ‘Operational Issue’ was found to be the foremost barrier and ‘Organizational Policy’ was found to be the worst or least barrier to implementing Lean activity in the chemical section. The factor ‘Operational Issue’ means that the majority of the workers have inadequate knowledge in chemical storage and unloading due to the lack of training. Also, they have inadequate knowledge about every chemical operation and the consequences of poor chemical handling in the tanning industry. Moreover, solutions like development of organizational learning culture, early deployment of lean culture through training and allocation of sufficient time and resources for change are also important. The study consists of some limitations, the aforementioned claim can only be justified within the resources and time constraints in which this study was conducted. Firstly, feedback taken from the participants or industry experts to analyze were limited. Secondly, the research for leather industry is limited and that is why less research paper for lean implementation was found on different databases such as scopus, google scholar etc. This research can help other Bangladesh industries, such as textile, food processing, polymer, pharmaceuticals, and etc. adopt Lean practices in their manufacturing. All of these industries have substantial impacts on the environment and society. This research can help industrial managers and planners develop strategies to overcome these barriers. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Weights Input-Based CR 0.098 Associated Threshold 0.362 1057","leather tanning industries in bangladesh. md. mahfujul haq research assistant, susleather project department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka, bangladesh email- mahfuzipe.buet@gmail.com prof. dr. mohammad sarwar morshed professor, department of mechanical and production engineering leader, susleather project ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka, bangladesh email- m.morshed.mpe@aust.edu mongsathowai marma research assistant, susleather project department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka, bangladesh email- babumarma077033@gmail.com dr. abu hamja assistant professor, department of mechanical and production engineering deputy leader, susleather project ahsanullah university of science and technology dhaka, bangladesh email- abuhamja.mpe@aust.edu","References

111,User Acceptance Of Smart Mobile Resources In Vehicular  Technologies Based Upon User Experience And,"as society evolves to encompass new formats of mobile technologies. it can be observed in everyday resources such as vehicular mobile technologies. this is becoming increasingly evident and observable in resources such as driver assistance software, autonomous vehicles, navigation support, and driver security for accident prevention. to better understand user’s willingness to accept and subsequently adopt said automotive technologies, theoretical frameworks and acceptance models such as the technology acceptance model (tam), theory of plan behavior (tpb), perceived usefulness (pu) and perceived ease of use (peou) were utilized and reviewed throughout various studies. the outcome suggested that the more generalized, tam was widely utilized and accepted in terms of predicting user willingness to accept and adopt mobile technology in vehicular settings.","technology, acceptance, vehicle, user",,"comfortability: a research review tasfia bari m.s. & dr. munther abualkibash eastern michigan university - college of technology michigan, united states of america tbari@emich.edu & mabualki@emich.edu","References

112,Analysis Of Design Of Flowers And Honeybees In The  Pollination Process,"pollination is a crucial ecological process for the sustainment of both natural and agricultural systems. approximately 85% of flowering plants depend on animal pollinators for successful reproduction. over 75% of global food crops rely on pollinators, making them indispensable for sustaining human populations. the pollination process is accomplished by wind, water, insects, birds, bats, mammals, amphibians, and mollusks. the pollination process in angiosperms is robust because of the efficacious design features of flowers and pollinators. the axiomatic design offers a methodology to judge if a design is good or bad. this paper analyzes the design features of flowers and honeybees related to the pollination process. the functional requirements (frs) of components of a flower and a honeybee are tabulated and mapped onto nature-chosen design parameters (dps). the “independence axiom” of the axiomatic design methodology is applied to analyze couplings and to evaluate if the features of a flower and a honeybee form a good design (i.e., uncoupled design) or a bad design (i.e., coupled design). the analysis revealed that the flowers and honeybees are a good design to support pollination. this approach to judging whether nature’s entities are good or bad designs can be valuable for biomimicry studies. this approach can also be useful in teaching design considerations of biology and bio-inspired innovation.","pollination process, axiomatic design, nature design, design evaluation","In real-world designs, some DPs do multiple tasks. For example, a kitchen knife is used for peeling, cutting, chopping, dicing, slicing, mincing, separating tasks. Similarly, the mandibles of a honeybee located on the sides of the head act like a pair of pliers. The mandibles are used for any chores in a hive such as grasping or cutting wax to construct the comb, biting into flower parts (anthers) to release pollen, carrying detritus out of the hive, and gripping enemies during nest defense. In his case, many FRs are fulfilled by a single DP. This looks like a coupled design. Coupled designs are created when the number of DPs selected to satisfy a given set of FRs is less than the number of FRs. In an ideal design, the number of FRs and the number of DPs are the same. But a careful analysis will reveal that all FRs are not fulfilled at the same time. Honeybees use mandibles (single DP) to satisfy multiple FRs at different times. Therefore, it is not a coupled design, but an ideal design. Axiomatic design is a general design methodology that can be applied to evaluate the couplings of very small to very large systems. It can be applied to product design, service design, machine design, tooling design, software design, manufacturing system design, or logistics design. This paper focused only on the evaluation of the design features of a flower and a honeybee to test if the FRS and DPs are coupled or not. The analysis revealed that the anatomical features are uncoupled, and therefore it can be concluded that they are a good design.","pratap sriram sundar academic director and adjunct professor of operations management (migm and piilm) indian school of business mohali-140306, india pratap_sundar@isb.edu chandan chowdhury senior associate dean, practice professor and executive director (migm and pliim) indian school of business gachibowli, hyderabad 500111, ts, india. chandan_chowdhury@isb.edu sagar kamarthi* professor and director of data analytics engineering northeastern university 360 huntington avenue boston, ma 02115, usa s.kamarthi@northeastern.edu * correspondence: s.kamarthi@northeastern.edu; tel.: +1-617-373-3070",
