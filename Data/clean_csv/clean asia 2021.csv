0,Identifying Workers With Low Aptitude Toward Assembly  Tasks In Production Cells Based On General Aptitude Test,"major studies on cell production have placed an emphasis on technical factors such as machine order/layout, family part grouping, work-flow sequence, etc. however, it is still insufficient to investigate how human factors affect the productivity of production cells. although many companies have introduced cell production systems and realized that productivity of cells varies greatly with workers, there is no effective measure to access workers’ aptitude toward to assembly tasks in production cells. in order to assess the impact of workers’ aptitude on productivity, we have made a series of experimental studies and clarified that there are about 6% of workers who have very low aptitude and can be considered not suitable to assembly tasks in cell production. meanwhile, intending to find the worker’s aptitude closely relating to her/his productivity, we designed a laboratory experiment, and administered 11 paper-and-pencil tests of the japanese general aptitude test battery (gatb) to the workers to measure their seven work-related aptitudes. after examining the partial correlations between the workers’ gatb scores and their productivity, we have clarified that the gatb scores can’t directly measure a worker’s aptitude towards the assembly tasks in production cells, but we could apply principal component analysis to obtain a component score that correlates significantly with the workers’ productivity in cell production. however, this component score still can't be used to measure workers’ aptitude perfectly, in particular it can’t be used to identify the workers with very low aptitude. this paper intends to propose an effective classification model to identify the workers with very low aptitude based on workers’ gatb scores. we pay special attention to make several new contributions to cell production research through the following examinations: (1) based on workers’ gatb scores, we apply linear discriminant analysis and decision tree to construct several classification models and demonstrate that these models can’t identify the workers with very low aptitude with acceptable accurate. (2) as the number of workers with very low aptitude is much less than the workers else, we treat this identifying problem as a classification problem on class imbalanced datasets. we apply random forest method to construct a classification model and examine its effectiveness, as well as the best choice of the parameters. (3) we investigate the relationship between the detailed aptitude scores or standard aptitude scores of gatb and the workers’ classification, and clarify the aptitude scores that have a heaver impact on the classification. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harbin, china, july 9-11, 2021 © ieom society international 1",,,"battery score yanwen dong cluster of science and technology fukushima university fukushima city, japan dong@sss.fukushima-u.ac.jp jiali du graduate school of symbiotic systems sciences and technology, fukushima university fukushima city, japan s2070033@ipc.fukushima-u.ac.jp",

2,Investigation Of Comparability Over Time Of Data And Its  Impact On Credit Rating Model,"almost all of statistical models and machine learning models are to be built based on a known dataset (learning dataset) that was collected from past or other regions/domains. the precondition for applying these models to new instances is that the data of the new instances are comparable to the learning dataset. the comparability between the new instances and the learning dataset has also a strong impact on the performance of statistical models and machine learning models. there are mainly three types of comparability: comparability over region (geographical comparability), comparability over other domains and comparability over time. comparability over time refers to the extent to which statistics are comparable or reconcilable over time. in particular, some social or economic indexes are affected clearly by changes over time of economic or social phenomena, comparability over time is an important aspect to improve the quality of various models in the social and economic fields. as major studies have put the emphasis on analysis methods or algorithms, there are lacks of researches dealing with comparability over time. this study intends to address the issue of comparability over time, our emphasis is put on (1) proposing a method to assess the comparability over time among datasets collected in different periods; (2) clarifying the impact of comparability over time on statistical models through examining how the performance of statistical models changes when the extent of comparability between the learning dataset and fitting datasets is different. as an example of statistical models, we consider the credit rating problem of japanese regional banks. we collect financial indicators of japanese regional banks in 2012 (r2012), 2015 (r2015) and 2017 (r2017) respectively, conduct the following examinations and make several new contributions to data analytics research: (1) there are no researches published to assess comparability over time, this study is to demonstrate that the number of variables with significantly different means or/and variances can provide a measure to assess to which extent that the two datasets are comparable. (2) we apply linear discriminant analysis (lda) method to construct two credit rating models based on the r2012 (model a) and r2015 (model b) respectively, and then use these two models to obtain the credit rating for each bank in r2017. through comparing the forecasting results of model a and model b, and examining the extent of the comparability among these three datasets, we can clarify the impact of comparability over time on the performance of credit rating models. (3) as a data preprocessing tool, data normalization has been applied widely in various fields. the main goal of data normalization is to guarantee the quality of the data, scale the data in the same range of values for each feature in order to minimize bias for one feature to another. in this study, we propose a proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management harbin, china, july 9-11, 2021 © ieom society international 5",,,"jiali du graduate school of symbiotic systems sciences and technology, fukushima university fukushima city, japan s2070033@ipc.fukushima-u.ac.jp yanwen dong cluster of science and technology fukushima university fukushima city, japan dong@sss.fukushima-u.ac.jp",
3,Utilizing Various Statistical Models On Time Series  Temperature Data,"this stem paper will study the time series data file raleigh temps.jmp in the jmp sample library, which contains maximum monthly temperatures measured in degrees fahrenheit from 1980 to 1990. the objective of this paper is to forecast the raleigh temperature for 1990 to 2010. among the four stem components, the science studied is climatology or the study of the earth’s weather patterns; technology is used to predict the raleigh max monthly temperature for the next twenty years; engineering focuses on comparing different statistical models on the time series data, and mathematical tools like statistics are applied. most traditional and modern data mining platforms can visualize the data distribution, normal quantile, normal mixture, outliers very well, detect process capability and process stability, build multiple regression model and identify month as the main factor, detect clusters or principal components through eigen analysis, and use neural network or partition trees to build the transfer function profiler. the major findings among these non-time series platforms are that there is month to month cyclic behavior within each year but no year-to-year trend pattern is detected. however, there are several limitations among these non-time series platforms. it cannot decompose the seasonal component (cyclic month-month) from the trend component (year to year), cannot determine the relative strength of the “seasonal” and “trend” components, cannot determine the optimal smoothing setting if the curve is highly modulated, and cannot forecast or predict future points. jmp time series and forecast platform were further used on the same time series data file. the time series decomposition statistics were utilized to separate the seasonal component from the trend component, and the smoothing technique cleaned the forecasting error. seasonal lag was detected and confirmed by the autocorrelation function (acf) plot and variogram plot. the time series forecast platform can help predict raleigh temperature for 1990 to 2010 based on the 1980 to 1990 data. authors are also continuing this time series stem project on the following areas – decomposition and smoothing statistics, non-seasonal and seasonal arima models, and forecasting and prediction interval statistics. time series analysis is not just popularly used in finance forecasting but also powerful for predicting any future uncertainty from the time series data.","time series, forecast, statistics, climatology","The STEM approach is adopted on analyzing the Time Series data file regarding the Raleigh Temperature records from 1980 to 1990.

4,Studying The Antarctic Glacier Melting Rate Through Time  Series Decomposition And Smoothing,"this stem paper will study the time series antarctic glacier mass from april 2002 to march 2021. the objective of this paper is to forecast the antarctic glacier mass level for 2021 to 2041. among the four stem components, the science studied is the geoscience of glaciers, technology included is the grace-fo satellites to collect glacier ice sheet mass data, engineering focuses on the covid-19 impact on the glacier melting rate, and mathematical models like time series decomposition and smoothing were implemented. several time series decomposition methods such as the detrended, season-adjusted, and differencing were utilized to detect the strength of time series “trend” and “seasonal” components. 12-month seasonal pattern and long-term year to year trend were significantly observed. although the glacier meting rate sped up recently before 2020, the covid-19 situation has slowed down the rate of glacier melting in 2020 in both antarctic and greenland. smoothing models were also utilized to smooth out the random noise component to enhance the forecasting model. several smoothing models were compared using their forecasting capability regarding both the trend and seasonal components. the prediction interval for forecasting glacier mass for 2021 to 2041 would become too wide to predict the future glacier melting rate for more than 5 years in advance. this stem time series analysis methodology can be commonly applied to any time series data in several fields such as climatology, geoscience, finance, economics, production quality, real estate.","time series, forecast, geoscience, glacier","The STEM approach is adopted on analyzing the Time Series Glacier Mass data file from 2002-2021.

14,The Correlation Of Motivation On Achievement In English  Language Among Selected Secondary Schools Students In,"in learning the second language, motivation is always regarded as one of the vital elements. motivation drives human to determine how to react to certain situation and to behave. this present quantitative study adapted dornyei’s l2 motivation self system (l2mms) to determine the type of motivation among selected school students in seremban, to study the different types of motivation based on gender and to analyse the correlation between all types of motivation and students’ achievement in english language achievement among 30 students selected randomly from schools in seremban district. the study found that the l2 learning experience is the type of motivation among the students followed by ideal l2 self and ought-to l2 self. the study also revealed that both male and female students scored the highest level of ideal l2 self motivation, a moderate level of ought-to self motivation and the lowest level of l2 learning experience type of motivation respectively. it was also found that there was a positive correlation between the ideal l2 self type of motivation and students’ achievement in the english language. however, there was no correlation between the l2 learning experience and ought-to self types of motivation and students’ achievement.",l2 motivation,"This pilot test aimed to investigate the correlation between motivation and students' achievement in the English language using the PT3 public examination among the form four students from selected schools in Seremban. In conclusion, the findings of the present study lend empirical support for the correlation between motivation and students’ achievement. This supports the motivation theory by Gardner (1959) and L2 Motivation Self-System by Dörnyei (2005) that motivation “plays a vital role in stimulating learners’ interest towards the target language thus improve the proficiency in the target language” (Nguyen, 2018). The findings depicted three important points; the L2 learning experience motivated the participants the most, there was no significant difference between male and female respondents pertaining the type of motivation and there was a correlation between the Ideal L2 Self type of motivation and students’ English Language achievement. More comprehensive investigations based on this study can be done for future research. This study can be extended by including social economic factors as factors that influence learners’ academic achievement. Other subjects, other than English language can be examined too. It would also be interesting to know other age groups’ type of motivation based on gender.

15,"The Variation Of Energy Consumption And Economic  Impact In Regards Of Location, Building, And System Type","there is an increasing awareness of the importance and cost of the thermal comfort of buildings’ occupants. for those who live in a hot climate, demand for cooling systems is rising. researches showed that during the hot seasons in the united arab emirates (uae), the increased usage of cooling systems results in increased use of energy consumption up to 70%-79% excessive amount of normal energy consumption. because of such high-energy demands, there is an apparent expansion of the consequential economic impact countrywide. it has thus become essential to study the economic impact of air conditioning systems in the uae. this research applies life cycle cost analyses on air conditioning systems under four major factors: (1) outside climate, (2) building type from the respect of elevation difference, (3) type of air conditioning systems, and (4) the distinctions among different brands of air conditioning systems. a mixed method research approach was considered that includes field observations, interviews with experts, document review, and mathematical/numerical data generation. statistical analysis was applied together with the analytical hierarchy processes (ahp) techniques. results included developing decision-making for selecting the most suitable air conditioning system regarding the total cost of the lifecycle span determined against the listed four assessment factors. results also showed that humid coastal areas are more demanding in terms of air-conditioning energy consumption compared to an internal dry area.","air-conditioning, energy consumption, economic impact","The current work studied the influence of multiple variations of indoor air conditioning systems in regards to climate – as indicated by geographical location, type of buildings in terms of height, type of cooling cycles based on air or water type of cooling agent, in addition to the variation in design concepts for different manufacturers. Data was collected in sequential steps through documents review, field observations, and expert informants’ interviews. The research is intended to fill the current literature gap in regards to best selection of in-door air-conditioning systems given the stated varying parameters. From the statistical tests and their interpretation, it could be concluded that three of the studied factors have a significant effect on the total price of the life cycle cost of air conditioning systems per power consumed; which are: 1) type of buildings in terms of height, 2) type of cooling cycles based on air or water type of cooling agent, and 3) the variation in design concepts for different manufacturers. In the other hand, influence of climate – as indicated by geographical location, on energy consumption and thus on operational cost, have no significant effect on the total price of the life cycle cost of air conditioning systems per power consumed.

16,Assessment Of An Accidental Liquified Petroleum Gas Release At A  Petrochemical Site: A Case Study,"the oil and gas industry is currently undergoing major changes in technology, and as a result of the increasing demand for energy, it is still a major source of risk, and therefore risk assessment of this type of industry is crucial to ensure the safety of people, equipment and the environment protection. this assessment contributes to better management by reducing these risks and implementing an adequate prevention and protection strategy to achieve the objectives of the hse (health, safety and environment) management system. this study consists of a quantitative assessment of the risks associated with an lpg storage and distribution station, by proposing a risk assessment approach that allows the analysis of the various accidental sequences that may occur following an accidental release of lpg and the modelling of their consequences. we would like to specify that the initiating event is a complete and instantaneous rupture of the line, and thus a loss of containment of an important quantity of liquefied gas. smaller, medium and large leaks are also studied. it was found that the main failure modes for the lines are: external leakage, plugging and deformation or corrosion (without leakage or plugging). the main causes of these failures are mechanical failures (typically due to a combination of overload) and inadequate design and corrosion. it should be noted that external aggression and human error are also possible causes of these failures. according to the analysis carried out by the event tree, the hazardous phenomena are an unconfined vapour cloud explosion (uvce)/flash fire, pool fire, jet fire and dispersion of the toxic cloud to the atmosphere/pollution. the scenario of dispersion of the toxic cloud to the atmosphere was not the subject of our study. as a result of this application and for small leaks, the phenomenon of pool fire, uvce / flash fire and jet fire are considered tolerable due to their low frequency of occurrence despite having high frequencies of occurrences > ft = e -5/ year (alarp principle). the phenomenon of vaporization of the butane pool can also be tolerated in the case of a medium or large leak due to their weak effects, on the other hand this phenomenon is considered unacceptable in the event of slick ignition. in the case of medium and large leaks, uvce / flash fire and jet fire phenomena are considered unacceptable due to their height consequences (effects), despite their low frequency of occurrence (1.28 e-5 and 3.2 e -5 / year respectively for medium leaks and 1.092 e-5 and 1.82 e -5/year respectively for large leaks). the results of the identified high-risk scenarios were modelled using the aloha simulator, and subsequently, we identified the areas exposed to different accidental effects such as: thermal, toxic and overpressure effects… this modelling was also used to develop or update the response structure and emergency plans.","risk analysis, lpg leakage, major accidents",,"aila imane, chettouh samia and haddad djamel laboratory of research in industrial prevention institute of health & safety universiy of chahid mostepha ben boulaid batna 2 batna, algeria imane.aila@univ-batna2.dz, samia.chettouh@yahoo.com, d.haddad@univ-batna2.dz",
17,Needs Analysis:  A Japanese Language Learning Module Of  University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (Uthm),"reports show that the japanese language achievement among malay students at universiti tun hussein onn malaysia (uthm) is less impressive. this problem is due to the less attention given to the psychological factors, purpose, background, and the need to learn the japanese language. thus, this study aims to identify the relationship between motivation and students’ achievement based on the approach of the l2 motivational self system (l2mss) and appropriate learning materials based on the analysis of learning needs. this quantitative study involved 73 samples of level 1 japanese language students. the results of the survey found that the students were influenced by curriculum factors, teachers, peers, and teaching materials. the students also have a high imagination towards the native speakers. besides, based on the analysis of learning needs, it was found that the theme of communication that focuses on conversations with native speakers and travel activities is the dominant factor chosen by the students. based on this feedback, a proposed syllabus has been introduced to meet the needs of students learning the japanese language at uthm.","motivation, l2mms","This study shows that in general, students have motivation in learning the Japanese language introduced by Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). The results of the analysis also explain that students have a high tendency towards motivational factors for the L2 Learning Experience dimension where students are influenced by situations that are specific to curriculum factors, teachers, peers, and teaching materials. Furthermore, although the relationship between student achievement and motivational factors is moderate, it further targets the dimensions of The Ideal L2 Self as students' imagination as native speakers. Researchers believe that a comprehensive analysis of Japanese language learning needs has been translated into a new approach in the preparation of teaching and learning materials. Besides, it can generate teachers' thinking to create teaching goals, curriculum, syllabus, preparation of appropriate teaching plans while adopting the best teaching methodology. Indirectly, the effectiveness of the teaching and learning process can be achieved in a more conducive environment.

25,The Effect Of The Use Of Influencer On The  Purchase Decision Of Msme Culinary,,,"were obtained in this study. Several conclusions can be drawn which are expected to provide answers to the problems formulated in this study, namely as follows: Based on the descriptive analysis that has been done by the researcher on the respondents' responses to the influencer variable, the calculation results are 88%, and on the continuum line it can be seen that the score is included in the very high category. This shows that the selection of @keanuagl as an influencer to promote the “Kripik Belings”, is right. Based on the descriptive analysis that has been carried out by researchers on respondents' responses to the dependent variable, namely purchasing decisions, the calculation results are obtained by 58% and on the continuum line it can be seen that the score is included in the sufficient category. According to Adhimurti & Gabriella (2019: 56) stated that social media influencers do indeed affect the purchasing decisions of Generation Z consumers, but found other variables (independent/X) that also influence consumer purchasing decisions (dependent/Y), including the quality of influencer content, image influencer, reach shown through the number of followers, likes, and comments, resonance shown through share, and relevance shown through the similarity of the influencer's profile with the respondent's personality. Based on the results of the coefficient of determination of the influence of the use of influencers on the purchasing decisions of “Kripik Belings”,, it can be seen that the value of the coefficient of determination of R square in this study is 0.352 or 35.2%, which means that the variable use of influencers influences purchasing decisions by 35.2%. While the remaining 64.8% is influenced by other variables or factors not examined in this study. For business owners, it is better to The company is expected not to be complacent in carrying out the strategies that have been carried out. Influencers are indeed able to improve purchasing decisions, but on the other hand, there are many factors that make consumers decide to make a purchase, so that the “Kripik Belings”, should be able to pay attention to these other factors, such as the content presented by the influencer, and whether the image of the influencer is in accordance with the intended consumer. Although the influencers used by kripik belings are on the rise and can influence consumers to make purchases, they should not be used as the only marketing communication strategy to promote their products. The selection of the @keanuagl influencer has been rightly done by kripik belings, but there is nothing wrong with increasing offline promotions in order to get balanced results, which can influence consumer purchasing decisions.",,
26,Development Of Risk-Based Standardized Wbs (Work  Breakdown Structure) For Mechanical And Electrical Works,"the construction of a coal-fired steam power plant in indonesia has a high urgency to be realized in a short period. however, many significant factors arise during mechanical and electrical works that cause delays. therefore, contractors need to plan the project carefully by anticipating all possibilities to minimize potential delays. with wbs, delay risks can be identified in smaller elements up to the resources level to avoid project time overrun effectively. this study aims to develop a risk-based wbs standard to improve mechanical and electrical works' time performance in coal-fired steam power plant construction projects. data was collected using questionnaire surveys from contractors involved in coal-fired steam power plant construction projects and analyzed using the delphi method and qualitative risk analysis. the result of this study is a wbs standard for mechanical and electrical works of a coal-fired steam power plant construction project that contains the scope of works up to 8 levels. this study also identifies 47 responses of the 13 highest risks which affect project time performance as input for risk- based standardized wbs development to prevent, reduce, or eliminate possible events that can delay the completion of the construction project.","wbs standard, risk factors","The result of this study can be concluded as follows: • The standardized WBS for mechanical and electrical works of the CFSPP construction project were decomposed into eight levels. Level 0 is the system as the main deliverable, namely ≥ 50 MW CFSPP (PC Boiler type). Level 1 is the sub-system grouping of the CFSPP. Level 2 is sub-sub-system grouping, namely the breakdown from the previous sub-system. Level 3 is the project phase grouping. Level 4 is discipline grouping in each phase. Level 5 is the sub-work of each discipline. Level 6 is the work package. Level 7 is the activity in producing each work package based on the selected method and design. Lastly is level 8, which is the resource breakdown from each activity. • Risks that affect the performance of mechanical and electrical works of the CFSPP construction project were then identified from the WBS standard, with a total of 89 risk events. The 13 highest risks were determined based on survey results and experts validation. Those consist of the two highest risks in the work package category; the two highest risks in the alternative method/design category; the two highest risks in the activity category; the two highest risks in the materials resource category; and the two highest risks in the tools and techniques resource category; and one highest risk in the environmental category. • From the highest risks, 28 preventive actions and 19 corrective actions were formulated in response to these risks. These risk responses then became additional or recommended activities which, if implemented, can prevent or reduce the impact of risk events that can cause project delays. The risk-based WBS standard serves as the basis in project planning and controlling the time performance to achieve project goals completed on time.","of coal-fired steam power plant construction project in indonesia to improve time performance adnin fairuzy putri, leni sagita riantini, and yusuf latief department of civil engineering universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia adninfairuzy@gmail.com, leniarif@gmail.com, yusuflatief73@gmail.com",
27,Development Of Risk-Based Standardized Wbs (Work  Breakdown Structure) For Civil And Structural Works Of,"the coal-fired steam power plant development project has a crucial role in encouraging economic growth. the coal- fired steam power plant is a complex epc project that often experiences delays in its completion. one of the factors influencing delays is scope changes. the delay of this coal-fired steam power plant project can be overcome with a clear scope through the approach of project management tools, called wbs. this study aims to the development of risk-based standardized wbs for civil and structural works of coal-fired steam power plant construction projects in indonesia to improve time performance. work breakdown structure is a decomposition of activities so that the project is easier to manage, and it can increase the probability of project success. the development of wbs standards using expert surveying and validation methods includes the highest risks affecting project time performance. the standard wbs for civil and structural works of the cfspp project consists of 9 levels and 14 dominant risks to time performance. the recommended risk response is preventive and corrective measures to analyze the impact of dominant risks on-time performance.","wbs, risk factor, time performance","The purpose of the first research shows the results of the development where the CFSPP as System Level 0 will form the WBS level into 9 levels. The development of this standard WBS can assist managers in project planning and control. The second objective of the research resulted in 14 dominant risks and the highest risk score was obtained from the work package category at Level 7 WBS. The third research objective shows that there are 33 preventive actions and 29 corrective actions which are then grouped into 5 categories. Each additional risk response cannot be adopted directly into the WBS structure but can be a prerequisite as an additional management or work plan requirement in this study. Recommendation additional prerequisites/response actions depend on the policies and decisions of the company or project to what extent it wants to control the work. The standard risk-based WBS can be used as the basis for time planning to assist project implementation. In addition, a risk-based WBS can be developed to minimize the impact of each risk, such as delayed work, design changes, to imperfect work results.","coal-fired steam power plant construction project in indonesia to improve time performance veriza agistin, leni sagita riantini and yusuf latief department of civil engineering universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia verizaagistin14@gmail.com, leniarif@gmail.com, yusuflatief73@gmail.com",

All in all, this paper concluded that by improving strategic suppliers and strengthening communication among construction parties are very crucial especially to logistic process in construction project to bridging the gap to improve logistics performance. By reviewing the interview data, it seems like there is still a room for improvement to establish their supply base and communication system. They were still bound by the adversarial character of the conventional construction working culture. Thus, it will require all parties in the project to implement the changes. It is time for them to shift their perspectives and attitudes. These phenomena that have been discovered will require an in-depth exploration to extend and understand its capability and ability for future improvement. More players in construction industry views on the same background should be applied for future report.

30,"Failure Modes, Effects, And Diagnostic Analysis (Fmeda) Of Esd Valves  In Oil And Gas Industry","the safety instrumented system (sis) is an automated system used to implement one or more safety instrumented functions. a sis, like the emergency shutdown (esd) system, consists of any combination of sensor(s), safety plc(s) and final element(s) (e.g. esd valves). esd valves are the last line of defense against risks, although the esd valve has high performance, the data (based on expert judgment and oreda database) indicates that esd valves failures are the most critical in the esd systems. in order to improve the reliability and safety of these valves, we applied the fmeda diagnostic technique. we started with a decomposition of the esd valve to the subsystems and we identified their functions. then we described the failure modes, their mechanisms, their sites and their effects. then we identified the impact of each failure mode according to the criticality classes and identified the failure rates and their class according to the criticality and the detectability by automatic diagnosis of each mode and from the failure rates we calculated the safe failure fraction (sff) and safety integrity level (sil) required and we concluded that the actuator subsystem is the most critical system. finally, we proposed preventive and protective measures to eliminate or reduce the risk of failure.","esd system, esd valve",,"omar bensmaine, rachid naït-saïd and fatiha zidani laboratory of research in industrial prevention institute of health & safety university of chahid mostepha ben boulaid batna 2 batna, algeria o.bensmaine@univ-batna2.dz, r.naitsaid@univ-batna2.dz, f.zidani@univ-batna2.dz",
31,Digitalization Of Steel Plant Operations,"modern steel operations demand more than traditional automation and supervisory systems in order to push higher the levels of efficiency and optimization. the impact of digitalization is reshaping this industry. data insights are now available for the optimization of the operations, digital vision systems span from surface defects detection to online inventory updates. the capabilities of the shop floor personnel can be augmented by ar and remote assistance. all these create new paradigms and new tiers where more efficient and more profitable companies are moving to. the paper introduces some aspects of the fourth industrial revolution, including two case studies.","digitalization, operations, maintenance, steel plant","Steel mill operation requires a fundamental redesigning in the age of modernization. Both the shop floor and manage- ment units share how inefficient worksite performance-rooted from inadequate data resources and minimal techno- logical intervention. On the other hand, the line automation and regular ERPs generally utilized in the production processes lag behind time as they have a fair share of feature limitations. Further opportunities in streamlining opera- tional procedures in L3 units and management are inexistent, creating gaps across all corners. Digitalization frame- work interfaced with industrial IoT evolutions that evolve in the face of up-to-date programming software embedded with sensor capabilities, visualization, and data analytics paved the way to bridging the issue. Through securing up- to-date ERPs and technological innovations, there resides an improvement in collaborative insight generation among the units of the workforce.

32,Material Selection Of A Tri-Adjustable Automated Heavyduty Handling System Designed On Industry 4.0 Principles,"over the years, many south african industries have been using forklift trucks to move bigger loads from one point to another till today. the use of large forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing processes poses ohs risks to workers as its internal combustion engine (ice) produces fumes (carbon monoxide, co) when in operation and exhaust fumes, (co), are harmful to human’s health. on this basis, a new system design is recommended to eliminate the use of mhs that relies on ice power source to prevent ohs risks in indoor manufacturing industries. in this project, autodesk inventor professional software was used for design development of technical drawings and simulation as well as validation of the new system’s structure. vehicle dynamics’ principles and equations are used to determine the overall rolling resistance, tractive effort of the new system, wheel torque, and the power required to drive the system under 20 – ton load capacity. the new system design has been developed to operate using a hydraulic power pack source, where it consists of four hydraulic wheel hubs for driving the system, four hydraulic cylinders for lifting & lowering, and a double rod end hydraulic cylinder for steering. electro- hydraulic circuit systems were developed and proposed using electronics and fluid mechanics phenomena. again, principles, laws and equations of strength of materials has been carried out for validation of the material selection of the new design system’s structure as well as verifying buckling, deflection & bending stresses, and moments. the size and type of a material handling system (mhs) and/or equipment influences the effectivity of the internal logistics within manufacturing industries. therefore, it is very essential to choose a correct mhs for a correct manufacturing process which requires material handling to complete its operation. incorrect usage or selection of an mhs for an operational process may lead to down time, damage to facility, increase in operating costs and/or pose occupational health and safety (ohs) risks to workers.","manufacturing, hydraulics","In conlusion, main objective of this research has been achieved through the design and development of the new proposed Material Handling System that is capable of replacing the use of very big forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing companies. Large forklift trucks rely on Internal Combustion Engine power source which unfortunately poses health risks to workers. ICE produces exhaust fumes (Carbon Monoxide) while running. Exhaust fumes are harmful to human health (Apple, 1972) & (Health & Safety, 2008). Therefore, the research beacame a success whereby a new proposed MHS has been designed using Autodesk Inventor Professional and material selection of the new design system’s components has been carried out and verified in relation with their strength & reliability properties and high strength properties. Technical design shapes and drawing have been populated as well through Autodesk Inventor Professional. Material chosen of component manufacturing of the new design system are readily available from the market, that means there is no need to mould any component when manufacturing (Mafokwane and Kallon, 2021).","s.z. mafokwane and d.v.v. kallon department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology, university of johannesburg, south africa. zamashaun@gmail.com, dkallon@uj.ac.za",

34,The Challenges In Indonesia Poultry Industry Business,"agroindustry is a key component of indonesia's economic system which has been experiencing “vuca (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous)” as the most critical set of challenges recently. this study is the first to provide an overview of the agroindustry with a framework focused on the indonesia poultry industry. apart from playing an important role in the national economy, the poultry industry also provides a protein source for indonesian people, with a 7.8 kg consumption per capita per year in 2019. this study aims to describe the challenges of the indonesian poultry industry under vuca conditions. the exploratory method was used to identify the potential factors through literature reviews and in-depth interviews with poultry industry practitioners. furthermore, results were based on data obtained from primary and secondary sources. this research identified the various vuca factors affecting businesses across indonesia’s poultry industry. these include volatile conditions due to fluctuations in live bird prices, uncertain conditions due to chicken meat imports, and the unavailability of food chain facilities. the complex and ambiguous conditions occurred due to chicken meat oversupply and cartel practices. finally, the research results were incorporated in a conceptual model for future reference.","agility, business, poultry","This research discussed the Indonesian poultry business which currently faces challenges of VUCA conditions. Furthermore, it examines how the poultry business reacts to address the VUCA challenges. It was observed that they will lose their market share progressively due to their inability to maintain their products relevant to current market demand. Financial difficulties may also occur due to their inability to quickly reduce costs during difficult times. If this condition does not change, the poultry industry may be acquired, become smaller, or even bankrupt.","puti retno ali, machfud machfud, sukardi sukardi, and erliza noor doctoral program of agroindustrial engineering department ipb university bogor, indonesia putiforindonesia@gmail.com, machfud21@gmail.com, sukardi_ri@yahoo.com, erlizanoor@yahoo.com dwi purnomo department of agroindustrial engineering padjadjaran university bandung, indonesia dwi.purnomo@unpad.ac.id",
35,"Let'S Go Phishing: A Phishing Awareness Campaign Using  Smishing, Email Phishing, And Social Media Phishing Tools","the phishing attacks have been drastically rising in numbers in several platforms such as personal and business emails, short message services (sms), and the emerging tactic that is through social media accounts. with the vulnerability of social engagement and trust in relationships, the study will show how phishing attacks are easily done with just minimal rapport in comparison to unknown senders and promotional links. the creation of a fake phishing website has been done and sent to 107 people - 46 via email, 37 via social media chat, and 24 via sms. data collection has been done through the use of the open-source phishing framework gophish for monitoring the links sent via email, google analytics for links sent via social media chat, and a link click counter for links sent via sms. the results have shown that out of the three types of phishing methods used, social media phishing is where the targeted users are most vulnerable on which has a 24 out of 46 (52.17%) success rate, compared to email phishing which has 6 out of 37 (16.22%) success rate and smishing which has a 1 out of 24 (4.17%) success rate.","phishing, smishing, email phishing","A Post-Experience Survey has been distributed to 23 targeted users, 8 Email Phishing targeted users (5 who clicked the link, and 3 who did not click the link), 12 Social Media targeted users (9 who clicked the link, and 3 who did not click the link), and 3 smishing targeted users (1 who clicked the link, and 2 who did not click the link). The results show that trust is the greatest factor in why the targeted users have clicked the link. This shows that even if their devices or browsers have high levels of security, their interaction, closeness, and trust in other people is their greatest vulnerability. Curiosity is the next factor in why the targeted users have clicked the link. This shows that persuading skills can be a significant characteristic of a penetration tester when dealing with other people, because getting their curiosity can be a way for them to disclose their information. The Post-Experience Survey shows that 13 out of 15 (86.67%) target users did not receive any warning messages upon opening the phishing link. This shows that hosting a fake website on an online hosting application that has a legitimate domain can easily be sent via social media, email, and SMS. If the users trust the sender of the fake website, their sensitive information can easily be gathered. On the other hand, suspicion is one of the ways that a user can be protected from opening a malicious link. The Post-Experience Survey shows that 6 out of 8 (75%) target users have answered that they did not click the link because of their suspicion. This shows that clarifying when suspicion happens can be an additional layer of security for people especially for phishing attacks. 2 out of 15(13.33%) target users had an encounter with a warning webpage upon accessing the link. These users have used Facebook Messenger to access the given link. This shows that Facebook Messenger has a level of security upon sending phishing links. Conclusively, the target users have a 4.6 Mean Value on the answers on the Likert Scale about their rating on the phishing awareness campaign conducted by the researchers, which falls under the Strongly Agree range. This shows that the target users have an overall positive attitude on the process of the phishing campaign.

And with the idea of the researchers to bring it to the cafeteria of the university, it has gained potential as based on the study conducted. With all the results provided, the satisfaction of the students and the concessionaires will definitely increase in time once the said system which is the RFID based payment system in the cafeteria of the HEI’s is going to be implemented in the near future. Given all the benefits that RFID can provide inside the vicinity, a lot of the customers gladly said that with the production of the said payment system it can have the ability to attain the highest potential of the cafeteria inside the university. The different features of the RFID based payment system will include the contactless transaction which can be very beneficial for the university and mostly after this pandemic that the people are encountering nowadays. One feature also is focused on the security of the customers and also the concessionaires itself; one factor that the system gave the students is its ability to track and record their transaction within the day which is also very efficient for the students and the accurate and efficient reports that it can provide for the concessionaires. The results on the survey conducted by the researchers are based on the ideas and opinions of both the customers and concessionaires on the implementation of the RFID based transaction system for the cafeteria, the outcome of the said survey attained positive feedbacks regarding the benefits of implementing the RFID technology to the cafeteria, some responses contained high development of sales and security of the customers while on the other hand, for the concessionaires; they stated that it would affect customer satisfaction and the growth of not only the university but also the cafeteria . As per the results of the study, it was analyzed that this specific technology which is the RFID technology- based Transaction System in HEI’s will greatly affect its growth and development as a full standard and competitive university among the others. It was also said that this certain implementation will solely benefit the satisfactions of both the concessionaires and the students of the university.","roland jay-ar r. espinosa, aiden lemuel t. lumibao, chloe ysabel p. zerrudo, grace lorraine d. intal school of information technology mapua university, manila philippines rjrespinosa@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, altlumibao@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, cypzerrudo@mymail.mapua.edu.ph,gldintal@mapua.edu.ph",

39,Pesantren Darul Huffadh Tuju-Tuju Indonesia:  Model Of Teaching And Learning  In Social Environment,"pesantren has some uniqueness when compared with other educational institutions. this article aims to study the role of the pesantren darul huffadh tuju-tuju in building the character of santri based on the quran and local wisdom. this research applies a qualitative approach. through interviews and observations, data collection is supported by written sources and strengthened by the author's intensive interaction with the director and alumni. the results show that this pesantren is unique. it requires all of its students to memorize the quran as its main characteristic since its establishment until now. the strength of the pesantren is in the strong character attached to the figure of k.h. lanre said. his style is a blend of the main principles of the quran and the local wisdom. the combination of religious background and social strata supports him with a strong character, which becomes a role model for the pesantren community. the central values underlying the character are taught to his children and students through exemplary 'taro ada taro gawu' and sublime messages. for darul huffadh, building the character of religious moderation must be built from three things: well, understanding of the quran, mastery of the basic islamic sciences, and strengthening local wisdom values.","character, darul huffadh, pesantren, local wisdom, al-quran","K.H. Lanre Said, a Bugis scholar, who integrated the background of aristocrats and scholars, so that he was able to institutionalize religion-based characters and local wisdom. His calling is his conscience to dedicate in the religious, social field in the community by establishing educational institutions to educate the nation's life, he lived as he is, and his messages are deep and relevant to be practiced. The main values of principle in strengthening students' moderation are sincerity, in-depth knowledge, long experiences, good ethics, honesty, persistence, hard-working, truth, and patience. He was prioritizing the needs of pesantren more than everything, and sincerity in intention. His position was irreplaceable. He advised students to be not biased, increased reading resources, wandered for knowledge, istikharah prayer, and hajat prayer before making essential decisions, mastering of the primary and twelve basic sciences. Strong faith, courage, and others are as key to success. This statement strengthens Zubaedi's conclusions that the figure of the kyai is crucial in establishing Islamic moderation from the pesantren. For Darul Huffadh, religious moderation must be built from mastery of these twelve basic sciences. The central values or principles institutionalized and stated in his words and actions (taro ada taro gawu) make him highly respected. The humbleness that adorns his personality makes him even more appreciated. He hoped that these character values are referred to as Islam and local culture. He also hoped these values passed on to his sons and daughters and students through his exemplary and wise advice (pappaseng) to all Darul Huffadh communities. The central importance of Bugis culture relevant to the Quran and authentic hadiths are taught theoretically but, more importantly, are in real attitudes of integration of words and deeds. His speech and actions are integrated, which is his personality as a whole. The strength of pesantren, according to him, is in the values of his attitude and wise advice or core values. If it is held firmly and practiced in managing the pesantren, it will survive and prosper. Conversely, if left out, it will fall and fail.

41,"Feasibility Study To Develop Production Of Active  Ingredients Nani0,5Ti0,5O2 Sodium Cathode : A Case Study","the use of lithium in non-renewable energy storage cathodes is possible to run out someday. therefore, an alternative is sought to replace it, namely the manufacture of cathodes made from sodium sea salt as raw material. this has been proven because there are many patents and research conducted by researchers. to carry out production, a cost analysis related to the process must be carried out. this study aims to calculate the cost components, especially the cost of production in the experiment of making cathode active ingredients made from salt. the method used in this research is using primary and secondary data. the results obtained in this study are the cost of production of the cathode active ingredient products made from sodium is rp. 132,677 per 100 grams and the selling price is rp. 150,000 per 100 grams. this price is very much cheaper compared to the price of active cathode materials made from lithium which is rp. 250,000 per 100 grams. apart from being cheaper, the cost of production is also easy to obtain, the production of active cathode materials also has a profitable economic value so that this study is appropriate to continue regarding scale up on a factory scale.","cathode, energy storage, renewable, and salt","The conclusions of this paper is the costs obtained in the production process of active cathode materials are as follows: Cost of production per 100 grams is Rp. 132,677; the market price of the active cathode is Rp. 150,000 thus the price of the sodium cathode active ingredient can have a profitable economic value. That is why it is very worthy of further study concerning its economic value. In addition, cathode active material made from lithium is much more expensive when compared to cathode active material made from sodium. The price of lithium raw material has a price of Rp. 250,000 per 100 grams and sodium cathode active ingredient Rp. 150,000. This potential can potentially be chosen by factories that produce batteries because it will cut production costs at battery factories. Further studies that can be carried out in this research is the expansion of production to an industrial scale. because in laboratory production conditions it can be said that it is feasible for production or scale up.

The average torque, torque ripple and efficiency have been compared in between normal rotor and shoe pole. The shoe hole structure has higher efficiency and lower torque ripple. The stator and rotor geometry parameters were kept the same and phase winding and turn per coil were fixed. This paper has also presented a novel rotor structure to reduce electromagnetic force. The shoe pole contributes to change the flux path and flatten flux density in air gap that radial force can be reduced while maintaining the average torque. Finite element analysis was performed to verify the radial and tangential force. The result shows that the radial force can be improved, and the average torque is even slightly higher than the conventional structure.","design 1minh dinh bui¸2dinh hai linh and 3dang chi dung electrical engineering department school of electrical engineering, hanoi unviversity of science and technology email: dinh.buiminh@hust.edu.vn",

OCB is a tool for dealing with Covid- 19 using the notion of non-natural disaster mitigation. The extent to which health workers contribute to realizing hospital goals is determined by several factors such as how much health workers show extra behavior or so-called organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). These behaviors lead to positive actions that benefit the health organization. Among others, the willingness to carry out tasks outside the main role it has, the willingness to protect the interests of the organization and take greater responsibility for the organization. This behavior is what embodies the goals of the organization. What needs to be considered are several factors that affect organizational citizenship behavior (OCB).

Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for working group and control group. In the working group, due to repetitive work a majority of women (56%) have normal BMI and only 10% workers were obese. The hand grip strength was measured for the working group before and after work. The grip strength reduced considerably due to repetitive work of hands and wrists. Statistical analysis by ANOVA between working and control groups indicated F-ratio being 94.52683 and p-value < 0.00001, significant at p<0.01. RULA analysis of working postures of working group showed about 46% of postures fall in high risk category, signalling immediate change in postures. The actual postures were built in CATIA software and RULA analysis was done. The results were similar to manual RULA analysis. The work station was redesigned in CATIA to suggest improvements. The new station was simulated and RULA analysis was done. The maximum RULA score obtained was ‘4’, indicating medium risk. Statistical analysis ANOVA was done on RULA scores across different groups. The results are significant at p<0.01 and F-ratio=9.07665. Overall the ergonomic intervention study in roti making units points to various ergonomic deficiencies, poor layout, work environment and work practices. Recommendations • Job rotation to remove the risks of fatigue • Job design to incorporate good ergonomic practices and provide relief from repetitive motions, awkward postures etc. • Provide possible safety solutions wherever possible, near the stoves/fire wood, spacing between work stations, safety against burns etc. • Basic first aid should be available always. • Work stations designed ergonomically to accommodate variability in workers, based on anthropometric data.

51,Managing Medical Waste During Covid-19 Outbreak: A  Simulation Approach,"medical waste is a problem that existed before the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the significant increase in medical waste during the covid-19 outbreak causes these problems to become more urgent and complex because they relate to health, environmental, and economic problems in developing countries. many interrelated factors influence the management of medical waste. a comprehensive analysis is needed to understand the complexity of the problem. this study aims to explore the right strategies and policies in dealing with the amount of medical waste during an outbreak such as covid-19 and in ordinary (non-outbreak) conditions. the factors considered are demographic, operational of the waste generation, emergency, and cost and investment aspects. a systems dynamic approach is used in this study to structure the complexity of the problem comprehensively. this research consists of three stages; where the first stage was a preliminary study by conducting a field study, and the second stage was developing the model. the third stage was testing the model. a case study of surabaya, indonesia, is selected.","medical waste, system dynamics, covid-19, simulation","This study shows that the System Dynamics model is an appropriate simulation method in a complex Medical Waste management system. The model developed in the stock and flow diagram consists of 4 aspects: the demographic aspect, the emergency aspect, the waste generation aspect, and the cost aspect. The model was developed based on the COVID-19 referral hospital, non-referral hospital, health center, and clinics based on health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. The system dynamic model can help plan to optimize the Medical Waste management system during the COVID- 19 outbreak and ordinary conditions to reduce health and environmental risks. The more Medical Waste is processed, the more it will improve public health. The COVID-19 referral hospital has more complete health facilities than other health facilities, so the amount of Medical Waste generated is also more significant. The COVID-19 referral hospital generates a generation of Medical Waste for hospitalization of 5.457,49 kg per day. In contrast, in non-referral hospitals, it is 2.322,34 kg per day, health centers, 120, 77 kg per day, and clinics, it is 576, 65 kg per day. This research implies that the Surabaya city government can use the resulting model to address Medical Waste. The policy is in the form of the number of trucks, the type of processing technology, the number of processing equipment, and the percentage of the government budget for medical waste.","agus mulyadi and niniet indah arvitrida industrial and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember surabaya, 60111, indonesia agusmulyadi.18024@mhs.its.ac.id, niniet@ie.its.ac.id",
52,Exploring Barriers To Mitigate Disruptions In Sustainable   Supply Chain Of Pharmaceutical Industry During Covid-,"the pandemic, covid 19, has affected global economy severely which caused an outbreak of crisis in all sectors of business. firms are struggling to keep up with the normal functions in different stages of supply chain which brought sustainability under a big risk. concerned by the covid-19 outbreak, the main aim of this paper is to determine the threatening barriers to supply chain sustainability in the pharmaceutical industry of the south asian region. this industry is one of the most pivotal and developing sectors in the south asian region with respect to other industries in this region. although economic growth is noticeable in this sector, many questions are arising about its sustainability and resilience in a true sense amidst the global pandemic. to establish the sustainability of this sector under a pandemic scenario, the major barriers in terms of social, economic, and environmental perspectives have been identified and analysed in this research. twenty crucial constraints have been identified and classified in five categories through an extensive study of literature and opinion of industry expert. this paper uses, interpretive structural modelling (ism) approach to develop the hierarchical structure and connection between these obstacles. ism presents the interdependency of the driving and driven power of these barriers. another modernistic approach, matrix of cross-impact multiplications applied to classification (micmac), has been used to recognize the barriers as driving factors, dependent variables, and link variables using. the modelling of this study provides companies insight into obstacles and the efficient and effective management of their resources while making their supply chains sustainable. the study closes by discussing findings and future area of the research.","(12 font) covid-19, supply chain, sustainability",,"19 shah murtoza morshed, naimur rahman chowdhury, m.a.tanvir bhuiyan, md. abdur rahim, mohammad sarwar morshed department of mechanical and production engineering ahsanullah university of sceince and technology (aust) dhaka, bangladesh shahmurtozamorshed@gmail.com, naimur20rahman.mpe@aust.edu , tanvirbhuiyan2017@gmail.com , abdurrahim.aust18@gmail.com , msmorshed@hotmail.com",

54,Global Stability Of Prey-Predator Model With Crowleymartin Type Functional Response And,"this article focuses on studying global stability of the prey-predator model with crowley-martin type functional response and stages structure for predator population. the analytical methods in this article are starting with the construction of a prey-predator model, determining stability of the equilibrium point by linearizing the model, analyzing the global stability of the equilibrium point using the lyapunov method and the krasovsky method, performing numerical simulations, and ecologically interpreting the global stability. the results of the study show that the prey-predator model with the crowly-martin type of functional response and stages structure of the predator population has one non-negative interior equilibrium point. the interior equilibrium point becomes globally asymptotically stable under a certain condition. this means that even if there is a tight interaction or predation on prey over a long period of time, the prey population will still be sustainable and also be stable. the global stability of the interior equilibrium gives an ecological interpretation that the ecosystem life is under control for a long period of time.",global stability,"The prey-predator model with Crowly-Martin type functional response and stages structure for predator population has only one non-negative equilibrium point 𝑻𝑻𝑬𝑬𝟒𝟒(𝒙𝒙, 𝒚𝒚, 𝒛𝒛) = ቀ𝝎𝝎, 𝒃𝒃𝒃𝒃𝒃𝒃+𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅−𝜶𝜶𝜶𝜶+𝒃𝒃+𝒅𝒅 (𝒃𝒃+𝒅𝒅)(𝝈𝝈𝝈𝝈+𝟏𝟏)𝝑𝝑 , 𝒅𝒅(𝒃𝒃𝒃𝒃𝒃𝒃+𝒅𝒅𝒅𝒅−𝜶𝜶𝜶𝜶+𝒃𝒃+𝒅𝒅) 𝝑𝝑(𝝈𝝈𝝈𝝈+𝟏𝟏)(𝜽𝜽𝜽𝜽−𝒄𝒄)(𝒃𝒃+𝒅𝒅)ቁ. This equilibrium point becomes the only interior equilibrium point and it is locally and globally asymptotically stable when a certain conditions are fulfilled. This means that even if there is a tight interaction or predation on prey over a long period of time, the prey population will still be sustainable, stable, and sustainably maintained. This global stability provides an interpretation that the populations in the ecosystem is under control for a long period of time. As suggestions for further research, the model can be developed by considering some assumptions or consider the time delay and harvesting in the mechanism of growth of each prey and predator population.

55,Correlation Between Playing An Instrument And Grades In  Middle And High School Students In The U.S.,"the purpose of this study is to determine if there is a correlation between grades and playing an instrument. furthermore, it will be determined if the number of hours one spends practicing their instrument and how long one has played their instrument affects one’s grade in a class. the data for this study was obtained through a google form and was targeted towards middle and high school students in the united states. results of this study concluded that there is a correlation between playing an instrument and one’s grades in certain subjects. it was also determined that the amount of time spent practicing or how long one has played an instrument also had an impact on one’s grades in certain subjects.","performance, instrument, grades, music","Overall, the conclusions drawn from the statistically analyzed data are that 1) there is a correlation between playing an instrument and one’s grades in math, 2) there is a correlation between how long one has played an instrument and one’s grades in science only, 3) there is a positive significant correlation between how long one practices their instrument each week and one’s grades in math and science, and 4) there is a positive highly significant correlation between how long one practices their instrument each week and one’s grades in humanities. The analyzed results support the original hypothesis. The data for the humanities grades vs. how long one practices their instrument each week was more supportive because the calculated value exceeded the critical value for the 0.01 threshold (99%). Realistically, these conclusions only point to the fact that people who play an instrument have higher grades in general. Any assumptions cannot be safely drawn about the psychological and/or neurological explanations for the data because the four conclusions mentioned above are not cohesive. For the chi-square test for association that determined if playing an instrument affected one’s math, science, and humanities grades, some categories had a value of 0 for the observed frequencies. For example, there was no one in the data that played an instrument and had a C in their math class. This then led to the numerical operation of “0/0” while calculating the chi-square values. For simplicity, these values were simplified to 0, but this may have led to a discrepancy in my final result. 5. Future Research Future research could be done on a larger population to gain a more representative sample as well as more representative conclusions. Additionally, it would be more beneficial if research was done not solely based on grades, but perhaps include additional factors, such as the subject that respondents found was easiest for them or most intuitive. If this project was carried out again, the questions about how long one practices their instrument each week and whether or not they sing would be removed. These questions were not relevant to the survey. The majority of efforts would be focused on a more longitudinal study including younger students who are just starting out in learning an instrument so that their grades can be tracked over time by doing a similar study with a wide range of participants every year. Because it was proved that there is a correlation between playing an instrument and one’s grade in math, math teachers could incorporate musical aspects into their classes. James DiComenico investigates this idea in his paper. He surveyed 46 teachers regarding their use of music in classrooms and conducted an interview with an instructor that has 23 years of teaching experience. Through his survey, DiComenico determined that 40% of teachers use music daily to alter their student’s mood, 52% of teachers sometimes use music to teach core subjects, 40% use music quite often to promote creativity and personal expression, and 40% of teachers sometimes use music to help with classroom management. DiComenico concluded his paper by writing that music has multiple benefits, including improving engagement, focusing concentration, and triggering imagination (DiComenico, 2017).","april wen stanford online high school, redwood city, ca 94063 april888@ohs.stanford.edu",
56,Current Ability Of Stock Market Indices To Track The  Technology Sector,"this paper investigates the information technology financial sector using the following indices: qtec, djustc, ndxt, and xtx. these indices stem from popular market indices such as the dow jones, nasdaq, and standard & poor’s 500 index and thus, are apt choices to study the sector. from a list of public technology companies with listed stocks, a sample of 40 stocks was selected. the past 100 days (100 business days before may 18th, 2021) of closing prices were used for both the indices as well as the stocks and the natural logarithm of all values was taken such that they could be compared despite different price ranges. these values were used to build simple linear regression models for all the stocks and for the indices themselves and standard t-tests were run to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between the slopes of the price/value vs. time graphs. based on the number of statistically insignificant values there are, a relative estimate can be made for how well the indices track the stocks overall and individually using the chi-square test for homogeneity and index holdings.","stock market, financial indices, stock price","To reiterate, the stocks and indices had linear models fitted to them and standard t-tests were run in order to determine whether the difference of the slope of each stock versus a given index was statistically significant. The number of fail to rejects/rejects was counted and a Chi-square test for homogeneity was carried out in which the null hypothesis was not rejected, and the conclusion was that there is not enough evidence to justify there being a difference in category proportions. Finally, using a holdings/set space size ratio, it was found that three of the indices were tracking more stocks than the expected baseline (with the exception of XTX which suggests we should reevaluate any reliance we might have on it). Overall, the market indices do indeed track the technology sector well and do so in a consistent manner.

Where, if the work motivation of employees is high, it will have an impact on the achievement of employee performance in the company. Maintaining employee motivation should be one of the focuses for every Human Resource Management in a company. One of the factors that influence employee performance is the motivation factor, where motivation is a condition that encourages someone to try to achieve goals or achieve the expected results. A strong form of motivation can produce good and quality results or performance from the work he does. This means that every increase in employee motivation in carrying out their work will improve their performance. Work motivation is a basic human need and as an incentive that is expected to meet the desired basic needs, so that if the need exists, it will result in the success of an activity. Employees who have high work motivation will try to get their work done as well as possible. By paying special attention to employees regarding the needs needed at work, it will have a good impact on their performance results. The needs that can be met for employees are related to the need for achievement, the need for affiliation, and the need for power. The results of employee performance can be seen from the quantity of work, quality of work, timeliness in completing work according to the specified deadline, attendance at work, and the ability of employees to cooperate with other employees both in the same field or not.","sisca maydiana nurvita sari, m. yahya arwiyah, tri indra wijaksana, and mahir pradana telkom university jalan terusan buah batu, bandung 40257, indonesia siscamaydiananvs@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id , yahya@telkomuniversity.ac.id , triindrawijaksana@telkomuniversity.ac.id , mahirpradana@telkomuniversity.ac.id",

66,Review Of Engineer Professionalism In Construction Project  Failure: A Case Toll Road Project In Indonesia,"the leading causes of work accidents on construction projects are related to the unique characteristics of the construction project, different work locations, openness, and weather conditions. the professionalism of the parties involved in implementing a construction project significantly affects a construction project's safety and success. a review of engineers' professionalism on the failure and accidents of construction projects took a case study on the pier head pcb 34 toll road bekasi cawang kampung melayu, which was carried out fast track. the method chosen was to carry out a literature study and a simple analysis of these incidents. a simple analysis shows that the failure and accidents of the construction project are caused by the deterioration of the already plastic steel material, which has a direct impact on the bracket's ability to withstand loads during casting. such deterioration does not need to occur if the entire project cycle is carried out properly with the parties' professional handling.","deterioration, pier-head","Based on the results of the analysis of the construction failure on the pier-head work of the Becakayu Toll Road above so that it does not recur in similar work in the future, the following are things that need attention both for the implementing contractor and the supervisory consultant, namely : 1. Improved implementation supervision The enhanced supervision includes supervision when the implementation and supervision of materials used. Implementation supervision can be applied by tightening SOPs (Standard Operational Procedures) and implementing more risk management. 2. Improved material supervision Material control can be improved by conducting periodic checklists with a series of tests. The material contained in the pier head bracket formwork is steel material. Tests commonly carried out on steel materials include tensile strength, deformation, and corrosion tests. The effect of corrosion on steel materials can reduce the strength of steel materials. 3. Improved human resource management In this case, improving the quality of human resources, workers and masons who carry out construction can be done by improving human resource management. This HR management includes scheduling workers, counseling on SOPs, and counseling on the importance of K3 in construction. In the Becakayu Toll Road project, there are indications of poor human resource management, including a busy work schedule but inadequate shift/work change arrangements. As a result, the risk of workers experiencing fatigue and making mistakes is getting bigger. Improving HR management in work scheduling can be done by re-analyzing the needs and scheduling of worker shifts according to the time/target the contractor is trying to achieve. 4. Re-analyze the strength of the pier-head formwork The pier-head formwork used in the Becakayu Toll Road Project is a cantilever/bracket system. The load on the formwork is entirely transferred to the pier body through the brackets. To reduce stress on the bracket, it can be done by installing reinforcing scaffolding/shoring. Shoring is a component made of metal assembled into a modular unit, which is usually used to strengthen freshly cast concrete (compressive strength is not optimal). In the case of the Becakayu Toll Road pier head, the shoring system can be used to carry the burden during and after casting. This reduces the stress on each bracket connected to the pier head body. This shoring requirement can be analyzed by recalculating the pier head formwork ability that has been used. Existing loads on the pier head work are the concrete's weight, the load the possibility of piling the concrete at one point (centered), the live load of workers, tools (vibrators), and other equipment. There are also shock loads, such as the height and speed of casting, which generally cause additional loads on the formwork. After the load has been calculated, the next step is to calculate the formwork ability. The bracket system essentially transfers all the load during casting to the pier body. In the Becakayu Toll Road Project case, structural failure was not found in the pier but the bracket. Thus, the bracket's ability to withstand stress needs to be recalculated by the existing condition of the test results. Shoring can reduce stress on the bracket because shoring transfers most of the load to the ground.

76,"Quality Of Disclosure Of Financial Accounting Information,  On Cash Flows, And Company'S Financial Performance","detailed disclosures of the company's financial statements and cash flows provide an overview of the company's actual performance. the purpose of this study was to prove and analyze: 1) the quality of accounting information disclosure has a significant effect on cash flow; 2) the quality of accounting information disclosure has a significant effect on the company's financial performance; 3) cash flow has a significant effect on the company's financial performance. this research was conducted at all manufacturing companies listed on the indonesia stock exchange using purposive sampling method. this research is a quantitative analysis using partial least square (pls). the results of the analysis show that: 1) the quality of financial accounting information disclosure has a significant effect on cash flow. the higher the quality of disclosure of financial accounting information, the higher the cash flow. 2) the quality of financial accounting information disclosure does not have a significant effect on financial performance. users reduce dependence on firm performance because of less important measures of accounting risk and tend to engage in speculative trading. 3) cash flow has a significant effect on financial performance. the higher the cash flow, the higher the financial performance.",cash flow,"of the relationship between variables supports the theory of the quality of financial accounting information disclosure on cash flow variables. This answers the problem formulation that the quality of accounting information disclosure has a significant effect on cash flows 2) Quality of Financial Accounting Information Disclosure and Company Financial Performance. The results of this study reinforce several previous studies, namely: Wolk, et al (1991). Information related to company performance is displayed through disclosure of financial accounting information in financial reports. Financial reports are very important information for investors in making investment decisions. Future disclosures are made because the business environment is increasingly complex and the capital market is able to quickly absorb and reflect new share price information through the accounting income statement. Quality accounting earnings (Tanor 2009) are accounting earnings that have little or no perceived noise in them and can reflect the company's actual financial performance. In conditions of market uncertainty, the value of relevant and reliable information reflected in company disclosures is an important factor (Hidayah 2008). The benefits of accounting information have no effect on risk perceptions (Lambert and Verrechia 2005; and Ferris, et al. 1990) in Hidayah 2008. This study explains that accounting information shows the performance, prospects, risk potential and firm value. , but this information does not provide a positive or negative attitude towards the company's shares. Use of information indicates a risk neutral preference. This suggests that users reduce dependence on firm performance because accounting risk measures are less important and tend to conduct speculative trades. Based on the explanation above, the variables of the quality of financial accounting information disclosure (indicators of the mandatory disclosure variable and the voluntary disclosure variable) together do not have a significant effect on the company's financial performance variables. 3) Cash flow and financial performance of the company. The results showed that investors in the capital market have a strong interest in information related to company performance. Companies that have a good performance are able to maximize company profits which in turn will improve the welfare of share owners as indicated by the market price per share of the company. This can be seen from the increase in accounting profit and the flow component in the financial statements. The higher the increase and the positive effect of accounting profit and the cash flow component consisting of operating cash flow, investment and financing, will increase company value and increase shareholder wealth in the form of an increase in share prices. Analysis of cash flow and cash flow (Albrecht 2003) relating to company performance is seen as one of the methods to contribute to economic objectives in the market. Financial reports (Kusno 2004), especially those related to information on changes in cash flow and company accounting earnings, are one of the important information investors can use to assess company performance. A higher increase and a positive effect of accounting earnings and cash flow components which consist of (Oktavia 2008) that: operating cash flows, investing and financing, will increase firm value and increase shareholder wealth in the form of increased share prices. Hypothesis testing can be concluded that cash flow has a significant effect on financial performance. Cash flow has a positive effect on financial performance, meaning that the higher the cash flow, the higher the financial performance. 6.

78,"Causality Relationship Between Infrastructure, Taxes And  Grdp Per Capita In Aceh","the main objective of this research is to see the causal relationship between infrastructure, taxes and grdp per capita. the method used in this research is a quantitative approach with the variables are infrastructure, taxes and per capita grdp. the infrastructure used here is the length of the road in kilometers; tax in rupiah units; while the grdp used is per capita grdp in rupiah units. all data used are secondary data in the form of time series data for the period 2006-2019. the results showed that first, infrastructure, taxes and per capita grdp had no causality, but there was a one-way relationship, namely taxes affecting infrastructure; second, the cointegration test through the johansen co-integration test shows that there is no cointegration; third, the function of impulse response and forecast error decomposition shows that the variable that most influences infrastructure and taxes is grdp per capita, while the variable that most influences infrastructure is grdp per capita; fourth, the relationship variable based on the results of the granger-causality analysis test which is supported by the analysis of the impulse response function and the variance decomposition can conclude that the fluctuating tax growth has a direct effect (through per capita grdp) on infrastructure improvement.",infrastructure,"Based on the results and discussion of the causality relationship of infrastructure, taxes and per capita GRDP, it can be proven that the three variables, namely infrastructure, taxes and per capita GRDP, do not have causality, but there is a one-way relationship, namely taxes affecting infrastructure. This suggests that the tax increase will improve infrastructure, including the addition of road infrastructure. The cointegration test through the Johansen Co-Integration test shows that there is no cointegration. The analysis of the impulse response function and the decomposition of forecast errors shows that the variable that most influences infrastructure and taxes is GRDP per capita, while the variable that most influences infrastructure is GRDP per capita. The relationship between variables based on the results of the Granger-Causality analysis test which is supported by the analysis of the impulse response function and variance decomposition can be relied upon that the fluctuating tax growth has an indirect effect (through per capita GRDP) on infrastructure improvement. The recommendations given are, first, to optimize the role of local government in infrastructure that can accommodate sufficiently, in this case the government acts firmly on tax collection so that taxes can become a resource for the government whose infrastructure is; second, it is necessary to supervise tax revenue and distribution so as not to misuse taxes; third, for further research it is necessary to examine the linkage between infrastructure and investment.","irham iskandar research and development field aceh province regional planning and development agency banda aceh, indonesian irham.iskandar84@gmail.com sugiarto civil engineering department syiah kuala university banda aceh, indonesian sugiarto@unsyiah.ac.id wawan hermawan department of economics padjadjaran university bandung, indonesian w.hermawan@unpad.ac.id",

There is a relationship between metacognition awareness and student creativity in learning biodiversity. Read carefully the case study below! (Questions 1-2) Forests in Indonesia have a variety of species. The distribution of biodiversity in it is also different. Forests on the island of Kalimantan, Indonesia have different biodiversity differences from forests on the island of Java. This is due to differences in soil physical and chemical factors. Kalimantan forests provide unique flora such as pitcher plant (Nepenthes, sp.) Nepenthes (Figure 1) has a variety of shapes and colors. Semar bags grow among ferns, pandanus, palms, and other shrubs. Currently the existence of semar bags is starting to be difficult to find, because their habitat has been converted into plantations and community settlements. 1. Based on the above discourse, classify the level of diversity contained in the ecosystem, and come up with an idea to maintain the existence of the germplasm! Answer: The diversity of colors and patterns of semar bags including gene level diversity. The idea to maintain the presence of germplasm is by not illegally burning forests and creating a breeding ground for the pitcher plant.

82,The Risk Assessment Safety Of A  Multipurpose Small Port,"activities at the port can be an environment that is potentially prone to accidents. various studies have been conducted to reduce risks and discuss safety factors in large ports but little for small ports, especially in determining the analysis method. this paper aims to discuss various risk analysis methods that may be used in analyzing small port areas that are considered dangerous in port areas: (1) formal safety assessment (fsa), (2) risk-based decision-making guidelines (rpdm), (3) frequency, probability, event tree (4) quantitative risk assessment (qra), and (5) risk index and ranking. the literature method used is a literature study on a risk assessment which is then adjusted to the port characteristics. the results concluded that the fsa is a method that can still be used with adjustments in several ways, especially related to accident characteristics. furthermore, we are developing the use of fsa with as low as sufficient and practical (alarp) based innovations, especially in small ports.","risk assessment, safety, job creation","Risk assessments are nowadays an integral part of any port activity, mainly because of a need for port reliability, which is strongly related to service revenue. Port activity is much more sensitive to safety faults in the transportation of people and goods. An accident is an inability of a port operator and other partners in a process to manage unpredictable events. Risk Assessment and criteria, as presented in the paper, are strongly related to actual safety standards and modern port management. The use of Historical analysis, databases, statistics and frequency, probability, event trees in port risk assessments is not currently usable, due to the lack of accident data documented by the port in the form of accident reports. Analysis of both Refers to past accident data where the probability is only on certain events with frequent occurrences and subsequent impacts. National data collection was done by KNKT, and this was limited to major and reported accidents. Many accidents have been handled directly by the Polisi Air (POLAIR) and the Port Authority. Format Safety Assessment (FSA), Quantitative risk assessment (QRA), The risk-based decision making (RBDM), and Risk Indices Ratings guidelines provide proven methods for addressing real decision-making needs in the marine safety, security, and environmental protection arenas. Decision-makers throughout the marine industry will find the insights, suggestions, and procedures in the guidelines valuable in the conduct of their operations. The results conclude sequentially that the FSA, GRA, RPDM, and Risk Indices Ratings are deemed appropriate for port risk analysis. The use of the FSA with innovation ALARP needs to be considered in analyzing port safety risks. This is to ensure that safety resources are allocated to maximize the number of lives saved, and implies that the ALARP criteria result in stronger minimum requirements for life safety investments. The paper presents the methodology applying different approaches, deterministic and qualitative to present deeper understanding and relations governing risks. Operational (technical) risks are analyzed and discussed for further improvement in their management.","santospriadi, tri tjahjono civil engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia, depok, west java 16431, indonesia. santospriadi91@ui.ac.id , trijajono@ui.ac.id sunaryo mechanical engineering department, faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia depok, west java 16431, indonesia. sunaryo@ui.ac.id",

88,Fea Of A Tri-Adjustable Automated Heavy-Duty Handling  System Designed On Industry 4.0 Principles,"materials handling (mh) is one of the most essential aspects within manufacturing processes and/or industries. mh equipment are mechanical equipment used for the movement, storage, control and protection of materials, goods, and products throughout the process of manufacturing, distribution, consumption, and disposal. transportation equipment used in manufacturing industries varies from pallet jack to forklift trucks and/or cranes. the size and type of a material handling system (mhs) and/or equipment influences the effectivity of the internal logistics within manufacturing industries. therefore, it is very essential to choose a correct mhs for a correct manufacturing process which requires material handling to complete its operation. incorrect usage or selection of an mhs for an operational process may lead to down time, damage to facility, increase in operating costs and/or pose occupational health and safety (ohs) risks to workers. over the years, many south african industries have been using forklift trucks to move bigger loads from one point to another till today. the use of large forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing processes poses ohs risks to workers as its internal combustion engine (ice) produces fumes (carbon monoxide, co) when in operation and exhaust fumes, (co), are harmful to human’s health. on this basis, a new system design is recommended to eliminate the use of mhs that relies on ice power source to prevent ohs risks in indoor manufacturing industries. in this project, autodesk inventor professional software was used for design development of technical drawings and simulation as well as validation of the new system’s structure. vehicle dynamics’ principles and equations are used to determine the overall rolling resistance, tractive effort of the new system, wheel torque, and the power required to drive the system under 20 – ton load capacity. the new system design has been developed to operate using a hydraulic power pack source, where it consists of four hydraulic wheel hubs for driving the system, four hydraulic cylinders for lifting & lowering, and a double rod end hydraulic cylinder for steering. electro-hydraulic circuit systems were developed and proposed using electronics and fluid mechanics phenomena. again, principles, laws and equations of strength of materials has been carried out for validation of the material selection of the new design system’s structure as well as verifying buckling, deflection & bending stresses, and moments.","manufacturing, hydraulics","In conlusion, the main objective of this research has been achieved through the design and development of the new proposed MHS that is capable of replacing the use of very big forklift trucks within indoor manufacturing companies. Large forklift trucks rely on ICE power source which unfortunately poses health risks to workers. ICE produces exhaust fumes (CO) while running. Exhaust fumes are harmful to human health. Therefore, the research beacame a success whereby a new proposed MHS has been designed using Autodesk Inventor Professional and material selection of the new design system’s components has been carried out and verified in relation with their strength & reliability properties. Through this paper and its engineering analysis, it is proven that the use of internal combustion engines in heavy duty handling systems that are operated within indoor manufactring factories and or internal logistics can be eliminated and replaced with an eco-friendly hydraulic systems technology. Therefore, this new system design promotes Occupational Health and Safety of people working in industrial areas where Bulk Material Handling systems are in place (Mafokwane, et al., 2019).
