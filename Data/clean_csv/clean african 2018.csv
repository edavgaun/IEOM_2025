0,Utilization Of Agro Waste Bio Adsorbents In Textile  Wastewater Treatment,"the textile industry generates huge amounts of wastewater which must be treated effectively in a bid to prevent water scarcity through re-use. in this chapter, the use of bio adsorbents from agricultural waste which included corn stalks, baggase and saw dust were used as bio adsorption carriers for textile water. bio adsorbents with particle size ranging from 200-1000µm and surface area of 500-1100 g/m2 were used to determine the effect of bio adsorbent size on textile wastewater treatment focusing on the total suspended solids (tss) and the chemical oxygen demand (cod). furthermore, the effect of bio adsorbent’s mass per unit volume with ranges between 1-5 g/l was also investigated on the impact from tss and cod reduction. tss and cod reduction by more than 70% were noted for increasing mass per unit volume in the textile water. however, an increase in the particle size of the bio adsorbent during textile treatment resulted in decreased efficiency of the tss and cod reduction. bio adsorbents present an attractive option which is easy to adapt for textile wastewater treatment.","agro waste, bio adsorbents, cod, textile wastewater",1800 1900 2000 2100 2200 2300 2400 2500 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Corn stalks Baggase Saw dust Bio adsorbent particle size (µm) TSS (mg/L) 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Corn stalks Baggase Saw dust COD (mg/L) Bio adsorbent particle size (µm) 2032,"m. m. manyuchi1,2* 1 bioenergy and environmental technology centre, department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa 2 department of chemical and processing engineering, faculty of engineering, manicaland state university of applied sciences, zimbabwe mercy.manyuchi@gmail.com; mmanyuchi@uj.ac.za c. mbohwa1 1 bioenergy and environmental technology centre, department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za e. muzenda1,3 1 bioenergy and environmental technology centre, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa 3department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology, botswana international university of science and technology, p bag 16, palapye, botswana emuzenda@uj.ac.za; muzendae@biust.ac.bw","References

1,Potential For Re-Refining Of Used Lubricating Oils For Reuse Using Zinc Dialkyl Dithiosulphate As An Additive,"used lubricating oils generated from automotive and process industries pose environmental hazards if not properly managed. in this study, the potential to re-refine used lubricants for reuse was investigated. used oil collected from a local garage was dehydrated at 240°c and varying pressure of 4-12bars under vacuum distillation. solvent extraction was employed using methyl ethyl ketone (mek) as a solvent with varying ratios from 2:1 to 6:1 at a mixing temperature of 60°c. mek and oils mixture underwent atmospheric distillation at 80 °c to allow separation of oils and mek. during the re-refining process, the amount of water removed, ash content, sulphur content, viscosity, specific gravity, flash point and pour point were measured. optimum oil yield of 94 (wt %) was achieved at a solvent to oil-ratio of 6:1. re-refining of used oils resulted in a 73% reduction in sulphur content, 76% reduction in ash content and 64% water removal. the re-refined oil’s viscosity of 90 cp, flash point of 160 °c, the specific gravity of 0.91 and pour point of -12°c. the re-refined used oils properties were almost similar to those of virgin oil using a combination of vacuum distillation and solvent extraction with an additive for maximum performance. re-refined oils employing zinc dialkyl © ieom society international 1357",,"Re-refining of used lubricating oils is essential for used oils management and recycling. Re-refined used lubricating oils exhibit almost the same characteristics of virgin oil in terms of the physicochemical parameters such as viscosity, pour point, specific gravity and flash point. This is achievable through vacuum distillation and solvent extraction with MEK with zinc dialkyl dithiosulphate being employed as an additive. Though re-refining used lubricants proved to be feasible at laboratory scale, the economic viability of the re-refining process needs to be investigated for scale up.","m. m. manyuchi bioenergy and environmental technology centre, department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa department of chemical and processing engineering, faculty of engineering, manicaland state university of applied sciences, zimbabwe * mercy.manyuchi@gmail.com t. nengiwa department of chemical and process systems engineering, school of engineering and technology, harare institute of technology, zimbabwe tatendanengiwa@gmail.com c. mbohwa bioenergy and environmental technology centre, department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za e. muzenda bioenergy and environmental technology centre, department of operations and quality management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering, faculty of engineering and technology, botswana international university of science and technology, p. bag 16, palapye, botswana emuzenda@uj.ac.za; muzendae@biust.ac.bw m. mpeta department of environmental engineering, faculty of engineering, chinhoyi university of technology, zimbabwe mibaureni@gmail.com","References

2,Situational Analysis For Producing Biomass Charcoal  Briquettes In Zimbabwe,,,"The domestic and industrial use of charcoal briquettes as a solid fuel Zimbabwe constitutes an important alternative that should be further developed as it allows for the economic revaluation of biomass waste and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Raw material for charcoal briquettes is locally available in abundance and technologies like torrefaction can be adopted for the manufacture of these briquettes. The chief raw material was found to be pine saw dust and baggase; however, other biomass feedstock includes sorghum spent grains from breweries across the country and charcoal fines from charcoal processing. The biomass briquetting technology presents positive results of higher bulk density, similar levels of calorific power, less moisture, and low levels of fixed carbon, chlorine and sulphur, promoting a healthier environment for the consumer and the environment. The energy content of biomass briquettes is considered sufficient for domestic and industrial use.

4,Junior Mining As Innovation Entrepreneurship In Minerals  Industry In South Africa,"south africa is well endowed with mineral resources which is estimated to be worth approximately us$2.5 trillion and is a leading producer of gold, platinum group metals, chromium, coal, iron ore, diamonds and vanadium. junior mining companies or “junior mining” as it is known today are exploration companies that search for new mineral deposits that are believed to have significant potential for finding larger mineral deposits. the junior mining sector however faces a number of challenges. these include access to finance for capital intensive prospective green and brown field mining projects and also the very high economic and technical risks. with the changing political climate within the country and global trends in the supply and demand of minerals and metals, it is foreseen that junior mining has a major role to play in the future as there are many potential undiscovered deposits. it is hence a space where both innovation and entrepreneurship are critical in order for these junior mining companies to not only achieve their medium to long terms goals but to also help attract much needed foreign investment into the country. this paper looks at the current status of junior mining in south africa, the challenges/gaps faced by the sector, opportunities for development and the role of both innovation and entrepreneurship in order to succeed in this difficult industry which is dictated by fluctuating commodity prices. recommendations will also be made on how this sector could be further improved and supported into the future.","entrepreneurship, innovation, investment, junior mining",With the country starting a “new dawn” there is much optimism within the mining sector even though there has been a decline over the last number of years. This however is seen as an opportunity of junior mining companies to play a major role in the identification of new mineral deposits. These companies however experience challenges. Lack of finance and investment is just one of them. They are also required to improve then technical and financial skills in order to stay ahead of the competition. Support systems and frameworks are required by both government and private sector in order to provide the assistance required and to help streamline processes and also reduce the risk involved in these type of project investments. If these areas that are identified are developed and assistance is provided by both government and private sector junior mining could be seen as the savior of the mining industry going forward with South Africa. The junior miner in order to succeed has to be innovative and must possess entrepreneurial qualities. Both innovation and entrepreneurship however involve risk. The use of innovative approaches poses a much greater 1897,"antoine f. mulaba-bafubiandi 1 1.mineral processing and technology research centre, department of metallurgy school of mining, metallurgy and chemical engineering, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa amulaba@uj.ac.za nirdesh singh1,2 2.small scale mining division, mintek randburg, johannesburg, south africa nirdeshs@mintek.co.za","References

The data from wearable tracking devices are representative of the real world and are not limited to a laboratory or clinical setting nor experimental time constraints. When used correctly this knowledge lends decision support to athletes, coaches, management teams and even urban planners that was not previously possible with the use of questionnaires, surveys and self-reported training loads.

7,The Bleeding Edge Of It Project Methodology,"there is abundant theory concerning the tailoring of project management methodologies, specifically as it pertains to ‘what’ tailoring is and ‘what’ the outcomes of tailoring ought to be. there are works that describe the process at a high level and there are also a sizable amount of papers reporting on the successful fusion of disparate project management methodologies. whereas the ‘what’ of selection, tailoring and fusion is well described, it is argued that tools, methods and theory supporting, guiding and describing ‘how’ to conduct tailoring presents an opportunity for the delivery of unique and valuable contributions to the profession. in the proposed presentation, a holistic approach to addressing these concerns are introduced, from which unique and valuable theories, methods and tools stem. a multi-level model of project management for large, complex projects is proposed following an investigation into 29 main project management methodologies. agile methodologies, in particular, describe the project as a defined initiative that can be viewed and interpreted from one level – the project’s level. some traditional methodologies allow for sub-projects and master projects, but it is argued that these approaches still fall short of providing the possibility of optimal customization. as an example in summary: a large, complex project may deliver defined functions at various levels within the organization – infrastructure and software development by the it team; marketing and training by the project sponsor’s business unit; and compliance by the company’s legal arm. furthermore, ‘above’ the organization, certain functions may be required to adhere to processes defined by the regulator. third party suppliers, ‘below’ the organization, may benefit from clear guidance as to how their unique process will be required to adhere to the methodology of the organization’s it team. the multi-level model allows for freedom of process at each level, while specifying the project governance needs between the levels. this produces seamless integration and reduced risk, while providing more freedom to the delivery of each function. in aid of the selection, tailoring and fusion of customized project management methodologies, a methodology comparison tool, or framework, and a hands-on guide to tailoring is proposed. the tool contains the defining characteristics of each of the 29 main project management methodologies. a methodology can be selected for analysis, at the requested level of detail. multiple methodologies can be compared for mutually inclusive and exclusive characteristics. furthermore, through a process of compression, methodologies can be compared by viewing only their differentiating characteristics. this advises the selection of a base, or master, methodology. the selected methodology can then be reinforced with the mutually inclusive characteristics of other methodologies. the guide to tailoring describes these steps and the requisite knowledge that stakeholders are expected to provide to the process in order to produce a methodology that caters for the perceived complexity and risk of projects, while being as lean as possible. using this tool and guide, a customized methodology can be created for the organization, for a business unit, for a portfolio, for a program’s projects, for each individual project or even for each function delivered at a specific level, as per the multi-level model. finally. in response to the need to progress beyond the design and development of solutions and to also provide for the implementation and take-up of solutions, the development of a guide to the implementation of enhancements into the it project management landscape, specifically, is proposed. this is done by building on the methods and lessons learned from itil implementations. this proposition and its benefits promises improved implementation success and take up, and reduced change fatigue endured in an",,,"steyn de wet, wynand van dyk and corne schutte stellenbosch university south africa",
8,Business Process Reengineering During Technology  Implementation In Power Plants,"business process reengineering (bpr) aims to challenge and assist organisations to break away from old ways of conducting business processes and embrace new ways to execute business processes. the implementation of new technology allows organisations to improve and simplify methods of executing business processes. despite this, the possible benefits provided by new technology are not achieved when ineffective and outdated business processes are reapplied to execute business operational activities even though technology provides alternative ways of executing business processes. the purpose of this research is to confirm why the benefits provided by new technology are not achieved when technology is implemented without correctly reengineering existing business processes. the research investigates if there are any gaps in the bpr methods applied in power plants during new technology implementation. the research also establishes which bpr success factors are not successfully incorporated when new technology is implemented. the research uses two case studies within the same organisation to evaluate how bpr is conducted during new technology implementation. the research found that if business processes are not reengineered according to best practices and all success factors are not successfully incorporated during new technology, the benefits that the technology provides are not achieved.","technology, eskom ltd",,"t. buthelezi, a. marnewick postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg, south africa thamsanqab@gmail.com, amarnewick@uj.ac.za","References

9,A Review Of The Application Of Gis In Biomass And Solid  Waste Supply Chain Optimization: Gaps And Opportunities For,"the application of gis enhanced modelling techniques in biomass and solid waste supply chain problems is hinged on a common denominator for both systems: the scattered nature of supply points and variability of resource quantities. since the sustainability of bioenergy or waste-to-energy projects around these resources will be affected significantly by the cost of supplying them, it is important to optimize decisions around facility location, size and transport routes. gis is an important tool that can be used to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of the biomass and waste. it can then be used alone or integrated with other software tools, for strategic and tactical level optimization of biomass and solid waste supply chains. in as much as a lot of progress has been made globally in research and application of gis enhanced modelling techniques in biomass and solid waste supply chains, developing nations have trailed behind. this explains why spatial and temporal waste or biomass statistics are not readily available in these areas. this paper reviews recent developments in the application of gis in biomass and solid waste supply chain models, with the ultimate objective of identifying the gaps and opportunities that exist. it is especially biased towards the use of the biomass and waste in renewable or waste to energy schemes- a fast growing field within the green economy.","waste, bioenergy, supply chain",,"developing nations gratitude charis, gwiranai danha and edison muzenda 1department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering, college of engineering and technology, botswana international university of science and technology, plot 10071, boseja ward, private bag 16 palapye, botswana. gratitude.charis@studentmail.biust.ac.bw, dangag@biust.ac.bw, muzendae@biust.ac.bw",
10,Factors That Affect Implementation Of Green Public Procurement In  Local Government: A Case Study In The City Of Johannesburg,"green public procurement (gpp) in south african local government is still at its infancy stage. the municipalities of city of johannesburg (coj), cape town, ethekwini, ekurhuleni, nelson mandela bay and tshwane (all members of international council for local government initiatives (iclei) committed in 2002 at the world conference on sustainable development (wssd) to pursue some form of gpp, however none of these municipalities has developed a fully-fledged policy on gpp. gpp is one of the new strategies that are being adopted globally to assist local governments in providing solutions for sustainable development and to embrace the green economy through the implementation of long-term sustainable policies and strategies. the incorporation of green procurement elements into current supply chain policies of municipalities can be the first and most inexpensive step in achieving a successful green procurement programs. municipalities spend a large portion of their budget on procurement and if they use their purchasing power by choosing to procure environmentally friendly goods and services, they can make an important contribution to sustainable consumption and production. the integration of green criteria in local government procurement would provide opportunities for: improved efficiency, reduced resource use, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cost savings and enhanced environmental and social outcomes. the aim of the research was to determine factors that affect implementation of gpp practices in local government and it concludes that there is a need to confront lack of knowledge and training as critical in driving the implementation of gpp. key words green public procurement, bid specification, cost of green products, training and awareness and management practices i. introduction the term “green public procurement” is still an emerging concept and it has been explained in different ways, one definition is that it is “a process whereby public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works with a reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared to goods, services and works with the same primary function that would otherwise be procured” (european commission, 2011) municipalities spend a large portion of their budget on procurement and if they use their purchasing power by choosing to procure environmentally friendly goods and services, they can make an important contribution to sustainable consumption and production, or what is called green public procurement (gpp) or green purchasing. the integration of green criteria in local government procurement thus would provide opportunities for: improved efficiency, reduced resource use, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cost savings and enhanced environmental and social outcomes. (green procurement by local government: a review of sustainability criteriaheather zeppel).gpp is one of the new strategies that are being adopted globally to assist local governments in providing solutions for sustainable development and to embrace the green economy through the implementation of long-term sustainable policies and strategies. the incorporation of green procurement elements into current supply chain policies of municipalities can be the first and most inexpensive step in achieving a successful green procurement programs. there are numerous factors that are affecting implementation of gpp in many local authorities in south africa such as price, availability, and insufficient knowledge, lack of political commitment, purchasing habits, no acceptable alternative to current product and no ‘green’ specifications provided by supplier amongst other challenges.",,"The research aimed to determine the factors that affect the implementation of green procurement practices in local government in the City of Johannesburg and provide the recommendations to the council.

16,Adjudging The Efficacy Of Total Productive Maintenance:  Case Study,"this research study was undertaken to implement and adjudge the efficacy of total productive maintenance at case study organization which is public utility oil firm. the study utilized both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, periodic plant visits and a maintenance department analysis (mda) tool for benchmarking and reviewing the company’s maintenance status at one of their major depot facility major. the average score from the mda obtained was 2.3 and showed potential areas to be improved when formulating the tpm strategy for the company. other methods such as the abc analysis for critical equipment identification were also used in this study, and key performance indicators data for calculating availability performance (ap) and overall equipment effectiveness (oee) were identified as well. the oee was found to be 77% and a people focused model for tpm formulated with the purpose of increasing the oee value to the target world class level of 85% as well as achieving the desired state. 1. introduction effective maintenance and asset management are a high leverage contributor to business profitability, through it impact on critical areas such as; safety, product quality, equipment capacity, health and the environment, and also the cost of production (bentley, 2016). maintenance is defined as all actions appropriate for retaining equipment in, or restoring it to, a given condition (dhillon, 2002). the company has for been using two main maintenance strategies - breakdown maintenance and preventive maintenance, which however have not been effective enough as equipment failures are rapid and instantaneous leading to a much lower productivity than expected. tpm is not only a modern maintenance practice but also a system (culture) that takes advantage of the abilities and skills of individuals in an organization in order to attain maintenance effectiveness thus keeping costs as low as possible while improving equipment and machine efficiency. currently, most of the plant equipment failures are attended by external vendors which are proving to be very costly. tpm is a modern maintenance technique which suits well an environment with automation and technological advancements, and since its pillar approach includes employee training, this calls for multi-skilled and revitalized employees who will not only be involved in plant maintenance but also have knowledge as to why they are doing so. if tpm is well implemented, equipment operates without breakdowns, everyone’s work is easier, and the company is more profitable, and working conditions are improved. 2. justification in today’s world of vast technological advancements, a great number of companies regardless of how much productivity and profits made in previous years, there is still need to be better and to reach maximum potential, as their survival depends on how they rapidly innovate and improve. total productive maintenance (tpm) is part of the benchmarking efforts seen or identified as the best in class manufacturing improvement process and is defined 1899",,"The purpose for this research was to formulate a TPM strategy which best suits the petroleum handling case study firm, and then adjudge its efficacy by considering one of its branches (depots) as a working station representing the company as a whole. By lowering the scope on one depot instead of five, the idea was to minimize the timeframe and the workload on the research part. A case study was carried out and the maintenance system analyzed through an MDA questionnaire obtained from other TPM studies on similar industries across the globe. The MDA score was found to be 2.3 on scale of 1-4, which when compared with other companies such it is a fair score (Gustav Fredriksson, Hanna Larsson, 2012). After analyzing the maintenance department at the case study firm, the weak and strong areas which showed that the company has a great potential for improvement were identified especially in the areas such as Reliability engineering, Maintenance Work orders, Operator maintenance, CMMS and Financial Planning. The critical equipment was also identified through the use of the ABC classification model and analyzed for Availability Performance and Overall Equipment Effectiveness of which the results were as follows.

17,A Systems Engineering Framework For Small Scale Rural  Community Engagement Projects: A Case Study,"small scale rural community engagement projects which are conducted by engineers fail on occasions as a result of a range of factors such as poor management, a lack of monitoring and evaluation and most importantly, not taking into account social elements. a structured approach on conducting small scale rural community engagement projects is hypothesized in this paper as a solution to improve the success of small scale rural community engagement projects. the paper shows the design of a systems engineering framework for the conducting of small scale rural community engagement projects, incorporating social elements and verification procedures to assess the strengths and weaknesses of such projects which could assist in ensuring project success. the framework was applied to a case study and validated on an applicable rural community - based project. an impact assessment was conducted and data analyzed statistically, proved the validity of the framework through means of measuring indicators. the impact assessment revealed that further work was required in the area of maintenance and knowledge transfer but was successful in meeting the needs of the community and dealing with social issues while the framework was being applied to the community-based project, gwakwani.",impact assessment,"The developed framework aimed to aid in developing solutions to solve social issues between engineers and communities and in so doing achieve project success. A Systems Engineering framework was designed to ensure the social requirements were met during a typical small scale community engagement project (approached by engineers) and at the same time integrating the necessary stages of the engineering project life cycle. Together with the implementation of the framework into the community and a verification and validation stage of the case study, an accurate solution could be deduced. The framework covered a number of community engagements which allowed the project team to continuously interact with the community, encouraging the community to be a part of the development. The framework incorporated a standard technology design methodology but included a number of community processes. Social processes allowed the project team to feel a sense of responsibility and gain a better understanding of the community’s needs and the future plans intended. The work presented shows the design and implementation of a community engagement framework capable of increasing the chances of project success for engineers conducting community engagement projects, through the integration of multiple social processes into a common engineering life cycle process. Based on the findings from the case study, a number of recommendations could be made namely, project teams can conduct thorough community assessments in order to determine accurate user requirements and to also inform the community around maintenance and safety of the systems installed.","rene naidoo, johan meyer, sune von solms department of electrical and electronic engineering science university of johannesburg johannesburg, 2000, south africa renenelec@gmail.com, johanm@uj.ac.za, svonsolms@uj.ac.za",
18,The Socio-Economic Implication Of 2Nd Generation Biofuels In  Southern Africa: A Critical Review,"this article summarises some of the major findings and developments on global 2g biofuels’ research in a non-chronological order. this was done in order to give a highlight on some of the potential implications these findings could have on southern africa’s decision making processes, given its abundant lignocellulosic biomass resources and residues. before specific feasibility studies can be made on a country- to country basis, this overview can give a glimpse into some potential opportunities and hurdles for such waste-to-biofuels systems from a socio-economic perspective. the findings indicate that biofuels demand is increasing around the globe, and it is envisaged that 2nd generation (2g) biofuels will gain a larger market share compared to 1st generation (1g) due to their vast availability, limited interference with food security and ecological benefits. southern africa will have to take advantage of the abundance of biomass, especially lignocellulosic residues from forestry and agriculture and create room for the transfer of some promising, demonstrated or commercialised technologies. the largest opportunity for the 2g biofuels will be from waste feedstocks like crop and forest residues, organic fraction of municipal solid waste (msw), black liquor and other wood process wastes. issues of limited supply and associated conversion costs will have to be considered along with the supplementary options to determine the socio-economic sustainability of such waste-to-biofuels ventures. lessons will have to be drawn from socio-economic shortcomings of 2g biodiesel jatropha projects to ascertain the viability of feedstock supply chains, right choice of conversion technologies and proper projection of potential socio-economic impacts.","biomass, residues, biofuels, 2nd generation, socio-economic","Research and development in 2G biofuels is steadily gathering momentum; more recent forecasts already predict that they should occupy at least 18% of all biofuels by 2035 [6]. Older forecasts had predicted that first and second generation biofuels would have a 50/50 share by 2022 [41], however supply chain viability and technological setbacks slowed down the pace for demonstrating the sustainability of 2G biofuel production. The past 5 years, however, have shown fast rising interest in this research area (Fig 1), supported by the rate at which demonstration and commercialization projects have sprung up. Cellulosic ethanol commercial production tripled between 2009-2012, while HVO quickly clinched 2.4% of biofuels production since its launch in 2008 [6]. Companies like Lanza Tech and Ineos Bio have launched demonstration plants for the fermentation of syngas using a mixture of residues and industrial waste gases as feedstock, with promising results [8]. Although Jatropha disappointed in some cases, the energy and momentum has encouraged further research and helped characterize what should form a part of feasibility studies for 2G biofuel ventures [33]. Given all such developments, the landscape for 2G biofuels development is becoming brighter and the R&D output can now better guide policies and decision making going into the future.","gratitude charis, gwiranai danha, edison muzenda department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering, college of engineering and technology, botswana international university of science and technology, plot 10071, boseja ward, private bag 16 palapye, botswana. corresponding author: gratitude charis gratitude.charis@studentmail.biust.ac.bw , danhag@biust.ac.bw, muzendae@biust.ac.bw edison muzenda department of chemical engineering in the faculty of engineering and built environment, university of johannesburg po box 524 auckland park, 2006 johannesburg, south africa",
19,Quality Management In The South African Public  Procurement System,"total quality management principles stress the role of supplier evaluation as a pivotal component of ensuring product or service quality. it is the task of the procurement function to evaluate different suppliers and to select the supplier that will provide good quality product/service at a reasonable price. in the public sector, the supplier selection process is more complicated as there are regulations and legislative frameworks that need to be adhered to. in the south african public procurement system, multiple sourcing through the tendering system, is utilised. potential suppliers are invited to bid for contracts and get evaluated based on set criteria. the preferential procurement policy framework provides guidelines for the criteria to be used in adjudicating public tenders. quality/functionality is part of the set criteria. there are various methodologies used to assess functionality in public tenders and all those methodologies have their own advantages and disadvantages. using document analysis, this paper will assess how functionality is utilised and assessed in the south african public procurement regime to determine winning bids. public tender notice documents were reviewed, and thematic analyses of the data carried out and presented. the results of the study can be used to determine the effectiveness of these methodologies in the management of quality in south african public institutions",,"arrived at, are those of the authors and are not necessarily to be attributed to the DST-NRF-TWAS.","bongumusa mansuette bhekamalinda cebekhulu, paul a. ozor and charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa musa.ceb@gmail.com, pozor@uj.ac.za, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","references of public clients in traditional and design-build

20,Numerical Analysis Of The Onset Of The Vapor-Liquid Phase In  A Single Horizontal Low Carbon Steel Water Tube.,"boiler tube failures occur in steam generation boilers due to subcritical short term overheating (sto). in general, sub-critical sto occurs when design parameters are often marginally and critically discounted. this leads to frequent failures of the boiler tubes that affect the sustainability of power generation. a commercial computational fluid dynamics (cfd) software, ansys fluent 19.0® (multiphase flow), was used to successfully analyze the locations where the phase boundary of energy transfer on the tube material occurs. a number of heat transfer velocity parameter changes were numerically analyzed to determine the integrity operating window in which the tube could perform, with further analysis done to predict the useful life when operating in this sub-critical sto zone. numerical analysis is limited to a horizontal carbon steel water tube of 36.6mm id operating at 17.6mpa with a uniform heat flux.","in supercritical, once-through, and drum units","With an increase in fluid temperature within the flow domain, it is clear that heat transfer increases within the fluid as velocity increases. It would be clear that point of low to no water (liquid) fraction would result in heat not being taken away from the tube wall directly related to the domain position, as water has a higher heat transfer capacity compared to that of water (vapor) with most points being at superheat. With lower heat flux input, longer lengths of tube can be utilized in applications without the risk of short tube life. Analysis is fairly comparable with published literature, and previous works, but would require additional tests at various heat fluxes and velocities to be able to scrutinize critical velocities against certain temperatures. The flow maps noted are similar in nature to that of works published by LiLi et al (2012) and Yu et al (2013) indicating bubble generation moving to the upper wall of the tube, with the bulk mass flow being moved to the bottom of the tube, with a near-perfect turbulent flow regime. This analysis indicates how critical maximum flow velocities have effect on the heat transfer coefficients with a flow domain, with turbulent flow instability having great effect on the material wall temperatures. Horizontal boiler tubing are at higher risk that vertical tubing for steam blanketing/ departure from nucleate boiling, due to the effects of buoyancy on the steam bubble generation. A higher degree of tube temperature and internal flow dynamics is required to ensure safe operation of the boiler tubing. Installation of thermocouples on the horizontal boiler tubing will indicate real-time tube wall temperatures, which in turn would provide data to accurately predict remaining useful life of the tubing during excursions. This can be linked to a master fuel trip, or boiler de-loading logic when or if tube wall temperatures are increasing out of its reliable operating window. This will allow for root cause analysis to be performed for system upsets, without further exposing the tubes to this out-of-design operating temperatures. Tubing should also be fitted with orifices specifically sized to give the most optimal fluid velocities across the wide range of flow requirements for the boiler outputs as required by the turbine. The higher the steam demand at the turbine, the higher the heat input and flow rate requirements within the boiler. Heat input can be drastically optimized to ensure that only the required amount for the steam generation is required. Soot cleaning within the furnace allows for higher heat intake within the lower furnace regions at the vertical walls, which would in turn, reduce the amount of heat the horizontal tubes above the furnace are exposed to. Burner alignment should also be optimized to decrease the likelihood of direct flame impingement on tubing which could reduce the cooling abilities of a specific section of tubing within the flow loop. 120","jarryd wyngaard, thokozane kunene, lagouge tartibu faculty of engineering and built environment (febe) university of johannesburg auckland park, jhb, po box 524, rsa jarrydwyngaard@gmail.com, tkunene@uj.ac.za, ltartibu@uj.ac.za","References

21,An Investigation Into The Sustainability Of Advance  Payment On Public Construction Projects Delivery,"within the past 12 years in ondo state, nigeria, three different percentages (60%, 50% and 30%) of the contract sum have been adopted as advance payment (ap) for construction contractors. this paper therefore investigated the sustainability of ap to construction project based on the survey of 127 respondents. the data used were collected via questionnaire with high reliability values of 0.830 and 0.780. the results of the study revealed that advance payment had positive and significant effects on the contractors’ net cash flows including cost and time performance of projects thereby implying ap’s sustainability. it is hereby recommended that the clients and consultants should continue the usage of advance payment on construction projects as it has solved the financial problem of contractors while the current government policy of 30 percent of the contract sum as ap should be maintained because majority of the contractors have cash surplus at an average of 28 percent of the contract sum. also advance repayment deduction should be made to span through the contract duration or when the actual performance on site reaches 85% as against the contractual provision for four equal installment repayments of 25%. lastly, the contractors should be made to stock-pile materials that are susceptible to price fluctuation immediately the contract is signed and ap granted.","advance payment, contractors, project delivery","The study has been able to identify the most important reasons justifying the sustainability of the use of advance payment in construction projects. The results provided information to clients, consultants and contractors on the effects of advance payment on the contractor’s cash flow; particularly in terms of AP’s positive and significant effects on the contractors’ net cash flows thereby solving the financial problem of the contractor. It has also established that advance payment impacts significantly on the cost and time performance of construction projects in Ondo State. Construction clients and consultants involved in project planning and execution should ensure that relevant needs/uses for advance payment as discovered through this study are considered in the implementation of advance payment policy and included in the contract while the contractors should also be made to comply with the needs/uses so stated in their contracts. It was discovered that the need to assist the contractor in stock-piling materials required for the project is the second most important factor supporting the need/use for advance payment, the client and consultant should endeavour to ascertain the relevant materials that are susceptible to price fluctuation which would be handed over to the contractor as part of the utilization of the advance payment immediately the contract is signed. This would assist in monitoring the use of the fund. The study further revealed that advance payment has positive impact on the contractor’s cash flow, and cost and time performance of construction projects; thereby corroborating the fact that advance payment solves the financial problem of contractors. Therefore, clients and consultants should continue to use advance payment in their construction projects. The study showed that majority of the contractors have cash surplus (positive cash flow) at an average of 28 percent of the contract sum granted them as advance payment which is a confirmation of the adequacy, sufficiency and sustainability of the current government policy of 30 percent of the contract sum as advance payment in the state. This policy should be continued and maintained in all public construction projects in the state. The study revealed that advance repayment (APR) has significant relationship with the contractor’s net cash flow. Therefore, advance repayment deduction should be made much more convenient by allowing it to span the contract duration or at best to be concluded when actual performance on site reaches 85% as against the contractual provision for deduction by four equal times of 25%. This would enhance the net cash flow of contractors; thereby assisting in solving the financial problem of contractors during construction process. 1395","isaac olaniyi aje and olufisayo adewumi adedokun department of quantity surveying school of environmental technology federal university of technology, akure, nigeria fisayoadedokun@gmail.com","References

22,Walking/Working Surface ‘System Integrity’  Considerations During Maintenance,"having ‘solid ground’ to walk and stand upon is among the most fundamental workplace expectations in most environments. with certain notable exceptions, workers do not consciously assess each step to ensure that the surface they are walking upon is stable enough to support them. rather, there is a subconscious assurance that workers experience when leaving ‘solid ground’ to walk on stairs, ladders, ramps, elevated structures, catwalks, grating, and covers, that the surface is designed and constructed in accordance with industry standards. this presentation discusses the removal and reinstallation of a section in a grated elevated catwalk, and what can happen when organizations do not recognize and adhere to the concept of system integrity (si) during routine and unplanned maintenance operations. it is paramount for supervisors and managers to have situational awareness during evolutions causing any system to be in other than a configuration it was initially designed for. particular care must be taken to ensure new hazards are not introduced into the system inadvertently. these concepts are presented in a case study involving a workplace fatality.","system integrity, latent hazards, control of work",,"gerard a. davis, phd, csp, cpe department of industrial and systems engineering samuel ginn college of engineering auburn university, al 36849-5346, usa davisga@auburn.edu",

Different researchers use different forecast models. To use ARIMA model to perform forecast, one must check for stationarity, seasonality and trend of a time series. If it is not stationarity, it has to be made stationary by applying some transformation techniques such as differencing, reciprocals or logs functions. If it is seasonal and has trend (up or down), it must be de-seasonalized using seasonal differencing and de-trend using 1406","chim chwee wong lkc faculty of engineering and science, universiti tunku abdul rahman, kuala lumpur, malaysia wongcc@utar.edu.my junichi kishigami department of information and electronic engineering, muroran institute of technology, hokkaido, japan jay@kishigami.net","References

25,Design Of Thick Porridge Mixing   Agitator For Commercial Kitchens,"the research study looked at coming up with a cheaper design of a mealie-meal thick porridge agitator cooking process which could be used in commercial kitchens. the design was generated to handle the effective stirring as the porridge becomes thicker and becomes increasingly difficult to stir around. agitator design concepts were generated and evaluated for suitability and robustness. a detailed design was undertaken to come up with a 200 litre capacity thick porridge agitator, which can reduce cooking time to 45 minutes after the boiling of the water. it has also to be fabricated and installed at a cost of less than usd5000. 1. introduction in today’s modern kitchen different equipment has been designed with the aim to improve the process of cooking food (taylay&fransials,2004). in the region the preparation of thick mealie meal porridge has remained the same over the ages. the popular meal is mostly prepared manually though out a number of countries in southern africa. this has been observed to be a challenge when it comes to preparing the meal for a large numbers of people. at universities, hotels, boarding schools and hospitals in zimbabwe, large volumes of thick porridge are consumed per day since it is the staple food. regardless of the large consumption, the process is still done manually, and kitchen staff use long flat wooden poles to mix when preparing the thickened porridge. this type of work is usually done by men rather than women because a lot of upper body strength and stamina is required. as such cooks often take turns or use two poles to speed up the process of preparing the porridge. the conventional way of preparing thick porridge was found to be long, tedious and laborious and inadequately hygienic. hence there is need to improve the quality and process of preparing thick porridge in an enclosed environment to minimise external contaminating factors for bulk food preparation. the design of a mechanical agitator would go a long way in assisting with the mixing and as it would reduce human effort required when preparing thick porridge particularly in a commercial set up environment. 2. justification the agitator would continuously mix the mealie meal throughout the whole cooking process to achieve improved heat transfer and reduce inconsistency of the thick porridge within the container. other than ensuring uniform consistency throughout the large pot, the agitator would create the required convenience in reducing meal preparation time for other pressing activities. this would be enabled by improved the heat transfer throughout the material contains as heat is evenly distributed from the top to the bottom of the pot. the entire process of preparing of thick porridge is done under a closed pot to avoid any contamination while cooking. a number of countries in the southern africa development community (sadc) region may be interested in using this agitator cooker design if it to be commercially available. 124",,"The design study was based on the fluid mechanics theory, design principles to available agitators and cooking methods already being used in the commercial kitchens. It also took a look at the agitator components, mechanism and power sources in the design process. The use of the thick porridge agitator concept can be a valuable design and will go a long in savings on labour required and time taken in the preparation of the meal for public entities. Limited research has been conducted in improving the method of preparing thick porridge however with the help of this design there is hope that other designers can take up this challenge and manufacture a more efficient and cost effective thick porridge cooker.","ignatio madanhire, kumbi mugwindiri and tanyaradzwa virukai university of zimbabwe, department of mechanical engineering, p.o box mp167, mt pleasant, harare, zimbabwe imadanhire@eng.uz.ac.zw charles mbohwa university of johannesburg, department of quality management and operations management, p. o. box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa. cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
26,Performance Comparison Of Loose Biomass Briquettes  Produced Using Cow Dung And Cactus Binders,"in this work, loose biomass briquettes were produced using cow dung and cactus binders at various compaction pressures. comparison is made of the briquettes produced using these binders with respect to their final bulk densities and moisture content. yellow thatching grass, groundnut shells, sugar cane leaves, mopani leaves and combinations recipe were used for briquetting. the objective was to identify a natural binder, which produces the best quality loose biomass briquettes. results show alternating improvements between lower and higher compaction pressures on bulk densities. briquettes with cow dung binder showed a good bulk density increment from low to high compaction pressures. at 6mpa, combined recipe had a density of 0.305 kg/m3, 0.333 kg/m3 at 12 mpa and 0.386 kg/m3 at 19 mpa. the lowest bulk density was for yellow thatching grass under 6 mpa compaction pressure but with a good increment on bulk density ranging from 0.236 kg/m3 at 6 mpa, 0.256 kg/m3 at 12 mpa and 0.285 kg/m3 at 19 mpa. cactus briquettes were found to be insensitive to compaction pressure while pressure was found to be a critical parameter in producing quality briquettes when using cow dung binder. cactus bonded briquettes achieved the highest bulk density of 0.375 kg/m3 on combination recipe and a maximum energy content of 16.49 mj/kg.","biomass briquettes, density, moisture content","Two types of briquettes produced using cow dung and cactus binders were compared for their performance. Factors such as density, moisture content, were monitored and compared. Briquettes made with cow dung binder found to perform better in all criteria with longer combustion time compared to cactus binders. Compaction pressure was found to be a key parameter in the performance of cow dung briquettes. When the pressure increased, an improvement with respect to bulk density, energy content was achieved. During combustion, briquettes with highest improved bulk density and energy content combusted the longest at average of 200 minute with average burn rate of 0.5 g/min. ground nut shells, Mopani leaves and combined recipe with cow dung as a binder performed better that cactus bonded briquettes. Briquettes with cactus binder exhibited lowest bulk density. Lower bulk density on cactus briquettes might have influenced the final lower bulk density and calorific values. 138","mikateko reuben shuma and daniel makundwaneyi madyira department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg corner kingsway and university road auckland park 2000 johannesburg, south africa mshuma@uj.ac.za, dmadyira@uj.ac.za","References

27,Customer Pairwise Fit Matrix Approach To Grouping Of  Customers For Garment Sizing,"the garment manufacturing industry is reported to be experiencing customer complains of misfit. studies on this problem seem not to have provided solutions that satisfy customers and manufacturers of clothing. in this study, customer pairwise fit matrix (cpf) was explored to group a given customers population for the purpose of garment sizing. a mathematical fit function expressed as percentage fit (pf) between pair of customers was developed, cpf matrix for a number of customers indicating the degree of fit between any pair of customers was derived. a grouping algorithm from literature was adapted with the cpf matrix to divide a given population of customers to garment sizes, and demonstrated using garment anthropometric data related to trousers of 100 male potential customers in nigeria. the results obtained for the pf between any pair of customers indicated 3 possible results of „no fit‟ (pf = 0.0%), „partial fit‟ (0.0% < pf <100%) and „perfect fit‟ (pf=100%). the outcome of the adapted algorithm to the 100 potential customers led to 19 set of customers but 18 sizes appeared to give the „best‟ possible fit of 99.31%. the procedure developed in this work may be useful for sizing of larger customer population and any garment type.",garment,"In this study, the possibility of solving garment sizing problem through Customer Pairwise Fit (CPF) matrix was explored. An attempt was made to identify garment sizing parameters and variables which led to a quantitative definition of fit formulated as CPF matrix indicating the degree of fit between any pair of customers in terms of the garment sizing parameters. The sizing problem was then defined as that of segregating a given customers population with known garment anthropometric data into sub-groups who will use the same size with the goal of maximizing fit. To test the feasibility of this approach, a sizing system for 100 potential customers population in Nigeria was developed. The results gave 99.31% fit which appears reasonable enough. The proposed method could be applied to larger customers population and different clothing. 6.0 Acknowledgement The authors would like to acknowledge the funding received from MacArthur Doctoral Research Grant Support of the University of Ibadan, Nigeria in carrying out this study. 6.0","1,2adekunle kolawole and 1oliver ekepre charles-owaba 1department of industrial and production engineering, university of ibadan, ibadan, nigeria kolawole_adekunle@yahoo.co.uk or k.kolawole@mail1.ui.edu.ng, oeowaba@yahoo.com 2department of mechanical engineering, landmark university, omu-aran, kwara state, nigeria kolawole.adekunle@lmu.edu.ng",
28,Influence Of The Consultants Related Factors On The  Performance Of Selected Tertiary Educational Building,"among the various factors that predispose teb projects to cost and time overruns, consultant related factors have been fingered as one to be recognized. others include contractor related, owner related and external factors. in order to achieve the aim of this study, which is to determine the order of influence of the consultants related factors on the performance of selected teb projects, mean item score and student t-test were used for the analysis. the perceptions of key construction stakeholders from 4 selected tertiary institutions, chosen consequent upon the record indicating a huge allocation received by these institutions from the federal government for capital projects, in the southwestern part of nigeria were sought. the reliability analysis carried out on the constructs show values of 0.862 and 0.946. it was found that delayed supervision & slowness in making decisions coupled with the absence of consultant’s site staff are the top two consultants related factors that predisposed teb projects to cost and time overruns. the factors cut across the teb projects procured under both open and selective competitive tendering methods. timely supervision with quick and prompt decision making therefore enhances building projects performance.",cost overrun,,"(teb) projects in nigeria deborah oluwafunke adedokun department of building & quantity surveying college of environmental sciences joseph ayo babalola university, ikeji-arakeji, nigeria funkedairo@gmail.com","REFERENCES

29,Thin Films In Tribology  Resego R Phiri1 And O. Philip Oladijo1.2,"this article examines tribology. more emphasis is on the effect of wear on engineering materials as it is an important and costly aspect of engineering industries. wear degradation is one of the most failure mode incurring millions of funds by maintenance and replacement in modern industries. apart from lubricants, thin film deposition technologies are well established for the improvement of wear resistance in high friction operations. there have been a widespread of hard coatings such as diamond and diamond- like carbon coatings for tribological applications in the last decades. however, the limitation of such coatings is that plastic deformation of such hard coatings begins from the substrate material. this is because the wear mechanisms of the material will depend on the mechanical properties such as hardness and ductility of the substrate and the coating. in depth knowledge of the macro-mechanical mechanisms dominating the tribological process are discussed. different wear mechanisms are briefly reviewed with respect to their effect on substrate-film system and hardness. the influence of the thin film deposition method employed and the surface treatment used on the tribological properties of the coated materials are discussed.","tribology, wear degradation","Application and implementation of good tribological practices provide high economic benefits by reducing energy losses due to friction, loss due to the depreciation of machines and breakdowns. Surface modification methods are amongst other methods of improving materials against wear degradation. These methods influence the properties and applicability of the thin film depending on the environment of operation. A wide range of thin film deposition methods is available also selected depending on the desired final properties. Wear mechanisms failure modes, susceptible environmental operations and factors affecting the tribological behavior of the films have to be taken into considerate during thin film deposition of coatings. 145","1department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering botswana international university of science and technology private bag 16, palapye, botswana resego.phiri@studentmail.biust.ac.bw, seyiphilip@gmail.com esther t. akinlabi2 2department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg auckland park, kingsway campus, johannesburg, south africa etakinlabi@uj.ac.za","References

30,A Resource Allocation Problem Under Risk Conditions  Mahsa Ghandehari,"we considered a situation in which some projects should be chosen in a limited budget. without any defending project, the loss is dependent on the specific site and the type and intensity of undesirable event. each project which needs a certain amount of investment to implement is suitable for a subset of sites and has specific impact on loss depending on the event. it is supposed that for a specific site and project, the value of loss is a decreasing function in amount of investment. first, the probabilistic and strategic risk is considered separately then in final model, both of them are considered simultaneously. as there are many common projects which can support two kinds of risks, the problem is selecting projects to minimize the total expected loss from two different kinds of risks. these three problems are formulated as integer linear programming. an example has been solved and sensitivity analysis has been done. the results show that facing strategic risk, the weakest site has the highest priority to reinforce in order to decrease total loss but in order to reduce the loss originated from probabilistic risks, it should be strengthened the sites found by solving a knapsack problem.","portfolio selection, strategic risk, probabilistic risk",,"department of management university of isfahan isfahan, iran m.ghandehari@ase.ui.ac.ir mohammad hossein golkhani-dorbati management research center, university of isfahan, isfahan, iran mh.golkhani@yahoo.com",
31,A Systematic Literature Review Of The Agile Methodology  Applied During Construction Project Design,"the civil construction industry is diverse as it includes various clients like property builders, property engineers, material providers, and contractual workers. the construction industry brings cost-viable building improvements wherein every one of these clients has a dynamic role to make the contract and project a success. the construction industry plays an important role in the infrastructure and economy of a country as well as the livelihood of people. most infrastructure projects throughout the civil engineering industry, are struggling with cost and schedule overrun which can be caused by various internal and external factors. this paper aims to determine the possibilities of using agile methodologies in the design phase of a civil engineering project to mitigate cost and schedule overrun and to improve the delivery of the design phase. a systematic literature review was conducted using nine electronic databases, which produced 2440 articles. after conducting the systematic literature review, 22 articles were used for synthesis and analysis. the results of the research identified four challenges faced in the design phase, which included schedule and cost overrun; construction waste management; design performance; and project management. the results obtained indicated that agile methodologies can improve delivery in the design stage of a project.","agile methodology, design phase","The civil construction industry is an imperative industry in the economy of a developing nation because civil construction projects are the principal drivers of expanding infrastructure and helps with enhancing social environments for the general population. As said that infrastructure contributes on a very basic level toward the South African financial improvement; creating work both directly and indirectly and improves individuals' personal satisfaction through the arrangement of essential financial infrastructure buildings. In any case, this is tended with infrastructure projects pausing and losing a measure of money because of cost and schedule overrun. The design stage was distinguished as the stage at which the greater part of the cost and schedule overrun begins, it was along these lines with reason that it is the stage at which mitigation measures can be connected. Systematic literature review gathers existing information from an extensive variety of sources and tries to deplete the accessible information to find un-bias conclusions. The main limitation of the systematic literature review is the inclination in the selection of the publication and mistake in data extraction. However, to guarantee that the procedure of selection was unbiased, the research adopted a research protocol in advance that deﬁned the research questions. Utilizing the questions as a premise, search terms and identiﬁed catchphrases and key terms that would be relevant in the literature. It is important to note that the search terms were not standardised due to the uniqueness of each electronic database. Therefore, as much as the research has endeavoured with the best capabilities to combine the search phrases to extract relevant studies, there is a risk of omitting some publications due to the key terms were chosen by the research. To conclude the execution of agile methodology in the design period of construction projects can enhance this stage by limiting the weakness or vulnerability and help in managing the unanticipated risks and having the capacity to adjust to evolving conditions. It can enable structure and aid with the design stage by expanding transparency and enhancing the project, using time management and expanding both the customer's commitment and the camaraderie's. 1440","mr sixolile mnqonywa 1 dr sune von solms 2 prof annlize marnewick 1 1 postgraduate school of engineering management 2 department of electrical engineering science faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg auckland park, johannesburg smspringbok11@gmail.com amarnewick@uj.ac.za svonsolms@uj.ac.za","References

32,Electromagnetic Wave Attenuation And Phase Rotation By  Charged Dust Particles,"electromagnetic wave propagating in dust storms is susceptible to attenuation and phase rotation by suspended charged particles. considerable attention has therefore been paid to the development in the recent past by researchers. this paper presents a theoretical approach for predicting the attenuation and the phase rotation of an electromagnetic wave propagation in dust storms environment with charged particles. mathematical model based on forward scattering amplitude rayleigh theory is given in terms of monodisperse medium (equal sized distribution) and polydisperse medium (exponential size distribution). the attenuation and the phase rotation are calculated, and the results are analysed. the effect caused by the charged particles is notably significant. it is found that the attenuation and the phase rotation with charged dust particles are greater than where there is no charge. the coefficients of attenuation and phase rotation increase with the magnitude of charges carried by the dust particles depicted by the ratio of charge-to-mass. the results also show the variation of both attenuation and phase rotation with the charge distribution angles under different charge-to-mass ratios.","attenuation, phase rotation, charged particles","In this paper, theoretical models to predict attenuation and phase rotation due to charged dust particles have been developed and proposed. Different scenarios and conditions have been assumed. The mathematical models as expressed in (7) and (8) – spherical shape of mono-dispersive charged dusty medium, (9) and (10) - spherical shape of poly- dispersive charged dusty medium, (13) and (14) - ellipsoidal shape of mono-dispersive charged dusty medium, (15) and (16) - ellipsoidal shape of poly-dispersive charged dusty medium, were developed to predict and evaluate electromagnetic wave attenuation and phase rotation.

33,Microwave Attenuation Along Earth-Satellite Link During  Dust Storms,"microwave propagation during sand and dust storms has received appreciable attention of researchers in the recent past due to the increase in the number of terrestrial and satellite links being deployed in the regions where dust storms are predominant. dust storms cause signal attenuation on an earth-satellite link for a substantial percentage of time which may affect quality and reliability of telecommunication services. this paper investigates the attenuation due to dust storms along the earth-satellite link. a mathematical model, expressed as a function of visibility, wavelength, elevation angle and storms’ reference height, is developed to predict dust storms’ attenuation along propagation path. variation of the dust storm’s visibility with height for different reference visibility conditions is also given. the mathematical model for attenuation in earth-satellite link was developed by applying visibility variation to the expression of attenuation constant in terrestrial link. this was then integrated with respect to dust storms’ height. the results obtained are depicted in graphs and discussed. it is found that attenuation increases when visibility during dust storms gets severe. lastly, the results obtained show that attenuation in earth-satellite link operating at x band, especially, during dust storms may be said to be insignificant except when visibility is extremely bad.","attenuation, dust storms","A method, using mathematical model, for estimating microwave attenuation during dust storm in earth-satellite link has been developed. The model was premised on 10 GHz dielectric constant values and that density of dust storm along the wave propagation path in earth-satellite link is not the same. It is observed that the performance of satellite systems operating at the X band is not very sensitive to the propagation characteristics of the transmission medium. However, at a frequency above the X band such as the Ku and the Ka bands, dust storms could be very sensitive and cause degradation on earth-satellite paths. This may be experienced for a substantial percentage of time especially with severe and prolonged storms. In such scenario, reduction in both the quality and the availability of communication services is not unexpected.",a. musa and b. s. paul institute for intelligent systems university of johannesburg south africa twhid2001@yahoo.com,
34,The Influence Of Stakeholders’ Relationship On Project  Success,"the quality of the relationship between critical stakeholders (client, consultant and contractor), in a typical construction project, influences the progress on the project. if this relationship is impaired, it may lead to disputes of varied degrees; which usually culminate in litigation. the objective of a typical construction project is to strive to improve on the relationship between the stakeholders through effective communication, cordial information sharing and timely response to enquiries. when this is done, the stakeholders at variance with others are politely educated and re-aligned towards achieving the project’s objectives. the effective management of relationships in a construction project can be achieved through the contextual use of the johari’s model. the action research approach was adopted, examining the actions of each stakeholder for a longitudinal period of twelve months in the life of a construction project. the findings revealed that the contractor’s actions, in many instances, displayed acts of ignorance, while the consultants were seen to be economical with details; these are referred to, in the johari’s model, as acting in the blind area and façade respectively. the use of the johari’s model has helped in ameliorating disputes between stakeholders; improved on in their relationship and facilitating progress in the construction project.","dispute, relationship",,edoghogho ogbeifun postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg south africa edobunmi@gmail.com charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za jan-harm c pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg south africa jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za,
35,Study Of Tensile Behavior Of S355Jr Steel Treated By Burnishing  -Approach By Experimental Plans,"surface hardness plays an important role in lifetime of a mechanical part subjected to friction and wear. indeed, the hardness can be improved by processes of superficial plastic deformation (dps), such as the mechanical surface treatment ""mst"", in particular the ball burnishing. however, the result of treatment is conditioned by mastery of operation thus ensuring treated parts good mechanical and geometric properties. experimental work was carried out by applying ball burnishing process on steel tensile specimens s355jr, in order to observe the influence of parameters of treatment regime on surface hardness 'hv' and the effect of latter on tensile behavior of this steel. two parameters of regime were considered namely: burnishing force ""py"" and number of passes ""i"". the relationship between these parameters and microhardness measured at ""hv"" surface has been highlighting using factorial plans 22. moreover a mathematical model has been obtained allowing prediction of response (hv) as well as optimization of parameters of treatment regime. the experimental results showed that for surface hardness hv it is possible to reach a 45% improvement rate for a burnishing force py = 20 kgf and a number of passages i = 3 for this material. regarding behavior of material during tensile test, it was noted that for a weaker burnishing force (py = 10n) and a large number of passes (i = 5), the section weakens further (s = 4.14), proof than the ductility of material has decreased.","surface hardness, factorial plans, ball burnishing, mathematical model",,"mounira bourebia1 , abdeldjalil bouri1 , hamid hamadache2, lakhdar laouar3 sihem achouri1 1 industrial technologies research center. crti.p.o.box 64,chéraga-16014, algeria 2 research laboratory in advanced technologies and mechanical production (lrtapm), badji mokhtar annaba university, p.o. box.12, 23000, annaba, algeria 3 laboratory of industrial mechanics, badji mokhtar university bp12 -2300, annaba, algeria",
36,A Predictive Approach For Effective Management And  Planning Within The Energy Sector Of South Africa,"being able to predict the future demand of electricity constitutes part of the issues utilities companies, policy makers and private investors willing to invest in developing countries are facing. the use of efficient, reliable electricity demand predictor would improve significantly the infrastructure planning and the expansion of power transmission. in this paper, the national demand for electricity at a macro level, based on data relating to macro level economic and demographic indicators was predicted using artificial neural network (ann). forecasted values for five electricity sectors namely agricultural, transport, mining, domestic and commerce/manufacturing sectors were obtained using ann. four growth scenarios have been considered for the forecasting namely low, moderate, high (less energy intensive) and high (same sectors) scenarios. these inputs values for the period of 2014 to 2050, from the council for scientific and industrial research (csir), were used to test data and validate the use of this new approach for the prediction of electricity demand. the deviations between the predicted values using ann and the recommended values by csir were well within an acceptable range. this study demonstrates that the use of ann would improve significantly the decision making within the energy sector.","energy, predictor","Reasonable knowledge of past, present and likely future demands would make useful contributions to planning and policy formulation. This work explores the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in creating a model of electricity forecast. The system model for the proposed forecast of electricity demands is a multilayer ANN, where the network is trained for optimized value using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The minimum R2-value, which measures of the quality of fit, was 0.98204. This means that more than 98.204% of the electricity demands variability are explained by linear regression. In addition, the responses obtained from ANN for any new inputs data within the range considered are relatively acceptable. In order to measure the ability of ANN to predict the electricity demands, the comparison between the results recommended by CSIR and the results predicted using ANN has been done per scenario. A maximum deviation of ±9% have been observed. Although the results reported in this paper are restricted to the year 2014 to 2050, based on the available data, this study demonstrate the possibility to understand future patterns of electricity usage in various planning context.

40,The Impact Of Breakdown Reduction Through Lean-Tpm  Methodologies And Energy Consumption In A,"at company x, nairobi an effort was made to implement total productive maintenance. it is a production management method and company’s ultimate goal in introducing tpm was a means to achieve leaner production and a calming of the material flow. in total productive maintenance, reliability and availability are the ultimate goals and the way to accomplish the goals is through elimination of major losses. these losses are only due to mechanical nature and visualized by the key figure; overall equipment effectiveness. the main key performance indicators for this research were; mean time before failure (mtbf), mean time to repair (mttr), breakdown percentage and energy usage. through literature studies, a training workshop with tpm consultancy firm efesotm and a visit to an exemplary tpm implementing company unilever, the tasks to be performed were set and a master plan of execution developed. in order to visualize production losses, a sheet for recording production progress in a timely manner was developed, a database for data storage was set up, together with a computer aided analysis, and the a program to compute reports written. this research accomplished a reduction in breakdowns from 12.5% to 5.5% on pk machine. in doing so, oee increased, and subsequently energy consumption per unit ssu reduced from 0.021kwh/ssu to 0.012kwh/ssu. the gains in productivity or effectiveness were achieved only through measures in tpm, mainly the preventive maintenance (pm) pillar, and not harder labor. the tools used in achieving these goals included; autonomous maintenance, continuous improvement, root cause analysis for failure, preventive maintenance among others. 1705",,,manufacturing industry daniel arusei and bernard maiyo moi university kenya,
41,The Study Of The Sewerage Disinfection Properties Of  Moringa Oleifera Leaf Powder,"apart from its health benefits and coagulant properties, moringa oleifera has the possibility to be a sustainable and green alternative to chlorine water disinfection, however, there are limited scientific documented research findings on the disinfection properties of moringa oleifera, the objective of this study was to prove that moringa oleifera leaf powder has the ability to disinfect sewerage. the moringa oleifera used in the study was collected from kgobokwane village in mpumalanga province (south africa). the study was conducted experimentally by dosing a sewerage analogue with moringa oleifera leaf powder at 600rpm for one minute, then allowing it and the sludge to settle and the change in chemical oxygen demand (cod) of the samples was then analyzed. a decrease of 40% cod attributed to bacteria was measured and a bone charcoal filter removed 37% of the organic colloids left in the water due to moringa oleifera treatment. based on the pre-mentioned result in traditional water treatment moringa oleifera can be implemented to subsidise alum as well as chlorine dosage up to 40% in industrial scale water treatment as a pretreatment with no known negative effects. the limitation of the study is that bacteria was not explicitly tested. in rural areas on a private scale, moringa oleifera has the opportunity to pretreat river water before consumption and combined with other technology disinfect household effluent.","moringa oleifera, sewerage, disinfection, cod, green","is that the three Trials can be used as one single data set. ANOVA would have statistically shown if there was an uncontrolled variable interfering with the results. 5. Conclusions Highest reduction in COD donated to bacteria was found to be 40%, representing a 40% reduction in bacteria count. An elementary carbon filter resulted in a COD reduction of 37% representing a 37% reduction in the organic colloids left by Moringa Oleifera. Therefore Moringa Oleifera leaf powder has the capability of disinfecting sewerage and the side effect resulting from said treatment can be negated with an elementary carbon filter. This technology has the possibility to be implemented to subsidies alum and chlorine in the industrial sector and be implemented in rural areas on a personal scale. With optimization, this technology has the possibility to be implemented full industrial scale. 214","douw g. faurie1, sthen-karl boussougou2 and molelekoa j. mosesane3 department of chemical, metallurgical and material engineering tshwane university of technology pretoria, republic of south africa 214223791@tut4life.ac.za, 215015971@tut4life.ac.za, mosesanejm@tut.ac.za","References

42,Comparative Study Of Experimental And Simulative  (Comsol) Results On Extended Heat Transfer,"heat transfer is an integral part of most processes and machines, whether it’s cooling a machine or heating a solution. naturally, heat flows from the highest temperature to the lowest. this driving force is defined as the temperature gradient. heat will dissipate as it flows through the medium into the surrounding air. this study was conducted using an extended heat transfer unit. in this study, a brass rod was heated and the temperature profile observed. the experiment was simulated using comsol and this was compared to experimental data. the objective of this study was to compare the experimental results of an extended heat transfer pilot unit to the simulated results. the error between the simulation and the experimental results grew larger the higher the current output. there is no formal documented work on simulation of the extended heat transfer phenomenon, with an accurate simulation of extended heat transfer the model obtained could be implemented in more complex models such as fuel cells and furnaces.","comsol, simulation, experimental","The simulation places had up to 26% error. The simulation initial temperatures were too high and the temperature profile declined to quickly. This shows that in simulation the brass rod would rather dissipate its heat into the atmosphere than conducting it through the length, which was not the case in experimental trials. This may be due to an insulation of some kind present which was not taken into account. The objectives of the study have been met with some consideration, while the extended heat transfer phenomenon was successfully simulated and compared with the actual experimental results the models have too great an error to be utilized at this stage. Future research will be directed at lowering the error between simulated and experimental results and testing the simulated model in more complex systems, an accurate model can be utilized in the simulation of heat transfer in fuel cells; nuclear reactor control rods and metal casting equipment to name a few. This research will be to investigate the extended heat transfer pilot plant further to validate the input variables of the brass rod obtained from the equipment manual is accurate. Then the study will be repeated using other substances like iron. Acknowledgements Mr C.P. Ntuli is acknowledged for his introduction into the use of COMSOL.

43,Gas Chromatography Calibration Curve For Siloxanes  Analysis.,"the ability to determine the concentration of an unknown sample is highly important in every scientific research. this work focuses on the construction of a calibration curve for the analysis of siloxanes concentration in an anaerobic digester. the siloxanes of interest were the octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (d4) which has a negative effect on the conversion of biogas into energy and is harmful to mechanical equipment. for this purpose, fourteen samples having methanol as solvent and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (d4) as solute, with concentrations ranging between 0.01 %v/v and 1 %v/v, were prepared and analyzed through gas chromatography. the resulting percentage areas helped to the construction of a calibration curve. only samples in the range 0.031 %v/v – 0.115 %v/v followed a linear trend as expected.","gas chromatography, siloxanes, calibration curve","The objective of this study was to build a calibration curve to analyze siloxanes through Gas Chromatography. The selected concentration range was 0.01 %V/V – 1 %V/V. However, after analyzing the fourteen samples specially prepared for calibration, the resulting data points didn’t all follow a linear trend as expected. The reasons behind this deviation were the contamination of samples and human error while preparing the samples. Nevertheless, the data followed a linear trend in the percentage area range 0.029 % - 0.124 % corresponding to concentration values ranging between 0.031 %V/V – 0.115 %V/V.

44,On The Capacitated Step-Fixed Charge Transportation  And Facility Location Problem:,"facility location, route selection and load consolidation are integrated distribution planning problems. these three decisions are of long, medium and short terms respectively. in all these three decision areas, there could be economy or diseconomy of scale involved. of particular interests are models with single and multiple price breaks. this paper studies a heuristic based on linear programming (lp) relaxation for solving this integrated distribution problem. the solution approach utilizes simple transportation problems which other known heuristics in literature have also employed. however, the solution approach ensures that a reduced number of transportation problems are solved. a numerical example is presented to ensure the comprehension of the workings of the solution method. results obtained for the first set of computational problems show little or no statistical difference in means while the second set of problems had the modified u-v method final solution better than the other methods considered. although computation studies on a small scale was done to compare the performance of the heuristic with the solution provided by standard optimization environment of java eclipse and cplex, large problem sizes still proof necessary to compare the runtime and objective value of each solution method.","facility location, step-fixed charge, linearization","And Future Directions In this paper, we considered the Facility Location (FL) and Step-Fixed Charge Transportation Problem (SFCTP). A Linear Programming (LP) based heuristic was developed which was decomposed into two major transportation problems. The relaxed objective function of the first transportation problem in equation (25) was used in selecting the combinations of locations to be considered for the final transportation problem. In addition, solving the first transportation problem could help in generating a good lower bound for other computation methods such as Lagrange relaxations. A Numerical solution was presented to show the workings of the heuristic while a small scale pilot computation study was done to gain a little insight into the heuristic performance as regards the objective value obtained. Two sets of problem sizes were considered. The first set of problem sizes was solved using the NWC method as a solution method for the final transportation problem. The statistical results obtained showed a little or no significant differences in the mean values of the CPLEX solution and the LP based heuristic with increase in problem size. However, the NWC method lagged behind the LC and Modi methods for the second set of problem sizes. The Modi method for the final transportation problem was superior in all the problem instances of the second set of problems. The optimal distribution pattern of the Modi method (minimum cost) seemed to have a strong link to the good results obtained. Conclusively, large scale computation study still have to be conducted to gain proper insight into the performance of the heuristic under different parameter ranges and also due to the reason that exact methods which may obtainable using the solution methods present in the CPLEX optimization studio could become inefficient as the problem size increases. Also, comparing the runtimes of the different solution methods would also need to be considered for an efficient study. Finally a comparative study between this LP based heuristic and solution methods such as the lagrangian relaxation heuristic, metaheuristics such as genetic algorithm , tabu search and hybrid solutions which uses both LP based relaxation and metaheuristics would be possible areas for exploring.","a local search heuristic gbeminiyi john oyewole department of industrial and systems engineering, university of pretoria, pretoria 0002, south africa johnigbem55@yahoo.com olufemi adetunji department of industrial and systems engineering, university of pretoria, pretoria 0002, south africa olufemi.adetunji@up.ac.za",
45,The Impact Of Just-In-Time (Jit) In Inventory Management  System And The Supplier Overall Performance Of South,"just-in-time (jit) is an inventory management approach of having the exact amount of inventory goods arriving at the exact time when needed. this paper investigates the impact of this approach on south african inventory management systems and the organization as a whole, by comparing two companies producing same products (bed mattress), with different suppliers, and with different inventory management system. company x has not implemented the just-in-time approach, while, company y has implemented the jit approach. this paper will provide insight knowledge on the benefits and challenges of this approach, how it can be implemented to improve the performance of a company. mixed-methods research design has been utilized as a part of this investigation, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data collection. from the study conducted it may be concluded that not implementing the jit system is the causes of lower performance rates, compared to the performance of the company that has. the jit approach has methods or guidelines on how the company can improve its inventory management system and improve the performance of the company. it is then recommended that organizations in the manufacturing industry implement the just-in-time method in their inventory management systems.","jit, suppliers, transportation, logistics","and Recommendations From the study it may be concluded that companies can have lower performance rates, reason being that it has not implemented the Just-In-Time system in the inventory management system. It is also clear that JIT does affect the inventory management system and how the company performance in overall. As results indicated that Company Y performs better and has less production costs, due to the fact they have implemented the JIT system, their employees are aware of this system and have knowledge on the benefits of it. This makes it easier for employees to work with management in efficiently implementing this method. With the above-mentioned recommendations, the company can improve its inventory management system. Therefore, it is highly recommended that organizations in the manufacturing industry implement the Just-In-Time method in their inventory management systems. This method requires that organizations have a good relationship with their customers, as JIT highly depends on the performance of your suppliers. Close and reliable suppliers make the implementation of the process much easier and more efficiently. Management of the manufacturing companies are advised to train employees before the full implementation process, as JIT method will require them to change their movements (by eliminating unnecessary movements and non-value adding steps), materials will be closer to the working station and the only necessary materials will be around that work stage. Employees need to understand the value of this method and how it will affect their work processes, by understanding the benefits, they are likely to adopt to this method trouble-free.","african’s bed mattress manufacturing companies sihle mankazana and sambil charles mukwakungu department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg po box 524 auckland park, 2006 johannesburg, south africa sihlemankazana@gmail.com, sambilm@uj.ac.za",
46,Implementation Of Safety Management System In Kuwait  International Airport,"in any aviation facility, safety is the most sensitive issue to consider. this is because any single accident can significantly affect the whole airport. in this paper, a successful implementation of safety management system (sms) is done at the kuwait international airport (kia). the paper shows an implementation of such a system reduces the rate of accidents along with their costs, increases the productivity of the place, and meets the legal specifications needed to insure safety at airports. several hazards happening currently at kia were illustrated in this paper with the suggested preventions to control these hazards. the five step dmaic methodology was used to describe the hazards and how they should be improved and controlled. a fault tree analysis (fta) technique was applied to investigate the hazards. at the end, sms was proved to be an effective system to apply at kia and which reflects the newkuwait vision towards a better and safer place to live in.","safety, hazard analysis, risk analysis","To sum up, in this paper a real life problem was studied by using methods and materials related to safety course. Many work places often suffer from lack of safety requirements which would cause hazards and would sometimes lead to series health problems or even death (Charles, 2003). KIA is one of the important facilities in Kuwait where not only local people work in it but it is also visited by global people from all around the world. Therefore, KIA needs to insure a safer environment which guarantees a better working place. This paper showed different hazard types that happen at KIA. It also described the main causes of these hazards. At the end, a methodology was constructed to show the steps of finding the problems and how they were eliminated and controlled. A fault tree analysis technique was applied. The results showed that SMS application guaranteed a better and safer environment to work at.

47,On The Facility Location And Fixed Charge Solid  Transportation Problem:,"a lagrangian relaxation heuristic (lrh) to solve the integrated distribution planning problem of selecting transportation mediums (conveyances), route selection, load consolidation and location of facilities has been studied in this paper. the problem is known as facility location and fixed charge solid transportation with real life applications of integrating several planning horizons of small, medium and long terms. a numerical example was proposed and solved using two different sets of lagrange multipliers as starting values for the iterations performed and termed the first and second trial runs respectively. the cplex standard optimization software was used as a base for comparing the lrh obtained. a simple infeasibility resolution of the better lrh (second trial) lower bound solution was applied to obtain the cplex values. extensive computations of various problem sizes and instances will however be required to validate the good performance of lrh (second trial) run obtained compared to using standard optimization solvers such as cplex.",facility location,"And Future Direction The use of Lagrangian Relaxation Heuristic (LRH) in solving facility location and fixed charge solid transportation problem has been considered in this paper. The lower bound solution obtained for the LRH (second trial) was better compared to the value obtained for LRH (First trial) when the respective values obtained were compared to the CPLEX values. The results of the LRH could still result in a lower bound as was the case of the LRH(second trial) if possible infeasibility contradictions of the upper bound formulations are not well captured. For the LRH (second trial), a careful perturbation to satisfy one of the violated constraints would result in the CPLEX values obtained. In order to further test the performance of the LRH compared to the values obtainable from standard optimization software, extensive computations for various problem sizes and instances still have to be considered. It is also worth to note that a structured perturbation technique could be employed to resolve the possible LRH lower bound infeasibility. Furthermore during the LRH process, metaheuristics such as genetic algorithm, simulated annealing could be used to search for a better upper bound obtained, in case the solution fails to improve before the terminating conditions are reached. 270","a lagrangian relaxation heuristic gbeminiyi john oyewole department of industrial and systems engineering, university of pretoria, pretoria 0002, south africa johnigbem55@yahoo.com olufemi adetunji department of industrial and systems engineering, university of pretoria, pretoria 0002, south africa olufemi.adetunji@up.ac.za","References

50,Evaluation Of Chemical Oxygen Demand (Cod) Reduction  In Distillery Wastewater Treatment Using The Photocatalysis,"the photo-catalysis technology has been effective and efficient in the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (cod) in wastewater. titanium dioxide (tio2) is one of the most commonly used photo-catalyst and plays significant a major role in reducing cod concentration levels in wastewater. the polyaniline (pani) was synthesized using an in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. this work focused on the reduction of cod in distillery wastewater using an annular rector under batch mode. the influent was diluted at different concentration levels of about 5 ml/l, 10 ml/l and 20 ml/l. the ph condition was adjusted at ph of 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00 and 5.00 in order to evaluate its effect on the cod reduction efficiencies. the tio2/pani was prepared in different ratios and was allowed to mix with the wastewater for a good homogeneity mixture. the experiments were carried out at ambient temperature (± 25 ºc), whereby solutions were pumped into the photo reactor (annular) inserted with a 25 uvc lamp. the results indicated that the concentrations of all three solutions without the catalyst decreased from 355 mg/l, 655 mg/l and 837 mg/l to 325 mg/l, 572 mg/l and 820 mg/l, respectively. the solutions containing the catalyst also decreased from 325 mg/l, 572 mg/l and 820 mg/l to 344 mg/l, 475 mg/l and 752 mg/l, respectively. the results showed an increasing reduction trend of 2%, 2%, 19%, 20% and 26 % when the catalyst was used at ph of 6.0. it can be concluded that photo-catalysis can reduce cod in distillery wastewater when running under both recirculation and continuous. it can therefore be recommended that higher adjustments of ph can be done, and the process can be operated for more than 2 hours to further enhance the cod reduction in distillery wastewater.","photo-catalysis, industries","and Recommendations 5.1 Conclusions The study was conducted to evaluate the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater using the PANI/TiO2 catalyst. From the experiments conducted, it can be seen that photo-catalysis of distillery wastewater was an efficient process of degrading COD, the results showed the process is effect with and without the addition of a catalyst. However, an addition of a catalyst increases the efficiency. Results showed that the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater can be done using photo-degradation, however, the process requires more processing time and an addition of a catalyst to be efficient. The results obtained the from the 5 ml/l diluted distillery wastewater, for both the solutions (without and with the catalyst) showed no consistence in decrease of the COD concentrations. The results for the 10 ml/l and 20 ml/l diluted distillery wastewater showed a decrease in concentration. Therefore, the UV light had an effect on the concentration with the assistance of the catalyst. One can conclude that pH has a great effect on the reduction of COD, as seen from results in figure 3-5. The results showed COD reduction of 2%, 2%, 19%, 20% and 26 % when pH was adjusted to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively, all operated under the same conditions (room temperature, stirring speed = 360 rpm, pumping speed = 55 ml/min). 5.2 Recommendations Results showed the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater, proving that photo-catalysis is one of the process that can be used to treat this type of effluent. However, the study recommends that the process should be conducted for more than 2 hours and be conducted under isolation (the beaker containing the solution should be closed) to prevent any sort of contamination. In addition, the hypothesized 50% reduction of COD could have been achieved if the pH was adjusted to be more basic (< 7), by observing the obtained results. The result might show a different deviation if the process was conducted in both batch and continuous mode. Due to time constraints and lack of distillery wastewater, the process was conducted only in batch mode. Acknowledgements I like to thank Mr. Thabo Brooms for supervising this project.

52,Modelling And Simulation Of A Pid Controlled Active  Suspension System Of A Rail Car,"adaptive control are often employed to improve the performance of rail car in terms of stability, safety and ride comfort. in this study, a pid controlled active suspension system was designed, modelled and simulated. the parameters investigated include; the vertical and pitch acceleration as well as the rate of rejection of input and output disturbances. the developed model for the linear rail car suspension system of two degrees of freedom was formulated using the equation of motion while the simulation was performed in the matlab simulink 2017 environment. also, the pid controller was used to fine tune the systems performance according to the ziegler-nichols tuning rules. the results obtained show that the designed pid controlled active suspension system is highly efficient in minimizing the effect of load and rail disturbances as the magnitude of the parameters investigated were kept within the permissible limits. this enhances ride comfort, safety and good stability. key words: adaptive control, controller, pid, rail car, suspension system 1. introduction during the operation of a rail car, there are disturbances that offsets the balance of a rail car which arises as a result of irregular rail profile otherwise known as rail disturbances or as a result of load impressed upon the rail car during movement. hence, the dynamic behaviour of a rail car is a major function of both the track irregularities or track inputs as well as load inputs which are modelled as deterministic and random variables (sharma and kumar, 2013). the bogie of a rail car consists of the primary and secondary suspensions designed to enhance ride comfort, safe curve negotiation and good dynamic 1470",,"A PID controlled active suspension system was modelled and simulated in a MATLAB-Simulink 2017 environment. The goal of the PID control is to increase the rise time, decrease the settling time with minimal percent overshoot and zero steady state error. Upon fine tuning, the proportional term was observed to improve the rise time, while the integral term sufficiently eliminated the overshoot and the derivative term was also observe to reduce the percent overshoot via adequate damping. The control system also proved efficient in rejecting the input and output disturbances which could alter the system’s performance.

53,Lack Of Training Opportunities In South African Foundries  And The Impact On The Number Of Engineering Metallurgy,"lack of in-service training in the field of engineering metallurgy at local foundries has had a negative impact on the number of graduates who are offered an opportunity to complete practical training and to graduate. this leads to shortage of skilled foundrymen and foundry-women who can take the industry forward and help south africa compete globally. universities and foundries need partnerships to establish ways in which foundry skills are taught to young technicians. to achieve this, a quantitative study was conducted and data were collected and analysed to investigate the participants’ understanding of lack of in-service training and its effect on skills development in foundries. expert review of the collected data was conducted to complete triangulation. descriptive analysis was based on actual data collected from all foundries which were randomly selected. using this information, three types of questions were adopted during interviews and document review. frequency and percentage distribution graphs were employed to display the results for easy interpretation of trends. based on the data collected and resultant analysis, three main factors were found to contribute 71% of the problem and recommendations were made based on these findings. these included financial support and budget, lack of government support and lack of training awareness.",in-service training,"A quantitative study was conducted to determine the reasons for South African foundries not taking students for in- service training. The data analysis collected from 52 foundries presented interesting findings and answers to the research questions. The study revealed that there are three primary factors that respondents believe contribute to foundries not giving students opportunities for in-service training, namely budget, lack of government support, and lack of training awareness. Respondents indicated that they believe universities, the government and the foundry industry are disconnected in purpose and support of one another. The respondents indicated that this division influenced and negatively impacted the number of students who are not able to graduate each year due to lack of in- service training. 299","graduates jonathan mkansi, hannelie nel and annlizé marnewick post-graduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa joenno@live.com, hannelien@uj.ac.za, amarnewick@uj.ac.za","References

54,Stakeholders’ Compliance And Accountability With Health  And Safety In The South African Construction Industry,"the paper presents case study findings on the effect of poor health and safety performance and the high rate of non-compliance by construction stakeholders in south african construction sites. a case study of the tongaat mall collapse, which was caused by a failure of columns, was conducted. the accident was studied to assess whether or not stakeholders were compliant with the provisions of health and safety legislation. the study also evaluates whether the inquiry that was established to investigate the accident managed to hold the stakeholders accountable for their actions or inactions. the findings from the case study suggest that the non-compliance of stakeholders led to an accident that could have been avoided. furthermore, gaps were identified in the legislation in so far the regulating body was responsible for holding non-compliant parties accountable. the research provides select contributing factors to the slow progress in health and safety performance in the industry. understanding and addressing the issues highlighted in the research may contribute towards increasing the improvement of health and safety performance in the south african construction industry.","compliance, emuze","The findings provide important lessons as they unveil the level of non-compliance in the Tongaat mall case. Although the findings in this single case study cannot be generalised to the entire construction industry, they do provide informed conclusions of the current practice in the industry. The literature underpins the importance of enforcing compliance in order to minimize incidents in the construction industry. The regulating body in South Africa, the DoL, must be empowered to enforce compliance, and to hold offenders accountable for their actions or inaction. The Tongaat mall case presents a situation in which compliance with statutory requirement was poor. Both the client and the contractor opted to proceed with construction work without a permit to work, or at least informing the department as per statutory requirement. The contractor also failed to develop a health and safety plan or a risk file; and the client did not ensure that it was implemented in terms of the responsibility bestowed on him or her. 309","kellie nhlamulo kwinika, hannelie nel and annlizé marnewick post-graduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa kwinikakellie@gmail.com, hannelien@uj.ac.za, amarnewick@uj.ac.za","References

56,Improving Quality By Implementing Juran’S Trilogy At A  Small Engineering Company,it is important for companies to have a quality management system in place to ensure that the products are quality certified. this study was conducted in a small engineering company. a needs analysis was conducted and areas that needed interventions were identified. the processes and operations were studied to understand the process flow and how the processes are interrelated. the company did not have an adequate quality control in place and the quality management system needed to be revised and updated. quality documents were developed and implemented to improve quality and processes. pdca cycle and control charts were used to investigate and improve quality control.,,"The aim of the study was to develop and implement Juran’s trilogy. During the course of the project, it emerged that the quality management system needed to be reviewed and updated. The quality manual was revised and all the documentation was updated. The developed documents will significantly improve processes at XYZ Engineering. It is recommended that the company instill the culture of quality control by each individual in order to continuously improve. The use of correct quality documents must be emphasised to ensure quality assurance and quality control at all times. It is also empirical that the revision number on the quality documents be changed each time a document changes, which is in line with quality management system control of documents. In order for the company to receive feedback on their service from their customers, they need to send customer satisfaction surveys. This will assist them to identify areas of improvement.","zanele mpanza department of mechanical and industrial engineering university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa zanelem@uj.ac.za",

58,Root Cause Analysis For Fuel Losses In Bulk Oil Storage  Tanks,"petroleum and its products are a major source of energy that plays a vital role in society, powering many essential tools that human life depends on. supply-chain management is very important in the petroleum industry. few continents have petroleum reserves, hence there is a need for efficient methods of managing the sourcing, storage and distribution processes across the globe. there have been major improvements in safety management practices, during extraction and processing, in transit, and in situ distribution. bulk storage of petroleum plays a crucial role across the world as it eases distribution hassles and can act as emergency reserves in the event of disruptions in the supply chain. however, lighter fractions of petroleum have a tendency to evaporate during storage as they are highly volatile. although there are mechanisms such as floating roofs that have been invented to effectively reduce evaporative losses of light petroleum fractions, the percentage of losses are still high, particularly in some climatic conditions. on average, floating roofs allow leeway for loss tolerances of +/- 0.2% of throughput. unleaded petrol tanks record significant losses beyond the acceptable tolerances. the botswana climate is semi-arid, which makes bulk oil storage facility manager cautious about prevailing conditions at their storage reserves. trends analysed show losses well above the stated tolerance range. this article illustrates the analysis conducted to comprehend the root cause for losses experienced by bulk oil storage tanks (bosts) and decision making solution to tackle the problem of excessive evaporative losses in similar climatic conditions.","root cause analysis, petroleum, semi-arid, supply chain 333","Based on the data analysis in the previous sections, it can be concluded that the root cause for excessive evaporative losses from storage tanks comes from high ambient temperatures and associated climate conditions. The floating roof method, although it curbs escape of petroleum vapour, the method falls short in semi-arid regions. Regular inspection of the floating roofs at the study site proved a proper integrity of the system analysed. A feasible resolve has therefore been reached for a robust technical solution. This feasible resolve would suppress the excessive losses to within allowable limits. Further endeavours to solve the problem of excessive losses in bulk oil storage tanks will explore various methods of recovering the vapour. Thus, enhancing the integrity of current floating roofs, and reviewing results oriented innovative methods available in the oil and gas industry. This will go a long way in improving the supply- chain management system for the oil and gas industry. 5.","1norman gwangwava*, 2taboka motlhabane, 3richard addo-tenkorang, 4enoch n. ogunmuyiwa, 5albert u. ude, 6william msekiwa goriwondo 1,2,5department of mechanical, energy and industrial engineering, 4department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering, botswana international university of science and technology palapye, botswana +267 76442524 3aalborg university, department of materials & production, center for industrial production, fibigerstræde 16, 9220 aalborg. denmark 6national university of science and technology, faculty of industrial technology p. o. box ac 939, ascot, bulawayo, zimbabwe gwangwavan@biust.ac.bw, taboka.motlhabane@studentmail.biust.ac.bw, richardat@m-tech.aau.dk, ogunmuyiwae@biust.ac.bw, udea@biust.ac.bw, wgoriwondo@gmail.com",

63,Operations And Maintenance Of Csir Photovoltaic Plants  Mudau Unarine Bridget,"the renewable energy independent power producers procurement programme (reipppp) was developed to encourage private investment to assist the development of the renewable energy sector in south africa. technologies that fall under the ipp procurement project include onshore wind, biogas, biomass, solar photovoltaic and the landfill gas project. different photovoltaic (pv) systems such as ground mounted, rooftop and carport systems have shown a significant growth in south africa and this growth is expected to continue over the coming years. in line with the vision of the reipppp, the council for scientific and industrial research (csir) has introduced a programme aimed at making the pretoria campus energy autonomous over the next 5 to 8 years. as a part of this initiative, and to promote the use of green energy, the csir has installed three pv systems: 558kwp single axis tracker (ground- mounted), 203kwp dual axis tracker (ground-mounted) and a fixed-tilt rooftop system of 250kwp which is to be integrated onto the campus’ electrical grid. this paper concentrates on the operations and maintenance of these three csir pv plants in order to maximize the plant performance and optimize energy production. the paper will also analyse the operations and maintenance costs associated with the plants.","photovoltaic, operations, maintenance",,"council for scientific and industrial research energy autonomous campus meiring naude road, pretoria umudau@csir.co.za nithin isaac council for scientific and industrial research energy autonomous campus meiring naude road, pretoria nisaac@csir.co.za",
64,The Influence Of Inventory Management Techniques And Supply  Chain Management: A Study On How Effective Inventory Management,"this study is conducted to show the relationship between the techniques used in inventory management and the supply chain management. inventory management is a train fundamentally about indicating arrangement of supplied merchandise (mwangi, 2013). there is a need to examine the implementation of effective inventory management system, its impact on the supply chain management of a manufacturing company and how it plays a role on the performance levels of the organization. the study was conducted at a manufacturing company, which will be referred as company x. this research paper followed a casual design approach, and mixed methodology technique further explored the findings from the literature review and the extent of application in practice. a non-random sampling technique was used, containing 34 employees in total. questionnaire was developed and distributed amongst all 34 employees from supply chain, inventory control and manufacturing line. the study conducted has evidently shown that inventory management and supply chain have an impact on the performance of the organization. it is then recommended that management ensures that the two department have and maintain a good working relationship.","supply chain, performance","and Recommendations From the study conducted it can be concluded that inventory management and supply chain does have an impact on the performance of the Company X. How the two departments work can influence how employees in the manufacturing line perform and the type of product they produce. It is therefore recommended that management takes the initiative of ensuring that the two departments have a good working relationship, and also with the manufacturing line. The inventory management department is recommended that they improve their inventory control technique, by implementing the JIT system, ensuring that each manufacturing line has just enough of materials needed for the production and provide enough working space in the manufacturing line. The JIT system will also allow the company to avoid a situation of having too much or too little materials in its storage facility and also decrease the storage costs. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 effectiveness of Inventory Technique Communication process Quality and Quantity Departemental relationships Results from employees employees Column1 Column2 400","systems and supply chain management can help establish high performance in johannesburg manufacturing industries. sihle mankazana, manti silase and magano molefe department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg po box 524 auckland park 2006 johannesburg, south africa sihlemankazana@gmail.com, msilase@yahoo.com, mmolefe@uj.ac.za","References

65,Evaluating Employee Performance To Improve  Customers Waiting Time; A Case Study.,". this paper aims to highlight how productivity tools can improve employee satisfaction, which in turn should improve the customer queuing system of the banking sector. fifteen questionnaires were distributed to the employees, nine where received. questions answered by employees to display the overall interest of their customers and having a new method in improving productivity. after the interest had been gauged, all the data was collected and started using the five steps in improving productivity and productivity calculation to eliminate unnecessary task and breaks taken at work. the results show that in the previous month that even with more employees, the monthly targets were not reached so more employees were not really needed every day only in month ends. recommendation that were included was hiring of two or three migration official that will help with the queues and help customer quicker then customers waiting for a consultant.","productivity, efficiency, utilization, profitability","Productivity is affected by multiple factors. Sometime one or more factors play their role to increase or decrease the labour productivity. The factors those affect the performance or productivity are the same. Because when the productivity of individual is increased automatically his performance is. The assessment of service productivity is not trivial, as services (in contrast to manufacturing) may, to a large extent, be understood as co-creating configurations of people, technology, as well as internal and external stakeholders connected by value propositions and shared information It is important the bank managers should check on the employee’s performances on a regular basis and providing feedback to the employees, so they could help move the lines quicker because they would know how to talk the customers and help them faster. The five steps in improving productivity helped to see the problems that needs to be corrected quickly because it affected the Organization performance The best “experience” can be summed up as customer are able to come in the bank and not wait for hours to see a consultant or wait by the queue man system for a ticket. Objective like to improve the queues at the doors and ATMs, to help customers figure out the problems without waiting in a queue, to determine which problems influence the productivity in banks, to Improve the queuing system and to see changes in output in respect of alternative inputs, in order to correct unwanted action and to exploit desirable methods/techniques. These objectives played a big part in conducting the study, implementing the solution found from the problem investigated.

67,Development Of An Effective Self-Cleaning System To  Minimize Fouling In Heat Exchangers,"power plant steam condensers use cooling water for condensation of exhaust steam from turbines. depending on the concentration of cations in the cooling water, changes in temperature result in the precipitation of insoluble metal salts on the tube walls hence impeding heat transfer, leading to fouling, a threat on the heat transfer efficiency of the condenser. the research was carried out at a power station in zimbabwe where offline mechanical methods used to clean the tubes were observed to be slow and inefficient, hence increasing downtimes. the use of spherical rubber balls was proposed where they were injected into the cooling water to scrub off dirt on the tube surfaces as well as creating turbulence to prevent the dirt from settling on the tube walls. ball sizes of diameter less than the tube sizes were preferred in order to cater for possible thermal expansion of the rubber material on exposure to elevated temperatures. a magnetic water treatment unit was added to facilitate the formation of weak precipitates of the metal salts for ease of removal on cleaning. the design and implementation of the research results had the potential of saving the company on downtimes during condenser cleaning.","condenser, fouling, foulant","The introduction of an online condenser cleaning system at the power station will be financially beneficial in that downtimes due to unexpected and unscheduled shutdown would be reduced during periodical cleaning. Annual expenses due to downtime on condenser cleaning can save the power company an estimated $475 200. However, installation of such a system requires total investment of $5,283 which can comfortably be paid back within a period of 1 year and 2 months. This research was innovative in improving the existing system to meet set objectives in that the magnetic water treatment unit used magnetism to alter the super molecules in water such that the calcium cations precipitated as weak aragonite sludge with reduced ability to stick. This was an advantage in that when a tube was missed by the cleaning balls in some cycles, it would certainly be easier to scrub it in the next cycles hence maintaining a continuously running and uninterrupted power station. Increasing the number of balls per cycle also increased the probabilities that any tube was cleaned after multiple cycles. The system also has the flexibility to reduce ball sizes in order to cover for thermal expansion on the balls when exposed to high temperatures. Recommendation were also made for further research to improve the ball outer surfaces, distribution and monitoring of motions within the tubes. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the power plant company for allowing access to their operations to carry out this research and indeed very thankful for accepting to adopt the proposed cleaning system and recommendations for improvements. 412","wilson r. nyemba, simon chinguwa department of mechanical engineering science, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa nyemba@yahoo.com, chinguwa@gmail.com isheanesu zimba department of mechanical engineering, university of zimbabwe, p o box mp 167, mount pleasant, harare, zimbabwe isheanesuzimba@gmail.com charles mbohwa professor of sustainability engineering, department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, auckland park 2006, johannesburg, south africa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

68,Spare Parts Stock Rationalization For Rotating Equipment  Based On   Companywide Interchangeability; An Inventory,"spare parts stock control is crucial to inventory research. current practice of spare parts stocking is based on individual plant’s equipment. identical spare parts could be rationalized based on companywide having different plants. it requires a dedicated review through drawings and documents of manufacturer’s data for interchangeability. primary objective is to contribute in inventory cost reduction on the basis of rationalization of stock levels for identical spare parts. identical spares rarely require simultaneously for maintenance in relevant equipment among different plants. the methodology is based on three stages which include gathered opinion through questionnaire for companywide stocking policy from above industries in india and gulf. subsequently followed by conceptual methodology of companywide codification includes reviewing through an adequate spare parts interchangeability record (spir) formatted document. the final stage is validation which is supported with case studies based on secondary data collected from one of sabic affiliate, ksa and other from fertilizer industry at india. the approach of companywide is applicable for petroleum & fertilizer industries globally since having more than two plants at a business unit like reliance & kribco at india & sabic & adnoc affiliates at saudi arabia and uae respectively. key words- companywide codification, spare parts descriptive statistics and interchangeability i. introduction spare parts are significant resources for continuous equipment availability [1]. keeping in view the equipment availability inventory management system needs to review with strategic policy and to reduce zero stock out condition with continuous production and minimum investment on spare parts administrative cost [2]. it is envisaged that spare parts inventory need should be treated as different from work in process (wip) and other finished product inventories in stock control approaches. [3]. handbook of petroleum processing indicates that the total cost of spare parts should be between 2-3% of project cost of petrochemical plants companywide. [4]. practically, due to lack of systematic review of spare parts interchangeability and historic base calculation during first time order and subsequently the stock levels cost of spare parts is always more and there is scope of using different methods and techniques for reducing stock cost of spare parts. 1718",,"Based on questionnaire survey, hypothesis design and testing , it emphasized that the companywide interchangeability strategic policy for spare parts inventory in the fertilizer and petroleum industries could rationalized the stock levels and reduce the duplication, long time inventory holding and reduces the average yearly spares inventory cost respectively. It also further reflected in the above case study and proves that the formulated research objectives could be achieved by macro and micro level strategic policy models and procedure to get advantage of companywide interchangeability of spare among different plants of same business unit. It has also indicated that ERP packages like SAP R/3 materials management module is data based codification tool and could not reveal the interchangeability of parts once it is codify in different item codes. Hence companywide codification should be generated using structured E SPIR and later these item codes should be recorded in the ERP system. 11 Future Scope The study could be carried out for other items like for electrical as well as instruments spare items for companywide interchangeability. 1730","cost reduction strategic technique-perspective to petroleum & fertilizer industries across india & gulf sandeep sharda faculty & research scholar, mechanical dept.

69,Towards A Decolonized Human Machine Interface For A  Rural Solar Bakery Management System,"the university of johannesburg and various stakeholders launched a community engagement project in gwakwani village in the remote area of limpopo province, south africa, where a solar powered bakery was deployed. to ensure the sustainability of the project, bakery staff was educated and trained in the processes of baking and business management processes. one of the biggest challenges around the initiative is that the bakery staff has no prior knowledge of how to operate and manage a small business. this paper presents the development of a bakery management system to assist the staff in the day-to-day management of the bakery. it discusses the human machine interface developed for potential lower literacy levels and experience of the bakery staff in mind. this paper presents the development of the user interface of the management system as well as results from a preliminary training session on how to use the management system.",management systems,"The purpose of this paper was to present and discuss the development of a bakery management system designed for the managing a rural bakery in Gwakwani, South Africa. The system was based on the use of images and icons instead of words and numbers and its development was motivated by decolonised methods of communication. It was developed in order to assist the bakers who were unfamiliar with technology or uncomfortable with reading or writing in the day-to-day management processes of a bakery. The user interface of the system is unique as it does not follow the general rules of a management system. The introduction of Information Technology and simultaneous education of business management skills, through the use of this software provides the end users with the opportunity to learn skills that are vital in the modern day economic environment. The utilisation of similar systems can assist the sustainability of small, informal businesses in their daily operations. One of the fundamental pillars of engineering is to better the standard of living of the general population and by developing tools to help those in need of opportunity, innovations such as these fortify this pillar.

70,Characterization And Evaluation Of Psychological Traits Of  Southern African Cultural Groups And Its Impact On Sisr,"the dynamism in man’s public sphere, with its associated diversity in the socio-cultural and religious inclination of people, have over time resulted in variation in the personality psychological traits of people in these environments. in most developing countries, the level of integration of social interactive service robots (sisrs) in public sphere has been greatly hampered; owing to the disparity in the psychological traits of the people in this region. this to a great extent has impeded the level of acceptance of sisrs in most public places. in an effort to remediate this challenge, there is need to understand and characterize the psychological trait of the people in this region. this work therefore, seeks to review psychological development and traits of the zulu, xhosa and swati tribes of south africa in a bid to characterize the inherent psychological trait variation of the people. it was also aims at establishing in quantitative terms, the variation in pro-social traits. findings from this work, show that xhosa and zulu tribe have a higher propensity to integrate sisrs more than the swati tribe, as they have higher positive correlation value in terms of pro-social traits: agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism with values of 0.45, 0.80 and 0.40 respectively. also, result from the analysis show that the mean pro-social traits for the tribe combination: xhosa/zulu, swati/zulu and swati/xhosa have correlational values of 0.58, 0.54 and 0.53 respectively.","environment, personality","Haven established that coherent and consistent pro-social attributes, are key factors required for the speedy integration of SISRs in the public sphere of most developing countries, we have been able to identify and characterize these distinct psychological traits of the: Zulu, Xhosa and Swazi people of Southern Africa cultural groups. Result from the correlational analysis shows that: that the Xhosa and Zulu tribe have a higher propensity to integrate SISRs more than the Swati tribe as result in in table1 shows that these tribes have mean pro-social trait values of 0.58 and 0.54 respectively. We strongly believe that if these traits variations of the people in developing countries are taken into consideration while developing SISRs for public environment, it would help improve both the level of SISRs–Human interaction and the extent to which they are integrated in our public sphere. 1497","integration 1 ajibo chinenye augustine, 2 babu sena paul institute for intelligent systems, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, auckland park, johannesburg 2006, south africa 1augustine.ajibo@unn.edu.ng, 2bspaul@uj.ac.za","References

74,The Interlink Between Sustainable Supply Chain  Management And Technology Development In Industry,"the adoption of the green supply chain, reverse logistics, and re-engineering methodologies have paved the way for advanced and sustainable thinking and led to the emergence of new technologies which may facilitate industrial flow processes in a supply chain cycle (scc). however, the understanding and full application of current evolving techniques are yet to be fully grasped or explored, especially as it pertains to different organizations’ operational structure. cyber-physical systems (cps), autonomous vehicles, robotics, additive technologies, and alternative energy systems, are under draconian scientific investigations, leading to incredible achievements, with the promise to replace humans in future supply chain operations. thus, as the technological trend improves into the future, the question is asked, to what extent do the tendencies support sustainability and how secure is the current technology, or the decision to adopt new ones to improve product delivery, material handling and organize storage conservatively without causing havoc in the society. as such, maximize profits while meeting societal satisfaction. in this paper, we assess current trends towards achieving sustainable supply chain management (sscm) and discuss viable implementation strategy of emerging technologies for the future, its impacts, challenges, and the scope of applicability for increased productivity. in conclusion, we share on how the promulgation and proper management of new and developing industrial technologies are essential to maximize time, minimize cost, and improve the value of employee commitment, and customer contentment.","sustainability, technology","The rapidly increasing digital dive to conduct business using artificial intelligence seeks more innovation and require robust decision-model that will facilitate successful implementation. As digitalization progresses, energy-intensive companies; manufacturing and power sectors must metamorphose their supply chain and integrate new ideas that will increase productivity through a re-evaluation of their current operational models and strategies, and also adopt new path in technological assistance. Hence, allow companies to compete favorably in all facet of their business. Successful implementation of innovative technological ideology will create the avenue for an unbroken value chain. Although the scope of this research does not cover applicability of technological advancement in any specific industry that aligns sustainability in their supply chain based on the business type, or sizes of the sector (small, medium, and large scale). The paper establishes that; the need to transcend to a new and advanced method of operations is not contestable in other to meet the current inclination to achieve general growth in businesses through sustainable supply chain management approach. As such, any business passionate about survival in the future must transform with the new paradigm shift; to automate operations processes, implement sustainability standards which call for eco-friendly- materials, designs, service delivery, energy efficient plants, and operations, among other benefits like fast effective and secure delivery of the most convenient methods.

77,Correlation Between Future Energy Systems And Industrial  Revolutions,"the last two to three centuries have witnessed humongous technological, socio-economic and environmental transformations which have laid precedence to the swift advancements in fields of sciences, engineering, medicine, business, and economics. while researchers focus on the productivity and economic growth potential and how subsequent industrial revolution paved the way for current contemporary lifestyle, very few analogies exist on the relationship between the intervention of the technology used and the implications as per energy management concerns during that period. the authors of this paper examine the impact of the changes in the industrial structure from the first to the third industrial revolution era (industry 1.0, 2.0, 3.0), premised on the campaigns for cost-effective manufacturing and energy conservation throughput within the time frame, and how it transitioned to existing technological innovations. the article discusses energy issues and performance from the technology utilization perspective since the eighteenth century that has led to the present engineering practices or the resolve for change, through new means and technological approach. different industrial practices which ushered the current anthropogenic situation are assessed, and critical strategies that are pivotal to drive current reforms, innovations and future ideas to see to the unstoppable realization of the industry 4.0 (i4.0) on a large, medium and small scale and the possible transition to industry 4.0 plus and society (i4. +s) are presented.","energy, industry 4.0","The attainment of optimum energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction with regards to the implication of actualizing industry 4.0, depends on the capability of the aligning technologies (IoT, Cyber-Physical Systems, etc.) As such, when incorporated into energy management, enhance energy security, ameliorate fuel scarcity and generate beneficial jobs while still promoting competitiveness amongst SMEs’ and conglomerates alike, who are involved in the energy market. The I4. +S which in this paper refers to the stage after successful actualization, and demonstration of the I4.0 through all the technologies responsible for unveiling its maximum potential and landing, on a digital society. The practical application of the framework to ensure smooth implementation on smart factories, energy, building, transport, services (health, sales, delivery, payment) and intelligent monitoring of the environment, will usher new economies with new business players and tremendous potentials. The development of unique transport systems, such as service companies like Uber and other online hosts business platforms like Amazon and Alibaba to mention a few is the beginning of what is yet to come in the future of transport and customer service delivery which utilizes IoT. The correlations of energy resources and technologies with current practices, operational competence and the way it is being managed or how the result affects the economic cost of living, energy production, consumption, and utilization are based on the zeal and commitment to move from ideation to fruition. The envisaged future intervention will replace traditional means of cooking and heating, from the domestic point of view, through using biomass and other crude methods. The I4. +S will feature in its entirety, smart buildings, with conservative energy plans (generation, consumption, and savings), smart factories, smart services, smart energy sourcing, smart transport, and smart farming to mention a few which in every step integrates sustainable technology that replaces the primitive technique and improves wellbeing. Although arguably that IoT will increase productivity, as well as lower costs through the extensive use of smart mechanical technology. Regardless, IoT has its concerns, which may well act as a dire hindrance to its adoption. Skills accusation will drastically reduce. As such, there will be a decline in the standard of leaving as a high number of 1959","onu peter and charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, p. o. box 524, johannesburg, south africa. onupeter@kiu.ac.ug, cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

78,The Optimization Of Container Stacking Process Under The  Impact Of Synchronization Of Seaport Container Terminal,"efficient stacking strategy in a container terminal is an essential task affecting competitiveness in many seaports, especially because this singular action may influence many of the conflicting objectives, like minimizing the reshuffles (unproductive moves) and number of future relocations of containers in storage yard and maximizing the yard density and stacking area capacity utilisation. any delay or deficiency in the synchronization and sequencing of daily operations and activities between seaside and landside of terminal will affect the stacking process in the container yard and may lead to the interference of terminal operations and lack of control in the scheduling of concurrent operations and activities during the management of inbound and outbound containers. in this paper, we model a seaport container terminal as a queuing system to obtain the service level parameters. a multi-server queue in tandem consisting of two stages was considered, the first stage being the relations between handling-off process and transportation process, the second stage being the relations between transportation process and stacking process. also, we consider twenty different scenarios of container stacking inside a container terminal to evaluate the performance of the queuing model. these scenarios vary from each other in terms of quantities of containers, durations of stay for the vessels in the seaport and number of equipments (quay cranes, yard trucks and yard cranes) that are used to perform the operations. experimental results were obtained from using the queuing model to evaluate the performance of the seaport container terminal operations, and to understand the behavior and characteristics of container stacking problem in a container yard. in general, experimental results show how increase in the number of service centers (yard trucks in the first stage and yard cranes in the second stage) affect the total waiting time of containers in the queue, the total time for containers that are serviced in the system and the average utilization of the system. furthermore, we determined the optimal number of equipments to be are used in service to achieve a given service level.","container stacking, reshuffle, queuing theory",,"operations sarma yadavalli, olufemi adetunji, rafid b dawood al rikabi department of industrial and systems engineering university of pretoria pretoria, 0002, south africa sarma.yadavalli@up.ac.za, olufemi.adetunji@up.ac.za, rafidbd2000@yahoo.com","References

80,Supply Chain Distribution Network Analysis Of Two Cable  Manufacturers,"supply chain performance can be determined by few factors like operating capital, inventory and time. however, one of the fundamental factors considered while optimizing a supply chain is the transportation cost. in this study, supply chain distribution network of two cable manufacturers were analyzed with the help of a linear programming mathematical model. the framework developed can be broadly categorized into three different stages in the life cycle of a product, namely a) pre-production phase b) post-production phase c) distribution phase. transportation costs were estimated for each of these phases. additional scenarios like increasing and decreasing the number of distributors were considered and analyzed for any reduction in the overall transportation costs of the supply chains. the findings show that varying the number of distributors may not necessarily result in a reduction in transportation cost. this study conveys that organizations need to strategically position their distributors to optimize the distribution costs. the developed framework is applicable to any supply chain network with multiple suppliers, single manufacturer, multiple distributors and multiple customers. this study may inspire future study on developing and solving models with a diverse range of scenarios.","coyle, ruamsook","Supply chain distribution network designs play a major role in deciding the performance and profitability of an organization. Along with reduction in distribution costs, a good distribution network also results in satisfactory customer service and experience. An effective network topology helps to address all factors that define the success of a supply chain. As every organization is free to design its own distribution network, a detailed analysis of all network options along with modes of transport and all constraints that may be involved has to be conducted. Organizations have to understand and estimate their requirements, potential customer locations and demand, uncertainty in demand, capacities, etc before setting up a network. In conclusion, it has been seen that altering the patterns of distributors in a network may not always result in reduced distribution costs. Hence, all the possibilities and combinations have to be analyzed through a reliable and accurate approach before implementing the design. Future study may be conducted on complex detailed supply chain distribution network designs with more accurate models to arrive at optimal solutions.","ayyagari venkata ramani master of engineering management lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa nayyagari@ltu.edu",
81,Dmaic Approach To Address Non-Compliances In 3D  Feature Based Computer Generated Design Models,"this project aims to address non-compliances in 3d feature based computer aided design (cad) models and drawings that are delivered to the customers under agreed technical data packages (tdp’s), at the various conceptual, developmental and production levels of a company. it has been found that over 20% of all models in the tdp has shown evidence of non-compliance. this results in profit losses, lost time and morale of employees. the dmaic six-sigma approach was used to define the problem, measure the extent of the problem, analyze the problem, attempt to identify root causes, find solutions to reduce the effects of the problem, and finally, sustain the improvements made. various six-sigma tools like project charter, operational definition, control charts, fish-bone analysis, etc. have been used to improve the non- compliance situation. after implementing the improvements discussed in this project, there has been a significant reduction in the number of non-compliances, validated through statistical quality control tools. on the whole, this project has helped acquire a deeper insight of the application of six-sigma dmaic approach.","dmaic approach, six-sigma, sometimes","This project successfully applies the concept of DMAIC to a real situation and effectively helps to mitigate the problem. Various six sigma tools were discussed and understood in detail in the course of this project. Although the DMAIC processes were implemented, the true tool of success was communication. Upon developing an SOP and supporting Guidelines for various modeling techniques that were posted in the company’s intranet, it was the physical SOP introduction sessions that brought awareness and understanding of the need to improve modeling quality. The directive was also supported by upper management in companywide webinars. 501","ayyagari ramani and ramon banuelos a. leon linton department of mechanical engineering lawrence technological university southfield, mi 48075, usa nayyagari@ltu.edu, rbanuelos@ltu.edu","References

82,Combustion And Energy Content Comparison Of Loose Biomass  Briquettes Produced From Cow Dung And Cactus Binders,"this paper compares combustion behaviour and energy content of cow dung and cactus bonded briquettes. briquettes were produced using yellow thatching grass, groundnut shells, sugarcane leaves, mopani leaves and combination recipe (composed of all loose samples) collected from a location in the north eastern part of the limpopo province. the aim was to identify loose biomass feedstock available in that location to sustainably produce good quality briquettes with the highest energy content and good combustion behaviour. cow dung and cactus were selected as binders during the briquetting process. briquettes produced with cow dung binder exhibited good performance with regards to improved energy content. the briquettes were produced for varying compaction pressures of 6, 12 and 19 mpa. cow dung bonded briquettes were found to have the highest energy content across all pressures. at 6 mpa, mopani leaves briquettes had 21.53 mj/kg, groundnut shells 16.85 mj/kg at 12 mpa and sugarcane 19.11 mj/kg at 19mpa. the lowest energy content for cow dung was reported with yellow thatching grass at minimum average of 14.84 mj/kg across all pressures. cow dung bonded briquettes were found to have the highest combustion rates across all pressures with groundnut shells recording 209.67 g/min at 19 mpa, 104.71 g/min at 12 mpa and 83.16 g/min at 6 mpa. the lowest performance was recorded for sugarcane leaves at 38.13 g/min. cactus bonded briquettes were found be very low on both energy content and combustion rates due to its pressure insensitivity and higher moisture content. the highest energy content for cactus bound briquettes was found to be at 16.49 mj/kg for mopani leaves followed by groundnut at 15.5 mj/kg with the lowest at 12.6 mj.kg for yellow thatching grass. the highest combustion rate was found at combination recipe with 59.48 g/min followed by mopani leaves at 53.91 g/min. the lowest was 3.36 g/min for yellow thatching grass. overall, cow dung bound briquettes performed better than cactus briquettes for all compaction pressures. key words: loose biomass, briquettes, energy content, combustion, compaction pressure 1962",,"Briquettes produced using cow dung and cactus binders were compared for their energy content and combustion behaviour. Cow dung bonded Mopani leaves briquettes showed a good performance on both lower and high compaction pressures. For cow dung binder, groundnut shell, Mopani leaves and combination recipe briquettes exhibited good performance and are good candidates for future briquetting with average burn rate of 0.0233 g/min. The highest energy content on cow dung bonded briquettes was at 21 MJ/kg and for cactus was at 16 MJ/kg. Thus, cow dung with 75: 25 mixing ratios performed better with 5 MJ/kg more energy content compared to cactus briquettes. During combustion, cow dung bonded briquettes combusted for the maximum of 209 minutes and cactus bind briquettes lasted for 59 minutes. This is less than half of cow dung briquette performance. Cactus bonded briquettes require blending. Combination recipe briquettes showed improved bulk density with slower burn rate of 0.0288 g/min. Slow burn rate is required for better energy extraction with longer cooking cycles.","mikateko reuben shuma department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg kingsway campus, auckland park, 2000, rsa mshuma@uj.ac.za daniel m. madyira department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg kingsway campus, auckland park, 2000, rsa dmadyira@uj.ac.za",
83,Validation Of Criteria For Service Delivery Performance  Assessment Tools,"service delivery deficit remains an overwhelming predicament in south africa. with ageing infrastructure, prolonged decision-making times in government, and the way in which municipal councils deliver electricity, water, sanitation services and domestic/industrial waste removals, public unrests, triggered by these factors are set to continue. although these induce a lot of worries, the main concern is, if nothing is done urgently, the situation would soon degenerate into a fully-fledged revolt of the masses. while there are some diagnostic tools developed to assess service delivery health with the aim of improving service delivery performance, the tools, with their qualifying criteria need to be evaluated for fitness within the south african context. this paper investigates and validates, through focus group driven evaluation, what performance criteria should be used to select an existing service delivery diagnostic tool to measure the performance of service delivery in south africa. a tool must thus sufficiently satisfy the criteria, to be considered adequate, appropriate and effective in south africa.","service delivery, focus group","According to the World Bank (Report, 2011), one of the major reasons for Service Delivery issues in South Africa is inadequate assessment (including monitoring and feedback) of the health of Service Delivery. Although a plethora of assessment tools exist all over the world (and few in South Africa) for the same purpose, civil unrests, fueled by service delivery deficits continue to hunt South Africa (Tirivangasi, 2016) as they often lead to damage to public properties, disruption of civic activities, police brutality and sometimes loss of life. Concerted efforts by government and its organs to stem these discontent and civic uprisings have not yielded much result, prompting several authors, including Makanyeza (2013), Sibanda (2012), just to mention a few, to suggest, in agreement with the World Bank, that a diagnostic assessment of the performance of service delivery is needed. In response to that requirement, we posit in this paper that a scientific approach with proper theoretical grounding is necessary in the design, development, and application of such a tool. We therefore explored, using the focus group discussion approach (and the AHP, for decision hierarchy suggestion), what criteria, service delivery assessment tools need to satisfy to deal with the inadequacy identified by the World Bank report and other authors. The study sets out by validating first, via the highly diversified, purposively recruited focus group participants, whether a need exists for a service delivery assessment tool. The response was in the affirmative: one is needed, and urgently too! The response satisfies the first study objective. Afterwards, the necessary criteria that such tools must satisfy to be considered relevant, adequate and appropriate within the South African context were defined and validated by the FGPs, fulfilling the second objective of this study. The third study objective is met by providing a decision-criteria hierarchy, premised on the AHP approach, to select the most appropriate tool from what is currently available. Given that South Africa national government, local government, the general public, an international agency, non-governmental organizations, the academia and industry were represented in the FGD, we took liberty to understand their perception of performance of service delivery and we reported on their feedback. Their feedback indicates that much still needs to be done in the area of service delivery. For instance, notwithstanding the availability of electricity, the group thinks it doesn’t get value for money and that electricity is too costly in South Africa. The group passed a vote of no confidence on the quality of water while reiterating lack of value for money: This group is generally urban, indicating the situation will be worse with South African rural dwellers. Affordable housing was rated low on cost and value for money, meaning housing is generally not affordable in South Africa. On a positive note, the group is happy with wastes removal and sanitation. This is not unexpected given the group’s geo-location in urban South Africa. To reach a final conclusion and strategic solution pathway for South Africa, it is recommended that a further study be commissioned to subject the defined goals and criteria to pairwise comparisons by relevant stakeholders and decision makers. 514","oluyomi ajayi department of industrial and systems engineering university of pretoria pretoria, south africa u16404808@tuks.co.za marne de vries department of industrial and systems engineering university of pretoria pretoria, south africa marne.devries@up.ac.za","REFERENCES

84,Application Of Supply Chains In Land Registration  Edward Kurwakumire,"land is the most crucial resource in any nation especially due to its scarcity in wake of unlimited needs and wants by mankind. land has been a major resource of conflict due to the need for countries to expand their territories. even, nowadays land disputes still exist between traditional leaders and municipalities, individuals and cooperations. this is because land is viewed as a social, cultural and economic resource. the registration of land is thus of importance so that rights to land are well defined and are protected. these rights give information on who owns what land and the type of land ownership that exists. this is referred to as land tenure security that is achieved through secure land rights. these secure land rights are then used as a basis financing land related projects by financial institutions where land and other real property and mostly immovable property are used as collateral. in communal areas, land registration can in principle, improve agricultural productivity as farmers can seek funding from banks to make their land more productive due to possessing title to land. eventually land registration creates land markets which involves the buying and selling of real or immovable property meaning land and buildings which is a major contributor to public funds collected by governments to support service delivery as land and property transactions contribute substantially to the gross domestic product of a country. while land registration is of immense importance, developing countries face challenges in managing land registration processes and in organizing the related land information in a systematic and easy to access manner so that timeous land transactions can be done. in some cases the land registration process is too long and inefficient while it is costly to the buyer of real property or the individual or cooperation wishing to register title. this results in insecure land transactions and a failing of the property market in a country. this affect government revenue acquired though through land and property tax and this brings the need of a well-functioning land registration system in the nation. land registration systems have been modelled using unified modeling language in previous research. this paper employs supply chain management to model land registration process in an urban environment. this paper argues that supply chain management can be used to model and manage the land registration process. in this study, the land registration process is considered to be a supply chain comprising of a land owner, surveyor, surveyor general’s office, notary and the deeds offices as the supply chain partners.","supply chains, land registration, land information, scor 517","Supply chain mapping can be utilized in modelling and visualising land registration systems. The processes involved in land registration have been mapped successfully including the connectivity between the supply chain partners. The supply chain mapping revealed that there are several actors who participate in the land registration processes towards the delivery of the final legal documents which confirm land title to the applicant. The processes relate to an analogue procedure which needs to be embedded with information technology as demonstrated for the document access system. Information technology improves supply chain success due to improved communication between supply chain partners and quicker turnaround times in production processes. Thus, adoption of information and communication technologies will in principle improve the overall effectiveness of the land registration supply chain. There is still need to test the suitability of supply chain management as a management tool for land registration systems. Future work entails the adoption of the supply chain operations","geomatics department tshwane university of science and technology pretoria, south africa kurwakumiree@tut.ac.za",
85,Energy Efficiency In Manufacturing In The Context Of The  Fourth Industrial Revolution,"the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have dawned with their unique problems that have been brewing for many decades and slowly consuming the environment, causing it to deteriorate at a very rapid rate. in recent years’ energy, efficiency has significantly gained research interest in stature, it is necessary to alter the way that energy is utilized. energy-intensive sector such as manufacturing industry in south africa can provide a competitive advantage on a national scale and could gain cost advantage against global competitors, if the energy productivity demand improves across the economy through lean energy- efficient opportunity in manufacturing operations and fourth industrial revolution. the need for energy efficient manufacturing industries requires the understanding of different customer’s energy demand and ability to fulfill these demands while maintaining the economies of scale at the same time. these can be achieve by segmenting manufacturing into various sectors to focus on high intensive energy users, and then gradually give attention to the others. the paper identified and investigated the existing gap in the train manufacturing plant equipment lists through determination of equipment energy demand profile and presents an analysis of the proposed energy efficiency initiative using 80-20 pareto analysis principle to analyze the equipment lists.","energy efficiency, manufacturing, pareto analysis",,"adenuga olukorede tijani, mpofu khumbulani and gabisile buyiswa gamede department of industrial engineering, tshwane university of technology, pretoria south africa olukorede.adenuga@gmail.com, mpofuk@tut.ac.za, gamedegb@tut.ac.za",
86,Development And Fabrication Of A Wood Gasifier To Power  An Internal Combustion Engine,"fossil fuels have been the main source of energy for many years hence the depletion of resource. there is therefore a need for alternative cleaner energy sources of fuel to be explored. the use of these conventional fuels led to land degradation global warming and air pollution. a wood gasifier machine which produces combustible gas from solid fuels like charcoal, wood and agriculture residue was designed. the combustible gas can be used for heating purposes or to produce mechanical or electrical energy. there was a great literature search for the technology currently being used for gasification processes which led to the design and manufacture of the gasifier prototype which was tested and came out successfully. an internal combustion engine was run on the combustible gas. gasification bi-products that came out were tar and ash which could be used for water proofing and fertilizer respectively. biofuels are renewable energy sources and are carbon neutral as they do not increase the total amount carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. the test also revealed some shortcomings in the design. the air which was used to allow for combustion to take place was inadequate, hence there is a need for further research.","carbon, combustion, fossil fuels","Internal combustion engines require syngas with tar content below 15mg/Nm3, too much tar above this threshold can cause problems during engine operation and pipe blockages. For the starved bed gasifier tests are required to be conducted to test the effectiveness of the gas cleaning system. Improvements on the packed bed filter may be required, as well as adding some materials like pressure and temperature sensors. During the scrubbing operation, the condensed tar may block the filter perforations hence it is of necessity to be able to measure the pressure drop across the filter. With such a system, the gasifier would be allowed to operate within a specified range of pressure drop. If the pressure drop exceeds a specified maximum, then cleaning or replacement of the filter material would be required. To build an effective heat exchanger the gas temperature at the cooler inlet should be determined. Temperature sensors are required to be installed in the gasifier reactor, these will serve to notify an operator if the gasifier is operating at normal conditions.

88,Dimensional Analysis Of Natural Vibrations Of Planar  Multilink Flexible Robots With Elastic Constraints At,"non-dimensional variables are very useful as they reduce the number of variables when analyzing physical phenomenon. in this paper, the solutions to the frequency equation of multilink flexible robots with elastic constraints is analyzed in a compact form using the dimensional analysis. first, dimensionless governing differential equation of motion is presented. second, dimensionless boundary conditions are obtained. third, the dimensionless frequency equation and the orthogonality conditions among the mode shapes are derived. fourth, some degenerate cases are developed and compared against some existing models. finally, dimensionless wave numbers are plotted for various joint stiffness ratio to show the influence of various dimensionless parameters on the natural vibrational behavior of the planar multilink flexible robots.","dimensionless, planar, mode, vibration","In this paper, a dimensional analysis for planar multilink robot was performed. For this purpose, some physical dimensionless parameters and variables were defined to express the system physical parameters in a compact form. The general dimensionless frequency equation and boundary conditions were developed. Some degenerate cases were derived and compared against the existing models. The general frequency equation was solved for various dimensionless stiffness values and the results discussed. The results show that the first and second wave numbers decrease when the actual mass and moment at the distal end of flexible links increase. However, when the contribution of mass of distal link is increased, the first wave number decreases while the second wave number increases. The findings from this analysis contribute towards enhancing our understanding of the effects of different physical parameters on the natural vibrations of planar multilink flexible robots. 567","actuator gearhead shaft–link couplings francis kunzi tekweme department of mechanical and industrial engineering university of johannesburg johannesburg, rsa ftekweme@uj.ac.za","References

89,Characterization And Structural Investigation On Diorite  Rocks Of Botswana,"clear investigation on mineral rock characterization is essential for establishing solid bridges between the mineral resource location and area of application, i.e. rock provenance. major scientific revolutions in the industry was made possible via technologies of characterization (xrd, xrf, sem etc..,) providing improved processing routes that effectively address arising challenges and problems faced by our local quarries and mining industries, therefore attempting also to explaining fundamental treatment techniques that were adopted anciently. modern civil engineering activities, mining and construction entail clear statistical data on material composition, texture, petrographic and mechanical properties of the source material or mineral ore they are handling for clear documentation. visual inspection was carried out on diorite samples acquired from various locations. microscopic examination of component were classified in order to rationalize unique and recognizable features (mineral type, structure and color patterns), and estimations for specific purpose the rock is suited for (i.e., as a sculpting material or fabrication tool). characterization therefore, provided crucial information to the interpretation on quality of stone and relevant processing factors relating to energy input and effective processing technique. in this work, in- situ x – ray powder diffraction analysis was performed at rtp conditions on powdered samples of diorite (a) and (b). various components were identified which revealed that phase composition is significant in determining the strength of material and processing parameters.","characterization, crystallography","From the data acquired by the diffractogram, it was visible that majority of crystalline phases where easy to identify with panda quarry rock sample as plagioclase (39.20%), amphibole (31.74%), Quartz (12.26%) and minor inclusions of mica mixed with chlorides compounds. For the analyzed scan results clear data obtained with less noise levels, N, made classification straightforward, presenting the material to possess a high fraction of crystallinity with larger particle components which consequently led to recommendation of the material as mainly suitable for road construction activities and infrastructural work due to the inherent character of large phase composition. The data analysis for master quarry diorite sample as mainly Hornblende (49.9%), Berlinite (18.2%), Bezzite (16.1%) together with traces of other complex, displayed less crystallinity of components while showing greater amounts of fine – grained distribution of phases thus suggesting a larger contribution to be occupied by clay and minor trace constituents of lazurite, mica and silicates. From the diffractogram analysis it can be suggested that the master quart stone is much suited to use in infrastructural work like building and also civil industry. Due to great domination in phosphates (Al (PO4)) and lesser crystallinity of components, master quarry rock would require less amount of breakage energy in comparison to the Francistown’s panda quarry rock product with higher crystallinity and a well-defined component field. The signal-to-noise ratio is important during analysis and a material with a high noise level remain difficult to classify, from these specimen it is clear that for Serowe rocks the signal was two times greater than the noise level, 2:1 while for panda quarries the ratio was approximately 3:1, these difference was due to the material’s diffraction characteristics and linear absorption coefficient of each specimen. 576","mr gaesenngwe gaesenngwe and dr. g. dahna department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering botswana international university of science and technology palapye, private bag 16, botswana info@biust.ac.bw mr gaesenngwe gaesenngwe chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering department biust university palapye, botswana gaesenngwe.gaesenngwe@studentmail.biust.ac.bw","References

Mr Gee Gaesenngwe; A teaching assistant and MSc Student at the University of BIUST under the department of 
chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering. For the past 6 years I was enrolled with Leeds University where I 
pursued an undergraduate program, still as a material scientist. Growing up, I always dreamed of working as a 
metallurgist especially in the mining industry because the economy of our growing country was continually 
investing more into mining. Also, I believe our country to be blessed since it affords many opportunities of science 
and technological improvement especially due to high reliance on production of methods and techniques that are old 
(for example: dependence on coal for energy production rather than employment of solar voltaic systems for energy 
production something that can not only reduce carbon emission into the environment but also create jobs and fill our 
large unused fields.) Outside learning I enjoy music and meeting new persons!!! Thanks.

90,Techniques For Iron Recovery From Chalcopyrite (Cufes​2​):  A Review,"to date there are limitations on commercial practices that aims directly at extracting iron from chalcopyrite. this is because for years chalcopyrite has mostly been mined for copper and iron discarded with slag. a technique called beneficiation that involves hydrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical processes is applied on chalcopyrite to recover both iron, copper and even sulphur. during the process of beneficiation copper is separated from iron and tapped off as copper matte while iron exit the furnace in the form of fayalite (iron [ii] silicate). some new approaches have focused specifically at reducing iron (ii) silicate to element iron for economic utilization. such operations are done at temperatures of 1000+ o​c. the recovered iron can be used as an alternative feed material to replace scrap steel in the steelmaking processes. this continued invention that aims at utilization of iron from chalcopyrite will be of economic value and at the same time addressing environmental associated with steelmaking using scrap. a detailed review of techniques for processing chalcopyrite and methods for iron recovery from chalcopyrite were discussed. methods that are found suitable in iron recovery from chalcopyrite are the direct reduction and magnetic separation. a combination of the two methods is effective.","chalcopyrite, fayalite, direct reduction, beneficiation","Beneficiation of chalcopyrite is a growing technology (Hyvarinen et al, 1999). Recent investigation has focused on beneficiation chalcopyrite mainly to recover copper. Although iron occurred in the mineral in high content for many years it has been disposed as waste during the beneficiation of chalcopyrite. For the past years its supply was from its major iron ores such as Kiruna-type ore deposits. Research on recovery of iron from chalcopyrite is aimed directly at providing an alternative feed material for steel electrical arc furnaces. During beneficiation, copper remains as copper matter while iron is tapped off as FeO.SiO2 the furnace and can be carried out to RHF reduction furnaces for iron recover. Reaction mechanisms in the reduction smelter show that the fayalite is reduced to Fe upon reaction with carbon or graphite in the direct reduction process. The reaction requires high temperatures of more than 1200​o​C and hence high energy usage at a roasting temperature of 3 hours. CaO as additive has effect on smelting temperature. There is a decrease in smelting temperature with increase in CaO. Literature suggests that the smelting reduction method has good iron recovery rates up to 90%wt Iron powder but combining the reduction method and magnetic reduction the recovery rate is improved and recovered iron powder can have up to 96.21% iron grade (Li et al, 2013). Iron can also be recovered simultaneously from chalcopyrite through chloride leaching.

91,Appraisal Of Measures In Enhancing Professionalism And  Ethical Conducts Among Quantity Surveyors In Nigerian,"quantity surveyors are one of the main professionals in the construction industry; they render service to construction clients which incorporate architects, building proprietors, investors, government organizations, engineers, and contractual workers. they engage in evaluating, cost administration, obtainment administration, cost planning, contract organization, plausibility studies, resource monetary administration, all exercises identified by making money in the construction industry. recently, quantity surveying profession in nigeria has one way or the other influenced by unethical practices display by its members. due to the development, this paper aims to evaluate the measures in improving professionalism and ethical behaviours among quantity surveyors in nigerian construction industry with a viable way to deal with a moral appraisal of quantity surveyors in the nigerian construction industry in an approach to upgrading moral standard among them. it was uncovered in the findings that that transparency & accountability in contract administration, leaders serving as role models and constant supervision of ethics are the most notable measures to enhance ethical conducts among quantity surveyors. the study recommends that powerful disciplines like punishments, withdrawal of authentication or even cancellation of the permit on dull infringement might be presented by nigerian institute of quantity surveyors (niqs) to minimized unethical practices among its members.","unethical, professionalism, behaviour","and Recommendations Unethical conduct by Quantity Surveyors has one way or the other expedite negative impact on the nature of construction. The supposition of construction professionals (Architects, Builders and Civil/Structural engineers) concerning the measures in upgrading moral conduct among Quantity Surveyors is high in the area of experience Quantity Surveyors serving as a role model. It was additionally uncovered in the findings that that transparency & accountability in contract administration and constant supervision of ethics are the most notable measures to enhance ethical conducts among Quantity Surveyors. Moreover, to conquer unethical practices among Quantity Surveyors in the construction industry, prompt advances must be taken to guarantee that all contract administration must be straightforward, accountable and responsible. In like manner pioneers and experienced Quantity Surveyors should fill in as a great good example to youthful graduate ones. Most Quantity surveying organizations are led by experienced QS who are formally trained in professional ethics, and construction organizations must stress on issues of professional ethics and enforce it on all young Quantity Surveyors. It is a clear fact that leadership serves as role model to enhance 592","construction industry ebunoluwa bimbola akinrata and adedayo johnson ogungbile department of quantity surveying, the federal university of technology akure, ondo state, p.m.b 704, akure, ondo state, nigeria. akinrataebun@gmail.com, adedayo_johnson@ymail.com","References

92,An Alternate Approach For The Numerical Modeling Of  Isothermal Flash Calculation Using Peng-Robinson,"in an industrial process for the design and simulation, the phase equilibrium of mixture and thermodynamic properties are required. due to this reason, the flash calculation plays an important role to solve the industrial problem. in this research, the peng-robinson equation of the state is applied which is widely used to find out the thermodynamic properties at phase equilibrium in the critical region for the system of hydrocarbon and related compounds. the behavior of four binary mixtures is observed by using mathematical modeling of peng-robinson equation of the state. the pressure-volume behavior and pressure mole fraction behavior of both liquid and vapor phase at equilibrium are studied by mathematical modeling of isothermal flash calculation. the pressure mole fraction behavior is compared with the experimental data taken from literature which states that both mathematical modeling’s of isothermal flash calculations flow same behavior with the experimental data.","flash calculation, methane, carbon dioxide","In this research, the mathematical modeling is applied on PR EOS for hydrogen n-propane, methane n-butane, carbon dioxide propane, and methane n-decane mixture to study the pressure-volume relationship and phase behavior. The hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide have an important role in the chemical industry, so the information related to phase equilibrium and thermodynamic properties. The prediction of phase behavior by PR EOS modeling accurately describes the experimental results for all these gases but in hydrogen propane mixture the deviation in liquid phase is noted due to low pressure and due to presence of lighter gas hydrogen and in carbon dioxide propane mixture the presence of carbon dioxide affect the VLE of mixture and it also shows the deviation in limited range of pressure but when pressure is moderate it show less deviation and at high pressure it shows almost negligible deviation from experimental behavior . The isotherms obtained between pressure and volume shows that when the pressure approaches zero the volume start continues to increase and gasses start to behave as ideal gases. In pressure mole fraction relationship, the mole fraction of all components of the mixture is obtained vapor-liquid equilibrium by iterating pressure in a specific range. The pressure mole fraction of components relationship in both phases obtained by model shows that prediction is given by model for the solution of problem accurate as experimental results. 5.

93,The Effect Of Business Processes Re-Engineering On  Improving Customer Satisfaction & Retention In The,"the focus of this paper is about business processes re-engineering in the manufacturing industry, with the aim of achieving customer satisfaction and retaining more customers. the benefits of bpr were discussed in the indenture of the benefits of total quality management (tqm). three sets of questionnaires were designed to extract data from customers, service agents and suppliers of the organization. this was to scrutinize the proficiency of business processes as a vindication assistance to correct customer loss. it was then established that customers are inclined to the organization’s processes than service agents and suppliers, therefore we recommend that through the practice of business process re-engineering, organizational goals must be aligned with the needs of customers",consumables,", Recommendations and the Way Forward The results indicate that the accessibility of customers is a challenge to the organization, however with the efforts to re-design their processes, they can minimize these challenges and not only be accessible to their customers but also be able to retain them. On the other hand, customers are satisfied with the quality of services provided therefore re- designing the organization’s processes may not be necessary. Service agents are reliable to the organizations, and the organizations customers and they make an effort to build a strong relationship between the organization and its suppliers. Another look at the survey results show that customers are more distressed than service agents and suppliers with the organization’s processes. It is recommended of the organization to aid customers by ensuring accessibility of their products, improve their speed in response to customer queries, decrease their service time, meaning delivering service as convenient as possible, and ensure the scope of the service is understood. This can be achieved by means of implementing or practicing bureaucratic management, management by rules and procedures. The importance of business process has been outlined in the research and it is evident that customer expectations and transcends are achieved by putting emphasis and effectively managing the business processes result in cost efficiency, timeous and reliable service to customer. More research in the future can still be conducted on various aspects such as contemporary management approaches, tools and techniques of managing processes, to name a few, to achieve significant customer satisfaction and retention levels in the manufacturing industry.

94,Identifying And Analyzing The Most Important  Fundamentals To Improve Project Management,"this research paper identifies and analyses the most important fundamentals to improve project management performance in south africa. many important factors were identified in this study such over 60% of participants have a certificate to none formal project management education, which compromise the quality of any project, and increases the number of project failures in the country. furthermore, project managers face many challenges from community participation within the project, project creeps, and political influences to getting the right team members for the project on board. therefore, it is recommended that a partnership between project management south africa (pmsa), higher education institution, public and private sectors should work together in bringing about standard requirements to practice as project managers and standard performance for practicing project managers. this study can be used in the draft of policies regulating the project management industry as well as when developing project management curriculum at higher education institutions, as it points out the fundamentals to improve project management performance in south africa.",,"and the Way Forward In conclusion, this paper presents data collected and analyses of practicing project managers from various industries. Technical knowledge and experience in fields such as Engineering, Construction, Marketing atc does not necessarly guarantees that an individual will be an effective project manager (Rwelamila and Ssegawa, 2014). Though Pollack and Adler (2016) argue that there is a link between project management skills and information technology skills in organizational performance. PM has a significant contribution in different industries and organizations, whether provide or public (Smith, 2000). For project management techniques to be implementation successful does not only project managers to be skilled in traditional PM techniques but also to be multi-skilled in areas such as IT to improve performance. (Hornstein, 2015). Therefore future study can involve how project management courses remodeled to include to include variety of techniques, outside the traditional PM techniques. The data has shown that over 35% of participates have a certificate in project management, 36.36% of participates are involved in projects that are over 25.1 million and above, 72.72 % have PM work experience that is 5 years and below, and 63.64% on completed 1 – 10 projects. Rwelamila and Ssegawa (2014) stated that many practicing project manager in South Africa do not adequate knowledge and experience to carry out PM techniques in projects or within organizations effectively. The deduction from this research work supports continuous learning in the profession of PM. Therefore, it is recommended that: (1) As a developing country, it is crucial for South African institutions, public and private to collaborate with the PMSA in developing world class course content of project management courses which include experiential training for newly growing project managers in the country. (2) Project managers need to be empowered to act like entrepreneurs by being able to identify and exploit market opportunities Acknowledgements We like to demonstrate our appreciation to Professor Charles Mbohwa, Executive Dean from the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment at the University of Johannesburg, for his immense guidance in the field of as well as for funding this project through his research grant.

95,Implementing A Quality Management System To Improve  Customer Satisfaction: A Study Of A Medical Devices,"customer satisfaction plays a very significant role in the success of any business. increased customer satisfaction ensures business continuity. implementing a quality management system (qms) is one of the ways to improve processes in an organization therefore improving operations and improving the quality of service. certification through qms administers the measurement of performance for processes and ensures continuity of the improvements. iso 13485 is a standard which represents the requirements for a comprehensive quality management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices. the standard is in harmony with the iso 9001, with additional requirements to guide the medical device industry. a questionnaire was administered to the top five customers and employees of small medical devices company. when questionnaires were analysed, the response received had supported the researcher’s idea, that the implementation of a qms has a positive effect on customer satisfaction. through the findings of the study, several gaps were identified from the current operations, and through these gaps, improvement can be implemented utilising qms principles that have been proven to play a major role in continuous improvement and customer satisfaction over the years as indicated in the literature review of the study.",iso 13485,"Based on the statistical analysis of the data for this study the results obtained from the customers support the idea that implementation of a QMS has a positive effect on Customer satisfaction. This statement is supported by both the qualitative and quantitative data obtained from the results of the questionnaires. This is in agreement with the conclusions made from the number of literature for this paper. Cronbach alpha also shows that analysis of data from this paper shows good correlation indicating that the data is reliable. Also from the information obtained from the questionnaires several gaps were identified from the current operations at this company, and through these gaps improvement can be implemented through the use of a QMS principles that have been proven over the years. A follow up internal audit should be conducted for the company and the findings should be used to verify the information obtained from this research is correct. As a follow up to this study the researcher intends to conduct a follow up study comparing different companies in the same industry to measure and establish if a fully functional QMS has an impact on customer satisfaction.","company nombulelo gqamane and nita sukdeo school of mechanical and industrial engineering department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg gauteng, south africa nsukdeo@uj.ac.za ngqamane@yahoo.com",
96,Assessing The Implications Of South Africa’S Integrated  National Electrification Programme’S Restricted Electricity,"south africa’s integrated national electrification programme provides low-income households with a free 20-ampere electricity supply connection. many of these households persist in using solid and liquid fuels like wood, coal and paraffin for heating and to a lesser degree for cooking. it is generally held that the use of dirty, less convenient fuels persists because they are less more affordable, but the restricted electricity connection also limits the type and number of appliances which can be used simultaneously. the implications of these restricted connections are explored in this paper with a mixed integer programming optimization model. household appliances are ranked according to their priority, and scheduled according to the lifestyle and needs of the household members. three scenarios encompassing the range of appliance power ratings are considered. it is found that the 20-ampere electricity supply does indeed restrict the use of appliances with medium and high-power ratings in peak evening periods. there is no such restriction for energy efficient or small appliances. increasing the electricity connection to a 40-ampere supply alleviates all restrictions. as low-income households become more affluent, they need to upgrade their electricity connection in order to make use of more diverse energy services.",electrification,"A binary linear programming model has been developed and used to investigate the implications of a restricted 20 Amp electricity supply connection for household appliance use. Three scenarios have considered to encompass the range of power ratings of appliances typically used in a low-income household. It is found that if appliances with medium and higher power ratings are used, the 20 Amp supply does indeed inhibit appliance use during peak evening periods, when it is assumed that all household members are presenting, and the bulk of household chores are done. In such cases, trade-offs need to be made by the household, for example switching the heater off in order to boil the kettle. If all appliances used have low power rating, appliances can be scheduled to fulfill all needs. Increasing the electricity supply connection to a 40 Amp connection alleviates all the restrictions. As households become more affluent and want to increase the electricity services they make use of (for example by using desktop computers, electric geysers, vacuum cleaners and tumble dryers), they need to upgrade to a 40 Amp connection. Significant savings can be achieved by using appliances with lower power ratings – the monthly electricity cost is roughly three times higher for appliances with high power ratings than for appliances with low power ratings.","supply connections zakaria yahia department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa (on leave from department of mechanical engineering, fayoum university, fayoum, egypt) zakariay@uj.ac.za, zakaria.yahia@fayoum.edu.eg kristy langerman department of geography, environmental management and energy studies university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa klangerman@uj.ac.za",

For differentiator, they focus on high level of customization and through interactive advertisement they give tailor-made messages to both online and offline of all segments. For higher segments or highest premium segments, advertisement will be one to one interactive dialogue and exchanges based completely upon customer feedback.","school of humanities and social sciences harcourt butler technical university kanpur, u.p., india harshmit0405@gmail.com r.r.k. sharma sanjay mittal chair professor (hag scale) department of industrial management and engineering indian institute of technology kanpur kanpur, u.p., india rrks@iitk.ac.in dr vinod kumar yadav associate professor school of humanities and social sciences harcourt butler technical university kanpur, u.p., india vkyadav@hbtu.ac.in vinayak drave department of industrial management and engineering, indian institute of technology, kanpur, u.p., india vinayak@iitk.ac.in",
98,Exploring The Impact Project Definition Readiness Index On  Capital Projects For Coal-Fired Power Station Projects,"eskom is constantly responsible for the management of capital construction projects in order to sustain their assets and increase their generation capacity. front end planning (fep) is an important phase before the execution of the project, as it determines the scope of the project to be executed. failure to have well defined scope leads, to scope deviations during execution that results in escalated cost and delays in the schedule. eskom adopted pdri as part of fep in order to improve the scope definition level. pdri is a tool designed by cii in order to quantify the level of scope definition through the fep. this research is conducted to evaluate the impact of integrating pdri on fep for capital coal projects.","front end planning, scope definition","From the interviews conducted it does can be concluded that the PDRI tool, is a useful and effective tool for FEP of the project. It assists with the development of scope ensuring that it’s well defined. It also assists in risk identification and risk can be resolved early or have mitigation strategies put in place when it’s not possible to resolve them. Over 50 % of the responded indicated that they depend on the facilitator to assist with the explanation of the requirements, and some have indicated that the interpretation of the elements it’s not standard depends on the facilitator. The PDRI assessment needs to be standardized further, so that it becomes less subjective. The technical experience and project management experience place a positive role on the score. The more technical experience the better the quality of designs and the project manager’s experience can help the team better prepare for the overall PDRI assessment. 647","yolisa andi motsepe, bheki makhanya and prof. j.h.c pretorius post-graduate school of engineering management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg auckland park, south africa olethu@gmail.com, bheki.makhanya@transnet.net, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za","References

99,Optimization-Based Scheduling Of Ingula Pumped Storage  Plant Under Demand Uncertainty,"electrical energy storage is one of the promising solutions of the irregular electricity demand issue. pumped-storage plants account for most of the storage capacity worldwide. it is popular for high capacity, good responsiveness and high efﬁciency. it can smooth peak loads, therefore plays a vital role in balancing the grid loads and enhancing the grid availability. a pumped-storage station can be operated in generation, pumping or idle states. in order to obtain an optimal plant schedule, a stochastic optimization model is proposed and the sample average approximation method is applied. the proposed model is used to determine the number of units to be hourly scheduled in generation or pumping mode. the model aims to minimize a supply-demand disparity and shortfall function as a weighted score taking into account the hourly grid demand. furthermore, the model considers the grid demand uncertainty by considering the main two different demand scenarios “winter and summer”, and many constraints which are limiting the operation of a pumped-storage station. the model is solved optimally with a case study derived based on the ingula pumped-storage station in south africa. results show that our model proposes pumping- generating schedules that could eliminate the disparity between demand and supply for both summer and winter demand profiles. furthermore, it could provide a robust schedule that could work for both demand scenarios.",energy storage,"This paper addressed the SPSSSP while incorporating grid demand uncertainty aspect. The objective of this study is to generate an optimal PSS schedule that determines the number of units to be hourly scheduled in generation or pumping mode. An MILP model based on the sample average approximation method is proposed with the objective of minimizing the weighted score of the supply-demand disparity. A case study, based on Ingula pumped-storage station in South Africa, showed that the proposed schedule could reduce the weekly supply-demand disparity by about 88%, 82% and 82% for the Winter, Summer and Robust Scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, the scheduled pumping capacity is more in the Summer Scenario than in the Winter and Robust Scenarios. So, for the Summer Scenario, the pumped-storage plant pumps and generates more on weekdays in comparison to the other two Scenarios. Also, during the summer, it is found that the pumped-storage plant generates for longer hours during the day. This is expected because the effect of the flat “Table Mountain” demand profile during the summer.","zakaria yahia department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa (on leave from department of mechanical engineering, fayoum university, fayoum, egypt) zakariay@uj.ac.za, zakaria.yahia@fayoum.edu.eg pule kholopane department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa pulek@uj.ac.za",
100,Employee Retention Strategies: Factors For Generation Y  Bursar Graduates,"the nature of work is changing, and so are the elements which are necessary to manage these different transformations. the focus of this study was to determine which factors were important to generation y engineering bursar graduates from a particular organisation; in particular those within their first 5 years of work. a theoretical framework from the literature was developed, and the case study research method was applied. the results showed that job satisfaction had the greatest influence as a retention factor. it was found that there was a difference between factors which influenced an employee to stay or leave.","bursar graduates, generation y","The design of employee retention strategies as a whole is a complex process; when taking into account the intricacies of human nature and the different life paths that people follow (be it out of personal choice or personal circumstance). The results did not show any significant difference between the differently tenured groups. This could primarily be because of both populations being Knowledge Workers and generally belonging to the same generation (Gen Y). What was evident though is that individuals at different stages in their personal and professional lives would have different needs; and that a balance between these segments is of great importance. This has implications for how employees are supported throughout their working career. Although a young graduate may have some support during the GDP phase, this can affect the continued growth and development of the individual after s/he exits from the GDP. This necessitates that the Talent Management (TM) and HR strategy for the greater workforce be adequately structured to ensure the continued retention of the internal talent pool, and that leadership/ management is sufficiently equipped to enable the employee retention effort. This need is compounded by a highly dynamic and competitive labour market landscape which is vying for the same talent. This requires that organisations reflect (and invest) more deeply into how their objectives and operations can be realised through human capital resources. There is a need for current employee retention strategies to be more employee-centric; i.e. that they need to respond to the needs of the individuals of the workforce. This can be achieved through the development of “highly targeted initiatives” which can be approached through more demographic segmentation of the workforce (e.g. aspects like age and gender). This will allow for the inclusion of the ‘softer’ elements of employee retention. In that way a more holistic framework to employee retention strategies at the organisation can be developed. A difference was also found between the factors which came out of the interviews, but which were not indicated in the perused documentation. It is important that the employee retention documentation (as well as GDP documents) comprehensively reflect these (possibly) implicit elements; as well as the initiatives that the organisation has been place to support the retention of its employees. The measurement of the effectiveness and success of an employee retention strategy (one that is more holistic and more reflective of employee-needs) needs to be considered. This entails developing ways to measure the outcomes of the EVP and EB strategies; and includes the investigation the measurement of investment on intellectual capital and efforts to attract the talent in the first instance. Future work would include the measurement of the success of employed retention strategies; as well as alternative methods of retaining institutional memory. More research can be conducted on contrasting the needs of the Gen Y with those from earlier Generations, so as to more adequately account for these differences in the employee retention effort. The feasibility of the expected retention period (i.e. how long should employees be retained for; considering the changing nature of work, and the nature of knowledge workers) should be explored as well. This research would also need to be expanded to other companies (multiple-case, embedded i.e. Type 4 Case study design). The implications of the study’s overall findings to the organisation’s current employee retention strategies were discussed; and the consequent recommendations are summarised below. 673","bontle tladi school of mechanical, industrial and aeronautical engineering university of the witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa bontle.tladi@wits.ac.za","REFERENCES

101,Benchmarking Energy Challenges In Palm Oil Mills In  Ghana,"the current energy crisis in ghana has affected significant number of industries which have direct impact on the country’s economy. amongst the affected industries are palm oil production industries even though the impact is less as compared to fully relied national grid industries. most of the large and medium palm oil production industries are partially grid reliance, however, the unavailability and the high cost palm biomass poses huge challenge. this paper aimed to identify and analyse the energy challenges associated with the palm oil production industries in ghana. the study was conducted on thirteen largest palm oil production plants in ghana. data was obtained by the use of questionnaire and observation. since the study aimed to compare the respective energy challenges associated with the thirteen largest palm oil mills under study and establish a benchmark that represents a common problem of all the thirteen mills under study, the study uses cross-tabulation analysis and analysis of variance (anova) as the statistical tools to validate the benchmark. the results indicate that, lack of sustainability of palm biomass supply chain is the key energy challenge in the palm oil production industries in ghana. other problems include intermittent power supply from the grid but limited to the medium scale mills. a baseline was set by comparing the boiler capacity and the palm biomass produced by the large scale mills and determined the sustaining period of the biomass produced when considered as boiler fuel. the average value obtained from all the large scale mills is considered as the proposed energy challenge benchmark. the one-way anova test revealed that there is statistically significant difference amongst the boiler capacity, ffb processing capacity, quantity of biomass produced and the average sustaining period. the post-hoc scheffe test then revealed that there is statistically significant difference between the boiler capacity and the biomass produced. the results also revealed that there are statistically significant differences between the boiler capacity and the average sustaining period. there were no other significant differences between the other parameter groups. 676",,"Most of the large and medium palm oil production industries are partially grid reliance, however, the unavailability and the high cost palm biomass poses huge challenge. To identify the specific common energy problems associated with palm oil mills in Ghana, survey was conducted across regions in Ghana. The survey sample was limited to only large and medium scale mills. The descriptive statistical method adopted for this survey was suitable. The data was obtained through questionnaire with response rate of 86.67 percent. The cross tabulation analysis was performed on several thematic areas. The response on the issue of biomass sustainability indicated that, the cost of biomass supply from local small scale mills in addition to transportation compel the large scale mills to consider intermittent operation in a day. The survey also revealed that the medium scale mills utilise the empty fruit bunch as boiler fuel and therefore do not experience any challenge with regard to biomass supply chain. The survey also revealed that, the steam boilers used in four of the five large scale mills are over 20 years old. However, they are retrofitted to improve their efficiency between 75 and 85 percent. Amongst the three challenges identified by the survey, the inconsistent supply of palm biomass is the key energy challenge associated with the large scale mills. This challenge results in intermittent operation of the steam boiler, reduces the operation period to 10 hours instead of 20 hours a day. This subsequently affects the daily production of the mill. The energy challenge benchmark has been established by the study based on the aforementioned key challenge. This baseline was set by comparing the boiler capacity and the palm biomass produced by the large scale mills and determined the sustaining period of the biomass produced when considered as boiler fuel. The average value obtained from the values of all the large scale mills is considered as the proposed energy challenge benchmark. A one-way ANOVA test revealed that there is statistically significant difference amongst the boiler capacity, FFB processing capacity, quantity of biomass produced and the average sustaining period. The Post-Hoc Scheffe test then revealed that there is statistically significant difference between the boiler capacity and the biomass produced. The results also revealed that there are statistically significant differences between the boiler capacity and the average sustaining period. There were no other significant differences between the other parameter groups.","mathias b. michael department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa m.michael73@gmail.com esther t. akinlabi department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa etakinlabi@uj.ac.za, tien-chien jen department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa tjen@uj.ac.za",

106,Customisation Through Technology In Small To Medium  Furniture Enterprises,"the needs of the people are no longer homogenous but are constantly changing at a rapid rate. these changes must be met with a high level of customisation. customisation is enhanced with advancements in flexible technology. this paper will focus on small to medium enterprises (sme’s) and seeks to establish how the principles of mass customisation and investment in technology are related to the capability of a company to produce customised products. using three cases in furniture industry, the research evaluated the extent to which technology advancement has been employed in the furniture industry sme sector, its requirement and the effect on customisation. it was established that advanced technological and customisation strategies play an important role in achieving customer satisfaction. technology use can have a dramatic effect on the productivity of a company in a competitive environment.","customisation, furniture 727","and Recommendations Case A is still in the craft industry era they have not evolved to embrace technology. Workers in Case have a low level of education which limits the level of innovation. Innovation requires prior knowledge. Case C workers have formal education. The level of education gives them an advantage, they have a high level of absorptive capacity, and they have embraced technology which is the main element of mass customisation. Customers are able to customise their products through the use of information technology and modularisation. Producing unfinished furniture allows customers to customise and also resale their furniture after adding value. Managers of SME Companies must possess some prior knowledge to enhance their innovativeness. The other observation made is that companies that have older employees worker at shop floor level as well as management level tend to be less innovative. In conclusion for SMEs to be successful in Mass customisation process they need to consider their ability to give a customer a wide options, this can be done by using modular designs and allowing the customer to mix and match the different units. The other way that they can achieve the ability to mass customise is by having a wide range of material, finish and using quality outsourced assembling parts. A survey can be used to generalise the results obtained in this study. 731","partson dube mechanical engineering and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, 2006, sa partsond@uj.ac.za charles mbohwa quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, 2006, sa cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

107,Evaluating The Impact Of Tpm In A Railway And Mining  Component Manufacturing Company.,"this paper evaluates the impact of total productive maintenance (tpm) in a railway and mining component manufacturing company. literature suggest that tpm is an approach innovative to maintenance and its major goals are no defects, no accidents and no breakdowns. many authors have argued that tpm improves quality, equipment productivity, prevents unexpected breakdowns and reduces defects. reliable manufacturing equipment is considered as a major contributor to the profitability and performance of manufacturing systems in today’s extremely evolving environment. most organizations function effectively today because the equipment is reliable and available thereby maximising production throughput and profit. a case study was conducted and it involved a mixed method approach where both quantitative and qualitative data was gathered and analysed. the company implemented tpm through the following initiatives; autonomous maintenance, employee improvement, planned maintenance, quality maintenance, education and training and safety and health. tpm was implemented for eighteen months. this study made use of the following maintenance improvement tools, tpm, failure mode effects and critically analysis (fmeca) and cause and effect diagram. maintenance performance factor such as overall equipment effectiveness (oee) was analysed before and after tpm implementation. the results of this study showed that tpm implementation contributes to equipment reliability. there was an improvement in overall organizational performance. through fmeca, maintenance tasks were prioritized and risk priority numbers (rpn) were calculated for particular equipment. key performance indicators such as productivity and oee were on an upward trend while there was a reduction in defect rates. communication among workers, workers and management, and among different departments was improved. worker motivation was improved through autonomous maintenance. however maintenance performance in some departments was found to be too low due to unavailability of data and worker inconsistency. this paper contributes to the theory and practice of tpm implementation. hypotheses tests could not be done due to very low levels of respondents. key words: tpm, equipment reliability, manufacturing, productivity and worker involvement. 733",,"TPM has begun to be a management criterion in all kinds of organisations. TPM concepts can be effectively practiced to enhance manufacturing performance in the organisation. An effective TPM program can address the organisations maintenance related obstacles with the perspective to optimise equipment performance. The study reveals that TPM concepts can assist manufacturing organisations in the search for achieving enhanced manufacturing performance. Therefore, it is important for organisations to integrate maintenance related performance aspects into the overall organisation performance systematic approach. Quality tools such as the cause and effect diagram are appropriate for designing and producing reliable systems. This paper could not test hypotheses due to very low levels of respondents and the researchers have agreed to make this testing part of their future work. This paper did not calculate the demand rate of the major products manufactured by this company. Maintenance efficiency and costs were also not calculated and will be treated as part of future work.","yvonie n. mawane and goodwell muyengwa department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa yvoniem@uj.ac.za, gmuyengwa@uj.ac.za",
108,An Empirical Analysis Of Total Quality Management And  Total Productive Maintenance In Industry 4.0,"the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of industry 4.0 adoption and operational performance improvement due to apply total quality management (tqm) and total productive maintenance (tpm). the analyzed sample was collected from 147 brazilian manufacturers which have been practiced tqm and tpm for at least 10 years and during the past few years have started to adopt industry 4.0 technologies. multivariate data analysis was applied into the collected data in order to examine such relationships. our statistical tests indicate that both tqm and tpm practices act as mediators for the relationship between industry 4.0 and operational performance improvement. hence, we mention that the companies which decide to join industry 4.0 must have properly addressed these practices to entirely benefit from the advances in information and communication systems. this study contributes to threefold. first, it provides evidence to underpin theoretical indications previously argued but lack empirical validation. second, the identification of relationship in an emerging economy context allows to understand the specific benefits or challenges that industry 4.0 adoption. third, comprehending how these approaches interact to help managers to avoid difficulties and set the suitable expectations along their implementation.",industry 4.0,,"guilherme luz tortorella, eduardo ferreira da silva and danieli braun vargas department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina caixa postal 476, 88040-900, florianopolis, sc, brazil g.tortorella@ufsc.br, e.f.silva@ufsc.br, danieli.v@ufsc.br","References

109,Big Data Security Proposed Solution  Ibtissame Kandrouch,"following the remarkable evolution of new technologies, and the computerization of different transactions and devices in several areas in recent years, the generation of data in its various forms has become increasingly important. hence the emergence of the new era of big data. this new phenomenon of big data has appeared with several advantages, but in return, it confronts several challenges linked to security. this paper highlights the various security issues that may exist throughout the big data life cycle. and touches some needs necessary to reinforce the security of these data. thus, the paper presents a solution allowing the improvement of the security level offered by systems allowing the management of these data during their real time treatment.","big data, security issues","The security is a major factor. Indeed, the key to success ensuring data privacy for organization is effective information management and governance. Data privacy applies to every internal and external network user within the global business community. However, many people are unaware that there are some measures to protect themselves against the most critical risk. To conclude, we try to clarify and explain the concept of the big data. We mentioned the different challenges of security. Finally we proposed a solution to reinforce the processing and security of big data.","adsi team, system engineering laboratory national school of applied sciences ibn tofail university, kenitra, morocco ibtissame.kandrouch@uit.ac.ma manale boughanja adsi team, system engineering laboratory national school of applied sciences ibn tofail university, kenitra, morocco boughanja.manale@gmail.com nabil hmina system engineering laboratory, adsi team national school of applied sciences kenitra, morocco hmina@univ-ibntofail.ac.ma habiba chaoui adsi team, system engineering laboratory national school of applied sciences ibn tofail university, kenitra, morocco mejhed90@gmail.ma",
110,Analyzing Human Factors In Fitness For Service Assessments  – A Boiler Case Study,"a boiler is one of the critical systems in various industries even in the food industry. the cost of boiler maintenance including repair and replacement are very high. therefore, options such as fitness for service are used as cost effective measures to demonstrate the performance characteristic of a component that might be operating with a flaw. this option is prone to a number of avoidable human errors like other maintenance functions. this paper aims to identify and examine the human factors acting as barriers for successful performance of fitness for service assessments in a boiler. it further recommends the possible solutions for the reduction and avoidance of reoccurrence of human errors. a single exemplary case study of a boiler in an anonymous company was selected. the study adopted a documentation review and observation as data collection tools to examine the source of human errors. human errors such as wrong and insufficient measurements, poor work planning, and improper data collection and recording were identified as key barriers for successful performance of fitness for service assessments of a boiler system. the study further revealed that human factors such as lack of experience and training, poor communication and organizational practices are key causal factors.","boiler, flaw, human factor","The results obtained in this paper are very important to the maintenance personnel focusing on fitness for service of boilers and pressure vessel specifically those having interest in dealing with human error. The study analyzed the human errors and human factors that are regarded as barriers to the success of fitness for service assessments. It was indeed discovered that if enough attention is not paid to human error, the fitness for service assessments will not achieve the desired goal. The missing measurements, poor records of data and lack of original documentation to support decision making were leading human errors hindering the successful implementation of fitness for service. Fitness for service is one of the processes that are data hungry, hence without appropriate data it is impossible to make proper and accurate decisions concerning the life of a boiler systems operating with flaws. The lack of knowledge, low level of education and insufficient training, organizational practices, poor work planning and poor communication were regarded as error causal factors having an impact on the fitness for service assessments. The immediate solutions to the issue of human error in fitness for service assessments of boilers were presented. These included the development of checklists, training, management commitment, electronic data recording and preparation of sketches prior thickness measurements. It is then recommended that as the first step to adoption of fitness for service assessments, training must be conducted with an aim of reducing human error, hence improve the performance. The adoption of human factors principles in fitness for service assessments process can help the companies to properly manage human errors and even eliminate them. The following are considered to be eligible for future research focus: • Analyzing human error in fitness for service assessments to examine the state of the industry practices. • The development of proper reporting systems that incorporate human factors principles. • A framework for better managing human error in fitness for service of boiler systems. 6.

111,Detection Of High Impedance Fault In Distribution Networks  By Using Time-Frequency Transform S And Artificial,"high impedance faults due to the high magnitude of impedance in their paths have little fault current. therefore, network security devices are generally unable to identify them. this paper presents a new method for identifying high impedance faults. first, the high impedance waveforms that have been extracted from actual experiments are de-noising by the wavelet transform. the waveform of other transient network conditions is also derived from the simulation of the standard 13-bay ieee distribution system in pscad software. then, by using time-frequency transformation s, extraction of the selected features of this waveform is performed by principle components analysis (pca) of the monitoring sample points and entering the neural network. finally, to distinction between transient states and high impedance faults and detection this fault, the multilayer perceptron neural network has been used. the results show clearly the effectiveness of this method","non-linear, random, unsteady","In this paper, a new method for detecting high impedance fault using simultaneous application of wavelet transform, S-transform, fundamental component analysis and neural network was presented. Because of the high impedance fault data obtained from the actual tests and final results shows the acceptable percentage of success, then this method can be used as a safe method.","neural network iman safinejad hormozgan electric distribution company iran, hormozgan im.safinejad@gmail.com mehrdad hajizadeh hormozgan electric distribution company iran, hormozgan mehr.haji@yahoo.com mohammad medi khademi hormozgan electric distribution company iran, hormozgan khademi366@gmail.com",
112,A Capacitated Clustering Heuristic For Large Datasets Jacoba H. Bührmann And Ian Campbell,"a regret order based clustering heuristic is proposed to create capacitated clusters for spatial datasets with equal weighting. this heuristic can be used in a vast number of applications, including the capacitated p- median problem (cpmp) and capacitated facility location problem (cflp). the heuristic is scalable and therefore also useful to cluster large instances. the heuristic builds on an initial uncapacitated clustering solutions the can be generated by various clustering methods and has proven to provide good quality end solutions independent of the quality of the initial solution. different types of regret proximities are tested for the capacitated p-median problem (cpmp) in particular. the results along with visual plots on a map of geometrical data are shown to illustrate the impact of the different proximity rules.","clustering, cpmp, ccp, p-median","When creating capacitated clusters for the single source CPMP with homogenous capacity constraints, traditional methods often do not take time complexity into consideration and are too slow to solve instances with a large number of data points. Cluster-based approaches are more practical as it is able to create clusters with reasonable time complexity. These methods can however not guarantee that capacity constraints are adhered to. The two-phase PROBUC method is an effective heuristic to create capacitated clusters for converting uncapacitated clusters to capacitated clusters. However, certain uncapacitated clustering methods tend to create unbalanced solutions where many points need to be re-assigned to create capacitated clusters, for example, the single linkage hierarchical clustering method (Bührmann, 2016). In these cases, points are reassigned to neighboring clusters, and these neighboring clusters quickly reach capacity. In other work, points are assigned to another cluster with enough capacity where the cluster center is not necessarily the closest or second closest one to the point. This causes a “jumping” effect, where an under capacitated cluster overlaps a full cluster (Bührmann, 2016). In the PROBUC method, this effect is avoided by not allowing points in overcapacity clusters to move to any other cluster than the closest. Instead, PROBUC allows the re-assignment of points in clusters that are within a percentage (typically P = 10%) of the capacity limit to their next closest cluster center. This makes space for transferal of points from overcapacitated clusters. The algorithm is also designed to prevent clusters becoming empty, by not allowing points to move out of clusters with only 10% of the capacity limit remaining. Results from the two instances indicate that solutions producing the best objective function do not necessary result in the best visual attractive solution. It is therefore important to also consider visual attractiveness when studying the CPMP and other related network problems as suggested by Poot et al. (1999) and Kant et al., (2008). Starting with balanced unconstrained clustering solutions do provide an advantage when using the PROBUC heuristic. Most of the time spend in the PROBUC heuristic method is spent in the improvement phase. If the solutions produced by the unconstraint starting solution is of good quality, the number of points that need to be re-assigned are so few that the need of the improvement phase becomes less significant. Overall the method was able to effectively create capacitated constraint solutions in a very short CPU time of less than 200 seconds for 13509 data points. Figure 5.

113,Autonomous Toddler Surveillance Robot Dr. Santaram Venkannah,"parents are the most qualified persons to look after their toddlers. however, there has been instances where the parents were briefly distracted in doing another task and unfortunately, it resulted into the toddlers falling in swimming pools and dying from drowning. this study aims at the design and manufacture of a toddler surveillance robot to reduce the death by drowning in the country. the robot reads the rssi strength of a bluetooth signal to identify when a toddler is alone outside and makes use of computer vision to locate and track the toddler from a safe distance. using deep neural network, the robot was trained to recognize if the toddler is playing near a swimming pool or has fallen in it. thus, it will automatically activate its alarm buzzers to notify the parents about the dangerous situation. the robot uses the rocker bogie mechanism to easily move over rough terrain and steps found in a backyard. moreover, the robot is equipped with a gps chip to locate its position and before tracking the toddler, it will save its initial gps location. this initial gps location is used when the parent comes close to the robot or when the acknowledgement button is pressed, which instructs the robot to return to its initial position.","— autonomous robot, computer vison, rocker bogie","The robot satisfied its aim and objectives. It was able to read the Bluetooth signal strength of a toddler’s Bluetooth tag and determine whether the toddler was roaming alone, by calculating the difference between the RSSI strength signal of the Bluetooth tags and started looking for him/her when the difference was more than 20 dBm which is equivalent to a wall blocking the Bluetooth signal of the parent’s Bluetooth tag. The robot was also able to detect a toddler and follow him/her within a safe distance (about 2 meters) while being more accurate at the walking speed of the toddler compared to the running speed of the toddler. The robot is able to accurately estimate the amount of danger in a given situation 8 out of 10 times. The accuracy can be improved through further training and testing. Furthermore, the robot is able to maintain a safe working temperature within its body which is 55 0C. This contributes to the good performance of the microcontroller, sensors and battery lifespan safety. Overall the project was successful and will be able to help reduce the number of death by drowning of toddlers as well as providing a safe environment for them. Parents will also be warned by a sound alert of about 120 dB if the toddler is in danger. OpenCV and computer vision in general is still under development, thus the system is not perfect and can be enhanced through further testing and training. Dataset are also not easily available which can contribute to the enhancement of neural network of the robot. Lastly, it has been found that using neural network, the robot can be modified very easily for other vulnerable age groups such as monitoring the safety of elder persons and handicapped persons. This can be done by changing the dataset used to train the robot and defining other dangers that the latter needs to detect. The price of the prototype is high as it is a one-off production. If mass produced, the price will be reduced. Rs 18,182.75 (USD 542.76) is relatively cheap compare to other companion robots discussed in the existing model section and they do not offer danger detection services. For example, Aristotle (Martinko, 2017), which is a fixed camera mounted on a table for real time video streaming and lighting control only, costs USD 400 (Rs 13,400), PaPeRo (Partner type Personal Robot) companion robot costs USD 600 (Rs 20,100) per month, Kuri robot (Heykuri.com, 2017), costs USD 799 (Rs 26,766.5) Ipal Robot (ipalrobot, 2017) cost between USD 1,500 and USD 2,000 (Rs 50,250 to 67,000) and Jibo robot costs USD 900 (Rs 30,150).","mechanical and production engineering department faculty of engineering, university of mauritius reduit, republic of mauritius sv@uom.ac.mu dan errappa mechanical and production engineering department faculty of engineering, university of mauritius reduit, republic of mauritius dan.errappa@umail.uom.ac.mu",
114,Application Of Computer Aided Technologies In The Clothing  And Textile Companies In Gauteng,"the purpose of this study is to establish the extent to which computer aided technologies are applied in the clothing and textile sector in gauteng. the study was empirical, quantitative and non-experimental research. data was collected through a cross-sectional survey that was conducted on one sample of clothing and textile companies. the surveyed companies were identified through purposeful sampling. the participating companies were a mixture of small, medium and large companies. the data gathering tool was a self-administered questionnaire. the computer aided technologies investigated are; computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, computer integrated manufacturing, electronic data interchange, electronic point of sale, and internet. findings from the analysis show that the applications were not equally popular. the most popular packages were the internet and computer aided design. electronic point of sale, computer aided manufacturing, and electronic data interchange had a fair number of users. the least popular technology was computer integrated manufacture. these computer applications are not only relevant to the clothing and textile sector. they are equally useful in other sectors. the technologies help reduce the cycle times from design to manufacture and manufacturing companies can accept customer orders closer to due dates.",gauteng,"This study investigated the application of computer aided technologies in clothing and textile companies in Gauteng, South Africa. The technologies analysed are CAD, CAM, CIM, EDI, EPOS and the internet. The results were generated from 104 clothing and textile companies that were chosen purposefully. Hence the results cannot be generalized to the clothing and textile population in Gauteng. The surveyed companies showed a low uptake of computer aided technologies. This could be a partial explanation to the poor competitiveness of the clothing and textile companies in South Africa as observed by Morris & Barnes (2014). Outputs from this research are of value to academia and policy makers. The results stimulate the academia to do a more comprehensive study in order to get a country wide understanding of the computer aided technology usage in the sector. To the policy makers the findings point to the intervention that can be introduced to save the sector from collapse. Moreover the results help the clothing and textile companies see the need to invest in computer aided technologies. Findings from this study have also generated a platform for informative debates within the clothing and textile sector with focus on the relationship between computer-aided technologies and performance. 6. Recommendations 1. The results obtained from this study are based on one sample whose elements were selected purposefully. Generalisation cannot occur because random selection of elements was not done. To get a general view of the usage of computer aided technology in the clothing and textile at district, provincial or national level, it is necessary to involve the entire population of clothing and textile companies. This will allow the researcher to select the participants randomly, analyse the data and eventually generalise the findings. 2. There is need to conduct a study that focuses on clothing and textile companies’ understandings of the influence of computer aided technologies on company competitiveness. This will aid stakeholders in realising the extent to which these companies understand the importance of the technologies and will help render appropriate interventions where necessary. 3. Although this study was conducted in the clothing and textile industry, similar studies could be applied in other sectors. 1522","forbes chiromo department of mechanical and industrial engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa fchiromo@uj.ac.za andre nel department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa andren@uj.ac.za","References

115,"Integration Between Production Planning, Quality And  Sales: A Proposed Framework","production planning is a continuous process that aims to achieve particular products i at the right time in the future, which targets the best utilization of the available resources to satisfy the market demand. this study focuses on how production planning is to be integrated with quality control and sales. a myriad of variants of the problem has been addressed in literature, however this study will focus on two major variants observed in a brewing company located in gauteng, south africa. the first variant asks for integrating both production planning, quality control and sales process to obtain a more accurate and realistic production plan, whereas the second variant asks for addressing and analyzing the mutual influence between the three processes (production planning, sales and quality control) and the packaging and warehouse in the brewing company. to cope with these issues, a research framework is proposed in this paper. the aim of the proposed framework is to minimize the disparity between the planned production volume and the actual produced volume while considering the integration and the mutual influence between the aforementioned processes. the proposed framework is to be used as a starting point in developing a mathematical model that will tackle the aforementioned variants.","brewing process, quality, packaging, warehouse","Poor production planning decision making in the brewing company under study triggered a need for the research study on the topic. As a result of poor production planning decision, the working hours in the packaging department have been cut down which resulted in reduced salaries. The company needs to improve in sales forecasting, delivery and also with following the production plan. Quality as one of the major aspects that prevent the brewing department from meeting and following the production plan also needs to be looked into. Whilst the company prepares the production planning looking at what the market demand and capacity planning, production planning could go wrong due to quality and inventory build-up. The proposed frame work will use mathematical modelling to find balance between the committed volume and the actual volume and recommendations will come from the findings. The data collection is still in progress. 793","mamoletsi winnie nkadimeng, zakaria yahia and anup pradhan department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg south africa nkadimengwinnie@gmail.com, zakariay@uj.ac.za, anupp@uj.ac.za","References

116,"An Analysis Of Organizational Structure And Strategic  Management Of Film Companies In Harare, Zimbabwe","film companies need to manage and strengthen their operations to produce quality films and create a sustainable film industry. in order to achieve higher benefits from filmmaking, it is important to develop a good organizational structure and strategic management, and identify roles of film personnel and processes as well. this article examines the organizational structure of film industry and strategic management of film production. the findings are based on the literature and responses of survey questionnaires distributed to filmmakers of harare, zimbabwe. the study offers a better understanding of the connection between organizational structure and strategic management.",harare,"and Recommendation This paper present the findings on the organizational structure of film industries in Harare and strategies that are used by filmmakers to operate their organizations. Most Zimbabwean film companies use a basic organizational structure and the strategies that they employ are different from each other. Whilst the filmmakers are aware of the importance of hierarchy structure, teamwork and different ways of staying competitive, the film companies are still struggling to adopt and implement proper strategic management. There are so many external barriers that affect the implementation of most of strategic mechanisms; some of those barriers include lack of funding, piracy and lack of exposure to international exhibitions. 5.1 Recommendations 1. Zimbabwean filmmakers should take advantage of its beautiful scenic locations, which has not been fully exploited, to start co-productions with other well-established film industries. It has also become an international hub for competitive production studios to work with global film producers with excellent locations at favorable costs, especially when producing films with high computer graphics involved. 2. Film companies should not only come up with innovative ideas, but should also strive to implement them, re- invent itself and offer the global market a different mechanism of filmmaking. 3. Filmmakers should change their mindset of waiting for the government and donors to support them but rather seek other ways of fund-raising such as crowdfunding.

117,Critical Success Factors (Csfs) Of Mida Compact I Road  Transport Project In Ghana,"the purpose of this study is to provide insight into the critical success factors (csfs) of a quasi-public institution in the delivery of projects, including the institutional structure of mida, processes and procedures affecting the successful implementation of the transport project under the mida compact 1. in order to identify the critical success factors the study was planned and performed in two stages. the first stage of the approach was to subject the set of success factors identified in preliminary evaluation to expert group of respondents involved in the mida compact 1 project. the second stage of the process was to subject the selected csfs to full scale evaluation by expanding respondents to determine their relative importance. to determine the relative importance of the csfs based on the expanded survey data, two statistical analysis, namely ranking and factor analysis were performed. the results of the study show that seven (7) critical success factors affected the n1 highway. these include; clear donor guidelines on disbursement of funds, strong national ownership of the project, pre-project design consultation with 1525",,"The results obtained in this study has identified seven critical success factors for effective project delivery. These critical success factors have impacted positively on the overall performance of the MiDA Compact 1 road transport project. The project exhibited high quality and timely delivery as well as completion within the costs specified. Road users have affirmed their preference of the road in terms of its architectural design and its ability to accommodate huge traffic flow. Beneficiaries of the road has therefore commended the contractors for doing a good job. It was also evident that organizational and managerial attributes of MiDA has played a significant role in the efficient and successful delivery of the road project. It is therefore imperative to emulate the approach adopted by MiDA on the supervisory role it played to ensure the successful completion of the road project. This study has significantly contributed to the General body of knowledge in the following dimensions: • Provision of more information and contribution to the body of knowledge on CSFs for delivery of public projects, especially in the context of a quasi-public institution in Ghana; • Provision of more information to evaluate the notion of relevance of management skills and organization structure in the efficient delivery of project, especially in Ghana; and • Provision of necessary information to policy makers and political leadership in Ghana to make informed policy decisions on public project management. However, it is the general consensus that the success of the road project stemmed from the fact that the contractors were foreigners which by their inherent nature are accustomed to doing a good job. This raises several concerns about the ability of local contractors to deliver on large projects. It is therefore important for local contractors to build capacity and ensure high quality of projects as well as cost efficiency in order to be able to manage projects of huge magnitude. Project managers must therefore identify such critical success factors that promote the effective and efficient delivery of projects.","amevi acakpovi electrical and electronic engineering department accra technical university accra, ghana acakpovia@gmail.com abena m. adutwum 1open university of malaysia/ accra institute of technology (ait), accra-north accra, p.o.box: an19782, accra, ghana simplya30236@yahoo.com mathias bennet michael electrical and electronic engineering department accra technical university accra, ghana m.michael73@googlemail.com samuel blay amo electrical and electronic engineering department accra technical university accra, ghana blaysamuel10@gmail.com anthony deku mechanical engineering department accra technical university accra, ghana tonydeku@hotmail.com",
118,A Novel Implementation Framework For Iso 9001: 2015  Jolanda Becker And Wynand Van Dyk,"this study proposes an alternative implementation method for iso 9001:2015 by using knowledge transfer best practice as basis for the development of an implementation framework. iso 9001 is by far the most widely implemented iso management system with an implementation base of 1.1 million accreditations worldwide, and benefits of iso 9001 accreditation are well researched. despite this, implementation of the standard is at times superficial. it has been shown that diagrams assist with learning in preparation for a biology test. though the environments are very different, organizational learning and therefore the ability to implement iso 9001 requirements, might also be more effective if information is presented in a diagram or flowchart form. this principle was applied in the development of an alternative implementation framework in the form of an interactive and editable flow chart. this approach promotes the sustainable integration of requirements into existing operations. the benefits of certification and barriers to implementation of iso 9001 are well established. however, there is a gap in literature on implementation methods for iso 9001. this study will be a valuable contribution to the iso 9001 body of knowledge. companies seeking or maintaining iso 9001:2015 accreditations would find this model useful. 1. introduction the international organization of standardization (iso) 9001 management standard is the most widely implemented iso management system with an implementation base of 1.1 million accreditations across the world (figure 1). the next largest implementation base being iso 14 001, is standing at a quarter of iso 9001’s implementation base (the iso survey of management system standard certifications, 2016). two factors can be attributed for this wide implementation base: 1) increasingly iso 9001 is becoming a pre-requisite for doing business in both the private and public sector (mcadam & canning, 2001). 2) in addition, iso 9001 is generic in nature and therefore applicable to all industries. this is no different for iso 9001 accreditations within south africa. the number of accreditations in south africa (sa) have steadily increased over the years as can be seen in figure 2. when last measured in 2016 the number of iso 9001 accreditation was standing at 4761 accreditations across all industries (the iso survey of management system standard certifications, 2016). the advantages of iso 9001 accreditation are well established (rusjan & alič, 2010). however, researchers have also found numerous barriers to implementation, such as senior management’s understanding and attitude towards iso 9001 (yeung et al. 2003), and cases of superficial implementation (zeng et al., 2007). although benefits and barriers to implementation are well researched, there exists gaps in the literature as to how to address these barriers. the aim of this research is therefore to put forward an alternative implementation framework to promote internalization of iso 9001:2015 requirements for sustainable implementation. knowledge transfer best practice will be utilized to assist with the development of this framework. the framework was developed for a south african state owned enterprise (soe), however it is generic in nature and can be applied to any environment. 2158",,"In conclusion, ISO 9001 is by far the most widely implemented management system standard from the ISO series. Certification has been shown to be advantageous across many industries (Rusjan & Alič 2010). Despite this, there are challenges involved in implementing a sustainable QMS that is well integrated into an organization’s operations. This is supported by studies that show that: • The motivation for seeking accreditation determines the organization’s ability to quantify the benefits gained from accreditation (Yeung et al. 2003), • Superficial implementation of the standard is common among certified companies (Zeng et al., 2007). • There is evidence of “ceremonial conformity” in the audits of the QMS (Biazzo 2005). Despite the barriers being well research, no research could be found on how to address these challenges. Because of the wide implementation base and the lack of a means to address the known challenges pertaining to ISO 9001 implementation, finding a more effective means of integrating ISO 9001 into the operations of an organization in a sustainable way, will have major benefits across many industries. From a South African point of view, there is still a lack of literature on ISO 9001 within both the public and private sector. This is despite a growing number of ISO 9001 accreditations. This study is therefore particularly add value to this context. This study proposes an alternative implementation method for ISO 9001:2015 by using knowledge transfer best practice as basis for the development of an implementation framework. In addition it promotes internalization by Activities Monitoring and measuring Measurement calibration 2166","industrial engineering department university of stellenbosch stellenbosch, 7599, south africa 15059367@sun.ac.za, wvandyk@sun.ac.za","References

119,Implementation Of 5S In A Mechanical Workshop At  University Of Johannesburg: A Case Study,"the 5s technique is a powerful and effective lean improvement tool which can be applied to any organization to reduce waste, increase efficiency, and organize the workplace. the purpose of this paper is to report on the research work conducted on implementation of 5s technique in a mechanical engineering workshop at university of johannesburg with an aim to improve efficiency, quality and productivity; reduce abnormalities and wastages; and enhance overall performance. in a case study where unorganized arrangement of everything such as improper storage form, misplaced and incorrectly stored tools, and haphazard placement of unnecessary equipment and materials, the 5s technique has been implemented. a time study and work measurement techniques were used to measure how long it takes to look for a single item before and after implementation to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation. this case study makes use of pictures from before and after implementation of the ss, observations of time interval for searching a single tool using time study, as they relate to workplace organization and efficiency respectively. increased efficiency and productivity, organized workplace, and elimination of abnormalities resulted as major outcomes of the implementation of 5s in this study.","5s, efficiency, productivity, lean","This paper reported some important aspects of implementation and effectiveness of 5S technique in a mechanical workshop of University of Johannesburg. The successful implementation of 5Ss has minimized the department's abnormalities; reduced idle time and waste; enhanced the work place appearance and efficiency. A tremendous improvement in efficiency from 61% (before implementation) to 86% (after implementation) has been recorded. Implementing the 5S at the department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering is a success and pave the way for future work that targets to improve wherever possible in other laboratories, offices, and workspace for the mechanical department. Upon success, it is hoped that this work can further be taken to the whole university.

120,Evaluating The Energy Efficiency Of Coal Fired Furnace  Based On Rural Foundry Design And Material Selections In,"energy efficiency of furnace should be based on its ability to conserve heat within the combustion chamber. this mainly depends on the design and material selection of the furnace. the coal–fired furnace is common amongst the rural foundries in limpopo province. the coal fired furnace is used to melt aluminium scraps for production of cooking three legged aluminium pots commonly used as cooking utensil and sold within the local and national communities. the coal fired furnace is used due to its easy to manufacture, to operate and its low capital and running costs investment which is suitable for small batch production. however made of a mere superposition of two tinned drums, the current coal fired furnaces in rural foundries have long melting time ~ 6 hours, due to the design and material selected in manufacturing the furnace. this paper presents the analysis of design and material components of rural foundries furnaces in south africa and studies the energy efficiency of the particularly coal fired furnace. technical testing of energy in and output was conducted. findings show that with a heat loss of 2929.92 mj and only 2% energy efficiency the heat loss was one of the main contribution to the experienced long melting duration the insufficient supply of oxygen or air into coal fuel also plays critical role in the performance of the furnace, since combustion of coal depends greatly on the supply of oxygen or air. to improve the heat retention and the energy efficiency of the coal fired furnace used in the rural foundries, a re-design of the furnace and selection of specified new lining materials are the main conclusions.","coal fired furnace, heat loss","The current coal–fired furnace in rural foundry has low energy efficiency which was obtained at 2% this has been attributed to poor design of the furnace which permits heat loss through the opening of furnace hub and exhaust by radiation. The heat loss on the body of the furnace was attributed to inadequate thin insulating material which was unable to contain heat with the furnace. The poor supply of air into the furnace limited the performance of the furnace as incomplete combustion was established due to dependent on ambient temperature. The recommendation on the improvement of the coal-fired furnace were provided focusing on minimizing the heat loss can be by redesign to have an enclosure in the furnace which will include refractory lid with exhaust draft which allows minimal amount of heat to be lost through the furnace hub and exhaust. An increase in the thickness of the insulation or selecting alternatively refractory lining such as brick will improve the ability of the insulation to contain heat within the furnace. In addition, the current furnace does not have adequate air supply to fuel ratio to promote good thermal efficiencies of the combustion. The rural foundry coal-fired furnace has great potential of improving the energy efficiency which will have the bottom line impact such as increase the productivity, reducing melting time, reduce coal usage and fumes.","limpopo province kulani mageza metal casting technology station school of mining, metallurgy and chemical engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg kmageza@uj.ac.za antoine f. mulaba-bafubiandi mineral processing and technology research center, department of metallurgy, school of mining, metallurgy and chemical engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg amulaba@uj.ac.za",
121,The Role Of Technological Advancement In African Cinema:  A Case Study Of Nollywood,"the advancement of technology has created new opportunities for amateur and auteur in filmmaking. the technological innovation is continuously transforming the film industry, thus enabling the application of re-imaging and re-engineering in the films to enhance the quality of films. nollywood, a nigerian film industry, is heavily being impacted by the technological advancement which is using digital technologies and high-definition cameras. this has led to film studios and film companies mushrooming across the country and its borders. presently, nigeria is considered as one of the most competitive film industry in the world, and thus has become an african icon. for africa, this has greatly resulted in a shared commodified culture. this paper discusses the role of technological advancement in the film industry and investigate all viable prospects for today’s tech-savvy filmmakers for the development of african cinema.","nollywood, digital","Nigeria stands second as the world’s highest film producing nation in the world. Nigeria has a great potential to grow and exceed its current performance. The fact that it has been utilizing all the technological equipment, devices or systems effectively shows that it is a very competitive industry. However, there are certain aspects that need to be immediately addressed, such as piracy which has resulted from lack of knowledge by filmmakers on international marketing skills and how to distribute films. The opening of formal internet websites like Iroko and Netflix that broadcast licensed films are some of the mechanisms used to address this problem. Nigerian film industry has the potential to develop positively in the future for a next generation of filmmakers.

122,Distribution Challenges And Opportunities In Zimbabwean  Film Industry: A Case Study Of Harare,"distribution is one of the least focused subject in film studies, yet it is the most substantial part of the film industry. over the years it has been experiencing significant technological transformations disrupting many traditional models of distribution (broadcasting television, dvds, etc.) which were profiting most of well- establish broadcasting service providers and studios. the introduction of digitalization in the distribution sector has created a competitive global environment with small returns, scrambling for audience over cable televisions and online facilities. this paper investigates the challenges and opportunities in the distribution sector of zimbabwean film industry. selective stakeholders from zimbabwean film industry were interviewed and their responses were analyzed using thematic encoding. the results indicated that there is a need for a clear distribution policy, educational workshops on business management skills in marketing, maximization of all available distribution opportunities, and formation of more international film distributors’ partnership in order for the industry to establish itself in both local and international market. 1. introduction distribution is the most significant and the only monetization component in film value chain which can lead to the sustainability and development of the zimbabwean film industry. once the production of a film is complete, it has to reach audience through a process called distribution. in order for a film to be a successful and film industry to sustain, there is a need to strengthen and use effective distribution channels. ever since the circulation and consumption of film has been driven by technological innovations, there has been a constant change in the market and audience behavior on genre preferences, especially after the introduction of internet. according to grunenwald (2013), academic researchers need to focus more on film distribution sector to create a better understanding of the challenges that need to be overawed in order to create a more sustainable film industry. the biggest challenge of the zimbabwean film industry lies not only in the global marketing sphere but also within zimbabwe itself. for decades, the industry has been operating without any proper national film policy to guide the film practitioners on how to distribute their films, which legal international agencies to deal with and how to negotiate the best deals out of their copyrights. in addition, zimbabwe has been operating with only one national broadcasting television, known as zimbabwe broadcasting corporation (zbc t.v), this has resulted in limited distribution channels, low budgets with poor productions (aboo, 2008). presently, there has been fewer (< 20) theatrical releases of zimbabwean films which clearly shows the lack of local film distribution within and outside zimbabwe. according to lobato (2006), distribution is the least theorized and most difficult element of the film industry to research because the required information is closely guarded for commercial reasons. 822",,"and Recommendations The paper identified the distribution challenges that need solutions and presented some opportunities that Zimbabwean film filmmakers should not overlook. The Zimbabwean film distribution models has been greatly affected by the lack of funds to produce quality films that can be easily distributed both at domestic and international markets. The world at large have been utilizing a hybrid distribution model, but Zimbabwe is yet to explore it to the fullest. There has been lack of distribution infrastructure in Zimbabwe making it challenging to have a sustainable film industry. Most Zimbabwean filmmakers have been relaying on DVD sales but piracy has worsened since past two decades leading to most filmmakers experiencing losses. However, the rural areas have been always underutilized and most of the filmmakers seem be reluctant on exploring these areas. Most Zimbabwean filmmakers believe that VOD has the potential to generate income for them but so far only a few have experienced how this new distribution model work. Many voiced out that the government should give filmmakers licenses to open television channels and operate independently in addition of providing financial support. The Zimbabwean film industry has to continuously work on developing innovative solutions and strategies to solve film distribution challenges and build on opportunities towards a sustainable film industry. 6.1 Recommendations to the Film Industry Table 2 highlights distribution challenges and opportunities of Zimbabwean films, which will assist film filmmakers and government in identifying what problems need solutions and what opportunities need to be maximized in order to create a sustainable Zimbabwean film industry. Table 2. Overcoming film distribution challenges A. For filmmakers Training • Will help create formal innovative business strategies on how to distribute films. • Develop skills on how to deal with international broadcasters and negotiate rights. VOD • Will assist filmmakers to have a solid income. International distribution partnerships • International market access opportunities. • Festivals and other exhibition programs. Content • Create more films. B. Government Addressing domestic market • Educating the public about piracy through campaigns. • Issuing more broadcasting television channels to film stakeholders. • Build more cinemas around the nation. Consulting with filmmakers • Need to establish a clear long-term industry vision and strategy. • Develop audience and strategize other mechanisms to develop the audience base globally. International Relations • Make use of the existing international relations for co-productions. • Select and sponsor Zimbabwean filmmakers to attend international film conferences, exhibitions, festivals so that they can establish international markets. Telecommunication • Address Zimbabwe’s slow and expensive broadband so that VOD can reach its full potential. Legal Guide • Provide strong legal measures to pirates 829","fortunate tatenda mauyakufa department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa mauyakufafortunate@gmail.com anup pradhan department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa anupp@uj.ac.za","References

123,Urban Transport Infrastructure Development In African  Cities: Challenges And Opportunities,"cities in developing countries are growing at an unprecedented rate. in a recent article by the world economic forum and united nations, the sub-saharan africa is emerging as the fastest urbanising region with a population expected to be around 1.5 to 2 billion by 2050. it is however unfortunate that these urbanisation trends have not been without their hurdles for africa’s developmental progress. the large scale infrastructure deficit in the continent is one of the widely recognised challenges inhibiting the realisation of sustainable and prosperous african cities. this paper examines the main issues and challenges specifically facing urban public transport infrastructure development in africa. it also argues that the success of african cities in sustainable mobility is without doubt based on their ability to respond effectively to rapidly changing urban landscapes and migration trends. the paper also uses the city of johannesburg in south africa as a case study example to illustrate some of the innovative and progressive urban transport infrastructure development initiatives currently being implemented towards spatial transformation and sustainable mobility. the paper concludes by setting out, at a high level, a number of strategic pillars around which urban transport infrastructure development opportunities can be anchored to respond to both current and anticipated challenges thereof.","african cities, johannesburg, urban transport",,"robert ndebele and prof clinton aigbavboa department of construction management & quantity surveying faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa robertndebele01@gmail.com, caigbavboa@uj.ac.za aurobindo ogra department of town and regional planning faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa aogra@uj.ac.za","References

125,Sustainability As A Vital Leadership Proficiency  Eric Amankwa,"this paper presents the case that sustainability should be acknowledged as an important proficiency in organisational leaders. arguably, sustainability requirements have been present in organisations for some time, however, sustainability has not usually been expected of leaders themselves. conversely, the advent of new requirements of organisations and its leadership are increasing. therefore, successful leadership will not be solely measured on effectiveness criteria, but gradually on the ethics that leaders exhibit when taking on environmental and social initiatives. in the development of both leadership in organisations and individual leaders, the application of a competence framework is prevailing among human resource practitioners, portraying a popular move toward conceptualising the attributes that ought to be developed in leaders to ensure their effectiveness in organisations. furthermore, it is argued that if sustainability was a proficiency that was incorporated by the leadership of organisations, then leaders would be better able to achieve the triple bottom line. this paper proposes that individualised consideration, empathy, enthusiasm to serve and modesty are some of the attribute of sustainability proficiency in leadership, which would distinguish this style of leadership from other leadership competencies. the paper also proposes suggestions for further research on sustainability as vital a leadership proficiency. 1538",,,university of johannesburg ericamankwa2007@yahoo.com,

127,A Review Of Metal Oxide Surge Arrester  Models For Remote Monitoring Application,"metal oxide surge arresters play a major role in the protection of electrical devices or equipment from lightning and switching surges. these surge protective devices are installed in most industrial, commercial and domestic power or data networks and facilities, yet do not always form part of predictive maintenance strategy. however, due to the critical importance of devices/equipment or networks protected by these types of arresters, condition monitoring of metal oxide-based surge arresters becomes essential practice to ensure or guarantee surge protection. a review of commonly-applied techniques for condition monitoring of mosa devices yields the need to develop or/and improve suitable models online and remotely-applied monitoring application.",explosions,"Monitoring of MOSAs is a critical aspect of a predictive maintenance strategy for power systems. In order to perform effective modelling of the device, a suitable and accurate model thereof is required. In this paper, six models have been reviewed and not all of them are considered sufficient to related studies. The other models presented are able to represent the frequency dependence with some precision. However, there are problems that were found in the analyzed models, those problems parameters calculation, residual voltage front surge increasing rate representation, the residual voltage peak value and the energy absorption calculation. Even when all the presented models have strong points, the most precise model currently available, attending to the proposed criteria in this paper, is the IEEE model. 858","a. dlamini, p. bokoro, and w. doorsamy department of electrical and electronic engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa 201331677@student.uj.ac.za, pitshoub@uj.ac.za, wdoorsamy@uj.ac.za","References

128,The Effects Of Financial Stress Of Employee In The  Construction Industry,"employees are the most important resource to any organization. they contributes to the success and development of a company to a great extent. employees are the lifeblood of every organisation. there is a major knock-on effect for companies and employee performance when employees struggle financially. the core purpose of this study is to explore the effects of financial stress on employee productivity in the construction industry. the study is mainly a literature review on employee financial stress and how it affect the construction industry. the study revealed factors that contributes to financial stress as overspending, lack of budgeting, high debts level, low salary or wages, lack of knowledge about money and poor financial behavior. the study also revealed the relationship between financial stress and psychological symptoms, behavioural symptoms, physiological symptoms and productivity. the study further revealed employers efforts and programmes that can improve the employee financial life. the study contributes to the body of knowledge on the subject of the effects of employee financial stress on job performance and productivity in the construction industry.","financial problems, employees, productivity, financial wellness, financial literacy","The employee worries over financial problems is critical due to increased financial pressure that has led to financial stress. To improve productivity related behavior and the implementation of employee assistance programs are needed by individual and in times of economic prosperity as well as downturn since there will always be those experiencing financial stress. The review of literature has revealed a very limited amount of research to date and a lack of precision tools for determining the effect of financial stress upon productivity in the construction industry. Research tools need to be developed and refined to assess the specific education and counseling that will benefit the employees in the construction industry. Research is needed to identify the impact of financial stress on productivity, performance and the employee morale in the construction industry. Research is needed to better document the cost/benefit of financial counseling programs to improve productivity, employer employee relations, retention, and well-being.","omotola olasehinde and clinton aigbavboa department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg south africa tollyjoy485@gmail.com, aigclinton@gmail.com",
129,Performance Of Brts Using Spatial Planning And Land Use  Management Act (Spluma) Principles: A Case Study Of,"cities worldwide have been battling to adopt and implement better ways of addressing a wide range of spatial development challenges towards sustainable economies through various policies and legal instruments. interestingly, much attention has been placed upon transport planning as part of transforming cities and thus urban public transport has become a cornerstone given its potential of integrating and commuting large communities to desirable destinations. in developing worlds very few but albeit interesting and successful initiatives are notable leveraging socio-economic and environmental benefits. this is particularly so in south african cities with city of johannesburg metropolitan municipality leading; introducing bus rapid transit systems through corridors of freedom project (cof). using secondary data generated from intensive literature review and primary data collected through survey & observations within coj regions, this study investigated the extent to which brts has implemented spluma principles in coj. the findings revealed that brts if well planned is crucial for the ambitious spatial visions of spluma. with its increasing technological usage (smartcard system, surveillances and upcoming vayamoja app) the brts (rea vaya) proved to be on the right path. it is hoped that this work may prompt further study and help in understanding its praxis and theoretical application.",rea vaya,,"city of johannesburg matlou agnes setati and aurobindo ogra department of town and regional planning faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg beit street, doornfontein 2018 johannesburg, south africa m.agnessetati@gmail.com, aogra@uj.ac.za",
130,Coordinated Scheduling Of Multiple Households’ Appliances  With Leveled Load Profiles And Consumers’ Preferences,"this paper addresses the multiple households’ residential load scheduling problem through the scheduling of typical home appliances while incorporating more realistic aspects. the objective of this study is to generate an optimal load schedule of home appliances for ﬁve households with leveled load profile while considering the consumers’ preferences. a myriad of variants of the problem has been addressed in literature, however, studies considering minimization of both electricity cost and peak load while considering the consumers’ inconveniences in a multiple-household environment have not received sufﬁcient attention. ignoring coordination between multiple households while solving the residential load scheduling problem could result in unplanned synchronization of peak loads of the individual consumer, which could result in an unmanaged aggregated peak load. reducing the overall peak load is an important goal for all the actors in the power grid. this study, therefore, proposes a multi-objective mixed integer programming optimization model under a time-of-use electricity tariff. the objective function minimizes the weighted score of three terms: the electricity cost, the schedule inconvenience, and the peak load over the day. a case study of ﬁve households shows that the proposed schedules with coordination between multiple households could realize a significant reduction in the aggregated peak load.",inconvenience,"This paper addressed the multi-objective and multiple households load scheduling problem of typical home appliances while incorporating more realistic aspects. The objective of this study is to generate optimal load schedule of home appliances for multiple households with leveled load profile while considering the consumer’s preferences and convenience level. A mathematical model is proposed with the objective of minimizing the weighted score of three terms: the EC, the IC and the EPL. A case study showed that individual consumers could realize almost the same EC and the convenience level. However, the “With Coordination” approach could eliminate the overall EPL significantly. The proposed model schedules the appliances with coordination between multiple households could reduce the overall EPL by around 17%, 30% or 11% based on the weighting factors combination.

131,Adaptation And Speed: Key Reasons To Adopt Agile Project  Management Within The It Industry,"in the fast-paced world of changing customer demands nourished on the internet, organizations seek to gain competitive advantage through flexibility and timely delivery of goods to the market. these rapid changes make traditional project management methodologies less practical and real. considering that the information and communications technology industry is one of the significant sectors in terms of revenue and investment in south africa and the world at large, there was a need to move along with these changes at a sustainable pace to beat the increasing global competition. this leads to the birth of agile project management which began in the software development sector but is spilling into all industries. this paper explores how agile project management affects the speed of delivery and the organization’s adaptability to the needs of the market. the research is based on the data collected by an independent management consulting firm in 2017 across 276 practitioners in the south african it industry. the results of the survey show that most people adopt agile project methodologies with the hope of achieving a fast delivery to the market and acquiring flexibility for robust design. the results further show that when agile methodologies are adopted, it is possible to flexibly adapt to the market but the increase in speed is not significant for most of the practitioners. they also realize unexpected benefits like improved project visibility and increased morale. agile must be strategic, ensuring goal congruence within the organization. it is recommended that organizations follow closely the agile frameworks and principles rather than chase instant benefits.",,"The ever-changing customer demands require a methodology that can assists the companies to keep up with these changes without affecting the quality of services but on the contrary make the organization flexible to changes. Traditional project management are too rigid hence they make it difficult for companies to respond to changes in the market. To keep up with the market companies are adopting agile project management which is more flexible and is modernised to meet the demands of the market while the market is evolving. For successful implementation, the organisation must stick to the principles of the agile PM which are easy to understand and simple to follow. At the same time, they must keep up with the basic processes if they want to implement agile PM. Without basic processes agile PM can lead to chaos (Stare, 2013). Furthermore, organisations must not dump the basic project management principles when adopting agile PM but they must combine them with agile PM principles because they do not oppose each other but they actually complement each other. The agile PM methodology must be adopted bit by bit to give the whole team time to adapt to the methodology. Through the figures from the survey and the literature review, agile PM is not a simple practice of running projects without planning, but it is a whole new philosophy that needs thorough analysis and understanding before it is adopted. If agile PM is well planned and implemented well it has many benefits that include flexibility to the market, faster market response, improved productivity, improved quality of service and increased visibility of the project. The study shows that the most realized result of agile PM is the adaptability of a company to the rapid markets hence it proves that agile PM can help organisations to be flexible to any possible changes in the market. Agile PM has penetrated the IT industry but it’s yet to find its feet in other industries, whether it is South Africa or abroad. Studies could be conducted to see why it’s not penetrating faster in the other industries. 883","nwobodo-anyadiegwu n.e, kasumba darlington tapuwanashe & lumbwe kabamba a department of quality and operations management. university of johannesburg. johannesburg, south africa evethn@uj.ac.za, 216056568@student.uj.ac.za, alicekabamba3@gamail.com,","References

133,Design Of An Automated Peanut Butter Making  Machine In Developing Countries,"this paper is on the design of automated peanut butter making machine for a developing economy which targets small scale farmers. many developing countries are still using traditional methods in making peanut butter for example pestle and motor while others are using hand operated machines which are laborious and slow. the demand of peanut butter is increasing but machines are manually and expensive therefore the production rate of peanut butter is low in developing economy. if peanut butter peanut is taken in small proportions chances of chronic diseases are reduced and also due to high proportion of carbohydrates in peanut butter there is gain in weight. there are three types of forces when crushing solid food namely shear, impact and compression. rittinger, kick and bond laws are used to determine amount of energy needed in size reduction of solid food. . after careful analysis of current peanut butter making machines and thorough study, a solution was developed that is efficient, safe and affordable the machine grind 50-56kg per hour with minimum human involvement since the machine automatically stop if all peanuts in the hopper get exhausted. power required to grind peanuts is approximately 1.01kw. key words: automated, peanut butter, machine, design, developing nation 1. introduction 886",,"The purpose of this project was to design automated peanut butter making machine. The machine was successful designed and all the objectives were met. As compared to other existing machines, the machine is almost affordable to almost all small scale farmers that are in the business of making peanut butter. Also the machine serves time when making peanut butter since the machine can be operated while doing other jobs and the control system regulate the amount peanuts entering into the machine. To reduce costs and supporting local business locally available materials were used to during designing. All types of peanuts can be grinded using this machine and also it cushion the vibration hence the machine is stable. When there is no electricity the machine can be operated manually hence there is continuous production of peanut butter. 5.1 Safety and precautions There are rotating components on the machine for example belts and pulleys, maximum care is needed when operating the machine for example removing of loose clothes. The machines also operates at high voltages therefore wiring should be regularly checked and replaced. In case of emergency there is an emergency button with a red color mainly and after pressing this button the machine automatically stops. 5.2 Maintenance After using the machine, plates and auger should be disassembled for cleaning with running water to avoid contamination of peanut butter .Moving parts are prone to wearing for example pulley and plates , therefore these parts should be inspected and replaced. Blanching of peanuts is difficult and laborious to small scale farmers hence there is need of mechanism that blanches peanuts and blowing out removed materials together with foreign particles and then blanched peanuts are grinded. Manually packing of peanut butter requires a lot of labor, contaminates peanut 893","benjamin moyana university of zimbabwe, department of mechanical engineering, post office box mp167, mount pleasant, harare, zimbabwe benjimoxxy@gmail.com tawanda mushiri university of johannesburg, department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment, post office box apb 524 bunting road campus johannesburg, south africa tawanda.mushiri@gmail.com","References

136,Effectiveness Of Rea Vaya Bus Rapid Transit System (Brts)  In The City Of Johannesburg,"transport remains connected to our indigenous habitat, wellbeing and monetary thriving which rely upon good transport frameworks that provides effectiveness, comfort, fairness as well as affordability. public transport is often framed as key component of building sustainable cities. nonetheless, present estimations recommend that transport development is unjustifiable. transport intimidates the social, economic, and our environmental future. modifying as well as overseeing patterns of transport shows a critical issue which necessitates collaboration from participants’ at all governmental spheres. the paper presents a critical literature review of the relationship between public transport and sustainability. the paper contributes to transport domain by identifying the key problems associated with sustainability of transport based on the perceptions and discussions of significant literature on transport. the attention is on connection amongst sustainable transport division and the sustainable development within south african setting. outcomes demonstrate that the concept of sustainable transportation has received recognition from the globe and improvement of sustainable transport is evident around the city. this work concludes that sustainable transportation is still a long process for developing countries, as it provides a progression of proposals that are intended to upgrade the execution of the johannesburg transport development and design method, with suggested changes for moving transportation improvement to a sustainable motivation.",public transport,"& Recommendations The city of Johannesburg is still working towards achieving transit oriented development. Be that as it may, the strategy that the city has around the improvement of the corridors of freedom gives chances for transit oriented advancement with blended land use planning. The method of reasoning for the improvement of the BRT framework is to give an accessible, protected, dependable type of transport to the communities (McCaul & Ntuli, 2011). It has been in this investigation that the framework currently isn't open to the larger part of communities in the city. The Phase1b was introduced during the year 2013, and intended to attract more individual from different zones to use public transport, for example, Auckland Park to the down town area. Lack of accessibility is another reasons a number of individuals still utilize their private vehicles to move around; in any case, workers who can't manage the cost of having private cars are then compelled to using informal transport, for example, the taxis which are seen as more available compared to the BRT Rea Vaya. This system has resulted in various difficulties for the private car users as well as taxi business. With the conducting of this investigation the Rea Vaya system had been discovered to be unreachable to the dominant part of the communities within the city. Even though the future strategy of the city demonstrate the BRT Rea Vaya expansion to all zones around the city, the framework still remains inaccessible compared to informal taxis. To be able to attend to these issues it is important to integrate the diverse methods of transport. All together for this system to be cost effective, it is important for the municipality to adopt on friendly integrated fare prices as recommended by Sandra. It can make the system reasonable thus addressing the necessities of the less privileged. The city needs to gain from the achievement and disappointments of the BRT frameworks in the other nations where it has been a success. Maybe the Rea Vaya Management could watch best routine with regards to other transport frameworks in Johannesburg, for example, the Metro Bus and Putco and plan an installed charge installment like that utilized by Metro Bus.

137,Cash Register Queue Simulation Scenarios For A Giant  Retail Company,"nowadays, companies compete with each other for better service to their customers and this is especially true for international companies who face global opposition. one of the most basic challenges these companies face is the queuing problem. as an example, there is a giant retail company serving more than 400 stores in 15 countries with more than 180 million individual sales annually. these sales are variable for each day as well as each hour within the day with an over-all average of 700 units sold per minute. in this paper, we developed the capability to run different scenarios to solve this queuing problem based on the unique data of each shop. taking assumptions into consideration, different scenarios are developed to better serve customers. a discrete-event simulation model is constructed using siemens tecnomatix plant simulation software. the model is set up so that it can dynamically be created based on input data and automatically optimize an objective function based on limiting variables. these simulation models determine the number of cash registers which should be in the store as well as when they need to be manned.","simulation, optimization, istanbul",,"batin latif aylak department of mechanical engineering türkisch-deutsche universität şahinkaya cad. 86 - 34820 beykoz / i̇stanbul, turkey batin.latif@tau.edu.tr hermias c. n. hendrikse esteq pretoria, south africa h.hendrikse@esteq.com armand du plessis esteq pretoria, south africa a.duplessis@esteq.com",
138,Enhancing Agriculture Productivity Using Solar Irrigation  Technology: Soy Beans Farming In Namibia.,"an increasing global and african population has brought with it social ills and food insecurity. due to these social problems, it has become increasingly important for farmers to innovate how they conduct farming activities in a way that allows them to produce more and better crop yields. focusing on namibia, a common problem related to farming is inconsistent irrigation water supply. the objective of this paper is to explore solar powered irrigation systems as a possible solution to provide sustainable irrigation water supply. preliminary work was completed on five-hectares of farm lynkloof, namibia in preparation to install a solar irrigation system. the irrigation system uses solar photovoltaic (pv) technologies to pump water for irrigation. crops will be put under cultivation and water will be supplied by two irrigation systems; drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation. the paper, through literature, analyzed the performance characteristics of solar irrigation systems and found that these systems are much cheaper to use than grid electricity and present a sustainable source of year-round irrigation water to increase agriculture productivity. key words: solar irrigation system; photovoltaic pump; drip irrigation; productivity 902",,"were reached and recommendations made towards implementation. This paper also adopted a case study approach using qualitative methods of data collection. 3.1 Background of Case Farm Lynkloof in north-western Namibia measures a total of 5000 hectare and is engaged in large-scale cattle farming. The farm is owned and managed by an all female staff of a mother and her three daughters. Of late they have decided to venture into soybean farming, using a solar-powered irrigation system. Land has been set aside for this venture but before the project can be implemented on a larger scale, a trial operation will be set up on land measuring five hectares. Water analysis and soil tests conducted on the farm determined the feasibility of cultivating on the identified portion of the land. This physical testing also ascertained the appropriate location to construct the storage dams and install the system as well as to plot the proposed layout of the cultivated land. A portion of land was identified, cleared and prepared for soybean cultivation. 4. Findings The findings from the literature review reveal that solar irrigation systems are more economically and environmentally feasible than diesel-powered systems and other conventional irrigation systems. Solar systems have low maintenance costs, low operation costs and no fuel costs. Solar irrigation systems use water optimally and reduce the physical involvement of the farmer because they are operated remotely. These systems increase the productivity of farmers. The project findings, based on tests conducted on the actual farm, reveal that the portion of land allocated for the irrigation system is ideal for the installation to commence. 5. Conclusion As the results of the various research indicate, harnessing the sun rays to generate electricity is a much cheaper exercise then using grid electricity. The use of solar irrigation systems with solar pumps is equally a more cost effective way to irrigate land in comparison to using diesel powered pumps or other conventional electric pumps.

148,A Critical Assessment Of Sustainable Development Concept In The  South African Construction Small Medium Enterprises,"over the past decades, the prime goal of construction sectors was to use fewer resources to sustain the forthcoming generation. thus sustainable development was introduced in construction sector to meet the needs of the current generation as well as the future generation to come. in this manner, implementations of sustainable development in construction sector was evaluated along with its principles; social, economic and environmental. consequently, the concept of sustainable development has become a buzz word amid scholars and industry practitioners. despite the fact that, the concept of sustainable development is attaining higher level of significance in western countries, america, and china due to its ability in ensuring south african particularly in construction sector. the adoption and integration of sustainability development concept is facing several challenges. to date, over the past decades, too many studies have been conducted to investigate the benefit of implementing sustainable development at the global level in the construction sector. however, few studies have been conducted from south african fast and moving consumer goods perspective, hence the overall goal of this paper is to fill this gap by means of critically analyzing studies that were conducted in the field of sustainable development over the past decade. as a key sector contributing to economic development, the construction industry also has extensive impacts on the environment and society. there are several environmental issues derived from construction activities such as outdoor and indoor environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and impacts on the ecological environment. as a retort to these contests, the shift of the construction industry from the traditional standard towards more balanced development among the economic, social and environmental dimensions, for example; sustainable development, has received global attentions. there is no shortage of studies on the sustainability of the construction industries worldwide. some studies emphasis on the social facet of sustainability. for instance, proposed there is a deficiency of innovativeness in the finnish construction sector, hampering the societal change towards sustainability.","construction sector, economic, environmental, social","The term sustainable development can be divided into two words to unpack its meaning. ‘Sustainable’ means that which can be preserved continuously, although ‘development’ means expansion. Sustainable development is therefore the ability to preserve and expand all social, environmental and economic systems of any formation in a way such that each generation accomplishes to fulfil its own needs and does not threaten the capability of upcoming generation to provide for them. As a major sector contributing to economic development, the construction industry also has substantial impacts on the environment and society. There are numerous environmental issues derived from construction activities such as outdoor and indoor environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and influences on the ecological environment. As a response to these contests, the shift of the construction industry from the traditional paradigm towards more balanced development among the economic, social and environmental dimensions, i.e. sustainable development, has received global attentions. Although the existing literature discussed the sustainable development in the construction industries, they failed to emphasize more on the principles of sustainability and the importance of sustainable development implementation in the construction sector. Thus, future studies need to carry on advancing consideration of all stages pertaining sustainability in construction sector. 1996","’malingaka maoeng, ndala mulongo, nemarumane takalani faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa","References

150,Simulation Modeling For Construction Chemical Operations  Mojahid F. Saeed Osman,"construction chemicals are commonly used in the construction industry. these materials are divided into two main categories, liquid and powdered products. the process of producing the powdered products addressed in this paper consists of three manufacturing stages comprising of feeding, mixing and filling and packaging. this paper is intended to study the operations in two of the three. currently, the average flow time in the powdered products plants is quite long; consequently, the lead time to deliver finished goods to customers is increased. it is anticipated that the customer lead time can be reduced by improving the construction chemicals operations. the paper studies the existing operations of the plants, conducts process mapping and time study, and develops simulation models for the current production system in arena software for improving the total flow time, resource utilization, and waiting time in queues.",production systems,"This paper studied the operations of chemical construction plant that produces powdered products. The average flow time is quite long in the current production system. This results in an increased lead time to supply the finished goods to customers. It was expected that the total flow time can be decreased by improving the operations in the manufacturing plants of the company. We developed simulation model in Arena software to imitate the operations of the current manufacturing system in order to the current production system. The proposed improvements to the process contribute to reducing the total flow time of manufacturing, increasing the average resource utilization and reducing the total time wasted in queue. Some of the areas of improvements are interdependent in the sense that enhancements in one area can lead to enhancements of other areas. For instance, reducing the total manufacturing time will result in increasing the total potential production capacity due to the fact that larger quantities of finished goods can be produced in the same amount of time. The results obtained from simulating the manufacturing process with improvements from the recommended alternative indicate 41% reduction in total flow time. This significant reduction would result in a substantial decrease in the total lead time required to supply the finished goods to the customers. In addition, the average resource utilization in the manufacturing plants has increased by 16% and the total time in queue was reduced by 2%. The last two parameters indicate a significant increase in the efficiency of the manufacturing process at the company.","department of industrial engineering american university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates mfsaeedo@aus.edu samer hijazi engineering systems management program american university of sharjah sharjah, united arab emirates b00036105@aus.edu",

155,A Routing Vehicles Model For The Delivery Of Furniture And  Home Appliances Of A Retail Company In Southern Brazil,"logistics has been recognized one of the key elements of the competitive strategy of companies including the supply of products and services from a supply point to a demand point. in retail market, companies’ net income is usually low and the expenses with distribution are relevant in the composition of logistic costs. in addition, there are challenges in the distribution of products such as high customer churn, requirement of specific delivery times and high product variability. this paper proposes a model of routing that aims to reduce costs of transportation of companies in the distribution of products, having as a base, a network of stores of furniture and home appliances in the south of santa catarina state, in southern brazil. by combining clarke and wright heuristic with own developed heuristics, a computational system has been implemented so that routes considering truck driver work days, truck load capacity and time interval for consumer delivery can be found in acceptable computation time. obtained solutions with the routing tool were nearly 1% above the optimal solutions obtained by enumeration, showing that the model leads to good results, i.e., reducing trucks travel time by low computational effort.","search in graphs, 2015). furthermore","The vehicle routing for delivery products to customers is a logistics decision with capability to reduce costs and increase service level. In retailers, the distribution process has specific characteristics that make it difficult to define the best route, such as the daily change of clientele served, the need to fulfill deadlines and delivery times restrictions imposed by consumers. So, in this way, the work contributes with a vehicle routing model for delivery of furniture and home appliances from a retail company, as a base on the implementation of a search algorithm for the smallest path in graphs, a routing algorithm and an interface for the router uses in the company's distribution logistics and drivers. Results show solutions close to optimality for a volume of deliveries consistent with what is observed daily in the company, and can serve as guidance for the development of commercial application that could answer companies, with trade similar profile. Additional analyzes such as the preferred customers addition to the model show that companies should limit the number of these customers on the same route in order to get economically acceptable solutions, because a large number of preferential customers tends to get rigid routes concerning to the sequence of clients to be visited and, therefore, solutions with longer travel times.","carlos ernani fries, luís antônio vinholi and danieli braun vargas department of production and systems engineering federal university of santa catarina caixa postal 5185, 88040-970 florianópolis, sc, brazil carlos.fries@ufsc.br, luis.vinholi@gmail.com, danieli.v@ufsc.br",

157,Innovative Technologies Of Waste Recycling With Production  Of High Performance Panels,"the use of waste materials within the construction industry has been studied in an attempt to reduce the nuisance of waste disposal and recycling these wastes into sustainable engineering products. sawmill dust bonded with polystyrene waste as the binder are being considered in producing wall panels that would exhibit improved physical and mechanical properties. a measured volume of polystyrene waste binder was mixed with a known quantity of sawmill dust to produce sawmill-dust-polystyrene composite. test specimens were then produced from the various composites which were used to perform flexural, tensile and water absorption tests. the samples were left to cure in room temperature for 12 days and 28 days. the results obtained showed that the composition of 60% sawdust 40% polystyrene slurry was the optimum composition yielding the highest tensile and flexural strength, with desirable water absorption properties when compared to some of the manufactured wood samples (particle board and plywood). it was also noted that the strength of the composite increased with curing time. therefore the use of sawmill dust bonded with polystyrene waste adhesive introduces a sustainable approach on reducing pollution caused by sawdust and polystyrene wastes.","sawmill dust, polystyrene waste, tensile strength","This paper was done for the purpose of reducing and recycling Polystyrene and sawdust wastes by combining them to form a composite for the use of a structural application of wall panels. The polystyrene wastes adhesive was combined with the sawdust by trial and error in which four compositions were developed. The developed composites were investigated for its physical and mechanical properties. From the 12 day tensile test the composition of 60% Sawdust 40% Polystyrene yields the highest Tensile strength of 8.355 N/mm-2, whilst the 45 % Sawmill Dust 55% Polystyrene had the lowest tensile strength of 3.980 N/mm-2 of the four compositions. The next test done was that of Flexure where the 60/40 composition had the highest modulus of rupture 5723.55 KPa whilst the 45/55 composition had the lowest modulus of rupture of 1336.55KPa. With the water absorption test it was observed that with increasing polystyrene waste content the water absorption decreased. These findings suggest that the 60 % Sawdust 40% Polystyrene wastes adhesive is the optimum composition and upon comparison with that of a manufactured wood, particle board it came out as being superior. As a result of conducting this research, I propose that the combination of the Sawdust and the polystyrene waste would be able to serve as wall panels more effectively than the manufactured board, reducing and recycling the waste of polystyrene and sawdust as well as the pollution cause by its large quantity in the environment and society.","abrahams mwasha and dillon ramdhanie department of civil engineering the university of the west indies st. augustine, trinidad abrahams.mwasha@sta.uwi.edu, dillon.ramdhanie@my.uwi.edu",
158,A System Dynamics Approach To Study The Behavior Of Cape  Town Tourism For The Next Coming 10 Years,"cape town is a coastal city in south africa. it is the second most populous urban area after johannesburg. the city is famous for its harbour, for its natural setting in the cape floristic region, robben island, and the beach and for such well-known landmarks as table mountain and cape point. for this reasons cape town shines as a tourist destination. the purpose of this project is to develop simulation model for cape town tourism using stella software in order to study the behavior of the system for the next coming 10 years. system dynamics is an approach to understanding the nonlinear behavior of complex systems over time using stock, flows, internal feedback loops, table functions and time delays. the approach that was used was to develop a simulation model is based on the following five stages of system dynamics modeling process: problem articulation, formulation of dynamic hypothesis, formulation of simulation model, testing of the model, and policy design and evaluation. initial hypothesis was generated based on the research done. the model study supports the hypothesis; as the population of cape town grows without the necessary expansion of services, cape town will be less attractive to tourism. therefore, the number of tourists visiting will decline.","system dynamics, population, robben island","and Recommendations This study was aimed at developing a simulation model for Cape Town tourism system, in order to study the behavior of the system for the next coming 10 years. Based on the simulation results; The Model study supports the hypothesis. As the population of Cape Town grows without the necessary expansion of services, Cape Town will be less attractive to tourism, therefore the number of tourists visiting will decline. For similar future studies additional variables (i.e. other factors that affect population growth and also all the factors affecting tourism) that may be linked to the problem of study must added, this can help achieve more precise results.

160,The Concept Of Decolonisation Within Engineering Education  Matimba Mkansi *,"the concept of decolonisation continues to be a topic of debate across academia largely in south africa and other historically colonised nations. there are many questions and few answers, however there seem to be clear directions for soft disciplines like humanities. in contrast for hard science discipline such as engineering, the topic of decolonisation generally remains a baffling endeavour. this research paper undertook a study to understand the applicability of the decolonisation concept within engineering education, as understood by students from three different engineering schools within the university of the witwatersrand, johannesburg. the knowledge sought was to address questions such as “what is decolonised engineering education?”, “what are the attributes of such a decolonised engineering education?” and “what are the changes needed within the university in order to decolonise engineering education?” amongst other questions. discoveries include developing an afrocentric education taking into account things such as institutional culture, racial diversity and impact of the education in society post-graduation. this paper rates and highlights the intensity and importance of some of the pressing issues that need to be addressed if decolonisation is to take place. at top of the list is the need to transform institutional culture and at the bottom is the need to do away with hierarchies in education.","decolonisation, engineering, feesmustfall, rhodesmustfall, curriculum","The study has met its purpose and succeeded in exploring the meaning of decolonisation in Engineering education from the perspective of students who were involved in agitation around the concept hence uncovering its meaning. It should be noted that the concept of decolonising engineering education proves to be an emotive subject hence of disruptive nature as evidenced in the lack of visible neutrality from participants. Clearly there are strongly held views and there is not one common accepted meaning by everybody. Nevertheless, even though the decolonisation of engineering education means different things to different people, the study has found that the concept of decolonisation is considered applicable to engineering education by Engineering students. In addition the study has found that certain views about decolonized Engineering education stand out more prominently than others among the students. The study findings indicate that curriculum reform is a crucial part of decolonising engineering education. Primary focus should be given to developing a curriculum inclusive of knowledge from different backgrounds, devoid of dominant western influence culturally and historically, and free of bias of any form e.g. towards a certain race or gender. The study findings recognise Science as a universal disciple and that engineering education cannot be complete without the laws which govern the universe, therefore science must remain within the engineering curriculum. However the position is that it should not come with the traditions of western supremacy within the local university. This is addressed by developing a locally centric education, in this case Afrocentric education. The study notes that the use of an African language is a crucial element of developing Afrocentric engineering education. While the removal of western discovered science from engineering will result in an education which is no longer able to solve engineering problems. However efforts must be invested in including African science (knowledges) within the engineering curriculum as well as on developing new knowledges. 8. Suggestions for future research For future research some themes are worth pursuing that have arisen from this study. Among these, an investigation into indigenous scientific knowledge’s should be made with the focus on discovering formerly available knowledge and knowledge being developed today which is excluded from the engineering curriculum. Another area of interest is the applicability of an African language which has been highlighted as necessary for developing an African centred education. A detail investigation should be made on the implementation of an African language within engineering education. A notable highlight which came from the research is that decolonisation is a collaborative process between staff and students. An investigation should be made on the role of students in the decolonisation process. Finally, it is recommended that an investigation be carried out on the potential impact of engineering education on the local society, particularly the society of the very individual who acquire the engineering education. 1018","0706665j@students.wits.ac.za bruno emwanu bruno.emwanu@wits.ac.za chioniso kuchwa-dube chioniso.kuchwa-dube@wits.ac.za school of mechanical, industrial and aeronautical engineering university of the witwatersrand johannesburg, south africa.","References

161,Operational Improvement Outcomes Through Voluntary  Compliance In Road Transport Operations,"this paper presents operational improvement outcomes of the road transport management system (rtms) in south africa. the rtms is a voluntary, self-regulation scheme that encourages consignees, consignors and road transport operators toward best practice in road transport. the views of consignors, consignees and road transport operators were surveyed to provide insights into perceptions and outcomes of the rtms. respondents indicated improved safety, operational efficiency, profitability, and reduced road crashes as outcomes of the rtms. the main obstacles to increased certification are a lack of awareness of the rtms and a poor understanding of the requirements for becoming certified.",road transport,"AND RECOMMENDATIONS RTMS certified road transport operators have reported significant benefits in improved safety, reduced crashes, improved fuel consumption, operational efficiency, as well as operating profits and regard the RTMS as well worth the effort and investment. There is significant alignment between the objectives of the RTMS and the user experience of the RTMS in practice. It is recommended that the RTMS steering committee embark on initiatives that will increase awareness of the improved road transport sustainability achieved through the RTMS. Clients of logistics service providers are key influencers in the decision to become RTMS certified, and their role should be leveraged in promoting the RTMS and its benefits. The requirements for RTMS certification need to be made clearer and more transparent. More effort needs to be expended in the marketing of the RTMS and its benefits. In addition, improved operator incentives may contribute significantly in the drive to increase the levels of RTMS certification. The RTMS is perceived as having achieved its stated objectives of improved operational efficiency and profits, increased levels of compliance, reduced damage to road network, improved road safety and driver wellness. The main challenge now is to create the right conditions for increasing the number of companies that attain certification. 1029","abdool kamdar university of the witwatersrand, private bag 3, wits, 2050 8582023@students.wits.ac.za, akkamdar@gmail.com frank kienhöfer university of the witwatersrand, private bag 3, wits, 2050 frank.kienhofer@wits.ac.za bruno emwanu university of the witwatersrand, private bag 3, wits, 2050 bruno.emwanu@wits.ac.za gert heyns university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park, 2006 gjheyns@uj.ac.za paul nordengen csir built environment, po box 395, pretoria, 0001 pnordengen@csir.co.za","REFERENCES

163,Mechanical Characterisation And Modelling Of A Pulverised  Palm Kernel Shell Based Spur Gear,"advances in power transmission using spur gear technology in some specific mechanical devices required lightweight to strength ratio of the gear material. this study evaluated the mechanical properties of a particulate palm kernel shell reinforced polyester composite (ppksrpc) for spur gear application. the ppksrpc sample was prepared and examined experimentally to determine its mechanical properties such as tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and shear modulus. the experimental result for 5% weight fraction of ppksrpc gave a tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and shear modulus of 90.3 mpa, 2.35 gpa and 0.89 gpa, respectively. the value obtained was used to model the ppksrpc spur gear under a torque of 140 n-m in ansys environment. the observed values of the responses (mechanical properties) of the ppksrpc under loading conditions are lower compared to the conventional steel in spur gear application.",polyester,"In this work, particulate palm kernel shells reinforced polymer composite PPKSRPC was experimentally and analytically studied. The developed composites were investigated by determining their physical and mechanical properties. Their static structural performance in spur gears was analysed and modelled.

164,Step Algorithm To Solve Positive-Integer Type-Linear  Programming Problem With Two Variables And N Linear,"in this paper, step algorithm to solve positive integer type linear programming problems with two variables and n linear constraints is proposed. classical methods to solve integer programming problems are branch and bound method and gomory’s cutting plane algorithm. manual solution by both these methods is tedious and tiring. moreover, to get multiple optima through branch and bond method, it is required to select different branch and need to solve for that particular branch. while in gomory’s cutting plane algorithm, it is required to solve the problem again with different sets of iterations to have multi optima. disadvantages of branch and bond method and gomory’s cutting plane method give motivation to develop step algorithm. proposed method i.e. step algorithm works on the principle that in linear programming problem optimum solution always lies on the boundary of feasible region in maximization as well as in minimization problem. furthermore, step algorithm is less complex and can give multi-optima solution in one go. to test the effectiveness of step algorithm few instances of integer programming problem with two variables are experimented. obtained results prove that step algorithm is more efficient, easy and less time consuming.",,"For solving positive-integer type-linear programming problem (ILPP) with two variables and n linear constraints; the new algorithm is developed in this paper. The algorithm is developed on the principle that, solution for ILPP type of problems always lie in the proximity of boundary of feasible region. Comparing this algorithm with existing methods, this algorithm is easy to solve manually. And also this algorithm gives multiple optimum solution in one go, where as in existing methods, multiple iterations are required in case of multiple optimum solutions.","constraints monal vaishnani department of industrial engineering pandit deendayal pertoleum university, gandhinagar gujarat, india monalsvaishnani2100@gmail.com poonam savsani department of industrial engineering pandit deendayal pertoleum university, gandhinagar gujarat, india poonam.savsani@gmail.com",
165,Mechanical Strength And Biocompatibility Properties Of  Materials For Bone Internal Fixation: A Brief Overview,"an ideal bone internal fixation material does more than just fracture union. it ensures the preservation of bone mineral density (bmd) and body-bone’s integrity. this has been a major fight in osteosynthesis from the ancient time till date. animal skeletons that were first used as internal fixations though had some desirable mechanical properties comparable to bones, their usage resulted in mild pus formation, difficulty with resorption of sterile bones and non-union. a shift to metallic bone implants resulted in corrosion and bio-incompatibility, stress shielding, imaging and radiotherapy interference, temperature sensitivity, revision surgery with extreme difficulty, growth restriction, metal-in tissue accumulation, bone-metal elastic modulus mismatch to mention but a few. advances in osteosynthesis have, however, led to great improvement on metallic bone fixations, yet leaving some fundamental issues unresolved. exploration of biodegradable polymers and their composites is fast solving most of the problems encountered through the use of skeletal and metallic fixations. their low young's moduli and excellent biocompatibility, non- carcinogenicity and bioresorbability have made them viable materials for bone fracture healing. this brief overview covers the biomechanical properties of popular biological materials, metallic fixations and polymeric scaffold.","osteosynthesis, internal fixation, biodegradability",,"aworinde abraham kehinde, adeosun samson oluropo and oyawale adekunle festus mechanical engineering department covenant university ota, nigeria abraham.aworinde@covenantuniversity.edu.ng, samson.adeosun@covenantuniversity.edu.ng festus.oyawale@covenantuniversity.edu.ng esther titilayo akinlabi department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg south africa etakinlabi@uj.ac.za eyere emagbetere department of mechanical engineering federal university of petroleum resources effurun, nigeria emagbetere.eyere@fupre.edu.ng",

The optimum aim of developing economy is to invest in any viable project that will bring an enormous profit to strengthen her feeble economy. This article extensively discussed the prospect of harnessing the economic value of recoverable materials in EOLT while at the same time proffered possible solutions to the bulk waste problem. Valuable suggestions were made on designing sustainable management templates for EOLT having clearly defined policies and regulations as the arrowhead of approaching a Techno-economic growth towards a safe recycling system. All the major stakeholders must be motivated by incentive driven arrangement and at the same time under strict monitoring and control by the inaugurated body.

167,Parameters For Design And Construction Of A Pilot Scale  Pyrolysis Gas-Furnace,"the objective of this study is to analyse the design parameters for a pyrolysis furnace designed and built for experimental purposes using the principle of heat transfer. the furnace was made of a casing of low carbon steel sheets inside which the refractory bricks were moulded, forming the furnace cavity to prevent heat loss. the pyrolysis capsule was made of high carbon steel tube with flanges which can be opened for batch loading of the precursors and evacuation of products. the furnace was designed to be gas-fired due to high efficiency and cleaner nature of gas energy. the pyrolysis capsule is installed along the centre of the furnace cavity where combustion takes place. the heat energy accumulated around the capsule is being absorbed into the pyrolysis chamber where precursors are being loaded, the regulation of the temperature of the combustion chamber via the installed feedback mechanism to monitor and control the system. the capsule has a nitrogen gas inlet for the inert environment needed for effective pyrolysis process and an outlet duct for pyrolysis oil collection and gas recovery. the experimental initial conditions were inputted in solidworks flow simulation to determine the heat distribution at different regions of the furnace and thus made it easy to determine the furnace combustion chamber temperature at which the pyrolysis temperature will be attained inside the pyrolysis chamber.","pyrolysis, furnace, heat transfer","The experimental analysis has been observed to have followed the same pattern as the simulated analysis of the Pyrolysis Furnace. It was noticed that the temperature difference between the combustion chamber and pyrolysis chamber is a bit not favourable as the high temperature is much needed in the Pyrolysis chamber. The heat loss is minimal via the kaolin bricks lining the furnace and thus this makes the furnace efficient in the sense that in little time and little fuel consumption a high temperature was attained. The Computer simulation shows that in transient mode, the furnace does not produce the desired conditions but with a continuous heating over time the furnace will acquire a forced convection energy capable of saturating the pyrolysis chamber with enough heat energy that will overcome the thermal resistance to radiation inside the pyrolysis Chamber, Ri and thermal resistance to conduction through the thickness of the pyrolysis chamber, . A rapid rate of radiation from the combustion chamber will give rise to the temperature inside of the pyrolysis chamber where a higher concentration of heat energy is needed for pyrolysis. One of the major advantages of using a simulation tool for evaluation is that all data for temperature, heat flux and energy are available for every part of the furnace as against the real system whereby the measurement was being done at disjointed and asymmetric points.

Production operations data of the Small and Medium Bottled Water Production Enterprise ABC, obtained through: (1) time and method studies and (2) opinions of the production manager of this organization was used to solve the model. Based on the results obtained, it was inferred that objectives 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the Small and Medium Bottled Water Production Enterprise ABC can be achieved. Objective 4 of this enterprise can be achieved during the first, second and fourth week of production, however cannot be achieved in the third week of production. Objective 6 of this enterprise can be achieved, however objective 7 cannot be achieved. Inability of the goal programming model to achieve: (1) the fourth objective in the third week of production, and (2) the seventh objective of the company, were due to the deviations of the results of this model from these objectives target. In light of this, it could be inferred that goal programming model could be used to optimally plan the production operations of the Small and Medium Bottled Water Production Enterprise ABC, in order to meet the strategic goals 1082","enterprise grace mukondeleli kanakana-katumba college of science, engineering and technology university of south africa, south africa katummg@unisa.ac.za olasumbo ayodeji makinde operations management department tshwane university of technology pretoria west, south africa olasumbomakinde@gmail.com","References

177,A Model For Optimization Of Green House Gases (Ghg)  Capture Technologies In Power Plants,"greenhouse gases from power plants are a threat to society, biodiversity and food security. south africa is relying on traditional methods such as coal to generate energy. the international energy agency (iea) forecasts a global increase of greenhouse gases to about 62 billion tons in 2050. in order to reduce greenhouse gases release, it is necessary to develop ghg (green house gas) capture technologies and renewable energies. this research paper is based on the analysis of greenhouse gas technologies which are widely utilised to capture greenhouse emissions from fossil based power generation process. these capture technologies are: amine scrubbing and flue gas desulphurization (semi wet and wet). the research paper covers the following aspects, background of the ghg capture technologies, applications, efficiencies, economies of scale and summary of the operating philosophy. the paper also provides strategies that can be implemented to combat climate change. analytical hierarchical process (ahp) methodology is used to analyse the input data and simulation of the results. ahp analysis is done on constituencies such as water consumption, reliability, capital expenditure and energy consumption of the greenhouse gas capture technologies. the results indicate the semi wet scrubber has an optimal cost benefit compared to other capture technologies.",greenhouse gases,"Considering all the climate change effects that have been experienced in recent years, it is essential that state organs prioritise implementation of greenhouse gases capture technologies and expedite development of renewable energies. Due diligence in selecting optimal GHG is imperative, constituents such as water consumption, reliability, energy efficiency are some of the critical fundamentals which can be used as a basis to select the most optimal GHG capture technology. The research has provided some strategies which can be implemented in reducing toxic gases, which are harmful to human lives and biodiversity. It is recommended that a pilot plant be built in South Africa in order to have practical analysis of the performance of GHG technologies. Comparative studies can then be performed in a more controlled environment. The research has provided a balanced argument between renewable energies and fossil fuels. The research recommends implementation of renewable energies and fossil fuel plants should be fitted with GHG capture technologies.","samuel mnyani post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg auckland park, 2092, south africa beltranjll@gmail.com, arnesht@uj.ac.za telukdarie arnesh post graduate school of engineering management university of johannesburg auckland park, 2092, south africa arnesht@uj.ac.za",

180,Biogenic Waste To Energy Case Studya Strive For Energy  Autonomy,"the energy autonomous campus program is aimed at making the csir pretoria campus energy autonomous over a 5- to 8-year period by supplying its energy from the three primary energy sources – solar, wind and biogas. this platform will be used to demonstrate, in a real-world setting of significant size, a future energy system that is based on a combination of fluctuating and dispatchable renewables that can be designed and operated in the most cost-efficient manner. figures from the world bank (2016) indicates that south africa is the 15th highest producer of waste in the world. according to (godfrey et al., 2014) south african waste sector survey results showed that landfilling remains the main technology option for management of waste, with 90% of all waste generated disposed to landfills. currently south africa’s landfills are rapidly running out of space however policy and regulatory reforms, environmental pressure and increased sustainability awareness are changing the waste landscape. estimates from department of environmental affairs (2012) showed that only 10% of waste is recycled, therefore there is substantial room for industries to come up with solutions to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills that can create a sustainable environment. one main focus of the energy autonomous campus program is to establish a biogas plant that utilises biogenic waste for power generation. the biogas plant will provide a dispatchable electricity generation when solar and wind energy are not available. the plant will also make use of combined cooling, heating and power (cchp) which will allow for increased efficiency. the security of feedstock supply is key in the success of the waste to energy project. the feedstock is expected to be 100% organic in both dry and liquid form. three potential sites have been identified within the csir pretoria campus for the location of the plant. to limit the cost of transporting waste to the biogas site, a virtual boundary of feedstock collection with a radius of 50km is considered. however, this boundary was not deemed to be prescriptive, meaning if a significant source of organic waste is identified slightly beyond this boundary, it would also be considered. in order to mitigate negative impacts of biogas facility on the ecosystem, the selection of right technology is important. a feedstock study showed that a total of 49 tons of food waste could be sourced from the nearby areas daily. the biogas feedstock can be improved by co-digestion of sewage sludge and abattoir waste resulting in 0.5mw electrical capacity and 0.56 mw cooling and/or heating capacity. the feasibility study and technical design will determine the viability of the proposed project by providing a high-level business model. this model considers different ways to maximize outputs from biogas waste plant such as electricity, heat, organic fertilizer etc. this presentation will focus on a holistic approach of generating energy from waste for the csir, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases, waste in landfills and production of electricity as well as useful by-products and determining viability of the business case. 1085",,,"busisiwe patience sigawuke council for scientific and industrial research (csir) pretoria, south africa psigawuke@csir.co.za",
181,Defect Formation And Surface Evolution Of Thin Film  Materials,"modern thin film industries require precise tailoring of thin films properties to have excellent performance for specific applications intended. thin film mechanical behavior and stress presents a technological challenge for material scientists, physics, and engineers. atomic-scale understanding of the microstructure of thin films is a crucial aspect for the control and manipulation of the film properties for a wide range of industrial applications. thin film growth of thin films influences the crystallographic orientation of grains, grain shape and distribution thereby affecting their reliability and performance of the material. this article reviews the present understanding of the mechanism(s) determining the microstructural evolution of thin films, defect formation, and the related failure modes. general trends in microstructural evolution, grain morphology, and texture formation mechanisms are briefly discussed in terms of their respective kinetic processes. the temperature dependency of the film microstructure evolution is described using the structure zone models.","thin film, kinetic processes","The surface and microstructural evolution of thin films have been demonstrated. The kinetic energy and the surface diffusion of adatoms plays an important role in the size of grains, grain distribution and hence the crystal orientation of the film. Thin films are subjected to defects or flaws due to the nature of the synthesis (fabrication and deposition). Presence internal stresses and voids in thin films are usually inevitable, such defects tends to lower the mechanical properties of the film making it susceptible to a various form of thin film modes aforementioned. The understanding of surface evolution and defects formation in the thin film is of critical value since the performance of the thin film system is attributed to the influence of particles and propagation at scales as low as atomic level, hence this review. 1091","resego r phiri1 and o. philip oladijo1.2 1department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering botswana international university of science and technology private bag 16, palapye, botswana resego.phiri@studentmail.biust.ac.bw, seyiphilip@gmail.com esther t. akinlabi2 2department of mechanical engineering science university of johannesburg auckland park, kingsway campus, johannesburg, south africa etakinlabi@uj.ac.za","References

182,The Bleeding Edge Of It Project Methodology  M.T. Steyn De Wet,": the large, complex it project within a major south african bank, is a multi-faceted temporary organisation. existing methodologies, standards and bodies of literature leave scope for the construction of a model that aides the customisation of a unique methodology for the individual, large, complex it project. distinct portions of a single, large, complex it project may differ in terms of characteristics and in terms of the organisational unit that delivers the portion. these organisational units may have unique locations within or external to the organisation. it may be desirable for all or most portions of the total initiative to be managed as a single project. in such a case the project management methodology employed must provide a requisite variety of characteristics and adaptability to manage and integrate the diverse portions of the project. in lieu of these requirements, the multi-level model of the large, complex project within the large south african bank is proposed. literature regarding the tailoring of project management methodologies have developed from describing selection, to describing tailoring and more recently the fusion disparate project management methodologies. the methodology customisation framework is proposed, presenting valuable and usable theory pertaining to project methodology customisation.","tailoring, customisation, multi-level model","- Validation of the MLM and MCF The MLM and MCF have been subjected to three initial validations.

Results should also prove that the resulting air is good for inhaling without any negative effects and it is viable as far as the cost benefits analysis is concern. The required supplied air to channel out this airborne will change if the experiment tests proves positive for engineering design and cost implications.

The study determined the opportunity for IoT solution to improve disaster risk reduction. The researcher conducted an exploratory study, analysing multiple cases, in order to determine if IoT is the appropriate technology to improve risk reduction. The findings revealed that IoT is the right technology for the reduction of human and economic losses. Technology transfer is moving slowly, capacity is a challenge to most countries, and financial constraints contribute to countries not affording to implement such solutions. This study recommends to countries; hazard prone or not, to invest in IoT technologies, as it is proving to be efficient systems for everyday living.

188,The Effects Of Manufacturing And Service Sectors On    Economic Growth In Nigeria,"the manufacturing and service sectors are the most dominant sectors that propelled the rapid growth and development of many industrialized nations. they are regarded as the engine of growth. however, their performances have remained largely slow in nigeria. therefore, the research investigated the influence of the manufacturing and service sectors on nigeria’s economic growth and development in the period under review. the methodology employed to test the levels of stationarity of the variables is the augmented dickey-fuller, while the dependent variable proxied by gdp and that of the independent variables are manufacturing sector, value added, service sector, value added, government expenditure and consumer price index. the obtained results indicated all variables are of order one. also, the study found the existence of a long run relationship existing among the variables of manufacturing and service sectors which are positive and significant meaning that as the manufacturing and service sectors grow, the economy also grows rapidly. the recommendations of the study among other things are that the central authorities should, therefore, endeavor to massively invest and boost the infrastructural needs of the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy to further enhance the economic growth potentials of the economy.","economic growth, manufacturing, relationship, l80","and Recommendations The study studiously examined the accomplishments of Nigerian manufacturing and service sectors, and its impact on the Nigerian economic growth using time series data for Nigeria. It was observed that its accomplishments in the initial time covered by the study were a relatively static period, while the concluding years showed some recovery in the performance of the economy. The study largely agrees with the previous works of Soderhom and Teal (2002), which noted that the more the manufacturing and service sectors grow and become more efficient, the more the export volume, the more the revenue to investment and the better the payment to workers and hence their well being. The study, therefore, recommends the following that: 1. All efforts should be geared towards ensuring the production of value-added products and the creation of new inter-sectoral linkages to ensure a more integrated production structure in the nation. 2. The Federal government should critically address the high infrastructure deficit been experienced by the manufacturing sector especially the epileptic and erratic power supply, poor roads network and the provision of potable water. 3. Also, the Federal government should enter into a joint partnership with private firms in investing in manufacturing activities that will trigger sustainable economic growth in Africa especially in technology components, human capital development and other areas that are critical to development. 4. Initiating and sustaining the right policies to encourage foreign direct investment and foreign investors will be a right step in the right direction.","1jesusetemi oluwafemi, 2e.t. akinlabi, and 3pule kholopane 1,3department of quality and operations management, university of johannesburg, rsa jesusetemiayeni@yahoo.com, pulek@uj.ac.za 2department of mechanical engineering science, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, apk, rsa etakinlabi@uj.ac.za afolabi babatunde and oluwafemi ifetayo department of banking and finance, college of social and management sciences, afe babalola university, ado ekiti (abuad), nigeria afolabib@abuad.edu.ng, johnifetayo@abuad.edu.ng",

191,"Constraint Dependent, Shortest Path Algorithms For Real Time  Vehicles Movement In The Coal Mining Industry Towards","industry 4.0 is knocking on south african miners’ doors, with the introduction of a digital mine increasingly becoming seemingly important for their survival and success. in order for mines to remain competitive, digital innovations will be needed in the future to increase productivity. this paper looks at an artificial intelligent technique in order to assist in the control of shuttle vehicles in the coal mining industry. since the bord and pillar mining technique is used, shuttle car movements are based on queuing, shortest paths and path constraints. a graphical user interface (gui) was designed in order to assist mining operators. the algorithms used in this optimization of these cars are dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, k-shortest path algorithm and discrete event simulation. in order to test this application, simulations and test results were carried out using matlab.",industry 4.0,"The development of shortest path algorithms to navigate through environments is a continuing area of research. When paths can be logically decomposed into a collection of routes and intersections, such environments can be represented by a graph. Edges of the graph can be assigned a cost, representing the expense of traversing a route between two graph nodes. Algorithms such as Dijkstra’s shortest path operate on these graphs to find paths with a minimal summed edge cost. Thus, different routes can be favoured or avoided by weighting graph edges with some metric associated of the environment. The distance travelled along a route is the most frequently used, but other measures such as traffic congestion can also be used. Many techniques to be employed for such applications are still being determined. Crucial tasks such as these are directly linked to operational efficiencies. The designed system in this paper is a positive step forward in solving this issue, at the same time taking steps to include the new industrial revolution. There is room for vast improvement to the concept such as the monitoring of real time data underground i.e. knowing the exact location of the shuttle cars, since GPS and other techniques are not readily available underground.

192,Acceptance Of A New Reporting Platform For Work Experience  Reporting In An Engineering Discipline,"technology has become crucial to the success of learning design, and more so in the recent years. the success of technological solutions depends on its acceptance within the target community of users, which in most cases is the student community it is meant to serve; but when it succeeds, it can be a great enabler of learning. a department in a university decided to migrate from the paper based approach submission of students’ vacation work report to electronic based submission. adapting this technology platform to continue to meet student needs is important, and so, it is necessary to understand the students’ perception of the new submission system. students were requested to complete questionnaires related to their perception of the system relative to the traditional system in order to guide the future evolution. the basic technology acceptance model (tam) was used to elicit students’ changeover experience. results suggest that the changeover is acceptable to the students, and the basic tam hypotheses postulated seem empirically supported. moreover, it seems the category of students that have used the previous paper based submission appreciated the shift more than those that had little contact with the old system.","tam, lms, vacation report","The acceptance of the new submission platform for the submission of undergraduate students’ vacation work report. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) adapted and a Structural Equation Model was developed. The result indicated that the TAM model hypotheses were supported by the data collected. This suggests that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are important factors to consider in engendering acceptability of leaning management solutions. The qualitative ranking of the features of the submission system also indicated that the ability to work, save and return to continue is about the most desirable feature of the system. Such information is useful in guiding the future development of the platform. It is recommended that an expanded system would be developed to see the effects of other moderating variables like mobile app capability, real-time data capture in log-form, and other such technology enhancement capabilities on the acceptance of the learning system.",,
193,The Exploration Of Modern Noise Control Measures For  Mining Operations,"operations managers are confronted with both first-level noise control (noise engineering) and second-level (hearing conservation) measures. the exploration of the full spectrum noise control is highlighted by a case study of south africa’s largest gold mining group. while modern factories will use sound cameras and new types of electromagnetic noise will occur, mine workers are continuously more exposed to potentially dangerous noise levels than to similar levels of any other noxious agent. the paper shows how second-level measures are not further compromised with second best quality. it focuses on a best-practice hearing conservation case, designed and implemented (maintained) on a large scale for more than 25 000 mine workers. the paper contributes to the prevention of nihl (noise-induced hearing loss) and provides management with an overview and practical principles for best-practice noise control.","noise pollution, noise engineering","The paper described the problem of noise and addressed the research problem in terms of a review of first-level noise control (noise engineering and the modern future of noise) and second-level noise control (hearing conservation) to eliminate NIHL (noise-induced hearing loss). Most solutions to the noise challenge were explored in terms of the science of noise engineering, the design (sources) of noise, noise ergonomics, the three primary noise control dimensions, principles to reduce noise, control of noise propagation, the use of acoustic barriers, sound absorption (and reflection), reverberation , the future of innovative modern noise control and best-practice HCPs. The focus of the paper was on second-level noise control in terms of a best-practice HCP for a South African gold mines describing how custom-made hearing conservation can be done on a large scale. It showed how important a competent HCP service provider is in terms of several operations management performance objectives and to manage complex MPSs. The four dimensions of the best-practice HCP indicated several unconventional measures needed for HCP effectiveness. The single most significant change at the gold mine was the overall buy-in in terms of the positive attitudes towards the HCP, ownership (wearability) of custom-made HPDs and hearing conservation awareness in general. The other success factor highlighted is the OAE technology providing an additional dimension for prevention. The majority of the workers are in the high risk groups for OAEs, but with normal hearing. This indicates the importance to sustain the HCP because the majority of employees have acquired OHC damage in the cochlear but still have normal hearing thresholds. 2141","rigard johan steenkamp department of operations management university of south africa pretoria, rsa steenrj@unisa.ac.za","References

197,An Analysis Of The Internal Organizational Processes And  Their Impact On Project Delays A Case Study On A South,"delay in project delivery has become a common phenomenon in the project management profession. this should not be accepted as a norm considering that projects form an integral part of achieving organization’s strategic objectives. this paper examines how internal organizational processes affect the successful delivery of projects by exploring a case study on the project management processes at a south african university. various project managers in the university, under the operations department were interviewed. the paper addresses project planning processes, organizational strategic objectives in relation to project management processes as well as addresses organizational bureaucracy and its effects on project processes. furthermore, the analysis addresses current internal challenges through the theory of constraint.","project delays, operations","5.1 Recommendation Firstly, the employer needs to investigate stabilizing the project management office. There are currently over 100 projects that need to be implemented within the organization. However, due to lack of staff and inconsistency in the office, these projects are not being implemented; causing a negative effect on the organizations operations. In addition, the Human Resource department needs to develop current staff in their positions to provide the necessary training and development courses to satisfy the project management methodologies. This will allow the project management office to have a strong solid foundation in terms of project management methodologies. Secondly, with the implementation of projects from inception to close out, the level of stakeholder involvement in executive decisions needs to be investigated. The reality of the matter is that, not often will a certain stakeholder be available to approve a certain document or conclude on a certain concept design. Some of the stakeholders (especially those in approval positions) involved do not provide much justice to project delivery. One respondent indicated that they are required to get signatures for payment certificates to the level of the Vice Chancellor (VC). Therefore, changing some stages in the process is also something that the employer can consider. One other respondent suggested that the procurement department should look at the option of pre-approving a list of suppliers for a period of about three years. This will in turn prevent lengthy signatory approvals and tender committee dates. However, it does not seem like a viable option as organizations are required to assist and build small emerging enterprises. Having a panel appointed for a three year period, leaves the other small enterprises out – as often the requirements for this option are intense. It also does not give them an opportunity to grow and gain the experience they need. Lastly, in support of the first point, the employer should look at the option of housing all the supporting functions to the project management office in one space. Having a procurement administrator, financial business partner, health and safety practitioner, and legal representative will allow projects to be implemented in isolation, not having to depend on functional departments. In that way they can all report to the Director, and all the necessary approvals can take place in one space, according to one standard process. 5.2 Conclusion The study revealed that although the project management office is recognised, it is not given due support to optimise its operations. The evidence is in the internal processes, and how they do not compliment project management methodologies. Furthermore, there are many areas that need to be given attention if the project management office is to work and be of efficient service to the university. The employer needs to determine the need of the project management office within the university and what the office needs to deliver. By so doing, the company will be able to place a visible structure within the project management office, and all stakeholders affected, positively or negative, need to buy in to it.","african university and the challenges faced by project managers when delivering projects eveth nkeiruka nwobodo-anyadiegwu, nyiko apathia baloyi-sindane, charles mbohwa department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg, johannesburg, south africa evethn@uj.ac.za; nyikob@uj.ac.za; cmbohwa@uj.ac.za",
198,Characterization And Structural Investigation On Diorite  Rocks Of Botswana,"clear investigation on mineral rock characterization is essential for establishing solid bridges between the mineral resource location and area of application, i.e. rock provenance. major scientific revolutions in the industry was made possible via technologies of characterization (xrd, xrf, sem etc..,) providing improved processing routes that effectively address arising challenges and problems faced by our local quarries and mining industries, therefore attempting also to explaining fundamental treatment techniques that were adopted anciently. modern civil engineering activities, mining and construction entail clear statistical data on material composition, texture, petrographic and mechanical properties of the source material or mineral ore they are handling for clear documentation. visual inspection was carried out on diorite samples acquired from various locations. microscopic examination of component were classified in order to rationalize unique and recognizable features (mineral type, structure and color patterns), and estimations for specific purpose the rock is suited for (i.e., as a sculpting material or fabrication tool). characterization therefore, provided crucial information to the interpretation on quality of stone and relevant processing factors relating to energy input and effective processing technique. in this work, in- situ x – ray powder diffraction analysis was performed at rtp conditions on powdered samples of diorite (a) and (b). various components were identified which revealed that phase composition is significant in determining the strength of material and processing parameters.","characterization, crystallography","From the data acquired by the diffractogram, it was visible that majority of crystalline phases where easy to identify with panda quarry rock sample as plagioclase (39.20%), amphibole (31.74%), Quartz (12.26%) and minor inclusions of mica mixed with chlorides compounds. For the analyzed scan results clear data obtained with less noise levels, N, made classification straightforward, presenting the material to possess a high fraction of crystallinity with larger particle components which consequently led to recommendation of the material as mainly suitable for road construction activities and infrastructural work due to the inherent character of large phase composition. The data analysis for master quarry diorite sample as mainly Hornblende (49.9%), Berlinite (18.2%), Bezzite (16.1%) together with traces of other complex, displayed less crystallinity of components while showing greater amounts of fine – grained distribution of phases thus suggesting a larger contribution to be occupied by clay and minor trace constituents of lazurite, mica and silicates. From the diffractogram analysis it can be suggested that the master quart stone is much suited to use in infrastructural work like building and also civil industry. Due to great domination in phosphates (Al (PO4)) and lesser crystallinity of components, master quarry rock would require less amount of breakage energy in comparison to the Francistown’s panda quarry rock product with higher crystallinity and a well-defined component field. The signal-to-noise ratio is important during analysis and a material with a high noise level remain difficult to classify, from these specimen it is clear that for Serowe rocks the signal was two times greater than the noise level, 2:1 while for panda quarries the ratio was approximately 3:1, these difference was due to the material’s diffraction characteristics and linear absorption coefficient of each specimen. 1200","mr gaesenngwe gaesenngwe and dr. g. dahna department of chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering botswana international university of science and technology palapye, private bag 16, botswana info@biust.ac.bw mr gaesenngwe gaesenngwe chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering department biust university palapye, botswana gaesenngwe.gaesenngwe@studentmail.biust.ac.bw","References

investing more into mining. Also, I believe our country to be blessed since it affords many opportunities of science 
and technological improvement especially due to high reliance on production of methods and techniques that are old 
(for example: dependence on coal for energy production rather than employment of solar voltaic systems for energy 
production something that can not only reduce carbon emission into the environment but also create jobs and fill our

199,Models For Infusion Of Pollutant Species Through Engineered  Geocomposite Media From Destructed Polyethylene,"in recent times, it has become crucial to protect soil, surface and groundwater reserves from pollution due to the consequential effects of landfilling operations. in a bid to safeguarding environmental and human health, various technologies have been employed in waste containment over the years. significantly, geomembranes/ mineral composites liners have been employed. sequential tests using a small-scale laboratory bespoke column hybrid permeameter device was conducted on the impact of infusion of pollutant species in a geocomposite lining system/ mineral barrier through a circular destructed polyethylene membrane. the imposition of pressure as a simulation for waste load on the pollutant infusion rate, pollutant transport and the buffering capability of natural-mineral soil profile were studied. infusion through the geocomposite liner-buffering system (bs) was measured for tests with the destructed membrane under simulated waste loads of up to 150 kpa. results and analysis showed significant reduction in infusion rate with increased pressure on the system. this reduction is attributed to the reduced barrier transmissivity, θ and soil liner compressibility alterations in the soil barrier. the infusion rate data for tests with the destructed membrane in this study were compared with predicted values from equations provided by forchheimer and giroud et al. the comparison showed inapplicability to this study and also showed imperfect contact conditions at the membrane/soil interface if assumed in practice. nevertheless, equations from giroud for good contact conditions revealed rational infusion rate predictions through the destructed membrane of the geocomposite media.","buffer, geocomposites, infusion, media","A test on geo-composite liner with defected polyethylene membrane under the effect of chemical transport was conducted in a small-scale device called a Modular Consolidometer-Percolation Column Hybrid. Effect of pressure on the leachate flow rate with the transport mechanism and buffering of heavy metals were investigated. From tests and analysis of results, the following conclusions were reached;  The increase in applied pressure on the liner systems was observed to significantly reduce the leachate flow rate; and from analysis, there was clear indication that the reduction was as a result of the membrane/soil interface transmissivity, θ, reduction and thickness reduction of the soil barrier.  The assumption of perfect membrane/soil interface contact condition is not applicable to leachate flow through a defected membrane with underlain soil barrier. Giroud empirical equations for good contact condition provided a reasonable prediction for this problem under very low pressure (close to 0 kPa). However, the influence of pressure was not catered for by the predictive equation in their work.  The measured pore fluid concentration of the transported contaminants, confirmed there was flow through the membrane-soil interface; the concentration of selected chemical ions in sectioned cores of the BS after percolation test revealed the natural soil to have good buffering abilities towards the selected chemical species/ions. However, further study needs to be conducted on the influence of pressure on the interface contact behaviour and modification is required for Giroud empirical equations such that the effect of pressure need be taken into account.

200,Reduction Of Anionic Chemical Contaminant Infusion  Through Engineered Clayey Medium,"waste containment has always involved the use of land which sees the disposal of enormous quantities of waste in landfills. this waste disposal approach creates gases and other toxic substances whose escape from containment facilities poses severe threats to environmental and human health. most breakaways of toxic elements from landfills are often associated with leachate infusion through failed barrier components/ containment materials to levels with consequential impacts. as such, it is pertinent that barrier lining systems are designed and constructed with integrity to ensure the protection of soil, water resources and other natural reserves, as well as prevent the pollution of surrounding environment. these challenges paved way for the study to investigate landfill leachate infusion through a circular failed geocomposite liner using a laboratory fabricated permeation testing apparatus. pressures which simulated actual landfill waste loads were applied to the lining system and the buffering capacity of a natural zeolitic mineral layer was investigated by measuring the leachate infusion rate and anionic (cl and hco3) contaminant infusion through the geocomposite liner-buffering strata (bs). 25 - 150 kpa of simulated landfill waste loads were imposed on the system at intervals. the study was also done as a revalidation mechanism to previous studies. the outcomes revealed significant reduction in infusion rate over the varied pressure. the infusion reduction is attributed to the reduced liner transmissivity, θ and compressed soil layer. however, the natural zeolitic soil displayed poor buffering of cl ions but showed a fair result in the case of hco3 ions. data for infusion rates were compared with empirical values from existing models by forchheimer and giroud. the comparisons indicated inapplicability to this study and to real life scenarios if conditions of perfect contact at the polyethylene/soil interface were assumed. nevertheless, giroud’s model for good contact condition considerably predicted infusion rate through a failed medium.","anions, buffer, contaminants, infusion","Tests on geocomposites with failed PE under the influence of leachate infusion were conducted in a fabricated laboratory column device. Pressure effects on the leachate infusion rate, infusion mechanism and buffering of anionic contaminant species were investigated. From the analyses of results the following conclusions were reached: • The increase in applied pressure on the liner significantly reduced the leachate infusion rate; and from analysis, there was evident that the reduction was as a result of the decreased PE-soil interface transmissivity, θ, and the soil liner densification. • The assumption of perfect PE-soil interface contact condition is not applicable to leachate infusion through a failed system with underlying mineral layer. Nonetheless, Giroud’s empirical model for good contact condition provided a rational prediction for this problem under pressure of 0 kPa. However, the influence of pressure was not considered by the model as contrary to the case of this study. 1218","emmanuel emem-obong agbenyeku and edison muzenda department of chemical engineering technology university of johannesburg johannesburg, doornfontein, 2028, south africa emmaa@uj.ac.za, emuzenda@uj.ac.za edison muzenda chemical, materials and metallurgical engineering department botswana international university of science and technology palapye, pmb 16, botswana muzendae@biust.ac.bw","References

202,Investigating The Risk Management Systems In The South  African Banking Industry,"over the last decade, there has been a huge debate that has risen around the issue surrounding risk management within banking sector mostly due to current monetary crisis. numerous attempts were put in place with the objective of improving the risk management and performance in banking industry comprising the introduction of the basel accords and also risk management strategies by central banks. as a result, the south african state-owned banks have allotted risk management policies to reinforce the risk management system and to enhance the functioning of the banking sector. but, the existing literature within south african perspective do not elucidate the influence of these attempts on the functioning of banks. lin light of this, the present research paper aimed at examining the efficiency of risk management systems in the south african local banks. this paper appraises the related literatures on banking risk management as of various methodological aspects and develops a conclusion to contribute to the existing literature; mainly in addressing some flaws concerning risk management system in the south african baking sector.","risk management, baking sector","Risk is everywhere whether it be internal or external, what is significant is how an organisation prepares for it, as risk is unpredictable and uncertain and can occur at any given time. Organisations prepare for risks even if they do not transpire, they do this by implementing certain controls and processes involving continuously monitoring and reporting. If an organisation implements the six steps in the risk management process, and everyone within the organisation from top to bottom understands the purpose and importance of risk management the entire organisation will benefit. There are many frameworks and models an organisation can implement, however at the end of the day what matters is what the organisation does with the information that they collect, how do they utilise it and implement it to better the current risk controls of the organisation. Enterprise risk management is entrenched in most organisations, for an organisation to thrive and remain competitive they need to ensure that all risks affecting an organisation have been predicted and treated. The main objective of this assignment was to provide an understanding of what risks management is and how Bank X incorporates the theory into their risk management system called Open Pages. It is vital to have a system that speaks theory and is a centralised point for the collection of data it allows for accurate reporting when there is one centralised system for capturing of risks. Risks usually emanates from external and internal factors both locally and internationally and therefore it’s important that organisations constantly monitor new risk that emerge. ERM should ensure that policies and regulations are constantly updated and incorporated within the Banks ERM framework. Risk is an ongoing threat and if an organisation implements the systems and processes discussed throughout this assignment, the organisation should be resilient enough to survive unscathed. 1235","khathutshelo mushavhanamadi and karen mcgloin department of quality and operations management, faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg, po box, 524, auckland park, 2006 south africa kmushavhanamadi@uj.ac.za","REFERENCES

203,"Exploring Salt Reaction On Buildings Along Coastal Area In  Lagos State, Nigeria – A Review","over the years studies have revealed that location and environmental impact are important factors to be considered in building materials selection. these have become major criteria in selection of appropriate building materials especially in the coastal regions of the world. in nigeria, lagos state has a close proximity with the atlantic ocean and the saline air present in this ocean have been discovered to cause physical and chemical damages to the nature of the building materials used in this area. hence, in order to curb these effects, understanding the impact of this saline air on building materials and the way towards improving the resistance of buildings within this area to salt reaction is necessary. this study present the result gotten from the review of literature on the effect of salt on buildings in coastal areas and the possible ways of ensuring a reduction of the negative effect of this salt reaction with building materials. findings revealed that salt attack on concrete and steel reinforcements leads to structural failure in buildings. also, moisture penetration leads to blistering, chalking, and peeling of paints, which leads to constant re-painting of buildings. cracking of walls, deterioration of floorboards and wood degradation are some of the effect of salt on buildings within the coastal areas.","building materials, saline environment, salinity, corrosion","and Recommendation This study through a review of literature assessed the effect of salt on buildings along the coastlines and the possible ways of ensuring a reduction in the negative effect of this salt movement. The effect of salt on concrete, clay brick and tiles, metal, wood and paint were investigated in this study. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the prevailing presence of saline air within areas along the Atlantic Ocean is a major reason for the degradation and deterioration of building materials in the area. The salt attack on concrete and steel reinforcements leads to structural failure in buildings. Also, moisture penetration leads to blistering, chalking, and peeling of paints, which leads to constant re-painting of buildings within these areas. Cracking of walls, deterioration of floorboards and wood degradation are some of the effect of salt on buildings within the coastal areas. The study, therefore, recommends that if building in the coastal areas of Lagos State, Nigeria are to achieve better resistance to salt reaction within the area, then proper consideration should be given to environmental factors as they have a role to play when choosing the right building materials for buildings around the coast and this provides prior knowledge of the reaction of the building materials to salt. The use of SRC and low water to cement ratios mixtures in designing concrete structures will help improve the resistance of concrete to deterioration from seawater and saline air. Oily preservatives such as creosote should be used on woods to prevent the effect of saline air on them while PVC can be used to control salt penetration into buildings by using them as surface finishes.","emmanuel aghimien1, clinton aigbavboa2, and douglas aghimien2 1department of architecture, federal university of technology, akure, nigeria 2sustainable human settlement and construction research centre, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa emmanuelaghimien@yahoo.com, caigbavboa@uj.ac.za, aghimiendouglas@yahoo.com,",
204,Prefabrication In The South African Construction Industry –  Challenges And Solutions,"despite the inherent benefits in the delivery of construction through prefabrication, its adoption is still considered to be low in most developing countries like south africa. this paper presents the result of an assessment of the challenges facing the adoption of prefabrication in the south african construction industry (saci) and the measures for improving same. the study adopted a quantitative survey approach with information gathered from participants within selected construction organisations in gauteng province, south africa. data gathered were analysed using percentage, mean score and standard deviation. findings revealed that the most significant challenges facing the adoption of prefabrication are lack of prefabrication branding and promotion, low awareness and knowledge, need for specialized equipment for installation, difficulty in getting tender, negative perception, improper assembly of prefabricated components, high investment on equipment, and clients doubts in using prefabricated materials. if the system of prefabrication in construction is to be adopted considerably within the saci, then there is the need for the adoption of measures such as, conducting research and testing to prove feasibility of design, organizing workshops to train individuals on prefabrication projects, providing skills development programmes, creating awareness among parties involved in construction, adequate government support, regular training of machine operators, and advanced technology in assembling.",precast,"and Recommendations This study set out to assess the adoption of prefabrication system within the SACI with a view to providing faster and better quality construction within the country. Using a quantitative survey with information gathered from participants within selected construction organisations in Gauteng, the major challenges of the adoption of prefabrication as well as the measures for improving its adoption were identified. Based on the findings of the study, it is, therefore, concluded that the most significant challenges facing the adoption of prefabrication within the SACI are lack of prefabrication branding and promotion low awareness and knowledge about prefabrication, need for specialized equipment for installation, difficult to get a tender, negative perception, improper assembly of prefabricated components, investment on heavy equipment, and clients have doubts about using prefabricated materials. If the system of prefabrication in construction is to be adopted considerably within the SACI, then there is the need for the adoption of measures such as, conducting research and testing to prove feasibility of design, organizing workshops to train individuals on prefabrication projects, providing skills development programmes, creating awareness among parties involved in construction, adequate government support, regular training of machine operators, and advanced technology in assembling. 1252","clinton aigbavboa, douglas aghimien, and yonela ntso sustainable human settlement and construction research centre, faculty of engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg, south africa caigbavboa@uj.ac.za, aghimiendouglas@yahoo.com, ntsoyonela@gmail.co.za","References

205,Optimal Production Plan In Flour Mills Of Nigeria Public  Liability Company: Linear Programming And Sensitivity,"the insufficient or little attention given to sensitivity analysis (sa) approach in the extant literature prompted this study to incorporate both linear programming (lp) and sensitivity analysis (sa) techniques to determine segment that best contributes to the objective function in flour mills of nigeria plc. the study considered five main segments of the company namely; food, agro-allied, packaging, port operation and logistics and real state of the company and financial information extracted from the company annual report for the year ended march 31, 2017. result from the lp analysis using simplex algorithm revealed that milling and sales of flour and rice and production and sales of pasta, snacks, sugar and noodles in the food segment contribute ₦72, 156, 441, 200 to profit representing 7.57% increase over the initial total contribution of ₦66, 689, 068, 000 with production of 1,250 units of the food items while each extra ₦’000 spent on the binding constraints (cost of sales), would produce ₦0.15 extra contribution. it was also found that sa analysis improves lp result by 1.34% and 0.88% respectively for units of production in the food segment and total contribution to profit. the study thus concluded that milling and sales of flour and rice and production and sales of pasta, snacks, sugar and noodles are more profitable to the company. for that reason and in order to maximize profit the management of fmn plc should give more attention to the food segment.","lp, sa, 2002). planning",,"analysis olusegun kazeem lekan department of business management, faculty of management sciences, federal university dutsinma, katsina, p.m.b.5001, katsina state. kolusegun@fudutsinma.edu.ng oladejo lukman gbolagade department of business management, faculty of management sciences, federal university dutsinma, katsina, p.m.b.5001, katsina state. loladejo@fudutsinma.edu.ng sonny emmanuel braide department of business management, faculty of management sciences, federal university dutsinma, katsina, p.m.b. 5001, katsina state. sbraide@fudutsinma.edu.ng",
206,Monitoring And Assessing The Impact Of Implementing Iso,"iso standards are getting an increasing attention from different organizations. however, the effects of using different standards on the organizational performance are still unclear. iso 55000 standard aims to provide all the stakeholders with a better understanding of the asset management system in order to achieve excellence in managing assets. the aim of this study is to assess the impact of moving toward implementing iso 55000 in an educational institute that has started preparing for implementing it. the process of this assessment started by identifying the key performance indicators (kpis), shortlisting them and then performing meetings and interviews with experts to evaluate the kpis based on the available data. it was found that iso 55000 requirements started to positively enhance the facilities management and planning department and its performance; however, the lack of data and records availability prevented from obtaining a full picture about the impact of iso 55000 requirements.","assessing, iso 55000, dhanorkar","Impact 7 Reduction of lead time (delivery time to market) Yes Stock materials are currently procured ahead of time to avoid delays caused earlier due to non- availability of required materials. Positive 8 Improvement in the quality, reliability of products / services Yes The available documents and regulation at the department prove the improvement in monitoring the quality of the provided services. Positive 9 Improved documentation, work procedures, policies and registers Yes Documentation of department processes, work procedures, asset records and maintenance schedules and plans are improved. Positive 10 Continuous improvement through reduction of mistakes, nonconformity, rework and non-value added activities No Measuring continuous improvement cannot be implemented at current stage as it depends on the electronic management system, which is expected to be completed by June 2017. In addition to that a sufficient time period after system completion (around 1 year) is required to measure any improvements or reduction of the frequency of maintenance activities. - 11 Improved maintenance performance No Similar to KPI #10. - 12 Improved working conditions, Health and safety performance No - - 13 Increased employee motivation and commitment No Although team building activities started, the activity is not continued and there is no clear plan of future activities to enable monitoring the motivation. - 14 Increased employee development, education and training No The department has not developed training plan yet. - 15 Clear knowledge of tasks responsibilities by employees No - - 16 Encouragement of innovation No - - 4. Discussion During the interviews, it was found that the assets were poorly managed prior the start of implementing ISO 55000 requirement, which can be noticed from the lack of data to assess 10 out of the 16 KPIs, where the documentation process has started with the start of applying ISO 55000 requirements. As a result, in the future and once the required data is available, the organization can re-assess its state and determine its strength and weakness. It can be noticed that the current practice of measuring the customer satisfaction is not enough, as not all customers are participating in the satisfaction survey, which indicates a need for a better method. 5. Conclusion The purpose of this work was to assess the state of the facilities management and planning department at an educational institute before and after the start of implementing the ISO 55000 requirements. The process of this assessment started by identifying the KPIs, shortlisting them and finally performing meetings and interviews to evaluate the KPIs based on the available data. ISO 55000 requirements started to positively enhance the department and its performance; 1260","sadeque hamdan1, maitha alsuwaidi2, imad alsyouf1,2, mohammad shamsuzzaman1,2 1sustainable engineering asset management (seam) research group, 2department of industrial engineering and engineering management university of sharjah sharjah, 27272, uae shamdan@sharjah.ac.ae; engr.maitha@gmail.com; ialsyouf@sharjah.ac.ae; mshamsuzzaman@sharjah.ac.ae","References

207,Project Cost Overrun In The South African Construction  Sector: A Case Study Of Johannesburg Metropolis,"the cost overrun on projects brings about poor speculation comes back from the utilization of the undertaking, delay in the usage of the general population offices and expanded burden for people in general. putting resources into foundation is a prime method to help financial development, enhance the social prosperity of populations, and advance territorial incorporation. in any case, unnecessary cost overruns result in expanded subsidizing needs and go about as an imperative to advancement. the objective of this study is to identify building contractors, consultants and clients perception on cost overrun in south africa construction sector, examine factors that cause, or influence cost overrun in south africa construction sector and identify the challenges in the construction sector regarding cost overrun. this study employs mixed methods that is an application of both quantitative and qualitative approaches to triangulate data. based on the contractor’s, consultants, and building clients response on identification and ranking of the determinants that causes cost escalation in projects from most pressing cause to least causes, the study revealed factors as listed in order of most pressing factor as; poor planning, fluctuation of prices of project materials, high interest rates by bankers, inflationary pressure, cost of labor, poor coordination between agents of construction, on site poor financial management, inadequate local production of raw materials.","project, cost overrun","and Recommendations The study employed a well-structured questionnaire to solicit views and opinion information particularly perception on cost overrun from a conveniently sampled agents in Johannesburg, South Africa. Findings obtained from this study indicated that majority of the agents or stakeholders in construction industry perceive proportionally a higher cost escalation in the construction projects. Contractors expressed their worry on the escalating cost in their projects. Based on the contractor’s, consultants, and building clients response on identification and ranking of the determinants that causes cost escalation in projects from most pressing cause to least causes, the study revealed factors as listed in order of most pressing factor as; Poor planning, Fluctuation of prices of project materials, High interest rates by bankers, Inflationary pressure, Cost of labor, Poor coordination between agents of construction, On site poor financial management, Inadequate local production of raw materials. Finally, the main challenges or constraints faced in the South African construction industry as indicated by respondents were; Constant rising of Project Costs” (Cost overrun) followed by Corruption Issues, Lack of Skilled Labor. The study recommends following for policy implications. Firstly, government should put keen interest in controlling inflation rates and interest rates especially on the cost of building and construction material prices in the South African economy. This would go a long way to relieve project contractors’ from incurring marginal cost in their construction project budgets. Also, government, vocational/technical construction institutions and NGO’s should incorporate project management and financing program (lessons) in their curriculum to educate and improve building and construction agent’s knowledge, skills and understanding of potential cost overrun in every project. 1269","ramaloko mulalo, kidoge ibrahimu, eveth nwobodo-anyadiegwu department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa mastermulalo@icloud.com,fredkidoge@gmail.com, evethn@uj.ac.za","References

208,Benefits Of Adopting Lean Construction Technique In The  South African Construction Industry,"the construction industry is heterogeneous and enormously involved with projects that are exposed to an uncertainty found in design and planning, presence of various interest of stakeholders, availability of resources, environmental factors, the economy of the country and statutory regulations. however, most activities of the industry have negative impacts on the environment by generation of construction and demolition wastes. lean construction (lc) technique gives the opportunity to more but with less of everything, lean use less of human effort, equipment, time, and space. this study seeks to appraise the benefits of lc technique based on professionals’ opinion in the south african construction industry. well- structured questionnaire was prepared to collect data from respondents which include quantity surveyors, architects, construction managers, project managers and civil engineers. result of the analysed data revealed that clients, consultants and contractors agreed that the most significant benefits of adopting lc technique are waste reduction, efficient administration of materials and improved whole-life cost of construction projects. this implies that management of construction waste is one of the important management processes necessary to achieve project objectives. recommendation was made that companies should use lc to identify and analyse waste to improve productivity, minimise time and accidents, improve reliability, improve quality and ensure more client satisfaction.","lean construction, project delivery","and Recommendations This study has been able to identify the benefits of lean construction technique to the South African Construction Industry as also identified by many researchers for other developing countries. Therefore, it is concluded that among others, reduced waste and efficient administration of materials are the main benefit which are the core objectives of LC technique. Since managing construction waste is one of the most significant management processes necessary to achieve project objectives, it is hereby recommended that companies should use lean construction to identify and analyse waste to improve productivity, minimise time and accidents, improve reliability, improve quality and ensure more client satisfaction. For further studies, this research can also be carried out in other provinces of South Africa to have a wider knowledge of the opinion of Construction Industry professionals on the benefits of LC technique.","opeoluwa akinradewo, ayodeji oke, clinton aigbavboa, mulongo ndalamba department of construction management and quantity surveying university of johannesburg johannesburg 2028, south africa opeakinradewo@gmail.com, emayok@gmail.com, caigbavboa@uj.ac.za, mwilambwegloria@gmail.com",
209,Conditioned Upshots Of Permeation Rates As A Function Of  Vadose Zone Effect In Engineered Landfill Clayey Medium,"in has long been established that the escape and consequent permeation of landfill leachate through a barrier medium is one of the contributing factors to environmental contamination, especially where vital regions with consequential impacts are concerned as in the case of soil, surface, subsurface and groundwater pollution. although the contamination process of environmental resources from leachate permeation may be slow, it poses a significant threat to human and environmental health in the long run. these challenges paved way for the study to evaluate via laboratory tests the permeation rates of a landfill mineral lining system as compacted clay liner (ccl) overlain an unsaturated/ vadose and saturated zone of known thicknesses respectively. the laboratory permeation tests were conducted to simulate the moisture flow regime and steady/ quasi steady-state permeation rates for typical conditions of a landfill. the results of the tests revealed the hydraulic conductivity of the fine textured vadose zone to be 1-2 magnitude in order lesser than the saturated zone hydraulic conductivity. nonetheless, the hydraulic conductivity of the mineral barrier and the permeation rate to underlying groundwater was found to dependent on the nature of the zone as the last line of defense to contaminant permeation in the event of leachate breakthrough. thickness values of up to 225 mm for the fine textured zones were reached which appeared to be functional parts of the tested landfill mineral liner. consequently, the vadose zone was found to behave better than the saturated zone in the permeability of the overall lining system as such, upshots of the tests showed permeability coefficient of the ccl of 24 mm natural clay mineral liner to be the key regulator of the steady/ quasi steady-state permeation rates in the overall system lining setup.","clayey, leachate, permeation, saturated","This study investigated on soil mineral lining systems to determine the effect of vadose zone on leachate permeation behaviour. A laboratory fabricated permeation column hybrid device was employed in the testing procedure with materials sampled from an active landfill site around the CoJ. The overall permeation rate, Q for the lining system was determined under certain boundary conditions presented in the study. It was therefore emphasized that failure to consider the presence of a vadose zone underlying a CCL can result in significant underestimation of the permeation through the clayey liner, thereby leading to consequential effects to sensitive underground regimes on the event of a contaminant escape from landfills. This consideration is based on the effect of the vadose zone on the permeation through the CCL. It was also noted that hydraulic conductivity of a soil is a function of water content among other factors. Therefore from the results and analysis, the following conclusions were reached:  In the fine textured soils, the vadose zone was observed to have 1 - 2 difference in order of magnitude lesser than the saturated zone; which was conceivably due to the difference in MC, pore-water pressure and density of zones.  The permeation rate for the overall mineral lining system for the vadose and saturated zones were determined as 0.0043×10-6 m3/s and 0.0061×10-5 m3/s after breakthrough was reached respectively.  In the permeability of the overall lining system, the vadose soil zone was found to behave better than the saturated soil zone.  In an event of contaminant breakaway, the vadose zone can function as advective barrier as was the case in the study, as well as an effective diffusive barrier.  The tests revealed the permeability coefficient of the CCL to be the key factor of steady/ quasi steady-state permeation rates through the overall barrier system. In a nutshell, the effect of hydraulic conductivity of the mineral soil as CCL was observed to be highly influential over the tested zones. Hence, it is important that critical considerations be given in the design of a functional mineral lining systems. Finally, the study has significantly established by laboratory simulation of permeation tests that the soil liner contributes a crucial controlling feature for leachate permeation into regimes with consequential effects.

211,"Availability Analysis Of Oil Production Systems  Paul A. Ozor1,2 And Charles Mbohwa1","system effectiveness in crude oil processing industries can be constrained by operational efficiency of the constitutive units. thus ascertaining availability status of all system units can provide decision makers with an effective means of improving the technical performance of complex processing systems. most of the works found in literatures focused on either models specifically for estimation of interval, instantaneous or stationary availability with specific repair distributions or models with mathematical complexities whose underlying assumptions impose ample application constraints to industries. this paper proposes a proof of concept compact generalized model for determination of availability of complex processing industries. the approach is clearly presented as an off-shoot of earlier but independent availability models (lie et al. 1977, ebeling, 2010). the applicability of the models has been illustrated using data obtained from a typical oil company, which will be called x-company for the sake of confidentiality. the unit availability for the studied period as well as mean annual availability of the system can all be computed with the models. the lowest and highest availability values recorded for the units were 0.083 and 0.692 respectively. the mean system availability during the period stood at 0.451. the result shows that the proposed model is a good means of computing system availability. the results have also updated decision makers support tools for system performance improvement.","availability, oil company","A general approach for the determination of availability status of processing plants and allied industries has been proposed in this paper. The method of models formulation is clearly presented as an off-shoot of earlier but independent availability models (Lie et al. 1977, Ebeling, 2010). The applicability of the models has been illustrated on relevant data obtained from a typical X-company. The results were graphically displayed and the significance properly explained. The unit availability for the entire period as well as mean annual availability of the system can all be computed with the models. The lowest and highest availability values recorded were 0.083 and 0.692 respectively at the Kero Hydro-treating unit and second boiler unit. The mean system availability during the study stretch is about 0.451. The result shows that managers and practitioners should embark on urgent availability improvement strategies to improve the functionality and effectiveness of the company. 1287","1department of quality and operations management, university of johannesburg, south africa 2department of mechanical engineering-industrial engineering and management, university of nigeria nsukka, nigeria pozor@uj.ac.za , cmbohwa@uj.ac.za","References

212,Dimensional Analysis Of Natural Vibrations Of Planar  Multilink Flexible Robots With Elastic Constraints At,"non-dimensional variables are very useful as they reduce the number of variables when analyzing physical phenomenon. in this paper, the solutions to the frequency equation of multilink flexible robots with elastic constraints is analyzed in a compact form using the dimensional analysis. first, dimensionless governing differential equation of motion is presented. second, dimensionless boundary conditions are obtained. third, the dimensionless frequency equation and the orthogonality conditions among the mode shapes are derived. fourth, some degenerate cases are developed and compared against some existing models. finally, dimensionless wave numbers are plotted for various joint stiffness ratio to show the influence of various dimensionless parameters on the natural vibrational behavior of the planar multilink flexible robots.","dimensionless, planar, mode, vibration","In this paper, a dimensional analysis for planar multilink robot was performed. For this purpose, some physical dimensionless parameters and variables were defined to express the system physical parameters in a compact form. The general dimensionless frequency equation and boundary conditions were developed. Some degenerate cases were derived and compared against the existing models. The general frequency equation was solved for various dimensionless stiffness values and the results discussed. The results show that the first and second wave numbers decrease when the actual mass and moment at the distal end of flexible links increase. However, when the contribution of mass of distal link is increased, the first wave number decreases while the second wave number increases. The findings from this analysis contribute towards enhancing our understanding of the effects of different physical parameters on the natural vibrations of planar multilink flexible robots.","actuator gearhead shaft–link couplings francis kunzi tekweme department of mechanical and industrial engineering university of johannesburg johannesburg, rsa ftekweme@uj.ac.za",

214,"Effective Management Of Waste Water In Abattoirs  Victor Msimango1, Paul Amaechi Ozor1,2 And Charles Mbohwa1","the driving force behind this research is the disposal of contaminated water in municipal drains by abattoirs in the meat production sector in south africa, while the country’s water crisis remains unabated. the government cannot allow contamination of the little available water. this paper is an attempt to determine an effective management of waste water generated by abattoirs, taking data from a typical abattoir located at ekurhuleni, east of johannesburg. the abattoir slaughters about a hundred and twenty (120) cattle per day and produces about 60m3 of waste water to the effluent plant. its treatment facilities uses mechanical processes for the treatment of the beef waste water. this research adopts a method whereby the waste water sample is collected, and taken to a standard laboratory for analysis. laboratory reagents are then introduced to the partially treated water. flocculation tests were conducted to aid the sedimentation of the undesired substance. the waste water treatment plant at the current status has been found to reduce the chemical oxygen demand (cod) from 7000-6000ppm, conductivity from 7.5 - 5.5 ms/cm, total suspended solids (tss) from 700-650ppm, nitrates from 720-600 ppm, and phosphates from 600-400ppm. some of the reagents used include but not limited to aluminium chlorate, ferriflocc, ferric chloride and polymers. the results show that quality of the mechanically treated water can be improved by reducing the cod by 39%, tss by 58%, phosphates and nitrates by an average of 40% apiece.","abattoir, waste water, contamination, management","The study seem successful since the Chemical reagents applied in the Project proves to be appropriate in the Quality improvement of the abattoir waste water treatment A methodology to optimize the waste water treatment plant of the abattoir at Ekurhuleni east of Johannesburg can be invented to correct the current status quo. The researcher recommends that a clarifier be installed in order for the abattoir waste water treatment plant to practice sedimentation activities in the plant to further improve the waste water Quality.

216,Evaluation Of Chemical Oxygen Demand (Cod) Reduction  In Distillery Wastewater Treatment Using The Photocatalysis,"the photo-catalysis technology has been effective and efficient in the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (cod) in wastewater. titanium dioxide (tio2) is one of the most commonly used photo-catalyst and plays significant a major role in reducing cod concentration levels in wastewater. the polyaniline (pani) was synthesized using an in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. this work focused on the reduction of cod in distillery wastewater using an annular rector under batch mode. the influent was diluted at different concentration levels of about 5 ml/l, 10 ml/l and 20 ml/l. the ph condition was adjusted at ph of 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00 and 5.00 in order to evaluate its effect on the cod reduction efficiencies. the tio2/pani was prepared in different ratios and was allowed to mix with the wastewater for a good homogeneity mixture. the experiments were carried out at ambient temperature (± 25 ºc), whereby solutions were pumped into the photo reactor (annular) inserted with a 25 uvc lamp. the results indicated that the concentrations of all three solutions without the catalyst decreased from 355 mg/l, 655 mg/l and 837 mg/l to 325 mg/l, 572 mg/l and 820 mg/l, respectively. the solutions containing the catalyst also decreased from 325 mg/l, 572 mg/l and 820 mg/l to 344 mg/l, 475 mg/l and 752 mg/l, respectively. the results showed an increasing reduction trend of 2%, 2%, 19%, 20% and 26 % when the catalyst was used at ph of 6.0. it can be concluded that photo-catalysis can reduce cod in distillery wastewater when running under both recirculation and continuous. it can therefore be recommended that higher adjustments of ph can be done, and the process can be operated for more than 2 hours to further enhance the cod reduction in distillery wastewater.","photo-catalysis, industries","and Recommendations 5.1 Conclusions The study was conducted to evaluate the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater using the PANI/TiO2 catalyst. From the experiments conducted, it can be seen that photo-catalysis of distillery wastewater was an efficient process of degrading COD, the results showed the process is effect with and without the addition of a catalyst. However, an addition of a catalyst increases the efficiency. Results showed that the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater can be done using photo-degradation, however, the process requires more processing time and an addition of a catalyst to be efficient. The results obtained the from the 5 ml/l diluted distillery wastewater, for both the solutions (without and with the catalyst) showed no consistence in decrease of the COD concentrations. The results for the 10 ml/l and 20 ml/l diluted distillery wastewater showed a decrease in concentration. Therefore, the UV light had an effect on the concentration with the assistance of the catalyst. One can conclude that pH has a great effect on the reduction of COD, as seen from results in figure 3-5. The results showed COD reduction of 2%, 2%, 19%, 20% and 26 % when pH was adjusted to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively, all operated under the same conditions (room temperature, stirring speed = 360 rpm, pumping speed = 55 ml/min). 5.2 Recommendations Results showed the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater, proving that photo-catalysis is one of the process that can be used to treat this type of effluent. However, the study recommends that the process should be conducted for more than 2 hours and be conducted under isolation (the beaker containing the solution should be closed) to prevent any sort of contamination. In addition, the hypothesized 50% reduction of COD could have been achieved if the pH was adjusted to be more basic (< 7), by observing the obtained results. The result might show a different deviation if the process was conducted in both batch and continuous mode. Due to time constraints and lack of distillery wastewater, the process was conducted only in batch mode. Acknowledgements I like to thank Mr. Thabo Brooms for supervising this project.

217,Effectiveness Of Rea Vaya Bus Rapid Transit System (Brts)  In The City Of Johannesburg,"transport remains connected to our indigenous habitat, wellbeing and monetary thriving which rely upon good transport frameworks that provides effectiveness, comfort, fairness as well as affordability. public transport is often framed as key component of building sustainable cities. nonetheless, present estimations recommend that transport development is unjustifiable. transport intimidates the social, economic, and our environmental future. modifying as well as overseeing patterns of transport shows a critical issue which necessitates collaboration from participants’ at all governmental spheres. the paper presents a critical literature review of the relationship between public transport and sustainability. the paper contributes to transport domain by identifying the key problems associated with sustainability of transport based on the perceptions and discussions of significant literature on transport. the attention is on connection amongst sustainable transport division and the sustainable development within south african setting. outcomes demonstrate that the concept of sustainable transportation has received recognition from the globe and improvement of sustainable transport is evident around the city. this work concludes that sustainable transportation is still a long process for developing countries, as it provides a progression of proposals that are intended to upgrade the execution of the johannesburg transport development and design method, with suggested changes for moving transportation improvement to a sustainable motivation.",public transport,"& Recommendations The city of Johannesburg is still working towards achieving transit oriented development. Be that as it may, the strategy that the city has around the improvement of the corridors of freedom gives chances for transit oriented advancement with blended land use planning. The method of reasoning for the improvement of the BRT framework is to give an accessible, protected, dependable type of transport to the communities (McCaul & Ntuli, 2011). It has been in this investigation that the framework currently isn't open to the larger part of communities in the city. The Phase1b was introduced during the year 2013, and intended to attract more individual from different zones to use public transport, for example, Auckland Park to the down town area. Lack of accessibility is another reasons a number of individuals still utilize their private vehicles to move around; in any case, workers who can't manage the cost of having private cars are then compelled to using informal transport, for example, the taxis which are seen as more available compared to the BRT Rea Vaya. This system has resulted in various difficulties for the private car users as well as taxi business. With the conducting of this investigation the Rea Vaya system had been discovered to be unreachable to the dominant part of the communities within the city. Even though the future strategy of the city demonstrate the BRT Rea Vaya expansion to all zones around the city, the framework still remains inaccessible compared to informal taxis. To be able to attend to these issues it is important to integrate the diverse methods of transport. All together for this system to be cost effective, it is important for the municipality to adopt on friendly integrated fare prices as recommended by Sandra. It can make the system reasonable thus addressing the necessities of the less privileged. The city needs to gain from the achievement and disappointments of the BRT frameworks in the other nations where it has been a success. Maybe the Rea Vaya Management could watch best routine with regards to other transport frameworks in Johannesburg, for example, the Metro Bus and Putco and plan an installed charge installment like that utilized by Metro Bus. The Putco and Metro Bus were regarded as an effective installment technique by members as passengers would only pay their fare on the transport than having to make cards at the station. These buses have been working in the city for a long time, the newly introduced BRT Rea Vaya can gain from the achievement and disappointments of these buses and adopt on them to enhance this framework.","thandekile nqobile khumalo and aurobindo ogra department of town and regional planning faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg beit street, doornfontein 2028 gauteng, south africa thandekilekhumalo64@gmail.com; aogra@uj.ac.za",
218,Evaluating The Energy Efficiency Of Rural Foundry Coal Fired  Furnace Based On Design And Material Selections,"energy efficiency of furnace should be based on its ability to conserve heat within the combustion chamber. this depends mainly on the design and furnace materials selection. the coal fired furnace is common amongst the rural foundries in limpopo province of south africa. the coal fired furnace is used to melt aluminium scraps to cast the three legged aluminium pots commonly used as cooking utensil and sold within the local and national communities. the coal fired furnace is used due to its easy to manufacture, to operate and its low capital and running costs investment which is suitable for small batch production. however, made of a mere superposition of two steel drums, the current coal fired furnaces in rural foundries have long melting time ~ 6 hours, due to the design and material selected in manufacturing the furnace. this paper presents the analysis of design and material components of rural foundries furnaces in south africa and studies the energy efficiency of the coal fired furnace. technical testing of the energy balance through the furnace i.e. energy in and output was conducted. findings show that with a heat loss of 2887.2 mj and an energy efficiency of only 3.37%. the heat loss was one of the main contributions to the experienced long melting duration. the insufficient supply of oxygen or air into coal fuel also plays a critical role in the performance of the furnace, since combustion of coal depends greatly on the supply of oxygen or air. to improve the heat retention and the energy efficiency, a re-design of the coal fired furnace used in the rural foundries and selection of specified new lining materials were introduced.","coal fired furnace, heat loss",,"kulani mageza metal casting technology station, school of mining, metallurgy and chemical engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg kmageza@uj.ac.za antoine f. mulaba-bafubiandi mineral processing and technology research center, department of metallurgy, school of mining, metallurgy and chemical engineering faculty of engineering and the built environment university of johannesburg amulaba@uj.ac.za","References

As such, problems whose have a range of applicable objective functions could benefit from the use of GAs. However performance based on speed showed that the real- coded BBO proffered a better alternative to the projection based GA variant (RCGA-P) in all cases; therefore problems for which convergence is of higher priority could consider BBOs..

221,Performance Investigation And Construction Of A  Traveling Wave Thermo-Acoustic Engine,"the current development of thermo-acoustic devices suggests that there is a possibility to enhance their performance even further. this technology could potentially contribute to the effort to swap conventional pollutant energy refrigerators/generators with environmental friendlier systems in the forthcoming years. the configuration of the regenerator is so far believed to be one of the factor that could contribute to the improvement the performance of the engine. this paper aims to investigate the behaviour of a designed thermo-acoustic engine when changing the porosity of the regenerator. it also aims to provide guidance on the construction, from mostly scrap and cheap materials, of a traveling wave looped-tube thermo- acoustic engine capable of generating higher sound level. the design is conducted using a code program named design environment for low-amplitude thermo-acoustic energy conversion that helps to simulate in fine details the performance of the device. three ceramic substrate blocs of different porosities have been considered as regenerators during the simulation. the results showed that the smaller porosity produced higher acoustic power. the higher performing bloc was subsequently used to develop and test a physical prototype. the constructed looped-tube thermo-acoustic engine produced a sound level of 121.4 decibel, just above the minimum auditory pain threshold.","thermo-acoustic, traveling-wave, engine, looped-tube",This work has analysed the performance of a looped tube thermo-acoustic engine with a main focus of providing clarity on the influence of the regenerator’s geometrical parameters on the performance of the device.
