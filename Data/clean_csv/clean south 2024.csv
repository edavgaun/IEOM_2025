1,5Th South American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Sa05.20240016,"tackling the reduction of carbon footprints in global supply chains presents a significant challenge for many companies, driven by tighter governmental emission standards and increasing environmental consciousness among consumers. therefore, it is crucial to incorporate carbon emissions considerations into supply chain management strategies. this work focuses on supply mode selection for a company that deals with a variety of products, each subject to periodic stochastic demand, with unfulfilled orders being backlogged. the products can be supplied through multiple distinct supply modes, each characterized by its own carbon emission levels, delivery speed, and cost implications. the company needs to allocate order quantities to each supply mode to minimize the costs associated with holding, backlogging, and purchasing, while also ensuring that the carbon emissions from these activities do not exceed a certain limit. we present a novel solution method for this problem, and benchmark it against other methods that are less sophisticated in a comprehensive numerical analysis.","inventory, sustainability, carbon emissions, planning",,"reducing carbon emissions in supply chains melvin drent school of industrial engineering eindhoven university of technology eindhoven, the netherlands m.drent@tue.nl",
2,5Th South American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Sa05.20240017,"efficiency in companies is an important factor to calculate because it is the key number that makes it easier to have a clearer image of how the company works and what results its operation is providing, especially in companies in the commercial sector that always have constant on real time production, so they are constantly searching for new clients and new guidelines to compete with other companies in the same sector. in this research, the central problem identified is related to the efficiency of the production process, which originates mainly due to the lack of standard procedures, a correct order in the production area and the absence of adequate maintenance on the machine used in printing plastic bottles. with the aim of implementing a continuous improvement model, various lean methodologies will be applied, such as standardized work, slp and autonomous maintenance along with various statistical tools that allowed us to reach the expected results. these techniques were implemented throughout two improvement cycles to optimize the production of plastic bottles and maximize efficiency, achieving important changes in the main kpis outlined in our research going from 74% to 82% of efficiency during the labelling of the plastic bottles, giving us 9% more of the projected profits, reducing costs and increasing monthly sales. therefore, this article seeks to determine what are the necessary improvements that must be implemented to increase productivity in the production area of a company in the commercial sector.","efficiency, standardized work","As evidenced by the financial flow, revenue was calculated based on the average number of customers projected for the first month, as observed in the field during the month of October. In addition, it is estimated that the number of customers will gradually increase month-on-month by 0.90% as the proposal is implemented. By calculating the Net Present Value (NPV), it was assessed whether the investment in the project was favorable or if, on the contrary, investment was not recommended. The NPV yielded a value of 5,576,532, which is greater than zero, indicating that the project will generate a higher return than the opportunity cost of the funds invested. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) was also calculated, which reached a value of 197%, meaning that it exceeds the opportunity cost. Regarding the Benefit/Cost indicator, a value of 64.22 was obtained, and since it is higher than 1, it is concluded that the project's income will exceed the expenses. Finally, as far as the Payback Period is concerned, this indicator determines the time needed for the company to recoup its investment. In this case, the S/4,730 invested will be recovered in a certain number of days (Table 6). Table 6. Analysis of economic indicators ECONOMIC INDICATORS VNA 5 576 532 IRR E 197% B/C 64.22 PR 0.809 After the respective studies and having applied the engineering tools, our efficiency will increase by 9%, which will positively impact our sales, also increasing our operating profit, generating a very good impact on the company's finances, also taking into account This is still recovering from the year 2020, 2021 and 2022 where its sales fell to negative since schools did not attend in-person classes so parents did not buy plastic bottles or any school supplies. Therefore, in addition to the fact that the company was already in recovery, our improvements have encouraged it to be strengthened and consolidated. In summary, the SLP tool as such and the reorganization of the area that was carried out, favored the new order and how the operators were organized to carry out their tasks since the scope they had improved their times. On the other hand, the manuals and training implemented under standardized work tools have complemented the operators with years of experience in the company and the new income that has come to the company to support with the campaign and with the orders that arrive during these months of the year. Finally, the Autonomous Maintenance tool has allowed the machines used to stop fewer times during a workday and this makes work more fluid, more plastic bottles are produced during a work hour and therefore more boxes come out. a day, thus fulfilling more work orders and meeting the needs of the main clients of the largest retailers in the country. It should be considered in future research or when the subject is dealt with more thoroughly, perhaps to try new tools or even an attempted sand run or some simulation program of the thermal transmission machine. Also, it should be recommended that the company improve the issue of soils as it limits help with the issue of the redistribution of its production area, in addition to being a time bomb with respect to rollover type accidents. On the part of this study, it could be improved with respect to the time that has been given to this report, since probably with a little more time invested, more information could have been collected and more staff trained, which would have made them even more efficient. It is recommended that, in future projects based on this or similar development, key performance indicators (KPIs) should be continuously monitored to assess the efficiency of production areas and detect possible improvements in 26","production management model for increase efficiency by applying lean manufacturing tools as standardized work, autonomous maintenance and slp in a plastic bottle company ana maria meza-cardenas and jorge antonio corzo-chávez facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima, perú 20184677@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, jacorzo@ulima.edu.pe","references for companies

On the other hand, after seeing the results of the implementation of the pilot test, during the months of August and September, of the tools to improve the manufacturing process, it can be concluded that with the implementation an improvement was achieved in the level of efficiency. An average of 8% raw material waste (5.5% less) and effective production time (5.2% more) was achieved. Furthermore, by obtaining results of the indicators above those expected, we can conclude that the project generates economic benefits for the company, by increasing the level of efficiency by 17%. 39","production management model to increase efficiency in the cotton garment manufacturing process applying mps kaizen and smed tools in a sme in the textile sector juan sebastian naranjo-torres, pablo benjamin izaguirre-bendezu and jorge antonio corzo-chavez carrera de ingeniería industrial facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima lima, perú 20182956@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20180946@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, jacorzo@ulima.edu.pe","References

An activity where product data is entered into the system, processing 20 entries at a time. This task takes time following a normal distribution with a mean of 8 minutes and a standard deviation of 2 minutes. The information is also input into the WMS for further processing and to facilitate product location within the warehouse. This activity takes time following a normal distribution with a mean of 5 minutes and a standard deviation of 2 minutes. 2. For the picking process, the same tool is utilized. Orders arrive every 2 hours throughout a day, within an 8- hour shift over 6 days. Upon receiving the order, the picking list is printed, taking time following a normal distribution with a mean of 5 minutes and a standard deviation of 2 minutes. Subsequently, the operators review the optimal route according to the WMS for picking the required products, which takes them 5 minutes. Once the route is established, the 3 operators retrieve their baskets for picking, which takes them an average time of 20 minutes. 3. The same 3 operators then pack everything into a box and proceed with the packaging process, which takes time following a normal distribution with a mean of 10 minutes and a standard deviation of 2 minutes.

This analysis pinpointed low production efficiency issues caused by delays in fabric roll inspection, piece labeling, and bag removal from the cutting area. The SMED methodology was applied via simulation using the Arena program, resulting in optimal outcomes after 30 iterations. This process showcased reduced total production time per order through decreased setup times, achieved by transitioning external activities to internal ones. Additionally, productivity increased, reaching 3.45 garments/day without SMED and 4.81 garments/day with SMED. Moreover, two key performance indicators, machine efficiency and operator saturation during non-machine time and internal activities, were evaluated to assess the tool's efficacy. Machine efficiency approached 100%, while operator saturation indicated enhanced resource utilization, with an increase of up to 39.43%. Economically, three indicators were examined: NPV, indicating project profitability when exceeding 0; IRR, with a value of 719%, suggesting project acceptance due to its positive value; and the Benefit-Cost ratio, resulting in a value of 25, confirming the project's viability by demonstrating that benefits outweigh costs. In terms of applicability to similar textile companies, our study's findings highlight the potential for enhancing efficiency and productivity through SMED implementation.

Exploratory research is vital for producing new knowledge and understanding, particularly in under-researched areas or where specific research problems lack definitive answers(Van Cauter et al., 2014). It is important to recognize the limitations of this type of research. These limitations include the use of unvalidated scales, small sample sizes, and undefined populations, all of which can affect the reliability and generalizability of the findings(Jansen et al., 2006). Furthermore, exploratory research is broad in scope and seldom provides conclusive answers to specific research questions, thereby limiting its conclusiveness. Despite the limitations in the research design, the findings provide insights for property owners interested in using their properties as guesthouses or improving them. 154","factors considered by holiday makers in selecting a guesthouse in the post-covid-19 pandemic era bheki b.s makhanya postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the build environment university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa bsm3174@yahoo.com","References

18,5Th South American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Sa05.20240042,"this project aims to propose a simulation-optimization model for enhancing service efficiency at a coffee shop branch located in a business district in mexico city. issues related to customer waiting times and service are addressed through simulation in simio software and the analysis of data collected from the coffee shop. the simulation is conducted considering three different scenarios based on the queue theory approach, encompassing one with real-world data (pure), one accounting for rush hours, and another utilizing the opt-quest simio optimizer. this approach allows the assessment of the branch's service capacity and proposes improvements in staff distribution. upon obtaining simulation results, the bottleneck is identified at the checkout counter, pinpointing areas for improvement to optimize the model. the findings indicate that during rush hours, both waiting time and total time within the system significantly increase. an optimization of the system is proposed, by varying the number of cashiers and baristas to minimize the average total customer time in the branch while increasing customer throughput. the optimal option involves hiring three cashiers and three baristas during rush hours, resulting in a 40% reduction in waiting time simulation results.","simulation, optimization, queue theory, simio software","In conclusion, the simulation yielded insights into the time customers spend at the Starbucks branch, including both at the Checkout Counter and in the Barista Station. It was observed that the waiting time during a rush hour was significantly higher compared to a regular demand schedule. Furthermore, it was identified that the bottleneck was situated at the Checkout Counter. Leveraging the obtained results and observations, the Opt-Quest optimizer within Simio was employed to analyze the behavior of output variables with various combinations of baristas and cashiers, and the optimization was compared against the rush hour scenario. Ultimately, simulation provides alternatives and proposals to enhance system functionality, thereby meeting the established requirements. As examined in the literature, various methodologies exist for analyzing system dynamics. Nevertheless, object-oriented approaches prove beneficial, facilitating the uncovering of insights concerning expected queue performance indicators. Similarly, simulations carried out using Simio Software enable us to assess bottlenecks based on the corresponding Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). 202","simulation-optimization of a coffee shop in business district: a case study of starbucks in mexico city dylan buzali, santiago elizondo and santiago muñiz students, industrial engineering department engineering school universidad iberoamericana, mexico city mexico city, mexico buzalicheremdylan@gmail.com, santiaeliz12@gmail.com, santiagomunizal@gmail.com oroselfia sánchez professor, industrial engineering department engineering school universidad iberoamericana, mexico city mexico city, mexico oroselfia.sanchez@ibero.mx","References

The number of contributions per year would naturally increase as the industry tries to recover from the effects of the pandemic. Similarly, countries heavily impacted by the pandemic would search for new tools and resources to improve their performance in the affected sectors. China is a prime example of such a country. This article analyzed the more frequently used models for forecasting tourism demand within a base of 40 articles. The following conclusions in relation to the tools reviewed were reached: statistical models, such as ARIMA, ANN and SARIMA, as well as models based on artificial intelligence, such as SVR, RFR and LSTM, happen to be the most useful when forecasting tourism demand. Likewise, there is evidence that the models can be improved, if they are implemented with a model from the other category, as such being a hybrid model. This partnering of models has been proven to be more effective than both categories on their own, achieving a more accurate forecast of the demand. A few recommendations for future research are the use of a sample bigger than 40 articles, to obtain more accurate results as to which models are the most frequently used when forecasting tourism demand. Finally, an important recommendation when it comes to analyzing forecasting models, is to consider the inclusion of multiple variables such as economic, political and social events. Because if not, the analysis would end up reaching the wrong conclusion.","forecasting models used in the tourism sector: a systematic review of literature guillermo huapaya and aiko makino facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima lima, peru 20194779@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20193026@aloe.ulima.edu.pe juan manuel machuca de pina professor, facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima lima, peru jmachuca@ulima.edu.pe",
21,5Th South American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Sa05.20240046,"the present work focuses on the cell formation problem (cfp), which groups machines to get several benefits, including productivity improvement, reduced tooling needs, reduced setup time, and reduced manufacturing lead time. in modern manufacturing systems, equipment availability is an important requirement, as it ensures a higher possibility of utilizing productive resources, which are usually of high value. therefore, the incorporation of reliability aspects into cell formation algorithms becomes necessary. various researchers currently consider reliability based on individual machine failures. however, this overlooks a crucial factor, the systemic approach of clustering, in other words, the reliability of the entire production line. since for the system to function correctly, all participating machines must be operational. so far, an approach considering the cell as a production line and taking its reliability as a whole into account has not been found. this work proposes an optimization model that incorporates machine reliability, considering the equipment as a production line. to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, an example is given and compared with an existing model. the results show that there is a considerable cost difference between the new model and the old model. the latter will allow us to detect uncalculated costs that can be very detrimental to the correct formation of the cells.","reliability, cycle time","A successfully developed mathematical model has been proposed to address the challenge of manufacturing cell formation, incorporating considerations regarding alternative routes, repair times, and route reliability. To achieve this, a mathematical function was formulated that integrates and applies a penalty to repair time, and reliability constraints were established to ensure that the routes selected in the model meet certain reliability standards. Model validation was conducted using an exhaustive search methodology, employing a case study adapted from the literature, where the obtained results were compared with existing data to assess effectiveness and applicability in real-world scenarios. Among the obtained results, it is noteworthy that the model provides a significantly better solution ($6950.86) than the overall average of all combinations ($734774.74). Additionally, these results underscore the importance of avoiding cost omissions when using other models, which could negatively impact companies relying on incomplete results for decision-making. Finally, as a future research direction, applying the model to multiple periods is suggested, as certain parameters such as demand and failure and repair rates may change over time and require ongoing evaluation. 236","optimization model for cell formation problem incorporating systemic reliability paulo r. figueroa torrez escuela de ingeniería industrial pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso valparaíso, chile paulo.figueroa.t@mail.pucv.cl orlando m. durán acevedo escuela de ingeniería mecánica pontificia universidad católica de valparaíso valparaíso, chile orlando.duran@pucv.cl","References

27,5Th South American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Sa05.20240066,"as businesses worldwide strive to improve their productivity, companies in underdeveloped countries like bolivia face significant challenges in enhancing their manufacturing capabilities, quality, and competitiveness. to overcome these challenges, new technologies and methods must be explored. this paper proposes applying the factory physics methodology to improve productivity in a bolivian brick manufacturing firm. in pursuit of this goal, the study analyzed the production line using time and motion study techniques, applying factory physics principles, and performing computer simulations. the analysis revealed that implementing process controls and measures guided by factory physics significantly improved the manufacturing system's performance, resulting in an increased throughput rate, reduced work in process, and decreased cycle time. these findings demonstrate the vast potential and adaptability of factory physics in significantly enhancing manufacturing systems' performance in underdeveloped countries.",productivity,"This study investigated the effectiveness of Factory Physics in improving production systems in developing countries. A Bolivian brick manufacturing company served as the case study. Focusing on a specific production line, researchers employed a time study, Factory Physics principles, and computer simulations to develop and validate improvement proposals. Analysis revealed significant inefficiencies. The line exhibited high CT, excessive WIP, and low TH, all indicators of poor productivity. Furthermore, operator activities included high levels of non-value-adding activities, such as waiting, idle, transportation times. Three improvement proposals were formulated: • Reduction of activities that do not add value to the production process. • Reduction of idle time of operators in the production line (line balancing). • Reduction of variability with thermocouples in the burning process (measurement and standardization). The implemented improvements yielded positive results. Product flow through the production process was optimized, with less waiting time and more dedicated to actual production. Operator efficiency also improved, reducing waiting, idle, and transport times by 17,04% and 35,76%, respectively. Conversely, working and necessary product transport time increased by 25,67% and 37,79%, respectively, indicating a more productive workforce. Moreover, Factory Physics metrics also reflected significant improvements and a decrease in variability. TH rose by 501 units per shift, CT decreased by 20,93%, and WIP dropped by 10,44%. These results demonstrate a notable increase in production output and efficiency, achieved with minimal resource investment. This study aligns with the findings of Herbas & Enriquez (2023), highlighting the potential of Factory Physics to enhance productivity in developing countries. The methodology improves understanding of production line dynamics and facilitates proposing cost-effective improvements. Given the resource constraints often faced by companies in developing countries, Factory Physics offers a systematic approach to identifying high-impact improvements using existing resources. This research promotes a deeper understanding of Factory Physics as a valuable tool for production improvement in these contexts, emphasizing the importance of ""working smarter, not harder"" (Jesus Romero).","enhancing manufacturing brick production performance in bolivia: leveraging factory physics and simulation for increased efficiency mariana sánchez-larrea bolivian industrial research and development group cochabamba, bolivia mariana.sanchez.ss20@gmail.com boris christian herbas-torrico tecnológico de monterrey guadalajara, méxico boris.herbas@tec.mx",
28,5Th South American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Sa05.20240067,"productivity is essential for organizational success, yet manufacturing systems often struggle to optimize resource utilization. this challenge is amplified in countries like bolivia, where resource and technological limitations create additional barriers. this study addresses this issue by examining how a bolivian food company leveraged factory physics methodology and simulation software to enhance its manufacturing layout and performance. the company pursued three goals: machine redistribution, reduced transport operations, and increased production capacity. results from the redesign were compelling, including reduced operator travel distance, optimized machine footprint, decreased work-in-progress, shortened cycle times, and a significant boost in production rates. this study offers valuable evidence that factory physics and simulation tools can be powerful assets for companies seeking to overcome productivity challenges, particularly in resource-constrained environments.","factory physics, simulation, plant layout","This research investigated the effectiveness of combining Factory Physics methodology with simulation software for improving production processes in developing countries. The study focused on a Bolivian food company, aiming to optimize its layout and production efficiency. The initial phase involved a thorough analysis of the existing production process, including a time study to establish standard operation times necessary for the simulation model. Three improvement suggestions were then formulated using Factory Physics principles and simulated using software. These proposals targeted enhancements in both layout and overall process performance. The results convincingly indicate that significant improvements can be achieved without resorting to complex methodologies or sophisticated software. This is particularly relevant for companies in developing countries like Bolivia, where limited technological resources often hinder growth. The study highlights the power of readily accessible tools like Factory Physics and simulation, which, when implemented effectively, can yield significant benefits. A common misconception is that simply increasing production capacity solves all problems. However, as this research demonstrates, achieving true optimization requires a deeper understanding. Factory Physics and simulation provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating the entire production process, analyzing the interaction between components, and pinpointing areas for improvement. This holistic approach ensures that interventions address the root causes of problems, leading to sustainable improvements. The case study confirms the value of combining Factory Physics and simulation to enhance layout and performance in companies located in developing countries. Furthermore, it suggests the broader applicability of these tools to analyze and improve not just individual production lines but the entire production system. The study acknowledges limitations. Focusing on a single production line presented an opportunity for in-depth analysis, but future research could explore industries with multiple interconnected processes, examining the complex interactions between them. 309","improving manufacturing layout: a bolivian food company's experience with factory physics and simulation boris christian herbas-torrico tecnologico de monterrey guadalajara, méxico boris.herbas@tec.mx oscar roberto luján-sainz bolivian industrial research and development group cochabamba, bolivia oscar.lujan.sainz@gmail.com","References

(1993)","Considering the results obtained in the bibliometric analysis, it is possible to see the relevance of developing new studies and technologies aimed at innovation in the beekeeping sector. The results obtained throughout this study made it possible to identify 57 documents related to the terms under study. Identifying the countries with the greatest scientific production in this field and analyzing the network of co-citations and authorship between authors and institutions helps to identify trends, gaps in the literature, and possibilities for collaboration in future research. The results made it possible to identify a predominance of publications in countries with a tropical climate, which is suggested to be related to the local climate and the difficulties they may face compared to other countries. In addition, the species' biodiversity in these countries' fauna and flora contribute to more research to take advantage of these factors for greater production in the beekeeping sector. The results suggest that using bibliometric analysis to identify characteristics, patterns, and existing products is relevant when considering innovation and beekeeping. However, it should be noted that bibliometric analysis is insufficient to answer all questions related to the scientific understanding of a field of study, requiring systematic reviews to map themes, study methodologies, and emerging issues in each field. Comparing the results of bibliometric analysis with the previous literature, in general, the literature allows us to validate the elements of economic growth, especially for developing countries, as well as the sustainability issues, demands for technology development, and a change perception need for boosting the apiculture practice on rural areas around the world. Technology issues, such as the main high-tech solutions offered for beekeepers, are not highlighted once the scientific discussion encompasses a whole view of the effective adoption of beekeeping in rural areas. Other products beyond honey, such as wax, propolis, or even organic honey or geographically originated honey, are not addressed, and even discussions regarding economic valuation for beekeeping activities are not well reported. Production planning and control for beekeeping in other countries are not reported in the scientific literature analyzed, which can be understood as a validation for the Brazilian reports that suggested this economic occupation is weakly systematized, almost working on an extractivist basis. The demand for more innovation and technology for beekeeping is highlighted in the literature analyzed. We detected diverse proposals but no reports on the utilization and impact. Empirical research is needed to gain a broader and deeper understanding of the complex synergies in any innovation- related environment. Therefore, it is important that there is more research on the topic and that they carry out a deeper analysis to improve the understanding of the role of innovation in promoting economic and sustainable development in beekeeping. Furthermore, the findings highlight the importance of international collaboration in research related to the topic once few coupling and co-citation networks exist. As a limitation of the study, it is important to highlight that the analyses cannot be generalized, as the sample and search were based on one specific database. Additionally, only the most cited authors were analyzed, with prospects for future work with the systematic study of the entire database collected in the research.

With respect to the above, response capacity is not the dimension with the greatest impact; The dimension with the greatest impact is the one with reliability, having the highest negative value of the weighted gaps. The dimension with the greatest gap is security with a negative value, which means that it is what the company objectively fails the most. The dimension most valued by customers is reliability, which is why the worst valued dimension of the company, security, is not the one that most negatively impacts the quality offered by the service. Within the security dimension, it is observed that, according to the individual score per question, the company's workers do not present sufficient knowledge to react to customer questions, generating insecurity in the service provided. Compared to Baffour-Awuah (2018) study, in both cases the dimension that has the least positive impact is that of tangibles, which could be an indication of a standard in the HVAC maintenance sector, on the other hand, it was found that the tangible dimension is the best qualified, which translates into a bad focus and waste of resources in Improve the tangibles of the sector. Both studies highlight the importance of reliability and security as critical dimensions in assessing service quality in the HVAC maintenance sector. These findings suggest the need for companies in the sector to prioritize improving reliability and security in their services to enhance customer satisfaction and maintain a competitive edge in the market. It is suggested to future studies aligned with the proposed, the formulation of improvement solutions for the sector and the development of key performance indicators focused on the proposed solution.","importance of responsiveness in the quality of service in an hvac maintenance company in metropolitan lima applying the servqual model anthony allen jaimes villa and juan diego oscco moreno carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, peru anthonyjaimesvilla@gmail.com ; jdosccomoreno@gmail.com josé antonio taquía gutiérrez instituto de investigación científica universidad de lima lima, peru jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe juan manuel machuca de pina carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, peru jmachuca@ulima.edu.pe","references

Finally, in the Security dimension, the item with the smallest gap (-0.57) is ""You received quick and efficient service 
from the company's employees."" This suggests that respondents perceived the service delivery by company employees 
to be relatively quick and efficient, aligning well with their expectations. However, the item with the largest gap (-
0.91) is ""The behavior of the company's personnel conveys confidence to you."" This indicates a significant difference 
between respondents' expectations and their perception of the confidence conveyed by company personnel. This 
difference might stem from variations in the demeanor or professionalism of personnel across different interactions 
or contexts. 
 
It was observed that the gap with the greatest deficit was security and the dimension of tangible elements was the best 
scored. However, using the weight of the dimensions, it was observed that the dimension that most negatively 
influenced the quality-of-service index was the reliability dimension, but not the security dimension as seen with 
normal gaps. This is because the reliability dimension has a greater weight for customers, this being the greatest 
weakness of the company's service. On the other hand, according to the weighted gaps, the dimension with the best 
results was the dimension of tangible elements; This being its strong point. 
 
In the current study, it was found that the item with the largest negative gap is item #19, belonging to the security 
dimension, with a gap of -13.49. This aligns with Baffour-Awuah (2018) finding regarding the importance of security 
as a critical dimension in assessing service quality. However, while Baffour-Awuah (2018) study does not provide 
specific information about the performance of the security dimension relative to other dimensions, in the current study 
it is observed that despite the security dimension having the largest gap, it is the reliability dimension that most 
negatively influences the service quality index, with a gap of -15.69, according to the weight assigned by customers. 
 
Additionally, in both studies, the tangible elements dimension yielded the best results in terms of gaps. In the current 
study, the item with the smallest gap in this dimension was ""Material elements were visually attractive and

This methodology attempts to integrate the insights from the pan's formation into a comprehensive dynamic framework modeling nonlinear strain behavioral patterns for the evaluation of sinking tools. Through meticulous simulations, a discernible relationship emerges between the displacement and strain of the blank, revealing insights into the dynamic characteristics of the pan manufacturing process. The focus on dimple depth and strains provides an understanding that serves as the root of the study's contribution to the standardization of the pan. The core of the methodology involves a meticulous examination of the impact of varying hammer diameters on the performance of a steel sheet. This investigation yields valuable information crucial for the design and optimization of sinking hammers, with a specific aim to achieve desired strain regimes essential in pan sinking. The controlled impact forces, coupled with the variations in hammer diameters, generate a dataset for selecting the most suitable hammer diameter, offering practical and applicable insights for the pan industry. The methodology as a guide for the pan industry should foster a culture for precision and efficiency in crafting pans. The intention through the lens of this methodology was to encourage the advancement and continued application of science and engineering in pan. To enhance the hammer’s performance in terms of diameter, strategic opportunities for improvement can be explored. Firstly, a thorough evaluation of the hammer’s design, especially for larger contact diameters, becomes critical. This entails refining the shape and composition to mitigate erratic strain reactions observed at a 100 mm diameter. Adjustments to the profile or surface modifications may help minimize frictional forces during the hammer’s descent onto the blank. Secondly, optimizing impact dynamics would be essential for achieving a smoother and more predictable strain response. Fine-tuning weight distribution, surface finish, or impact angles could ensure a more uniform strain distribution across the sheet. Lastly, insights from the sensitivity analysis using the Taguchi method together with the Analysis of Variance Method can inform targeted enhancements in the hammer design, considering factors affecting the variables that significantly influence strain behavior. By systematically adjusting parameters based on these insights, the goal would be to achieve a more consistent and efficient sinking process.","steelpan sinking quality approach employing dynamic nonlinear finite element method peter poon chong department of mechanical and manufacturing engineering faculty of engineering st. augustine, trinidad and tobago, west indies peter.poonchong@sta.uwi.edu terrence r.m. lalla department of mechanical and manufacturing engineering faculty of engineering st. augustine, trinidad and tobago, west indies terrence.lalla@sta.uwi.edu",

The investigation comprised static analysis and modal analysis to evaluate the structural and dynamic characteristics of both materials. The obtained results provided valuable insights into the behaviour of the driveshafts under various loading and vibration conditions. In the static analysis, the total deformation, equivalent stress, equivalent elastic strain, and maximum shear stress were compared between Aluminum Alloy 7075 and Steel SM45C. The results revealed that Aluminum Alloy 7075 exhibited higher total deformation, equivalent stress, and equivalent elastic strain compared to Steel SM45C. However, the maximum shear stress was also higher in Aluminum Alloy 7075. These findings indicate that the Aluminum Alloy driveshaft experienced more deformation and stress under the applied loads, potentially affecting its overall structural integrity. Modal analysis was performed to investigate the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the driveshaft materials. The natural frequencies are crucial indicators of the driveshaft's ability to withstand dynamic loading conditions. The results indicated that both materials had different natural frequencies across multiple modes. Steel SM45C displayed slightly lower natural frequencies compared to Aluminum Alloy 7075 in most modes.

Interpretation of the data suggests that the proposal is financially viable. Likewise, the Benefit-Cost calculation indicates that the project would return 1.25 soles of net benefit for each sole spent, which would reinforce financial viability. The payback period is set at 2 years and 16 days, which indicates an effective return on investment. The NPV and IRR suggest that the project is profitable, with positive values and the second indicator being much higher than the discount rate. Using inventory management methods like EOQ and Lean Manufacturing to increase efficiency and profitability in a barbecue chicken restaurant is wise. The data supports the project's ability to generate long-term benefits while providing an optimal return on investment. Likewise, the recovery of the investment and the IRR demonstrate the financial solidity of the project. These data reinforce the hypothesis that improving inventory management and implementing efficient review procedures to avoid stock outages are essential for the long-term performance of companies in the food service industry. On the other hand, the application of Lean practices has demonstrated significant improvements in workflow during restaurant operations. This is due to the reorganization of the spaces in the warehouse, focusing them on activities that generate value in the product, and consequently in the sale. Additionally, a notable decrease in work interruptions was observed. Consequently, Lean tools have provided substantial value in the management of inputs in the poultry warehouse. In the case of value flow mapping, workers are now aligned to the same process of purchasing and receiving inputs. Thus, resulting in greater alert and monitoring of when the delivery of supplies would be made, and having everything ready for their correct reception and allocation in the warehouses. Finally, it is concluded that by applying correct inventory management using the demand driven planning methodology, stock shortages are not incurred, and in this way no lost sales are generated for the restaurant.","inventory management optimization model in a restaurant applying inventory control and lean manufacturing juan carlos bustamante sosa facultad de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, perú 20190304@aloe.ulima.edu.pe fabrizio joaquín salazar pérez facultad de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, perú 20193407@aloe.ulima.edu.pe richard meza ortiz senior lecturer facultad de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, peru",

The optimal lead-time may not be consistent with the traditional seasons anticipated in the region, an expected disruption due to climate change. Therefore, it is prudent to forecast drought conditions at lower lead times like 1 month due to the erratic rainfall patterns being experienced generally. This is in line with Felsche and Ludwig (2021)’s findings on the importance of seasonality. With substantial variabilities in the drought experiences of different regions, wetter regions are more susceptible to drought than drier regions, necessitating region-specific pricing of products and region inclusivity as a risk-pooling tool. Mokhtar et al. (2021) shared similar sentiments, highlighting that AI models’ performance would improve when applied using a localized approach. The study's results may also be used to establish region-specific underwriting by manipulating SPI value thresholds and designing localized products.","ai-based drought forecasting for parametric insurance malcolm tanyaradzwa mathende, belinda ndlovu and sibusisiwe dube national university of science and technology, bulawayo, zimbabwe p.o box ac939, ascot, bulawayo, zimbabwe mathendemt@yahoo.com, belinda.ndlovu@nust.ac.zw, sibusisiwe.dube@nust.ac.zw martin muduva department of information and marketing science midlands state university gweru, zimbabwe mmuduvah@gmail.com fungai jacqueline chairperson ict and electronics department school of engineering science and technology chinhoyi university of technology fungaijacquelinekiwa@gmail.com",

Specifically, the study reveals that composite molds exhibit a remarkable reduction in mold production time by 38.98% and a substantial cost saving of 44.24% when compared to traditional molds. These findings underscore the operational benefits and cost-effectiveness associated with adopting composite molds in manufacturing operations. Moreover, one notable advantage highlighted in the study is the reproducibility of composite molds. Unlike traditional molds, composite molds can be easily reproduced if the master plug remains in good condition. This capability eliminates the need to invest in new raw materials for each reproduction, further reducing production costs and enhancing resource utilization. The study highlights that for the same budget allocated to mold production, manufacturers have the potential to produce two composite molds in contrast to only one aluminum mold. This dual capacity for composite molds translates into increased production output, reduced waiting times, and enhanced manufacturing efficiency.","a study of ltc410 composite mold system to improve mold manufacturing process in aerospace industry phongchai jittamai and kanin rungrattanachavala school of industrial engineering institute of engineering suranaree university of technology nakhon ratchasima, 30000, thailand jittamai@sut.ac.th, m6302405@g.sut.ac.th",

The bending angle of the operators is inadequate for the type of work performed (mixing, cutting, and baking). Production activities posing an ergonomic risk are mixing, cutting, and baking. This was identified using the REBA and RULA techniques, which indicate that mixing poses a high risk, followed by cutting with a medium risk, similar to baking. In the case of mixing, it is recommended to intervene at the station as soon as possible. Anthropometric data of the operators were obtained, allowing for a proposal for improvement considering the results of REBA and RULA. Thus, if the improvement proposal is implemented, it could prevent the development of musculoskeletal disorders as each station adapts to the anthropometric measurements of the operators. Through the Nordic questionnaire, the main ailments of operators during the production process were identified, which are hands (100%), followed by the elbow (85.71%), and lastly the shoulders (71.43%). Among the limitations for future research are the time and cost of implementing ergonomic designs in the machines, since specialized labor is required to guarantee correct installation. Also, data collection during the production process can affect worker performance. Research could be conducted on the effectiveness of worker ergonomics training to improve work practices, increase productivity, and reduce the cost of personal injury. The application of REBA, RULA, and the Nordic questionnaire allowed us to recognize the discomfort of the operators and, consequently, identify activities with a higher ergonomic risk.

Conclusion After the application of the SMED tool in the following work, the following conclusions were obtained: It is feasible to use Lean Manufacturing methodology to improve bakery productivity. It is demonstrated that the use of the SMED tool reduces the processing time per shift by 98.53 minutes, making it an acceptable practice for reducing food productions times. As a consequence, labour and electricity costs are reduced. Through the application of the SMED tool, an increase in the man-hour unit of the work performed by the operator on bread production is evidenced. It is possible to make an additional car of bread as long as there is an additional consumption public to the one that exists the bakery. It is essential to have protective equipment throughout the production of bread, because there are processes in which without the use of these it is not possible to perform them. Another contribution was to be able to provide flexibility to adapt to changes in demand, respecting the time limits. In this way it will be possible to obtain an immediate response to any new situation. The impact of the following scientific article will be of help to many small and medium sized companies in the bakery sector to improve their bread production processes because the research is focused on this target audience that do not have the necessary resources to acquire more modern machines and have limited budgets for personnel. From the following research, the use of the baker's man-hour and machine-hour estimation unit of the machines will be optimized, thus decreasing the bread production time, labor and electricity costs. In addition, this model will be able to meet variations in customer demand without affecting the productivity of the bakery. To take advantage of the work presented, it is important to collect the exact time taken by each baker in a bread production shift and validate it through automation and event simulation software. In this way, the application of any Lean Manufacturing tool will have more accurate results, for the desired improvements. It is important to always receive feedback from the customer to know their experience in the service provided if it meets the expectations and thus identify areas for improvement and process readjustments.","implementation of lean manufacturing smed and value stream mapping tools to increase productivity in a bakery company jimmy andré cárdenas peña and jhoel oswaldo veliz veliz universidad de lima industrial engineering lima, peru 20130235@aloe.ulima.edu.pe ; 20174022@aloe.ulima.edu.pe",

The operational practices implemented in logistics services companies in the Cartagena context during the last five years (2018-2023) were identified and analyzed, with the purpose of establishing a roadmap to strengthen operations management and competitiveness in this sector. The findings of this research highlight the importance of operational practices, such as Theory of Constraints (TOC), Lean Services, and Six Sigma, in improving the efficiency and quality of logistics services. Through the systematic review supported by the Gavilán model, it was evidenced that these practices have generated positive impacts in the reduction of delivery times, the increase in efficiency in warehouses, the decrease in transport costs and the improvement in the quality of service in various areas of logistics companies. including profitability, quality and productivity. The unique contribution of this research lies in its comprehensive approach to understanding and evaluating operational practices in the specific context of logistics service companies in Cartagena. By using the Gavilán model, an adequate structuring of the information collected was achieved, which allowed the identification of patterns in the adoption of operational practices, focus on continuous improvement, use of technology, organizational culture to give trends and areas for improvement in a clear and organized way to companies in the logistics sector. In addition, this research provides a solid basis for strategic decision-making in the logistics sector. The recommendations derived from this study, such as the strengthening of the Six Sigma methodology, TOC, Lean service and the implementation of ICT that offer logistics service companies in Cartagena a clear path towards continuous improvement and competitiveness in a dynamic and challenging business environment.","operations management in servuccion systems in logistics service companies: a systematic review keily andrea caez rojas ciptec research group – tips research incubator. faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias, colombia keilycaezr@tecnocomfenalco.edu.co ronaldo nieto trespalacios ciptec research group – tips research incubator. faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias, colombia rnietot@tecnocomfenalco.edu.co hernando garzón saenz ciptec research group - faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias, colombia hernando.garzon@tecnologicocomfenalco.edu.co josé manuel solana garzón ciptec research group- faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias - colombia jsolana@tecnologicocomfenalco.edu.co",
74,5Th South American Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Sa05.20240215,"the purpose of this paper is to characterize the management of operations in the service systems of the hotel sector in cartagena de indias. servicing, understood as the manufacture of services, together with approaches such as lean service and six sigma focused on eliminating waste and improving efficiency in service processes, is a topic of interest. when reviewing the existing literature on operational management in hotels, it is observed that several authors have addressed this topic through studies or analyses. however, little attention has been paid to research on how these approaches, successful in the area of manufacturing, can be effectively implemented in service manufacturing. for the preparation of this document, we chose to use a qualitative research methodology applying the gavilan model, which will allow us to offer a clearer and more precise vision of what is in the subject in the time horizon of the last 5 years (2014 – 2024). the expected results seek to determine the extent to which these improvement approaches are being implemented in operations management in the hospitality sector, providing valuable insights into areas of 768",,"The growing relevance of research on the implementation of 4.0 technologies in the hospitality sector highlights a significant shift in operational focus. In this context, studies are underway to understand the psychosocial impact that could arise from relying on services provided by robots. This reflection underscores the need for broader, more ethical considerations in human interaction with technology within the hospitality industry. The Covid-19 pandemic has left a deep mark on the tourism industry, radically transforming the way we travel and how services are managed in the hospitality sector. However, despite the unprecedented challenges faced by tourism during the health crisis, current data shows renewed interest and increased importance attached to the act of travel. According to (Expendia, 2023), 46% of travelers consider travel to be more important now than before the pandemic, a trend even more pronounced among Millennials (52%) and Gen Z (50%). This evidence suggests that while Covid- 19 has marked a significant milestone in the history of tourism, it has also triggered a shift in perception in the value and relevance of exploring the world and enjoying new experiences. Adapting to this new traveler mindset will require continued innovation and attention to changing market expectations, but it also presents exciting opportunities to revitalize and reinvent the tourism industry in the post-pandemic future. Hotel management systems (PMS) are indispensable tools for the efficient operation of hotels, ranging from reservation management to data analysis for strategic decision-making. Its importance lies in its ability to improve service quality, increase customer satisfaction, and maximize profitability. (Calderón Fajardo & Para-González, 2022) By facilitating resource management, understanding guest preferences, and adapting nimbly to market demands, PMSs become crucial strategic advantages in a competitive environment such as the hotel industry. Their implementation and effective use not only simplify the daily tasks of staff, but also support long-term planning and sustainable growth of hotels. In the regulatory framework of the hotel sector, there are various provisions that regulate fundamental aspects for the operation of the tourism industry. From the implementation of measures to promote sustainable tourism to the regulation of taxes and parafiscal contributions, these regulations reflect the concern for the balanced development of the sector.

In that sense this study identified eight key topics that contribute to the understanding of this field. These topics encompass various aspects, including hydrogen cost and storage, transportation, distribution, renewable energy economy, energy generation, in-dust rial applications, and environmental impact. We have observed that while there is immense promise in green hydrogen, certain barriers such as high production costs, limited infrastructure, and complexities in the supply chain must be addressed to achieve its full potential. However, as technology advances and the costs associated with renewable energy and electrolysis decrease, the production and utilization of green hydrogen are expected to increase significantly. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in studies focusing on finding new and optimized distribution methods for green hydrogen. While these studies contribute valuable insights to the field, it is crucial to also emphasize the importance of investigating green hydrogen supply chain management and developing new supply chain models. 830","green hydrogen and supply chain management through natural language processing approach laura visintainer lerman industrial engineering department engineering school federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre, brazil laura.lerman@ufrgs.br, lauravlerman@gmail.com daisy valle enrique industrial engineering department engineering school universidade beira interior covilhã, portugal wagner henz schettert senior software architect sap, são leopoldo, brazil","References

However, professors and students have found it difficult at times to integrate engineering knowledge with sustainable development. As a result, it is critical to structure both competencies and courses in engineering education with a focus on sustainable development. The integration of competences with learning outcomes, pedagogical practices, and assessment methods assists professors in rethinking how to correctly teach sustainability concepts and what form of assessment is best. Because sustainability is a complex topic involving several pillars, classes involving these systems are required. The findings of this article may aid in the development of more sustainable classes in engineering programs, broadening the scope of action in the field of engineering education. The article's findings can be applied to fields other than industrial engineering. In addition, in future research, focus groups can be used with students who are participating in disciplines to understand what they are learning and how they are evolving. Future research could also investigate whether there is a difference in the pedagogical practices and assessment methods utilized by courses that emphasize sustainability versus those that do not. Also, future studies can categorize pedagogical practices and assessment methods according to performance levels and the three domains of Bloom's taxonomy to assist instructors in implementing them in their courses. Acting with Environmental Responsibility is a fundamental part of sustainability, as it brings the environmental vision of sustainability. Companies and individuals who practice environmental responsibility are contributing to broader sustainability goals, particularly the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda, helping to protect the environment for future generations while meeting the needs of the present. In short, environmental responsibility is a specific action within the broader context of sustainability that needs to be taught in engineering classes so that future professionals can apply the concepts in their work. Therefore, it is important to analyze, based on the teaching and practice of this competence, which new pedagogical practices and assessment methods should be implemented to contribute to the environmental vision of sustainability.","integration of pedagogical practices and assessment methods to foster sustainable competencies in engineering education laura visintainer lerman, paula kvitko de moura and maria cannarozzo tinoco industrial engineering department engineering school federal university of rio grande do sul porto alegre, brazil",
