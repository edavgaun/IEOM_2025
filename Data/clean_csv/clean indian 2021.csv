0,Banana Ripeness Indicator Machine Learning,"bananas are a staple food in most developing countries and are considered a ‘superfood’ due to their health benefits. however, they are also the most wasted fruit in the world, generally due to retail outlets throwing them away due to over ripeness. this paper highlights an alternative and more precise method to the conventional human visual tests which are conducted to precisely estimate the ripeness of a banana. the product is made specifically with the small- scale agriculture industry in mind. the device utilizes the internal physico-chemical changes caused by the banana ripening process to estimate its degree of ripeness. utilizing data gathered from colour, ph and moisture sensors, a support vector machine-learning model is created to predict the ‘stage of ripeness’ based on these input parameters. these parameters have undergo significant in the ripening process where colour changes due to decreasing magnesium content, acidity changes due to ratio of acids changing and finally moisture increases as the banana becomes softer. by having a better estimation of the ‘stage of ripeness’, supply-chain efficiency can be increased by allowing bananas to reach retail outlets at the optimal time to reduce wastage. reference adeyemi, o.s., and a. t. oladiji/ “compositional changes in banana (musa ssp.) fruit during ripening.” african journal of biotechnology 8.5 (2009) jamaludin, d., s. abd aziz, and n. u. a. ibrahim.

1,Single Stage Single Commodity And Multi Period  Warehouse Location Problem (Sscmpwlp),in this paper we pose the location-allocation problem (single stage) with shortages and inventory variables in a style similar to sharma (1991). vimal kumar (2012) gave a novel method of eliminating shortages and this is considered here (this leads to reduced number of variables). next he problem sscmpwlp is formulated in the conventional manner where no variable can be eliminated. we derive a formulation where the resulting 0-1 milp is solved by bender’s decomposition and the associated all real problem is solved by dantzig-wolfe decomposition where the sub problems are posed as min-cost-network flow problems. it offers computational advantages. thus we give three different methods to solve the problem sscmpwlp. an empirical investigation is underway to see which of these three methods perform the best.,,Thus in this paper we have given three methods for solving the SSCMPWLP. We have undertaken an investigation to empirically determine which method does the best. Method three can be accelerated by the inclusion of ‘feasibility’ constraints in the all integer sub problem.,"with location, distribution inventory and shortage costs prof. rrk sharma and piya ghosh industrial and management engineering department indian institute of technology kanpur, india rrks@iitk.ac.in, piyagh@iitk.ac.in prof. kk lai business administration department chaoyang university of technology taichung city, taiwan kklai.tw@gmail.com",

3,"Improving Material Management In Micro, Small, And  Medium Enterprise (Msme) Using Material Requirement","micro, small, and medium enterprise (msme) is the largest business executor to indonesia's national gross domestic product. due to the size of the company, it is inevitable that msme is required to have an efficient workflow and material purchasing to minimize the costs. one of the most popular sectors of msme is food and beverages, glucofeel is one of them. glucofeel is a company that sells cakes that are tasteful and attractive. based on the company’s data, it is important for glucofeel to be able to fulfil their customer’s demand. these objectives, however, were inhibited by the problem of the company’s inability to make efficient material procurement in order to fulfil the customer demand in the right amount and at the right time. the purpose of this research is to increase the company efficiency by implementing mrp. the mrp will be based on the company's historical data and bill of material. the final calculations of mrp are being totalled and compared to the actual purchasing data. the result of the total calculation shows that if the company has implemented mrp from the beginning, the company can save the amount of rp 115.746,66,‐ in price and make a saving of 6,22%.",bill of material,"Glucofeel company is a Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) food and beverages company which has the problem of company’s inability to determine what materials should be purchased and how much the need and company’s inability to make a production planning in order to fulfill the customer demand in the right amount and on the right time. This problem results in the company to experience a shortage and excess in the purchase of raw materials such as sugar, milk, margarine, etc. To answer this problem, an implementation of Material Requirement Planning is performed in the calculation of raw materials purchasing plan. This method was chosen because it was considered appropriate to answer the problems that were faced by the Glucofeel company. Its objective to perform a better response to customer demand, more efficiency in production control, and to avoid excess in inventory (Heizer & Render, 2011) is also beneficial to fulfill the company customer demand. In comparison, it can be figured that, in demand from February to March, the company can save costs by 6.22% if the company used MRP for their production. The company also makes savings of Rp 115,746.66 if the MRP method has been applied early February. Efficiency generated from MRP calculation is relatively small in percentage. However, in its capacity as MSME, the application of MRP in the purchasing of raw materials saves a lot of money to the company.","planning (mrp) wahyu adiraga digjaya, gemilang ananda nizola, and muhammad ilham bintang department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia wahyu.adiraga@ui.ac.id , gemilang.ananda@ui.ac.id, muhammad.ilham94@ui.ac.id",

5,Demand Forecasting Comparison Of Softex 1400-M Using  Single Moving Average Method And Single Exponential,"as a company who excels in agriculture, nutrition & health, and home & personal care, it is important for basf to have the ability to forecast future market conditions. one of which is forecasting customers' demand. poor forecasting would create problems in the management of product availability, namely the lack of availability of stock quantities or the amount of excess product stocks. lack of available stock quantities may result in unfulfilled requests from customers, while producing excess stocks may result in losses. hence, the aim of this study is to compare the demand forecast for softex 1400-m, a product manufactured by basf, using the single moving average and single exponential smoothing method by applying mean absolute deviation, mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error. the method applied in this study is a quantitative method. based on the testing result, the method which often depicts the best result is single moving average method with periods length is 5. the demand forecast can support basf to prevent excess or shortage of product stocks.",demand forecasting,"In conclusion, this study examined forecasting methods using single moving average (n=5) and exponential smoothing (α=0.6) to forecast demand sales for Softex 1400-M. Monthly data from January of 2021 to December 2021 were collected and used to forecast the month of 2022 customer of BASF demand. The study revealed that the five months single moving average has higher accuracy then the exponential smoothing with smoothing constant of 0.6. High level of accuracy has been proven through calculation of errors. The result for forecasting the number of demands for the coming month by the Single Moving Average method is 15,952 kgs/month with errors calculated, namely 2,7257 (MAD), 19,6159 (MSD), and 12,8168% (MAPE) whereas by Single Exponential Smoothing method The result for forecasting the number of demands for the coming month is 17,0858 kgs/month with errors calculated, namely 4,5888 (MAD), 61,9394 (MSD), and 15,7311% (MAPE). Therefore, it can be concluded that the five months single moving average method will give a better forecast for the demand in the year 2022 and subsequent months if adopted. This study helps BASF to find out which forecasting method is the most accurate because demand forecasting plays an important role for any company to stay competitive and survive in the global business environment. Therefore, effective forecasting does not only play a crucial role in the production processes but also for suppliers and transports. With effective forecasting, this will help BASF reduce unnecessary inventories and focus on improving product availability and customer satisfaction.","smoothing method alifa taqya shafa nadhira, cherish amarissa gadisku, sarah malemta peranginangin industrial engineering department universitas indonesia depok, indonesia alifa.taqya@ui.ac.id, cherish.amarissa@ui.ac.id, sarah.malemta@ui.ac.id.",
6,Comparing The Accuracy Of Holt’S And Brown’S Double  Exponential Smoothing Method In Forecasting The Coal,"coal is a fossil fuel that is commonly used throughout the world. nowadays, the demand for coal is fluctuating because of several factors. these changes and uncertainties on the demand level of coal requires more attention from the companies because they must determine the accurate level of production in a certain period of time. the accuracy in predicting how much is needed and how much is produced will be very necessary, because it helps the company to fulfill the market needs and to retain customer loyalty. in this paper, we estimate the demand for coal production for the next 6 years in company x using brown’s and holt’s double exponential smoothing method then determine which method is the most accurate. with brown's method, the result obtained is that the maximum value of α parameter is 0.4 and the mape value is 6.74. on the other hand, with holt’s method we got the value of mape is 5.8157, with alpha 0.5867, and gamma 0.14754. by comparing the two methods, we conclude that holt’s method is more accurate in predicting the demand level in the next 6 years than brown’s method, as holt’s method has a smaller value of forecast error.","coal, forecasting demand, holt’s des","From this paper, the forecasting of coal demand is done based on the historical data from the past 11 years. This will help the business owner to be prepared to produce at the same level with the predicted numbers. Using Brown's method, the result obtained is that the maximum value of α parameter is 0.4 and the MAPE value is 6.74. On the other hand, with Holt’s method we got the value of MAPE is 5.8157, alpha = 0.5867, and gamma = 0.14754. By comparing the two methods, we conclude that Holt’s method is more accurate in predicting the demand level in the next 6 years than Brown’s method, as Holt’s method has a smaller value of forecasting error. Our suggestion for future research is to implement and optimize this method to achieve a higher accuracy so that it will be more beneficial for the company in producing the coal in order to meet the customer demand.","demand of company x ajeng rahmawati, charisma nur ramadhanti, firda hanna ismia, rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, 16424, indonesia ajeng.rahmawati@ui.ac.id, charisma.nur@ui.ac.id, firda.hanna@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",
7,Analysis Of Inventory Control Using Economic Order  Quantity Model A Case Study In Pt.

With EOQ, we can optimize the inventory cost by determining the order quantity if there’s no clear inventory control method. Implementation of EOQ brings many advantages for SMEs, especially in inventory management. Min-max method used to determine the inventory cost when the company decides to classify their inventory cost. This method allows us to calculate the inventory cost using maximum used and average used on the inventory based on customer’s demand. From the analysis above, we conclude that the inventory cost by using the EOQ method is far more efficient than using the Min-Max method. In 2020, the optimal order quantity in each purchase activity is 2,146,860.92 gram, 9 times a year, with the total inventory cost being $14,635.59.

8,The Effect Of Covid-19 On Production Plan   (Case Study: Automotive Parts Industry),"this paper will discuss the importance of preparing the change of production plan during and the effect of covid- 19 pandemic using linear forecasting (forecast.linear). many manufacturing companies are in shock because of the pandemic, from the uncertainty of government regulation and the scarcity of raw material. in addition, not only about a pandemic or epidemic, but can be a monetary crisis or other kind of uncertainties. and, adjusting the production level severely affects the supply chain, since these companies also need to adjust their production level. in the planning process, we need to know how are the customer demand to ensure the production. to forecast the customer demand, we use linear forecasting. the method we used for acquiring the data for covid lockdown are all on public domain. as for the company data, we acquire it by asking the company with the requirement that we shouldn't publish the company name in regards of company privacy. from this study, we hope a better way to adjust production level including preparing for every uncertainty could be used for better decision making in forecasting the production plan and could be used for shifting production plans when adjusting to government regulation and customer demand.","covid-19, production plan","From this paper, we concluded that there was a limited time span of countries reacting to a global pandemic. Most are in the range of 9 to 26 days (about 3 and a half weeks) from the first case to lockdown or curfew, with an average time are 27 days (about 4 weeks). The Effect of the pandemic can be seen with linear forecasting. Even though the pandemic has been a year, the effect to the automotive manufacturing sector still can be seen, affecting the demand of spare part which lower the volume need of the production.","alifarel virya, farrell dzaudan muhammad cahyana, and prima haikal hakim department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, west java 16424, indonesia alifarel.virya@ui.ac.id, farrell.dzaudan@ui.ac.id, prima.haikal@ui.ac.id",

10,Application Of Toc Strategy Using Simulation: Case Of The  Indian Automobile Component Manufacturing Firm,"improved productivity, resource utilization, and efficiency are crucial for the industries working with batch production systems and have attracted growing interest from academia and practice. five focusing steps approach (ffs) of the theory of constraints (toc) is considered a reliable solution to achieve these ends by effectively elevating the constraint within the system. although earlier studies highlighted significant advantages of ffs to the manufacturing firms that adopt it, empirical validation from the real-life cases about these benefits is unaddressed in the literature. most of the studies on toc concepts are found to have utilized hypothetical cases to demonstrate their applicability. however, this study successfully implemented the simulation-based toc application in the real-life case of the indian automobile component manufacturing firms using a resource reallocation strategy to elevate the constraint. a simulation model of the firm under study is created in a discrete event simulation software, arena©. the simulation results show that the toc implementation resulted in an improved manufacturing performance viz. throughput and resource utilization. the results also establish that the application of toc reduces the lead time and shown a positively productive efficiency.","toc, simulation","The bottleneck management concept is emerged out of the TOC approach (Daultani et al., 2015). TOC has a fruitful application since its inception in 1980. TOC consists of different strategies for elevating/exposing the capacity or availability of the bottlenecked resources. This study successfully demonstrated the use of reallocation/redistribution strategy of TOC in the actual case to enhance the manufacturing performances for fulfilling the customer wants using the simulation method. Shifting a load of CCR on the duplicate resources resulted in maintaining the resource utilization within the range and thereby helps to achieve the required throughput level within the stated lead time. Thus, the proposed strategy can be further utilized by researchers and practitioners for bottleneck management in the manufacturing firm. The proposed versatile TOC strategy can further be extended in the fields viz. Project management, supply chain, healthcare, marketing, accounting, and logistics.

The three benefits include reduction in production, logistics, inventory and maintenance costs; shortening of time to produce and time to market; and improvement in output, quality, quality of life and customer satisfaction. The technologies had been identified as additive manufacturing (including AI, 3D printing and robots), data analytics, Internet of things, and virtual & augmented realities. The findings of the study are concluded as below. • Value enhancement has been judged as the most important benefit of I4.0 adoption with approximately 60% importance as compared to reduction in costs (27% weightage) and improvement is response time (nearly 13%). • 3D printing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robots have emerged as the most preferred technologies in order to reap the I4.0 benefits. • Adoption of IoT at this stage has been found as least important as compared to other three technologies with respect to all three benefits. • Data analytics has more important role to play to achieve reduction in costs and response time as compared to that in value enhancement. • Virtual and augmented realities are more important for value enhancement as compared to reduction in costs and response time. • The overall ranking of the technologies indicates that 3D printing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robots together (AMG) have been preferred over all other technologies with 55% weightage, followed by virtual & augmented realities (VAR), data analytics (DTA), and Internet of things (IOT). The experts were asked to judge the relative importance of the three benefits and relative ranking of four technologies to take advantage of these benefits. This was asked in the context of medium and large manufacturing firms in India. Despite being the sixth-largest manufacturing country in the world, India lags many other countries in the adoption of I4.0 technologies. Though the automotive industry in the country has taken lead in this direction, the manufacturing sector has to go a long way to transform its processes into the Industry 4.0 era. Following recommendations are proposed. • Challenges like, large investments, different leadership and skills, and better physical and IT infrastructures need to be taken care by the policy makers and industry experts. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.9 Technology weightage Cost Reduction (CTR) weightage AM G DTA Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Bangalore, India, August 16-18, 2021","hera farooquiea, asif akhtarb aresearch scholar, bassistant professor faculty of management studies & research aligarh muslim university aligarh, 202002, india herafarooquie@gmail.com","References

13,Status Of Smart Manufacturing System Implementation In  Indian Smes: A Multi-Case Approach,"smart manufacturing system (sms) is facilitating new ways for humans and machines to work together, empowering businesses to achieve greater insights, reduce the risk of error and make better decisions. this revolution in the manufacturing sector is possible through digital transformation, up-gradation to new technological developments and effective use of data and thus making the manufacturing sector more intelligent and smart. in recent times, significant efforts have been undertaken by the indian government to promote the implementation of sms in the indian manufacturing sector to leverage the benefits of this technological transformation. thus, this paper presents the status quo of sms implementation in indian “small and medium enterprises (smes)” and discusses the various initiatives undertaken by the indian government and private players. in addition, five case studies are conducted which either is seeking or have already implemented sms system in their working environment. the study also comprehends detail about challenges faced by smes in sms implementation and finally elaborate the future scope of sms based research.",,"The manufacturing sector is globally witnessing a new period of radical change and transformation. Several advance economies are focusing on the implementation of SMS to withstand the competitiveness of the market. Further, SMEs across India accounted for nearly 30% of India's GDP and 48% of export in the financial year 2019-20 (PTI, 2018). Indian government is much focused on their SMEs as these units also drives employment, exports, and provides inclusive growth opportunities. Implementation of SMS in SMEs will act as a catalyst in improving the manufacturing prosperity of these enterprises and of the nation. Companies can strategies the implementation of this industrial automation using a suitable framework and with clear system architecture. Instead of going for a high-cost sophisticated transformation, SMEs can deploy simple and affordable customized automation support system. As transformation is not about cost; it is also about how much improvement it brings in manufacturing practice. The cases discussed in this paper is a clear evidence to prove that small or single technology transformation provided a major help in their production output. Furthermore, the government is also showing clear interest in providing platforms or SMS and Industry 4.0 implementation, especially in SMEs to move the steady growth of manufacturing sectors. With some successful initiatives like SAMARTH, Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India, the Indian government is providing financial support and ease of doing businesses to SMEs. Apart from the Indian government, the private firms are also coming forward to joins hands in bringing the SMS implementation in Indian industries. It is observed through this study that SMEs are going under the required amount of transformation as financial constraints restrict them from complete transformation. Case company A an auto ancillary company by installing real- time monitoring in their machinery benefited around 20% output increases in their production. Similarly, Case company E a food-producing, and packaging company integrated an RFID system for tracking and monitoring food packaging. By this single integration, the company benefited from the increase in sales turnover 485cr INR (approx.) from 80.2cr INR (approx.) by minimizing food waste. The other three case companies also believed in the potential of SMS and rather than waiting for complete transformation companies planned to implement this system in specific areas. SMEs in India are highly organizing themselves in terms of improving their technology infrastructure and skill management. However, many challenges are in the way of these technologies evolving completely in the Indian Scenario. But with the confluence of the wisdom of researchers, academicians, “public private partnerships (PPPs)” and government members; the complete existence of the SMS in Indian manufacturing can become reality. Acknowledgement The authors would like to thank the management of five companies (considered in this study) who allowed the first author to visit their plant and carry out the case study. The authors also thank the employees of these organizations for their valuable insights.","monica shukla & ravi shankar department of management studies indian institute of technology delhi iit campus, hauz khas, new delhi 110016, india shukla.monica4@gmail.com; ravi1@dms.iitd.ac.in",

15,Probability-Based Algorithmic Framework Incorporating  Human-Centric Design And Implicit Bias To Counter,"machine learning models have been employed in many organizations for impactful decision-making processes. however, bias prevalent in an organization’s model could create meaningful issues, ranging from incorrect hiring decisions to a negative impact on an organization’s image. organizations often lack the knowledge or time to create a model in line with society’s standards, leading to the utilization of faulty systems. here, we present a framework to help combat this issue, allowing organizations to prevent bias in their models. our framework starts with a general guidebook to clarify relevant terminology and provide best practices for developers to measure and mitigate bias. we then incorporate an automated algorithm based on statistical parity and disparate impact to de-bias raw data. we apply smote-tomek to resample imbalanced datasets and a reject option classification algorithm to reduce biased predictions. we infer adding more data related to minority and unprivileged classes to datasets will help create more equitable and representative datasets leading to fair ai systems for all. we propose a novel decentralized database using web-scraping and homomorphic encryption as a reliable source of real-world data. our assumed hypotheses were confirmed by data derived from extensive testing.","machine learning, implicit bias","In this paper we have outlined the structure and benefits of our proposed algorithmic framework to counter bias in AI/ML systems composing of a general guidebook, an automated de-biasing algorithm, SMOTE-Tomek, and a Reject Option Classification algorithm.

18,Prioritization Of Enablers Supporting Deployment Of Lean Six  Sigma With Sustainability Considerations: An Ism Based,"this article aims at prioritizing and analyzing the enablers that supports implementation of lean six sigma with sustainability considerations. 10 such crucial enablers were identified and an integrated interpretive structural modeling (ism) and micmac (matriced’ impacts croisés multiplication appliqués à un classement) approach was applied for prioritizing the enablers. based on the analysis, the most dominant and dependent enablers that enables lss adoption with sustainability considerations were identified. the enablers, namely, “availability of proper defect monitoring system, availability of well designed roadmap for sustainable lss implementation and effective in-bound and out-bound communication”, occupy the base segment of the ism hierarchy; the enabler, namely, “a supportive leadership”, occupy the top level of the ism hierarchy. the study helped in identifying and prioritizing the enablers that supports lss adoption with sustainable considerations arrived using a mathematical approach. this approach will be helpful for practitioners and implementation experts to focus on enabling the key dominant enablers and to deploy lss adoption with sustainable considerations.","lean six sigma, structural model, enablers","Ten enablers affecting LSS adoption with sustainable considerations were identified from the literature and their interrelationships were obtained based on expert opinion from the case organization consisting of practitioners and academicians. Based on the ISM methodology, the model was built which consists of four levels. The first level consists of three enablers namely ‘Availability of proper defect monitoring system’, ‘Availability of well designed roadmap for sustainable LSS Implementation’ and ‘Effective in-bound and out-bound communication’. These three enablers possess maximum driving power and are considered as the most crucial enablers in adopting LSS with sustainable considerations. The enablers ‘Availability of infrastructure’ ‘Enhanced focus on sustainable process’ ‘Frequent amelioration of processes’, ‘Adequate training’, ‘An engaged sponsor’, ‘An engaged sponsor’ and ‘Effective designing of implementation process’ occupy the second and the third levels. The first level enablers have an influence on these enablers and support them. ‘A supportive Leadership’ is at fourth level. These enablers possess strong dependence powers and weak driving powers. The firm must take necessary mitigating actions to remove these identified enablers in order to make LSS adoption process with sustainable considerations without any hurdles. The developed ISM model is further analyzed based on the Enabler’s driving and dependence power in order to create clusters of enablers. Based on results of ISM analysis, the enablers are categorized into autonomous, dependent, linkage and independent clusters as indicated in Figure 2. Figure 2. Classification of Enablers MICMAC principle is based on multiplication properties of the matrices. The purpose of MICMAC analysis is to interpret the driving power and dependence power of the enablers. This is performed to identify the key enablers that drive the system in various categories. Based on their driving power and dependence power, the enablers in the present case have been classified. The enablers ‘A Supportive Leadership’, ‘Adequate Training’ and ‘An Engaged Sponsor’ and ‘Effective Designing of Implementation Process’ are considered as the driver elements. These enablers are dependent on their own and are considered as the powerful enablers for integrated implementation of LSS with Sustainability considerations. The enablers ‘Availability of Infrastructure’, ‘Enhanced Focus on Sustainable Process’ and ‘Frequent Amelioration of processes’ were identified as the linkage enablers.

21,Development Of A Dedicated Framework For Deployment Of  Circular Economy Strategies In Manufacturing,"in the current industrial scenario, manufacturing organizations are dealing with issues pertaining to lack of resources, higher environmental impacts and decreased value creation. to make the manufacturing process more efficient and to cope up with the volatile industrial market, manufacturing organizations have started to adopt sustainable strategies that focus on gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, and designing waste out of the system. circular economy is one such strategy which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products. deploying circular economy strategies would make the firm to strengthen its business model and also improves the overall value of the manufacturing process and as well as the product. a dedicated framework is required for deploying the circular economy concepts systematically. this research article proposes a dedicated framework for deploying circular economy concepts in manufacturing organizations. the developed framework consists of five phases namely framing the factors, production and deployment, collection and reuse, usage and consumption and measuring the performance. each phase consists of a set of directives for deploying the concepts. the developed framework will be useful for implementation managers and manufacturing firms willing to deploy circular economy concepts in their organization.","lean six sigma, structural model, enablers","Circular Economy is an approach that is applied to eliminate waste and to maximize value by redesigning the manufacturing and distribution process. It concerns about making the production more sustainable by focusing on improving the indicators of Environment, Economy and Society. For deployment of Circular Economy concepts systematically, it requires a high level map or framework for guiding the implementation process. The present work describes about development of a dedicated framework for deployment of circular economy concepts for manufacturing organizations. The developed framework consists of five phases namely Framing the factors, Production and Deployment, Collection and Reuse, Usage and Consumption and Measuring the performance. Each phase consists of sub activities to be deployed and are designed to be implemented in a step by step manner. The developed framework allows the firm to assess its resources before implementation and makes the firm ready to the actual deployment. The developed framework provides a step by step procedure for deployment and also supports in enhancing the firm’s efficiency post deployment of CE concepts. The developed framework will be useful for implementation managers, production managers and process engineers to systematically analyze their production and distribution system and allows them to plan their deployment activity during the framework deployment. In future, the developed framework can be validated with the case study and based on the implementation challenges, the framework can be further modified.","organizations ben ruben r assistant professor department of mechanical engineering sri krishna college of engineering and technology coimbatore, tamil nadu, india *ben.ruben21@gmail.com s.p. nithin balaji, k pranav, and j.jayasuryaa under graduate students department of mechanical engineering sri krishna college of engineering and technology coimbatore, tamil nadu, india balajinithin@gmail.com , kaladharan.pranav@gmail.com , jayasuryaa104@gmail.com ,",
22,Are Indian Companies Aligned Towards Women  Empowerment?,"in this research study, the researchers have analyzed the corporate social responsibility (csr) of the 58 listed central public sector enterprises (cpses) in terms of women empowerment and further analyzed in terms of sustainable development goals (sdgs). to analyze and measure women empowerment, the researchers extracted relevant data from the 2019-20 annual report of the 58 cpses. the researchers performed qualitative content analysis and through descriptive data analysis analyzed the participation of the cpses towards women empowerment through their csr activities. the results of the study suggest that most of the listed cpses are engaged in women empowerment-related csr activities. the result further shows that participation of the heavy engineering, refinery, and service industries towards women empowerment-related csr activities is the highest, whereas that of the coal, fertilizer, and medium/light industries is the lowest. the study has also found that most of the sectors are promoting women empowerment through skill and educational development of women followed through their health and hygiene improvement programs. it also shows that these activities would improve their productivity and employability which in turn will open the opportunities for generating steady and sustainable income for them.",women empowerment,,"arpita chakraborty lecturer, dept. of economics st francis college bangalore university arpita.goswami@gmail.com dr. shekar babu phd professor & founding head, department of management amrita vishwa vidyapeetham university bengaluru, india sb@amrita.edu","References

27,Development Of Proactive Mine Electrical Safety  Management System (Mesms) For Indian Underground,"automation of operational activities in trackless underground hard rock mines is very common and necessary trend in present day indian mining scenario. the use of various types of electrical machineries and equipments like electro-hydraulic drill jumbo, electrically operated lhd (load haul dump), auxiliary and booster ventilation fans, winding system and pumping system etc. are essential requirements for carrying out mining operations efficiently and safely. beside this, mine illumination system comprises large number of electrical components. as the use of the electricity is indispensable in nature and exposure of miners to the electrical equipments is increasing day- by- day, the occurrence of electricity related accidents in mining industry is also increasing. in this context, a detailed study on recent accident/incidents caused by electrical installations in mines and associated hazardous issues in a trackless underground hard rock mine was conducted. the major outcomes of case study exhibited the necessity of a methodical approach using suitable scientific tools to moderate the hazards associated with the electrical equipments and installations during different unit operations in case study mine. as the measures of control, a proactive mine electrical safety management system (mesms) has been established in accordance with the directorate general of mine safety (dgms), india, guidelines, cea (central electricity authority) regulation,2010, india and hazard and operability analysis (hazop) procedure and instigated for implementation. in this paper; design and development of various components of mesms viz. hazard identification and risk assessment of electrical equipment operations and maintenance activities, standard operating procedures (sop) for significant hazards and apposite work plans (wp) to accomplish the goal of operational safety have been demonstrated.",risk assessment,"The process of evaluating the safety performance over preceding years is a postmortem or reactive safety management effort (accident enquiry, analysis of safety statistics, finding responsible persons etc.) and is not useful in present day scenario. The healthier way would be to recognize the lead indicators like numbers and quality of training classes conducted, evaluation of worker’s risk sensitivity and understanding of MESMS etc. which can indirectly help in identifying new hazards, improving standard operating procedure(SOP), bringing existing risk control indexes(ERCI) from low to high etc. There is a need for modernizing the training system by using simulation based modules and audio visual effect oriented systems. The world of virtual reality and digital monitoring of Major hazards could be an effective step towards efficient implementation of MESMS. However, it is essential that the input of all stakeholders should be given solemn consideration during feedback management for the enrichment of such proactive approach; otherwise the process of MESMS will remain an exercise on paper and not promulgate in right way.

35,A Simulation Study To Evaluate The Performance Of Fms  Using Operations Flexibility,"the advancement of modern technology, specifically speaking industry 3.0 and 4.0 has brought enormous amount of changes to the manufacturing sector. it has resulted in a very high automation of existing manufacturing sectors. flexible manufacturing systems (fms) have become the backbone of the modern industries due to this technological advancement. however, the complexity of the fms requires a system to be developed to analyze and design complex manufacturing systems. this paper attempts to find a solution to this problem. simulation is a powerful tool that is used to study and analyze the system performance. numerous works has been done by various researchers considering various types of flexibilities. the main aim of this study is to develop a demonstrative model of flexible manufacturing system (fms) using arena simulation software and to study the effect of operations flexibility on the performance of fms. one of the reasons to select the operations flexibility for the study is due to very limited work done for this flexibility type. based on the selected configurations, the conceptual and simulation models and their respective animations have been developed by arena software. to verify the simulation results, multi-criteria decision making techniques viz. grey relational analysis (gra) is used.",simulation,"This work provides a framework based on simulation experiments which can be applied to a FMS for improving its performance by optimizing certain design parameters. This has been done by developing a dynamic, deterministic and discrete type of the simulation models using ARENA simulation software to study the effect of operation flexibility on the performance of FMS. From the series of experiments conducted with four sequencing rules viz. FIFO, LIFO, SPT & LPT and operation flexibility it was found that SPT rule comes out to be the best rule followed by the FIFO rule. The sequence ‘3-2-1-4-5-6’ in combination with the SPT sequencing rule gives the optimum performance for FMS. This selection of optimum sequence and the sequencing rule was verified by performing a MCDM analysis i.e. Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). The GR analysis results were found to be in accordance with the simulation results and it verified the selection of optimum sequence and sequencing rule.","huzefa mashhood and prof. mohammed ali department of mechanical engineering aligarh muslim university aligarh, up 202002, india huzefa.mashhood@gmail.com, mohdali234@rediffmail.com",

49,Social Economic Impact Of Communication Network Pattern  Of Rural Women Community In Malang Regency,"the development and improvement of entrepreneurial activities in a country cannot be separated from the participation and role of women. women need a place to work with. moreover, women in the rural area should also have a special space to develop and improve their skills. this article would take a deeper part to analyze about how the social and economic implication of the communication network pattern among the community member. this is broadening the analysist of the previous research that has been done by the writer about communication network pattern of rural women pelangi nusantara community in malang region. in addition, the factors of network communication pattern that influenced the developing and sustainability of the community also becoming a part of the discussion. the results show that the communication network pattern is a wheel. this wheel pattern has the advantage that the rapid flow of information and command given from the founder to the leaders. so that the quality and quantity of production remains the same as in the pelanusa ops. the disadvantage of this pattern is, because of the centered information and communication, members who have no position in the community have no access to share their needs and their capability in designing and producing the product. regarding the economic and social situation, showed that there is no significant change in rural women members of the economic situation. meanwhile, in terms of social aspect, members admitted that skills and information networks and knowledge gained to design products have increased.","sociopreneur, women community, rural economic","Managing a community especially when its members are rural women, certainly challenging. Because there is the desired of hope to be achieved, especially in economic terms. There is a desire to change the economic situation of the family that cannot be delayed. However, this cannot be done quickly because it often clashes with the interests of the organization. According to the analysis of the Social Economic Impact of Communication Network Pattern of Rural Women Community in Malang Regency showed that the communication network pattern formed in Pelanusa is a wheel pattern. A pattern which information flow is centralized. Centralized communication patterns in Pelanusa make information management and production go through one channel, from the Founder to the leaders of women groups. This wheel pattern has the advantage that the rapid flow of information and command given from the founder to the leaders. So that the quality and quantity of production remains the same as in the Pelanusa OPS. The disadvantage of this pattern is, because of the centered information and communication, members who have no position in the community have no access to share their needs and their capability in designing and producing the product. Nevertheless, this pattern should be satisfying the members, in fact Leaders and members feel dissatisfied with the management of this community. Through this research, showed that the implications of the wheel pattern are related to the founder leadership skills. The relation among members is transactional based on the business needs. While the aim of the community is to empower rural women in the economic sector and reduce the number of early marriages in the village. Thus, the relations should be more focused on the relationship. Regarding the economic and social situation, showed that there is no significant change in rural women members of the economic situation. Because of the reward system considered too low and cannot quickly get the money from the production services. Meanwhile, from social conditions there are perceived changes ranging from communication skills to design skills, networks for women's empowerment as well as information on existing sales and marketing activities. So that members can participate to sell their community products.","yanuarita kusuma permata sari communication science department faculty of economics and communication bina nusantara university, jakarta, indonesia ypermatasari@binus.edu riesta devi kumalasari department of entrepreneurship business creation business school undergraduate program bina nusantara university, malang, indonesia rkumalasari@binus.edu asih zunaidah language center, communication science faculty of humanities bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia asih.zunaidah@binus.du",
50,Developing A Mathematical Model For The Effect Of Charcoal  On Odor Intensity Using Differential Equations,"charcoal is known not only for grilling but also for its ability to absorb odor and moisture. the presence of charcoal on the container results in a change in its odor intensity with respect to the change in time. this study developed a first order, first degree differential equation that can be used to predict the odor intensity of the container with respect to the time after putting charcoal or vice-versa. the variables used were the perceived odor intensity of 20 respondents as the dependent variable and time as the independent variable. parameters such as the container’s volume and temperature were held as constants for the simplicity of the model. the data used were the mean odor intensity rating for every 8 hours. the computed odor intensity per time (t) has varying absolute percentage errors because the data used deviated. this model is effective as long as the odor intensity rating is more accurate. therefore, it is recommended to gather data on odor intensity with the use of equipment and instruments to make the predictions more accurate. it is also recommended to modify or improve the model and consider temperature and the volume of the container as variables instead of constants.","charcoal, odor intensity, deodorizer, exponential model","The researchers were able to develop a mathematical model that shows the relationship between the effect of charcoal on the odor rating of a container. This proves that the odor intensity of the container-when treated with the help of charcoal decreases with respect to time until it reaches the level where the odor is not perceptible anymore. When the volume and the temperature of the container are held as constant and based on the parameters and factors used in the study, the observed optimal time for the odor to be fully-removed on the container will take about 56 hours or more than 2 days. On the other hand, the accuracy of the model is highly dependent on the data gathered from the experiment that the researchers conducted. The percentage errors of the computed odor intensity are caused by the factors being held as constants. It can be concluded that this mathematical model can be used with the odor ratings/intensity and when the temperature and the volume of the container will be held as constants. 6. Area for Future Work Based on these findings, the researchers highly recommend using a greater scope of data on odor intensity. The use of accurate data such as the actual measurement of odor intensity with the help of equipment and instruments would greatly help for the accuracy of results. Moreover, a longer period for the data gathering and larger-scale data prompts greater modification of the model. The researchers also recommend developing a model that will consider the temperature and volume of the container being observed. Moreover, the use of objective measurements when it comes to odor intensity would also be an essential tool to achieve more accurate results. For future related studies, it is also recommended to use a device to validate the results.","jeremy laurence m. bañez† industrial engineering department bulacan state university city of malolos, bulacan, philippines, 3000 banezjeremy@gmail.com mcgensen v. gorospe industrial engineering department bulacan state university city of malolos, bulacan, philippines, 3000 gorospe.mcgensen0133@gmail.com eldrin b. gulapa industrial engineering department bulacan state university city of malolos, bulacan, philippines, 3000 gulapa.eldrinb0483@gmail.com",

The major contributors in NPD were the customer requirement, suppliers’ capabilities, market analysis, and technical analysis. Both suppliers and customers helped in the generation of initial product configuration. The NPD was focused on developing products that are reliable in performance, safety in operation, user-friendly, and ease of maintenance. So, a 5-stage new product development process accompanied by six check gates was adopted. These gates were designed to address every possible issue after every stage that can delay or fail the product. The study also reveals that the NPD increased the new product intensity, customer satisfaction, and market share of the organization which is tangible benefits to the organization. The study also reports that the interacting factors as reported by various researchers in the literature review are consistent with this study. Limitations of case study This case study is conducted on a single organization so the results may not be generic so for the generalization more organizations should be considered.

52,Parenting Style And Its Influence On Student Discipline  Problem And Student Happiness In Malaysia,"parenting style is one of the factors which can influence the occurrence of student discipline problems in school. there are four types of parenting styles according to baumrind’s theory of parenting (1991) which are authoritarian, authoritative, permissive, and neglectful. this paper reviews the influenced of parenting style towards students' disciplinary problems and students’ happiness in the malaysian perspective by conducting literature review. the findings of this study are based on the findings of studies which conducted by previous researchers. in addition, this study also examines the types of parenting styles that are often practiced by parents which their children involved with disciplinary problems in school. the parenting style practiced by parents can influence the child's personality and behavior, which is indirectly associated to the disciplinary problems.","parenting style, student, discipline problem, happiness","In summary, parenting style can either influence or not influence students ’disciplinary problems in school. This is because, there are other factors which can contribute to a child’s involvement to disciplinary problems such as individual factors, family factors, peer factors, schooling factors and community factors (Tharshini and Ibrahim, 2020). In addition, most parents adopt an authoritative parenting style. According to Baumrind (1991) and Maccoby and Martin (1983), authoritative parenting style is an ideal parenting style in the formation of a child's personality. Therefore, this is also considered if the parenting style does not affect the disciplinary problems of the students. In addition, a child's emotional intelligence plays an important role in a child's behavior. A child who is given enough love will grow up in a harmonious and happy atmosphere, and this will help the child to always behave well. Therefore, parents need to further strengthen their relationship with their child so that the child feels comfortable when communicating with parents. Not only that, parents also need to be aware of what their children do when they are away from home. Parents do not need to monitor them 24 hours but just to make sure that the child does not fall into social problems. Moreover, parents need to build a strong relationship with teachers in the school. Teachers have a role to educate a student and are considered as parents while in school. The good relationship that is highlighted between teachers and parents will give a lesson to the child to respect the teacher as much as they respect their parents.

54,Development Of An Optimization Model For Multiple  Production Systems With Split And Merge,"assembly production systems (asps) are used to assemble complex components in manufacturing industries such as automobile production, aviation, mechanical equipment, electronic goods and household items. importantly, asps may, in a single production process, merge two or more serial production lines. contrastingly, disassembly systems (disasps), with split lines, are employed to disassemble/systematically remove constituent parts from the final product, without impairment. the buffer size of the bay in front of each machine tool should be optimized for an efficient asps or disasps. the characteristics of machine tools, including their uptimes and downtimes, have a significant impact on decisions concerning buffer size and subsequently on the production rate of an asps or disasps. optimum buffer size can achieve a high production rate which enhances the performance and operation of the entire production system. this research presents an effective method for determining optimal and near optimal design for assembly and disassembly production systems. the proposed model optimizes the buffer size among each couple of machine tools in the asps and disaps for any given uptime and downtime parameters of the machine tools. a genetic algorithms (ga)-based optimization model is used to determine the optimal values of buffer size for serial production lines in the production systems. the numerical examples performed in the research validated the ability of the optimization model in determining the buffer size. optimized selection can be carried out quickly as compared to previous selection techniques. moreover, the proposed algorithm can back the manufacturing engineer’s decision-making while development stage of new asps or disasps.","asps, disasps, optimization, genetic algorithm, buffer size","This paper proposed an enhanced optimization algorithm to find the best buffer size for assembly production systems with both assembly (merge) and disassembly (split) lines. The algorithm simultaneously maximizes the throughput of the production lines. The results show that the algorithm requires only a short processing time for large numbers of machines and multiple production lines. The algorithm was tested on production lines with four and ten machines to confirm it was not limited to a specific number of machines. The symmetry of the two problems meant the results with DisASPS were the same as for ASPS with an inverted sequence of the production lines. The optimization algorithm was designed to be able to integrate with the decision support system (DSS) to provide a correct decision to the operator in a short time. For future work, the author aims to update the algorithm to be part of a multi-agent artificial intelligence system that can predict regular maintenance needed and optimize manufacturing process parameters.

58,Food Wastage In Households And Theories Underlying The  Behaviour,"food waste index 2021 report reveals that people wasted 931 million tonnes of food material in the year 2019, out of which 61 % is contributed by households, 26 % by food services, and 13 % by retail; indian households waste 50 kilograms of food annually per individual. the large quantities of food waste created by the worldwide food system is a critical issue that is getting major focus owing to its environmental and socio- economic impacts. internationally, since visibility regarding sustainability, food wastage and impoverishment is on the high, the requirement to understand the behaviour patterns behind reducing food wastage and food insecurity is the need of the hour. in this paper, the authors make an attempt to list and analyse the theories behind the food wastage behaviour in households and to assist future research identify the antecedents of food wastage behaviour. the goal of this paper is to demonstrate a theoretical foundation for household food waste. the paper focuses on the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) and theory of reasoned action (tra) majorly to explain constructs of behaviour.",,,"mithun raj phd student amrita vishwa vidyapeetham university rajmith@gmail.com dr. shekar babu phd professor & founding head, department of management amrita vishwa vidyapeetham university bengaluru, india sb@amrita.edu",
59,Ergonomic Risk Assessment Of Manual Material Handling  (Mmh) Tasks At Select Unorganized Small Scale Units In,"manual material handling (mmh) is one of the most physically challenging works where workers are vulnerable to awkward postures, repetitive movements, forceful exertions and contact stresses. mmh tasks include lifting, lowering, holding, pulling, pushing, carrying and moving a load. these tasks, if repeatedly performed lead to fatigue and musculoskeletal disorders (msds) of lower back, shoulders and lower extremities. while performing mmh tasks, the operator’s posture is at an unacceptable position, exposing them to msd risks and low back problem (lbp). a field study of small scale industries in informal sector such as stone cutting & polishing units, saw mills, bottling plant and warehouses is undertaken. the methodology for present study is body discomfort questionnaire, rapid entire body assessment (rula), rapid entire body assessment tool (reba) and niosh lifting equation. the primary data is collected through observations, interviews and discussions and rula, reba and niosh. rula and reba analyses the working postures of workers and determines the ergonomic risk factors. niosh determines the recommended weight limit (rwl) and calculates lifting index (li), which analyses whether a lift is safe or hazardous. the ergonomic studies revealed that in almost all industries the workers complain of discomfort & pain in shoulder, low back and lower extremities due to unscientific methods of handling and awkward postures. the postural analysis according to rula and reba tools revealed most of the postures are in medium to high risks (40% to 55%). in one particular case, ergonomic interventions by digital human modeling and simulation (dhms) are done using catia v5 software. by implementing suitable ergonomic interventions, the lifting index value was reduced from 1.64 to 1.2, and 1.79 to 0.98. the postural risks are also reduced considerable. several ergonomic interventions and redesign of workplace and training of workers were recommended. the findings indicate an immediate need to implement ergonomic principles and interventions throughout different industries to reduce the risks due to mmh tasks. after implementation of proper lifting techniques and redesign of work systems, showed that the workers yielded lower lifting index, reduced physical exertion and msds and improved productivity.","mmh, niosh, msds, rula",,"north karnataka abhishek s. humpli student, department of industrial & production engineering, p.d.a.college of engineering, kalaburagi, india abhishekhumpli@gmail.com qutubuddin s.m associate professor, department of industrial & production engineering, p.d.a.college of engineering, kalaburagi, india syedqutub16@gmail.com arbaaz sohail, prashnat t. and mohd. azhar ahmed students, department of industrial & production engineering, p.d.a.college of engineering, kalaburagi, india sohailarbaaz1996@gmail.com , tauseef44anwar@gmail.com, prashant.talwar100@gmail.com, ahmedazhar78695@gmail.com",
60,A Study Of The Relationship Between Logistics Performance  And Human Development,"logistics is an important of supply chain management. it ensures smooth flow of information and material across the supply chain. countries have always tried to reduce the money and time spent on supply chain logistics. logistics industry impacts a country’s economy, both on macro level and micro level. logistics sector is the key to globalization and internationalization. logistics performance index (lpi) as defined by world bank and human development index (hdi) as defined by united nations development program (undp) have been discussed in this paper. the relation between international lpi and hdi have been explored. the authors have attempted used a linear regression model using spss (statistical package for the social sciences) for studying this relationship. the data for 154 countries for the year 2018 has been used for this study. each assumption relating to regression analysis is satisfied and the same is proven with the help of spss outputs. the regression equation obtained is used to predict the lpi value for the year 2019.",,"and Future research directions Due to cut throat competition among various countries, the need for improvement in the logistics front appears to be necessary. Every nation is in a race to achieve better logistics performance index but this fact seems to neglected that apart from the six key indices as defined by the World Bank, LPI depends on other factors too. HDI is one such factor that is responsible to the variation in LPI. Level of development of a nation and logistics costs are interrelated. Developing countries see a logistics cost of as high as 25% of delivered costs while for developing countries this cost is dipped to 8-9% (Roberts, 2003). A reduction in the logistics cost for any country can help in bringing down the final cost of the product which in turn can make things more affordable for the people of the country. This is how the LPI can affect the HDI of any country. Taking appropriate measures for increasing life expectancy of its citizens, providing access to education and offering a decent standard of living can be linked to a rise in HDI. The LPI can contribute to offering a decent standard of living by making prices competitive thus affecting HDI. It can also be seen that logistics costs have a direct relation with increase in international trade and hence increase foreign direct investment (Coto-Millán, 2016). Increase in foreign direct investment can enhance the foreign exchange reserves of any country. A country’s external obligations can be met by its reserves and just the presence of these reserves can boost market’s confidence level in its country’s capabilities. Not only this, reserves provide external assets to a country which are in turn responsible for backing of domestic currency. Also, reserves provide assistance to government when it comes to meeting requirements involving foreign exchange and external debt obligations. Maintenance of reserves is also crucial in case of national disasters and natural calamities (Mathews & Singh, 2020). This will indirectly help the government in improving the HDI for the country. This study is limited to 154 countries as only these countries had both the indices defined. The lack of LPI data by World Bank for the year 2020 limits the study to year 2018. Logistics Performance Index values are available only for 6 years as this index is released every alternate year. These values can be extrapolated to find values of this index for all years starting from 2008. The value of LPI predicted by the model is a fairly accurate. A more accurate model could be developed by including more variables in the model. Other factors like Gross Domestic Product, Ease of Doing Business scores could have been used to see if these indices have an impact on LPI and hence, predict a more accurate LPI score.","soumya varma and bhavin shah operations and supply chain management department indian institute of management (iim), sirmaur, himachal pradesh 173025, india soumya.iim.20@gmail.com, bhavin.shah@iimsirmaur.ac.in",

Back supports are supporting devices that are used to alleviate discomfort to the back region of the body. In this study, comfortability and productivity of employees were assessed on the use of back support. The components of back support that have an impact on comfort are height, width, type of material, cushion thickness, design, and curve on the lumbar region. In XYZ company, the employees used two designs of back support, namely the D-shaped and pillow-shaped back support. The researcher assessed the components through surveys distributed to 100 participants. The respondents were asked about their personal & work information, evaluation of components of back support, comfortability experienced with the components, Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ), and productivity evaluation. Based on the results of the survey, most of the respondents used Pillow-shaped back support than D-shaped back support. The components curve on the lumbar region and the design of back support obtained the least comfort level experienced by the employees using the current back supports. In the CMDQ section, results showed that the back and lower regions were the parts that experienced the most discomfort. The researchers conducted RULA and REBA to assess the level of MSD risk. The results indicated that investigation and implementation change is needed to prevent workers from exposure to high risks of injury with the two designs of back support. Moreover, they conducted recommended anthropometric dimensions to the back support regarding backrest to achieve the supporting function on the back region. The statistical analysis shows that there is a significant difference in the productivity of the workers and the back support. It is also the same as the CMDQ score of the upper and lower back. For the comfortability in the components, the comfortability experienced at the height of the back support was the only exception that has no significant difference for the variation of the back support. The greatest predictor for productivity was the height of the back support but it is not significant according to its standardized effect, and for the upper and lower back was the curve on the lumbar region. The proposed design of the back support was based on an ergonomic design and the anthropometric measurements of Filipinos. The posterior pelvic cut was used based on the Review of Related Literature. The measurements followed the anthropometric data.","almarose villapando, daniel raven b. gollayan, and janka andrea f. magaling school of industrial engineering and engineering management mapúa university 658 muralla st. intramuros, manila almarosevillapando@yahoo.com, drbgollayan@mymail.mapua.edu.ph, jafmagaling@mymail.mapua.edu.ph",

66,An Indirect Approach To Analyze The Impact Of Working  Environment Restrictions Due To Covid 19 On Muscle,"the current research work seeks to analyze the changes in the muscle fatigue and strength, if any, due to the restrictions of use of facial mask while at work. the workers are required to perform tasks like lifting and pushing which range from moderate to heavy workloads. alternative approach had to be used as the shop floor environment did not facilitate the use of standard laboratory setup for measurement of muscle fatigue.","muscle fatigue, ergonomics, workloads, discomfort","It can be concluded that there is increased fatigue experienced by the workers involved in moderate to heavy intensity of physical activity, due to use of facial mask for protection against COVID 19, which may lead to productivity loss on the shop floor by about 8% to 12%. This value of loss will change depending upon the policy allowances provided by the Management based on the ambient conditions. Research is being conducted to determine the best suited mask for such working conditions. Further research needs to be undertaken to find if feeling of discomfort is felt by the workers due to which there is a decrease in productivity.","fatigue and strength anand n umrani phd student of industrial and production engineering department, vishwakarma institute of technology, pune, india (anand.abhiman@gmail.com) varsha karandikar prof., industrial and production engineering department, vishwakarma institute of technology, pune, india (varsha.karandikar@vit.edu) shraddha karandikar ug student, mechanical engineering department, mksss’s cummins college of engineering for women, pune, india (shraddhakarandikar28@gmail.com)",
67,A Comparative Study On Pandemic Response And Their  Impact On Economic Growth: Evidence From Covid-19,"coronavirus strikes again with the delta variant and puts the world in a phase 3 pandemic state. countries all over the world have adopted different response mechanisms to contain the virus's spread. health officials call for lockdown strategies as covid-19 cases rise in most countries. in a faster and more effective worldwide vaccination scenario, leading economies are racing towards ""herd immunity"" under an optimistic hypothesis, speeding the world's economic recovery. the justification behind countries making a move towards the open community approach is to keep the economy in good shape. validating both ""lockdown"" and ""herd immunity"" approaches, scandanavian countries were studied in this paper. sweden, a nordic member state that follows an open economy approach, and; denmark, finland, and norway that follows strict social-distancing and lockdown strategies as a measure to flatten the curve were considered in this study. this can help assess each government policy's success or failure against containing the virus. ibm cognos business intelligence platform is used to visualize the different factors affecting the economy namely, the number of infected people and the number of deaths per country. the analysis revealed that sweden chose an open economy strategy, failed to sustain a stable economy, and continued its upward trajectory with a rising number of virus-related deaths. the comparison of gross domestic product (gdp), inflation, and unemployment rates showed sweden as one of the least, if not the worst, among other nordics in flattening the curve. this research thus contradicts the notion of herd immunity as a measure to sustain a healthy economy to be no longer valid.","coronavirus, pandemic, lockdown, herd immunity","It is seen from the study that Sweden is one of the countries that adopted the herd immunity approach for fighting the virus, while others opted for partial and full lockdown strategies. This research investigated and compared different data for the selected Nordic countries to understand the effectiveness in their response mechanism to flatten the curve. These selected countries have a lot in common, such as common geographic boundaries, culture, and monetary values, and many more, which will help assess each government policy's success or failure against containing the pandemic. In conclusion, Sweden's choice of choosing an open economy on public safety was inappropriate since it failed to sustain a stable economy and exacerbated the overall number of new deaths. It has drained the health care system, and when considering the spread of the virus due to travel, it will affect other nations. The comparison of GDP, Inflation, and unemployment rates showed that Sweden was one of the least if not the worst among the other Norden regions. So, any argument that the option of herd immunity was made to sustain a healthy economy can no longer stay valid. A dashboard was created to study all the factors together, as shown in Figure 8. Figure 8. Covid-19 visualization dashboard for Nordic countries The novel Coronavirus has been declared a pandemic. Therefore, even though it is detrimental to their economies, countries should take the right steps to monitor the spread of this disease. Future research can be conducted to study the correlation between these different factors. The authors could not do this due to various time intervals for each element and pandemic dynamics being a wicked problem. For future research, the authors suggest in understanding the Global Health Security (GHS) dynamics post the pandemic recovery through the lens of sustainability and global sustainable development goals.","outbreak in scandanavia nasser al-jurf, georges atallah, salim ali al yafei, adeeb a. kutty, thejas vivek, ahmed abadi, murat kucukvar mechanical and industrial engineering department college of engineering, qatar university doha, qatar nasser.aljurf@qu.edu.qa, ga1912343@student.qu.edu.qa, sa1206682@student.qu.edu.qa akutty@qu.edu.qa, tv1900798@student.qu.edu.qa, aa1904826@student.qu.edu.qa, mkucukvar@qu.edu.qa",

70,Fdm 3D Printing Parameters Optimization:   The Key Role Of Line Width,"additive manufacturing technologies have evolved rapidly and steadily over the last decade and they become widely used not only in large, high-level companies, but also in medium-sized industries for both the production of prototypes, mockups, and the production of finished components. stratasys' patented fused deposition modelling (fdm) technology, or more generally fused filament fabrication (fff), is by far the most cost-effective additive manufacturing (am) technology especially if compared to powder technologies such as selective laser melting. it offers an extremely wide range of materials from nowadays mainstream, low-cost polylactic acid to the more advanced carbon fiber peek. the use of this technology is usually finalized on the production of prototypes and few case studies of end-use components can be found in the literature. this is due to the difficulties in predicting the final behavior of the resulting component and the presence of defects that can cause unpredictable premature failures in the component. this study focuses on describing how it is possible to reduce the defects present in the component with a careful choice of printing parameters and in particular focus on the effect of the parameter called “line width” and its correlation with the geometry of the printable part. the results would help to make fff a more reliable process that could be used for obtaining a reliable, industrial production as well as prototype manufacture.","optimized fff, fdm defects","The mathematical Gcode-based model demonstrated the importance of the line width as a crucial slicing parameter in the FFF process. This parameter has a direct effect on the number and final volume of defects obtained in the printed component. A reduction on the volume of defects proven to be feasible by means of a modification of input printing parameters and correct hardware selection. Furthermore, changing the percentage of volume of defects implies that mechanical characteristics of the material would change accordingly and can be compromised because of poor choice of printing settings for a given 3D printed part. This approach and the use of a mathematical model with “standard” predefined condition made possible to make a valuable comparison between different slicing settings and therefore appreciate the theoretical gain in defects reduction with the given setting. This work consequently represents a step forward in order to turn FDM technology processes into the mainstream production of components with higher mechanical properties and that would turn this process feasible for creating structural-applicable parts. 6. Future Developments To extend this study and consider further parameters like positioning defects of the machine and filament tolerances. To extend this algorithm for the evaluation of defects also on complex geometries. To identify a correlation between defects volume and mechanical properties of the specimen by means of tensile test.","patrich ferretti, christian leon-cardenas, elisa ciotti, gian maria santi, giampiero donnici, leonardo frizziero department of industrial engineering alma mater studiorum university of bologna viale risorgimento, 2 – 40136, bologna, italy patrich.ferretti2@unibo.it, christian.leon2@unibo.it, elisa.ciotti@studio.unibo.it, gianmaria.santi2@unibo.it, giampiero.donnici@unibo.it, leonardo.frizziero@unibo.it",

72,A New Approach To Two Stage Capacitated  Warehouse Location Problem (Tscwlp),"in this paper, we give a new method for solving the mid cplp problem that results when vertical decomposition is applied to two-stage capacitated warehouse location problem (see sharma and agarwal (2014)). in the mid cplp problem, warehouses are locatable in stage 1 and stage 2 (thus incurring fixed costs), and we incur transportation costs as goods are transported from stage 1 to stage 2. here in mid cplp, we minimize the sum total of the cost of warehouse location (stage 1 and stage 2) and transportation. in the method due to sharma and agarwal (2014), the decomposition is followed where location variables at one of the stages are relaxed, and it is reduced to lhs cplp (left hand side capacitated plant/warehouse location problem), and reasonable bounds are obtained by the procedures given by verma and sharma (2007). thus, in the method, due to sharma and agarwal (2014), the problem tscwlp is reduced to lhs cplp, mid cplp (that is again reduced to lhs cplp) and an rhs cplp. this paper reduces the problem tscwlp to lhs lp (linear program), mid cplp and rhs lp (linear program). it is expected to offer good computational advantages. this procedure is outlined in detail in this paper. proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management bangalore, india, august 16-18, 2021 © ieom society international 1",,"In this paper we give a new relaxation scheme for solving problem TSCWLP that leads to 2 LPs and one MID CPLP problem (that is intractable). In the earlier method due to Sharma and Agarwal (2014) the problem TSCWLP was decomposed into one LHS CPLP, one MID CPLP and one RHS CPLP (all three of them are intractable). The method given in this paper could offer computational advantages (as only one problem is computationally intractable; and other two LPs (RHS LP and LHS LP) can be solved by polynomial time procedure to get a good upper bound and lower bound).

79,A Linear Optimization Model For Reducing Co2 Emission  From Power Plants,"the adverse impact of climate change is possibly decreased by reducing the anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. as the coal-fired power plant is the primary source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide generation, our research work focuses on the maximization of capturing of released carbon dioxide from the power plant. this paper proposes capturing carbon dioxide by considering decisions regarding clean technology such as carbon capture technology by linear optimization model. this paper's other contribution is to solve the optimization problem considering the loss of energy due to the implementation of the clean technology, which is compensated by incorporating the coal-fired compensatory plant. with the introduction of compensatory plants, the model becomes nonlinear, which is managed by auxiliary equations. it is observed from analysis results that the proposed model is 35.62% more effective to capture carbon dioxide from the coal-fired power plants of orissa state in india due to the optimal selection of clean technology. these research works provide one of the paths in reducing the risk of exceeding a global temperature increase of 2 0c compare to the preindustrial period in the context of sustainable operations.","climate change, clean technology, carbon capture","The information provided in the above study concludes that CC technology must be developed to become effective in terms of cost. However, CC technology is a viable and clean technology to mitigate the problem of climate change. Long-term and more stable storage facilities must be developed. An interdisciplinary approach must be taken to tackle CCS issues like technological aspects, economic factors, timing issues, carbon cycle dynamics, and unstable and uncertain sustainability. It had to be widely accepted that government incentives are needed, and other stakeholders must support the power plant firm. Government incentives can provide incentives in many ways like giving tax incentives, provide funds at a cheaper rate for installation, provide funds for research and development of advancement in CCS to reduce its cost, and increase operational efficiency and lower energy requirement. Further, CCS technology’s validity in different manufacturing sectors helps in sustainable energy management and reduces overall CO2 emission in the atmosphere.","sasadhar bera department of operations management indian institute of management ranchi ranchi, india - 834008 sbera@iimranchi.ac.in",
80,Analyzing The Challenges In Humanitarian Supply Chain  Management In Emerging Economy,"the nature and extent of disasters are incrementing with the progressive nature of the economies across the globe. the uncertainty factor has made the global humanitarian agencies much more proactive to analyze the coming disasters before the generation of their impact. this resilient behavior has provided ample opportunity to the decision makers for identifying, planning, and progressing towards humanitarian supply chain management (hscm). the literature on hscm comprises studies dealing with the enablers or the challenges in delivering essential goods. the focus on understanding the relationships between the challenges is, however, missing from the literature. in this context, the present work aims to identify the challenges from the literature and decision-makers and to understand their relationships for a better decision-making process. the study utilizes the grey decision trial and evaluation laboratory (dematel) to identify the interrelationship between the challenges for effective hscm implementation. the major findings of the study are to understand the situation in an emerging economy like india for building a humanitarian supply chain operation network during pre and post-disaster scenarios.","challenges, grey dematel, globally","The study provides an analytical framework to the investors and policy makers in building effective and strong sustainable humanitarian supply chain. The research focused on scrutinizing the challenges in successful implantation of effective humanitarian supply chain in organizations, making them proactive and effective in meeting any unforeseen situations, preparing them for future challenges. In the literary work it was analyzed that all the authors used a limited number of challenging factors for their research lacking in making a comparative analysis in finding the relative importance of the factors critical for implementing successful and resilient humanitarian supply chain network in organizations. The research gap identified through detailed literature review makes the study relevant when it examines the interrelation between cause and effect of humanitarian supply chain . The problem that we came across is that all the papers identified have focused their research on challenges and ways for implementing humanitarian supply chain but lacked in analyzing the cause - effect of the critical factors required in building successful HSC framework in organizations. The study adopts Grey DEMATEL methodology to understand the interrelationship. The focus of the study was to recognize the critical successful factors for the industry and to find out the cause - effect relationship for the factors. To study the relationship grey linguistic terms were used to avoid uncertainty of data.

Non-anemic pregnant mothers would reduce the probability of stunting among for children aged under five years by giving birth to healthier and more nourished babies. Access to healthcare through adequate physicians improve child’s nutrition intake through more and better counselling on sufficient feeding practice information and guidance as well as early stunting diagnosis. Access to electricity can also reduce stunting through increase access to nutritious feeding practice information among mothers with under five years of age children. Better economic development achievement could prevent stunting through better resources to nutritious food for children aged under five years. Therefore, countries, in particular low and lower and middle income countries, should improve maternal health, access to healthcare, infrastructure, and income in order to eradicate stunting.","wilson rajagukguk faculty of economics and business, universitas kristen indonesia jl. mayjen sutojo no.2, cawang, jakarta 13630, indonesia email: wrajagukguk@yahoo.com; wilson.rajagukguk@uki.ac.id john tampil purba department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu sidik budiono department of management faculty of economics and business universitas pelita harapan tangerang-15811, indonesia sidik.budiono@uph.edu gidion p. adirinekso department of management faculty of economics and business universitas kristen krida wacana, jakarta, indonesia gidion.adirinekso@ukrida.ac.id",
84,Potential Of Lean To Minimise Implementation Costs Of  Building Information Modelling (Bim): A Conceptual,"building information modelling (bim) is a combination of technological processes in which the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of any construction project can be digitally managed. even though bim’s promising nature has been appraised in scholarly works, it is not yet being fully implemented in the construction industry. many scholarly works have identified cost headings of the bim implementation as the major barriers for a successful bim implementation. as a come-up strategy, lean construction principles (lcp) can be used to minimise the wastes which do not add value to the construction. therefore, the aim of this research to develop a lean integrated bim framework to minimise the cost headings of bim implementation. accordingly, an extensive literature survey was conducted to develop a conceptual framework by identifying the cost headings and the possible expectations with the bim implementation and identifying the applicable lean construction principles to optimise the value of bim implementation with respect to each cost heading as the objectives of this study. so that, this study has identified the bim implementation with the expectations of the stakeholders and the associated cost headings. further, bim implemented projects have been compared with the traditional projects to identify the major benefits. addition to that, lcp were discussed with the benefits of its usage. therefore, this framework lays down the guidance for construction industry-related firms to find their capabilities and competence to implement bim with the integration of lean construction principles. hence, this research will be effective for the construction industry as the major barrier for the bim implementation has been recovered with the strategy of lean construction principles.",engineering,,framework lichini nikesha kumari weerasinghe department of building economics university of moratuwa sri lanka lichininikesha@gmail.com himal suranga jayasena department of building economics university of moratuwa sri lanka suranga@uom.lk akila pramodh rathnasinghe faculty of engineering and environment northumbria university united kingdom akila.rathnasinghe@northumbria.ac.uk,
85,Electronic Device For Early Detection Of Infection At  Crowded Places,"in the last decades, the world has undergone rapid changes including demographic explosions, population movement, increase in international trade and travel, emergence of new pathogens. to respond to this changing environment, there is a need to develop the capacities of the systems to detect, notify and respond to health risks that may constitute a threat to human health. the ongoing covid-19 epidemic highlights the need for effective tools capable of predicting the onset of infection outbreaks at their early stages. early warning systems are therefore an essential requirement for a robust public health emergency work. fever is a common symptom in infectious processes. a subject with high temperature in a crowed place could become the zero subject of an outbreak. keeping this in mind, i have designed a non-invasive low-cost electronic device that senses and displays the temperature of individuals. the prototype was made with low-cost electronic components. this electronic device will allow to monitor the temperature of individuals in crowded places. the device can be installed at busy places like train stations, schools, malls or hospitals etc. visitors can check their temperature before they enter the site. the prototype has two sensors: a thermal sensor, and an ultrasonic distance sensor. the temperature sensors operate on a one-to-one basis. rather than looking at a crowd of people, this setup scans one person at a time. scanning is very fast. every 3 seconds a temperature reading is processed and can be displayed. this allows to quickly process large groups of people. it performs the skin temperature measurement with an accuracy of ±0.5°c. the setup measures the temperature, when a person is within less than 25cm from the sensor. another sensor used is ultrasonic distance sensor. this sensor is used in applications where measuring distance or sensing objects are required. it has two eyes like projects in the front which forms the ultrasonic transmitter and receiver. the sensor works with the simple high school formula that distance=speed x time. this sensor in the device helps in maintaining a safe distance between two people entering the site. while entering if the distance is less than defined norms there will be buzzer thus ensuring no over crowding at point of entry. the device can be installed at the entry gates of any establishments. this is one of the tools to keep malls, businesses, schools, colleges or facilities of any kind open. the device enable the precise non- reactive, contactless recording of body temperatures and ensuring a safe distance at entry points hence, it is highly suitable from public health perspective.","fever, temperature, sensor, distance",,"kuhu sharma oakridge international school, mohali punjab, india sharmakuhu947@gmail.com",
86,Predictive Technology In Remote Competitive Product  Service Markets,"in recent times, predictive technology is altering product design and performance by incorporating new capabilities such as monitoring, control, and optimization. by predicting specific failure modes, such technology converts unplanned, uncertain failure events into planned ones, reducing the effective product failure rate. it thus enhances the service productivity of the oems that also offer product maintenance services. driven by these benefits, oems could use predictive technology to penetrate remote product service markets served by local fringe firms. in this paper, competition for service of products between the original equipment manufacturer (oem) and a fringe firm is studied using a sequential game-theory model. the oem utilizes predictive technology to reduce the product failure rate, and the fringe firm provides efficient service at a reasonable price. because of market remoteness, the oem is incapable of matching the local fringe firm's service quality. the price of service offered by the two players, the effective failure rate of the product when serviced by the oem, and the fringe firm's service quality drive the number of products in the service market. further, the captive market segment for oem service and the products' failure rate as seen by each player drive that player's service demand. in such a setting, the oem invests in predictive technology that reduces the effective failure rate of the products serviced by it. we find predictive technology benefitting both the players at higher failure rates, thus acting as a pareto improvement while implying co-existence in such remote product service markets. we further find the oem dominating the fringe firm with higher price and profits only when the oem captive market segment is large. biography amit joshi is currently pursuing his executive doctoral studies at the indian institute of management indore. he also leads a large team of data scientists and data engineers at a us based multinational at their india headquarters and possesses an overall work experience of over twenty years working in gas turbine, wind turbine and power management domains. his research interests include mathematical modelling, data science and operations research proceedings of the international conference on industrial engineering and operations management bangalore, india, august 16-18, 2021 © ieom society international 84",,,"amit joshi indian institute of management indore prabandh shikhar, rau-pithampur road indore - 453556, madhya pradesh, india. https://www.iimidr.ac.in fi16amitj@iimidr.ac.in",

89,Evaluation Of Operational Flexibility For A Manufacturing  Organization,"flexibility in the context of an organization is the ability of it to respond and cope with uncertainties. these uncertainties can be both internal as well as external. therefore, it has become very critical to manage and effectively react to several uncertainties posed by today’s changing environment. operational flexibility is a formative approach to meet the demand of a customer during a changing environment. the research focuses on operational flexibility at a micro-level in the context of an indian manufacturing organization, ‘xyz’. by referring to past literature and experts’ opinion, 7 main and 28 sub-attributes have been established as the parameters for measuring the operational flexibility index. the study is an approach to evaluate operational flexibility through the fuzzy logic approach. the research concludes that the organization is found to be ‘very flexible’ in its routine operations.","flexibility, attributes, fuzzy set theory","A manufacturing organization must deal with changes in its operations to breakout from threats posed by uncertainties and changing environments. Therefore, it is very crucial to incorporate flexibility for an organization in its routine operations. To empirically determine the level of operational flexibility in a manufacturing organization, the fuzzy logic approach is used. This approach is used to eliminate problems associated with vagueness complexities in the study. A conceptual model has been developed and seven important enablers of operational flexibility have been established. The first step for this study is established by collecting ratings and weights of attributes and sub-attributes consolidated through literature and industry experts’ opinions. Flexibility Index has been computed. The organization is found to be ‘very flexible’ by employing the Euclidean distance method to obtain operational flexibility level. The study is based on evaluation of flexibility in manufacturing organization. However, it can be extended to a series of other organizations of different sectors of economy. The study focuses and evaluates operational flexibility of an organization. Following this, it can be extended to other notions of flexibility such as organizational and supply chain flexibility. This method can help an organization to identify and monitor weaker areas in its operations that help determine flexibility. Following the study, it is evidently drawn that operations managers of the organization need to establish and improve material handling flexibility, labor flexibility and automation flexibility. This improvement can be done by focusing on a pool of factors explained in the study.","prasun sarote department of mechanical engineering national institute of technology patna, india prasunsarote@gmail.com cherian samuel, ajeet kumar yadav department of mechanical engineering indian institute of technology (bhu) varanasi, india csamuel.mec@itbhu.ac.in ajeet.kryadav.mec17@itbhu.ac.in",

The detailed SD-SR diagrams presented above and block diagrams with layout showing material/personnel movement and information flow provide an insight into the functioning of entire supply chain by highlighting the interactions and associated responses from different participating actors/stakeholders. It also shows how interactions between one set of members affect the relationships and counter actions by another set of members and how selective actions and fulfillment of individual or group objectives of a depender element relies on a timely and collaborative response by the dependee which in turn results in smooth and continuous operation of the entire supply chain network thereby attaining the maximum customer service level objective. Also a robust and interactive payment system mechanism, role of government departments in facilitating online orders and tax payments and use of GPS and RFID for real time product tracking whether in transit or storage paves a way for successful utilization of cloud technology which in turn helps in efficient Inventory management at all levels leading to customer demand fulfillment by supermarket organizations (dealing mostly in FMCG and edible products). 5.1 Scope of Future Work A detailed study about different inventory management plans for different storage locations (DC, supply station, local warehouses, franchise stores) can be conducted in future for variable demand multi-product handling. Other food processing industries (bakery, beverages) situated in remote small city/ town /village areas can also be integrated further with the local cloud network of supermarket thereby promoting rural economic activities further and also enhancing total number of customers. The type of customers from each City A, B and town C can also be further categorized into regular, occasional and elite based on frequency and value of purchases exercised or purchasing behavior and based on their demand data, the inventory levels of different products can be optimized and sale offers for each separate type of customer can be customized accordingly. The transportation routes of supply and delivery agents or third party vendors can also be planned and optimized daily for better fuel economy and simultaneous reduction in order delivery time which can significantly improve net profit margin due to reduced costs and increased sales for supermarket and other contributing stakeholders..","dependency models rishabh tripathi, abhishek shukla and subhas chandra misra indian institute of technology kanpur kanpur-208016, uttar pradesh, india rishtrip@iitk.ac.in, abhiskl@iitk.ac.in, subhasm@iitk.ac.in",

95,Ui Greenmetric Ranking Of Turkish Universities Using  Entropy Weight And Copras Methods,"sustainability is one of the most important issues nowadays. the university of indonesia (ui) created ui greenmetric in 2010 as a result of the necessary researches on what is done in terms of sustainability in universities and what can be done on the university basis. in ui greenmetric, universities can see their positions in the whole world by which criteria they can work on sustainability. the ui greenmetric criteria helped universities to measure their sustainability in economic, social and education dimensions. universities have measured their sustainability in six different areas (setting and infrastructure, energy and climate change, waste, water, transportation, and education. universities that are greener and more conscious, giving importance to waste, water and education are ranked higher. in this study, this problem that includes conflicting criteria and alternatives (universities) is considered as a multi-criteria decision making (mcdm) problem. to solve this problem, two mcdm methods namely, entropy weight and copras (complex proportional assessment) methods, are applied to weight the criteria and to rank the universities, respectively. obtained ranking is compared with the current ranking and the suggestions have been made.","sustainability, ui greenmetric","Sustainability studies in universities are measured by a university ranking named UI GreenMetric. UI GreenMetric examines the sustainability activities of the universities and it help to universities about sustainability. Universities have measured their own sustainability in six different areas. Universities that are greener and more conscious, giving importance to waste, water and education are ranked higher. In this study, Turkey GreenMetric of 2020 data is analyzed and the problem is considered as a MCDM problem. To overcome this MCDM problem, Entropy Weight and COPRAS methods are applied to weight the six criteria and rank the 56 Turkish universities. To provide an alternative rank, TOPSIS approach is also applied. According to the results the most important and unimportant criteria for Turkey, are determined as Water and Setting and Infrastructure, respectively. When the universities are ranked using COPRAS and TOPSIS methods, Istanbul Technical University and Middle East Technical University are still placed as top two universities as in UI GreenMetric ranking. For future, (i) different MCDM approaches such as analytic hierarchical process and the analytic network process can be applied to consider expert opinion, and (ii) fuzzy approaches should be considered to reflect the uncertainty of experts’ opinion in connection with the first suggestion.

97,Failures Of Indian Toy Industries: Problem Identification  And Proposed Solutions Through Field Visit,"toys are an important part of children life and also for their parents. in indian, toys are also connected with culture and festivals, but indian toys industries have failed to establish themselves not only globally but also locally. this paper focuses on indian toy industries, which are ignored previously, and now the indian government has taken multiple initiatives to boost this sector's scale. so this paper addresses the issue of the indian toy industry with its solution. the current paper will address the problems of the indian toys industry and propose solutions to those problems. the research is based on the field visit performed by the authors. during the visit, some interviews of toy manufacturers were performed, which helps to identify the problems related to the toy industry. this problem helps us understand why the toys industry fails in india and guide us to propose solutions for the respected issues. the data collection was done in india's delhi/ ncr region, which holds the major stakeholders of the indian toy industries. after the data collection, the experts' team has proposed solutions. the findings of the paper suggest that india has a great potential to become a world leader in the field of toys manufacturing, but lacking due to government policies, fewer skills, high-cost technology, less variety etc.",innovation,"The team's visit explored several angles of the problem facing the Indian toy industry, including the design and innovation challenges faced by the supply chain management of the toy industry. While various issues were explained in the previous section of the paper, many more still need to be explored. Initially, the manufacturers were reluctant to talk about the lack of government support in their opinion, but they were open and talked about the possible inputs / results of the government agencies concerned. After the visit, the team reported that design and innovation is an important part of this industry, which can lead to field scale. Visit also explores the loopholes in various government industry support programs, including a corporate finance affiliate that is only given to people who buy things by lending and not with their own capital. Likewise, fairs that promote this industry by the government are also not appreciated (the media do not promote, their stands are not well recognized, people under 18 are prohibited from entering. , etc.). In this way, they opened up to the following possible government outcomes- • Research and development in this area needs more attention than ever before. • There is a shortage of skilled workers, so skills development programs for this sector are very important. • Design is a major issue for these industries, particularly in terms of cost and competence. It is therefore necessary to focus more on qualified designers, which will make the design part more efficient in the field. • Innovation can be a better solution to material and process problems.

99,Clustering Of Maintenance Work Data For Failure Mode  Discrimination.,"a fast and efficient method to discriminate failure modes from maintenance work orders will facilitate and motivate proactive maintenance development. this paper aims to propose a faster and as efficient clustering methodology that differs from previous text mining attempts. text mining attempts are very dependent on correctly classifying text but the method proposed here is text independent. it is based on time to repair (ttr), time before failure (tbf) and other available identifiers. using k-means as the clustering algorithm, the processing speed was greatly reduced. singularity of discriminated failure modes were as good as previous text mining attempts.","failure mode, k-means, clustering, electrical","In terms of processing speed, the results show greatly higher speeds as compared to previous text mining processes (Salo et al. 2018). However, clustering of work orders by their TTR and TBF is not a perfect solution for discriminating failure modes from work orders. The results were not all singular and similar. Exceptions still exist as in other methods (Lin and Richi 2007). However, if for every cluster, results generally are not more than 3 different failure modes, as is seen in this clustering attempt, then the complexity of identifying failure modes have been simplified. The results however could be more singular and finer if more identifiers were available. It is proposed that future attempts add more identifiers such as asset numbers, part numbers, asset categories and others if available. Location and trade labelling could also be more granular. Having these nouns as discriminators, will further individualize the failure modes. In future, these clusters could be coded as failure codes that can be used by maintenance departments to tag future work orders. This would aid in making proactive and priority decisions. Added to this, is the recognition that each failure mode in a cluster have similar risks. Risks here being defined as the product of duration and frequency. Therefore, in terms of resource costs, discriminating by TTR and TBF has the added benefit of proactive task planning being prioritized by risks.","abdul rani achmed abdullah, siti zura a jalil and nik nadzirah nik mohamed razak faculty of technology and informatics, universiti teknologi malaysia. a.rani@graduate.utm.my",
100,Servuction Procedures For Waste Collection Management  Through The Use Of Information Technologies And The Design,"according to the united nations and their human settlements program, 7.000 to 10.000 million tons of waste are produced every year in all the world causing a huge air, water and ground pollution. in cuenca, ecuador, waste management is carried out by the cuenca municipal public cleaning company, which indicates that there is a lack of recycling culture of the citizens due to ignorance about classification and separation of waste. therefore, it is proposed a user-centered mobile application adoption as an alternative solution to separate waste properly, considering design thinking and technology acceptance model. the findings of the study suggest that the app needs to be simple, intuitive, attractive and made up of classification, education and use. moreover, the study shows that the attitude of users about this app influences the intention to use it and also that the social image within cuenca influences the perceived ease of use of it.","design thinking, mobile application","The results obtained in the servuction framework and the Design Thinking methodology made it possible to clearly define that the mobile application must resolve doubts about waste classification, contain environmental information, include advice on how to reuse materials, educate users and have a section on activism. Similarly, it is recognized that the main characteristics that citizens want in the mobile application are clarity, simplicity and quality. There are significant statistical values that indicate that the social image in the target market influences the perception of ease of use of the mobile application; and that the attitude of use with which users use the application influences the intention to use it. Therefore, it is important to establish promotion strategies emphasizing the importance of contributing to the care of the environment and its benefits. The mobile application initially proposed will have only three main functions (answering classification doubts, educating and advice on reuse of materials), which have been the most requested by the respondents, in order to avoid information overload. In addition, the design will include the most common characteristics of mobile applications, the recommendations and suggestions provided in the DT; thus, generating a mobile application focused on users.","thinking methodology claudia contreras silva, esteban crespo-martinez production and operations engineering, universidad del azuay cuenca ecuador claucontreras@es.uazuay.edu.ec",
101,Diagnosis And Detection Of Ic Engine Fault At End Of Line  Engine Vibration Measurement System With Machine,"diagnosis and detection of mechanical fault in an internal combustion engine at the end of line engine testing is very crucial to deliver customer a defect free healthy engine. currently engine testing operator uses his subjective hearing expertise to diagnose and detect any abnormal noise coming out from the engine. subjective engine testing leads to continuous noise exposure to operators, possibilities of defective engine go to customer due to hearing fatigue of the operator, there are few abnormal noises which are beyond human perception which sometime manifest itself when it is loaded on the vehicle and in few cases, there is bias among the operators’ perceptions as the testing is subjective in nature. more over operators needs rigorous training to become an expert of engine noise testing. the theme of the project is to convert the subjective engine testing to objective engine testing by developing an engine vibration measurement system and deploy a machine learning algorithm model which can detect the faulty engine and also diagnose the type of fault (head noise, gear damage, whining noise etc.) in the engine with less or no manual intervention. the vibration measuring system consist of three unidirectional accelerometer sensors with magnetic mounting base which can be mounted on the three different locations of the engine. vibration data is captured by a vibration analyzer hardware at three different engine speeds. statistical method is used to extract the time domain and frequency domain features data and feature ranking method is used to reduce the dimensionality of the features. we have collected more than 550 engines vibration data combination of both healthy engines as well as 5 types of typical faulty engines occurred at the production line including operator’s remark. auto associative kernel regression (aakr) model is used to separate the faulty engines from the healthy engine and it will also rate the engine health on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 stands for excellent and smooth engine and 1 stands for severely faulty engine. random forest (rf) model is used to classify the type of fault in the engine. we have conducted a blind test with a set of healthy and faulty engines, we have achieved overall accuracy of 83.7% with true positive rate of 94 % and false positive rate of 25% for the health index model. engine diagnostic model yields an overall accuracy of 75.9%.",machine leaning,"In this paper we have addressed the one of the major challenges of the automotive industry to objectify the engine end of line testing with a modern vibration data acquisition system and machine learning algorithm. For our application we have used vibration sensor instead of acoustic sensor to get rid of the noise interference from neighbor machines. We have found vibration data also yield satisfactory in terms of separating the faulty engine from good engine.

102,The Impact Of The Covid-19 Pandemic On The Energy  Sector,"the purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the energy sector. with the widespread closures of business and decrease in travels due to the pandemic, there have been significant falls in electricity, coal, gas, and nuclear power consumption. disruptions in manufacturing facilities and pauses on construction projects bring uncertainty about energy growth in 2021. in the past, similar drops in emissions occurred such as the global financial crisis of 2008 but resulted in a rebound of global co2 emissions when the market recovered. however, the pandemic brings forth unique risks and uncertainties for industries and governments in having to balance safety with progress. for this covid-19 related recession, governments have the chance to pivot energy consumption by incentivizing renewable energy sectors like wind, solar, hydrogen, and energy storage that reduce the carbon footprint. investing in renewables could stimulate economic recovery and aid in the transition to a more sustainable future. however, we see significant declines in such investments. we investigate how the energy industry was affected by and could recover from the challenges set forth by the pandemic and how this recovery could incentivize clean energy technologies.","sustainability, covid-19 pandemic, renewable energy, fossil fuels","COVID-19 has presented the world with a unique opportunity. It has forced change that once seemed out of reach. The rapid reduction in emissions has laid the groundwork for transitions to occur in the way we use energy. However, it is unfeasible to expect energy reductions to last as the virus’s prevalence fades and people return to their “normal” lives. Travel will become popular again, and businesses will be able to handle a greater capacity. Due to oil and coal’s current low prices, there is a strong chance that we will increase our dependency on them over renewable energy sources. In 2008, the financial crisis resulted in greenhouse gas emission reductions of 1%, but it was short-lived. By 2010, carbon emissions grew 5.1%, reaching a record high (Le Quéré et al. 2020). This was the result of both the economy naturally returning to its previous state as well as government stimulation of the oil and gas economy. Because climate change is a slow process, the effects are not so immediate but pose a serious threat to human health and life as we know it. Yet, if we use this base of emission reductions to shift to an increase in renewable energy use and low carbon infrastructure, we may be able to have a greater positive impact, both environmentally and economically. As the economy rebuilds itself in the wake of COVID-19, increasing investment in renewable energy can increase employment, stimulate the economy, and, of course, lower carbon emissions. The COVID-19 global crisis resulted in a rapid response from the government, showing us that it is possible to induce a rapid change in a worldwide emergency (Khanna 2021). However, this example also solidifies that both policymakers and individual consumers will need to commit to the change necessary to curb climate change. As 2021 progresses, there will be many opportunities to expand upon this research as more COVID-19 pandemic impacts take effect. An example of such will be the projected shortage in truck drivers expected to occur this summer, potentially having supply chain impacts on many energy sectors such as gasoline (Isidore 2021). Additionally, a review of alternations in companies’ risk evaluation procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic should be studied as infrastructure is put in place to avoid hazard risk. In the same vein of consideration should be a further study in government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and how these responses to hazard risk affect consumer demand. These studies, if conducted over the next year, can further the research of this paper, with the potential to lay indicators for future global issues such as climate change.","giorgio agostini, christian berger, delaney hall, salaar khan, michael pennington and mohamed awwad department of industrial and manufacturing engineering california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa gagostin@calpoly.edu, chberger@calpoly.edu, dhall10@calpoly.edu, mkhan12@calpoly.edu, mapennin@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",
103,The Impact Of The Computer Chip Supply Shortage,"the goal of this research is to explore solutions to recent shortages in the computer chip supply chain. the covid- 19 pandemic revealed weakness in the supply chain for computer chips. with more industries needing computer chips for their products, particularly the automotive industry, a shortage caused by shutdowns in china after the pandemic led to a rise in prices of consumer goods. in this research, we focus on the technicalities of the computer chip supply chain to find methods of preventing shortages and improving the overall supply chain to avoid future shortages. this is particularly important with the increased dependence on computer chips in products. india has shown success with its government incentives to encourage reshoring of computer chip manufacturing, so there is less dependence on other countries to obtain chips. it is recommended that the us follow india’s lead and encourage reshoring of computer chip manufacturing to reduce the likelihood of shortages in the future.","computer chip, semiconductor, fabless foundry, covid-19","COVID-19 has brought awareness to the necessity of restructuring the US semiconductor supply chain. Offshoring of chip fabrication has made the US dependent on other countries for production. During normal times, the offshoring of production has been largely beneficial to US fabless companies and IDMs looking to outsource the cost of manufacturing to other entities. However, COVID-19-induced supply chain issues caused US shortages in key chips necessary for manufacturing everything from cars to laptops. The US is strong in design and R&D but lacks the fabrication infrastructure necessary to ensure a steady in-country supply of chips for domestic use. The US chip shortage has halted production in industries such as automotive, even as demand is at an all-time high. As automobiles transfer to be completely autonomous and electric, semiconductors are drastically rising in demand, and the country’s supply lines heavily rely on other countries such as Taiwan, Japan, and Europe for semiconductor supply. This reliance is detrimental, as any disasters such as COVID-19 or increased tensions with these countries can completely halt the supply chain. Chip shortages have also affected the cellular industry as networks upgrade to 5G. Chips are necessities for developing the 5G infrastructure cellular providers need to fully roll out 5G across the country. In addition, consumer demand for 5G phones and laptops is increasing rapidly, and a steady supply of chips is necessary to keep up with this demand (Leprince-Ringuet, 2021). To ensure a steady future supply of chips, it is recommended that the US Government provide incentives for in-country manufacturing and reshoring of production. The US should consider following the lead of countries such as India, which use government policies to incentivize computer-chip manufacturers to re-shore and ramp up production. This will reduce reliance on other countries, as well as bring more sustainability and regulation to the supply chain and jobs back to the states. It is also recommended that the US explore the use of mathematical models to optimize the current supply and reduce the frequency of shortages. The research discussed in this paper is not exclusive and is ongoing. The state of the semiconductor supply chain is continuously evolving, necessitating further research on best practices for maintaining a steady chip supply. Future research is needed on effective government policy for incentivizing in- country fabrication, in addition to developing methods for diversification of semiconductor supply chains. Furthermore, research is needed on the future of IDMs and what they can do to remain competitive with the rise of the fabless-foundry model.","hannah casper, autumn rexford, david riegel, amanda robinson, emily martin and mohamed awwad department of industrial and manufacturing engineering california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa hcasper@calpoly.edu, abrexfor@calpoly.edu, driegel@calpoly.edu, arobin21@calpoly.edu, emart148@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",

105,Application Of Economic Order Quantity (Eoq) For Maketo-Order (Mto) Business,"research about the implementation of the economic order quantity (eoq) model is mostly done only for implementation in make-to-stock (mts) companies. there has not been much recent research about the implementation of the eoq model to companies that use make-to-order (mto) business production strategy. therefore, by considering the research gap as well as the need of mto businesses to reduce their costs, the implementation of the eoq model is applied to pt x, which is an mto company that produces steel wheel disc. the aim of this research is to discover a better order quantity planning method by comparing the holding cost between pt x’s production system before and after the implementation of the eoq model. the results of analysis, calculation, and validation of order quantity planning using the eoq model showed that the implementation of the eoq model for order quantity planning in pt x can reduce the number of losses caused by holding costs. the research is conducted assuming the supplier is a make-to-stock producer that is capable of meeting production demand with at most 1 week lead time.",,"is based on the negative mean and median values of the difference between the ending stock before and after the implementation of the EOQ model is negative as is shown in Table 4. 6. Conclusion With the assumption of not more than one week lead time, we identified economic order quantities of the raw material Steel Plate 9 mm that is aligned with PT X's technical constraint of using the MTO business production strategy. The results of analysis and calculation of order quantity using the EOQ model showed that the implementation of the EOQ model for order quantity planning in PT X can reduce the number of losses caused by holding costs. However, the decrease of holding cost also means there is a higher ordering cost. In the case of PT X, the increase experienced by ordering costs is not greater than the decrease in the amount of holding costs. Therefore, at the end of the calculation, it is concluded that the implementation of the EOQ model for order quantity planning delivered a higher profit. This is proven through the validity test using the Wilcoxon One-Sample Test. From the results of the validation test, it is proven that the implementation of EOQ reduces the ending stock of PT X which also means a reduction of its holding cost and an increase of its profit. Therefore, we can conclude that MTO companies can reduce their inventory cost through reducing their holding cost by implementing the EOQ model. This study was completed with various constraints. The main research constraint is constraint regarding the supplier limitations of only being able to do shipment once a month. To make the implementation of EOQ model to MTO businesses more practical, it is suggested to do further research about development of an EOQ model that can consider this shipment constraint. The research has also identified an opportunity for improvement that can be researched further if PT X changes its supplier of raw materials to a supplier that does not have such constraints. Hence, further research to improve PT X's inventory management and control can be done by implementing more novel theoretical EOQ models.","andreas parasian, hafsha rasyida sakti, intan karunia novarianti and rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, indonesia andreas.parasian@ui.ac.id, hafsha.rasyida@ui.ac.id, intan.karunia@ui.ac.id, rahmat.eng@ui.ac.id",

There was overproduction in the past years and can be solved by dropping the racks production based on forecasting results. By forecasting the supply, production, and demand helps in making production planning more effective. The production planning using MRP based on the forecast provides detailed information about material requirements for a period of time so it will clarify the needs and prevent the occurence of underproduction and overproduction problems. Using digital applications to build forecasting systems and MRP tools can make the production planning accessible and integrated, resulting in improvement of the production planning system.","requirements planning dwi ardian, julio febrian, thomson, rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering universitas indonesia depok, 16424, indonesia dwi.ardian91@ui.ac.id, julio.febrian@ui.ac.id, thomson91@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",
108,Improving Small Apparel Company’S Production Planning  Using Demand Forecasting And Material Requirement,"aggregate planning has been widely used by apparel manufacturers to gain maximum profit by finding the optimal solution between maximizing sales and minimizing production cost. commonly, small apparel companies use chase strategy, where production rates are varied for each time period to meet changes in demand. however, without an appropriate demand forecast and well-calculated production planning, this strategy cannot accommodate the fluctuating demand, causing recurring product stockouts which increases the number of unmet customer demands. to improve the company’s production planning, the number of demands is forecasted using single moving average method for each week of the upcoming month. the forecasted demand is then used to plan the production quantity using material requirement planning which helps ensure that all the demands are met while avoiding over-production by taking on-hand inventory into account. comparison between the former and the improved production planning method shows an increase in the company’s sales, increasing profit by 8.98% or equal to rp616.000. this concludes that the method proposed in this paper can be used as a simple yet effective way to improve the apparel company’s production planning, hence increasing the company’s profit.","forecasting, product stockouts","Whycotton is a small apparel company which applies chase strategy as their production plan method.

110,Implementation Of Time Series Forecasting Using Single   Moving Average Model A Case Study In Printing Industry,"the first step in optimizing the overall planning process is to develop a reliable forecasting process. in this paper we discuss the implementation of forecasting in the printing industry, forecasting the timing of demands is one of the critical issues. time series is a collection of observations made at regular time intervals and its analysis refers to problems in correlations among successive observations. a simple moving average model is a time series constructed by taking averages of several sequential values of another time series. to support the research, data collection from the firm is needed. in order to find the best model, the research will be supported by graphic visualization, analysis, and the accuracy of the single moving average model for demand forecasting with data obtained from the firm over the course of 1-2 years. the demand products are provided by cv. mitrakom bintang kemilau firm. in this paper we calculated 3 different data, two of the three are based on the types of product which have the most sales percentage within 2 years of production, shelf talker and wobbler, the other is total products produced by the firm. based on the three types of data we gathered two years in advance, we found evidence that forecasting data using the single moving averages model results in 30%-50% errors using the error standard of mean absolute percentage error (mape) supported by mean absolute deviation (mad) and mean squared error (mse).","forecasting, accuracy, printing industry","In this project, given that time series forecasting enables predicting the future through understanding the past, time series modeling and forecasting are important in a variety of practical domains. In the printing industry, forecasting future productions depend on capability to make predictions of significant products. After analyzing the graphic for both forecasted and actual data, error standards are calculated in measuring the differences between forecasted data in two different techniques and actual data are conducted. From the previous graphical and numerical results, we have concluded that the 3 different types of data itself are not in a regular state with some numbers of fluctuations occurring within the 2 years period of 2019 and 2020. Analysis of the data for the number of products differ in 3 ways has resulted in strong irregular components. This can happen as a result of the standard policy which the firm used in producing and selling the products to the customers.

Even though software is expensive, through linking society and academia as a response to social responsibility, Universidad del Azuay has developed this system, considering the guidelines for improving the productive matrix of the region and the country, through enhancing the growth of MSMEs. UDA-ERP is adaptable to any business model and does not require a considerable investment. The company that served as a pilot presented deficiencies in terms of control, therefore the implementation of the inventory module contributed to the management processes of this business area. Through the identification of the groups or classifications assigned to the different products, it is evident throughout the work that an ERP is a scalable, flexible, and low-cost solution, and that it can be used by SMEs in Ecuador at a required moment. For future research, it is recommended to evaluate the results of the implementation of all software modules, which will allow to identify advantages or disadvantages when implementing an ERP.

This can also be proven by the MAPE, MSD, MAD, and MSE values that are smaller than the Double Exponential Smoothing so that it shows more accuracy than the Double Exponential method with the details MAPE value 1,23664E+0, MAD value 2,20761E+05, MSD value 9,88990E+10, and MSE value 1,1227E+11. However, as the deviation value is still significantly far from the actual data, improvement needed to give the most accurate or as close result as possible to the actual data. For single exponential smoothing, obtained that the closest forecast is when the coefficient has the highest MAPE value while double exponential smoothing, obtained that the closest forecast is when the coefficient has MAPE value in between the lowest and the highest. According to the validation analysis, the smallest MAPE does not always give the closest forecast result but single exponential smoothing still gives the closest forecast value. We encourage the enterprise to always take considerations and examine others' forecast value results even though the MAPE value exceeds 20%.","demand forecasting fitted model indry maretania, muhammad rummy alfadjri, pradieqta uli paramesywarie and rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering, universitas indonesia, depok, west java 16424, indonesia indry.maretania@ui.ac.id, pradieqta.uli@ui.ac.id, muhammad.rummy@ui.ac.id, rahmat.eng@.ui.ac.id",

119,Driver Burnout And The Fuzzy Vehicle Routing Problem,"drivers are the foundation blocks of the transportation and logistics industries. any damage to the foundation can topple the entire structure. therefore, the well-being of drivers is of utmost priority and unfortunately, often overlooked. the availability of extensive literature on driver burnout and technological advancements in natural language programming (nlp) techniques motivated the development of the idea presented here. multiple research articles on driver behaviour, driver burnout and driver fatigue are analyzed using nlp on python to cluster the factors responsible for driver burnout. a burnout function is created using the controllable factors derived from nlp. this function is used as an objective in a multiobjective fuzzy vehicle routing problem (vrp). the problem is coded and solved using a genetic algorithm (ga) to derive trade-off solutions for the vrp and the well-being of the drivers. incorporating a driver burnout/well-being function in a fuzzy vrp, where the burnout function is created using factors derived from text analytics forms the novelty of the approach proposed hereafter.","driver burnout, fuzzy set theory, genetic algorithm",,"anisha khaitan department of operational research faculty of mathematical sciences, university of delhi new delhi - 110007, india anishakhaitan.du.or50@gmail.com",
120,Identification And Management Of Quality Costs In  Companies,"companies implement quality management systems to be more competitive and achieve organizational objectives efficiently; quality is essential for any type of company and is present in all processes that are designed with the purpose of guiding the company towards a culture of continuous improvement. because traditional cost accounting does not perform in-depth quality cost analysis, this research develops a methodology that allows companies to identify, quantify, and manage quality costs from an accounting perspective. the methodology used has a cross- sectional approach and analyzes companies as generic entities without focusing on a specific activity or sector, as results a process map is proposed to identify where the main quality costs are located, considering the main activities that can be develop within a company, then a chart of accounts is presented that allows recording the different costs related to quality, and finally indexes are proposed for their management. the method and results are consistent with traditional accounting and operations management. it can be combined with business management tools such as erp systems. this method can be of special interest to small and medium-sized companies due to the complexity and cost of having erps commercial systems that perform this type of analysis.",quality management,"Quality from the business point of view refers to a basic factor demanded by customers and fundamental for the competitiveness of companies, which is why quality is increasingly important as time goes by. In the same way, the importance of competitiveness lies in having knowledge of how to manage the organization's resources, increase productivity and recognize market requirements on time, which is why to obtain quality it is necessary to manage it, since it is efficient to produce goods or services, generating greater satisfaction at a lower cost. The methodological proposal of this research work tends to be systematic and continuous, since it is complemented with traditional and cost accounting, providing convenience and time savings. In addition, this methodology can be implemented in management systems, such as ERP systems, considering that common accounting and production management systems do not have a tool that allows managing quality costs as part of their main functions, it is In other words, common systems often do not provide a means to identify, classify, quantify and help manage these costs. Since the method was evaluated in a general way, it is necessary that those who apply it have knowledge in production management and accounting; o that interdisciplinary teams are formed for greater effectiveness in the use of the method; Applying the methodology requires knowing and understanding material requirements planning (MRP) and the structure of processes, as well as the accounting structure of the organization. The methodological proposal of this research work tends to be systematic and continuous, since it is complemented with traditional and cost accounting, providing convenience and time savings.

On the other hand, when applying the method, organizations may face difficulties in determining which activities are related to quality, and consequently, in which cost classification to locate it, since internally each company is different and they carry out their operations according to your business needs and goals. The method has the facility of being able to be implemented in any type of company, because it adapts to the activities and the chart of accounts of any organization, that is, the method is coupled to the accounting, administrative and management structure of the Business. In addition, the process that must be followed to implement this methodology is continuous, since, when establishing the process map, the cost-generating activities are determined and after this, these are classified relating them to the total quality of a product, in order to In this way, it is possible to identify in which macro process and sub- process the quality costs are found and, in turn, they can be managed in a specific way.","joselyn garcia-ortega and gabriela chica-contreras lidi, accountant and auditory school, universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador jgarcia@es.uazuay.edu.ec; magaby@uazuay.edu.ec juan manuel maldonado-matute and maria jose gonzalez calle uda business observatory, bussiness adninistration school universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador jmaldonado@uazuay.edu.ec; mgonzalez@uazuay.edu.ec catalina astudillo-rodriguez and paul crespo-martinez lidi, computer science engineering school, universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador cvastudillo@uazuay.edu.ec; ecrespo@uazuay.edu.edu ana vasquez-aguilera lidi, engineering of production school universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador anavasquez@uazuay.edu.ec",
121,Exploring The Use Of E-Learning In Chilean Universities:   A Study Using Structural Equations Modelling,"higher education institutions had to deploy e-learning for all their students during the year 2020 in chile, shifting from face-to-face to distance education. this change needed the adaptation of students to uncertain scenarios and affected the online system's outcomes. for example, there were issues with the internet connection, students got distracted easily, and they tend to turn off cameras so often they are losing face-to-face contact, and teachers were unfamiliar with the technology due to their age. this research explores the effects of online learning based on both technology acceptance and success models within this context. we conducted an online survey in engineering students belonging to chilean universities, using five variables: information quality, system quality, user satisfaction, behaviour intention, and actual use of e-learning. the study used the partial least squares path modelling technique to analyse the measurement and structural model. we conclude that the quality dimension had a more significant impact on user satisfaction. also, this satisfaction is an indirect antecedent of the use of e-learning systems. these findings show the importance of the system's characteristics in the final acceptance of the e-learning system by chilean university students in the context of a pandemic.","e-learning, higher education, is success model","This research explored the effects of e-learning on technology uptake and success models in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic in Chile. We conclude that the quality dimension has had a more significant influence on user satisfaction. Furthermore, this satisfaction constitutes an indirect precedent for the use of e-learning systems. These findings demonstrate the importance of system characteristics in the ultimate acceptance of the e-learning system by Chilean university students in the context of a pandemic.","mario andrés bruno faculty of engineering university of playa ancha valparaíso, cp 2360002, chile mbruno@upla.cl patricio ramírez-correa school of engineering universidad catolica del norte coquimbo, cp 1781421, chile patricio.ramirez@ucn.cl",
