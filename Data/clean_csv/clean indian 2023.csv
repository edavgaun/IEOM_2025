3,Application Of Genetic Algorithms To Optimize Distribution  In Food Transport Companies: A Systematic,"the article applies genetic algorithms as a tool of artificial intelligence that provides optimal solutions to the problem of vehicle routing in the distribution chain by transport companies. the main problem in the food sector is transporting perishable goods with low life expectancy. the methodology used for the present work was a systematic literature review focused on applying genetic algorithms in transport companies. to achieve this goal, a massive search was made in scopus, web of science, and proquest databases. a total of 60 articles were compiled for this document. for the study of the extracted articles, they were categorized into three factors: total costs in distribution, profitability, and delivery times. for the findings section, the use of vosviewer software was used. the use of this software allowed us to demonstrate that genetic algorithms would have a positive influence on each of the factors mentioned.","genetic algorithm, optimization",,"literature review ayre rosales dylan anndrei and garcia-lopez yvan jesus facultad de ingeniería- carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, perú 20170131@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe",
4,Solving Order Batching And Assignment Problem With  Multiple Pickers And Central Depot,"efficient and effective warehouse management is one of the most important issues in any supply chain. order picking, which occurs in a warehouse or distribution center (dc), is the most costly and labor-intensive operation. as a result, many researchers have focused on optimizing this process and finding near-optimal solutions. this study presents a heuristic solution approach to address the order batching and assignment problems in a warehouse with multiple pickers and a central depot. in the proposed method, order batching problem is solved using the proximity batching approach. additionally, a one-way s-shape routing strategy is implemented, as it is easy for order pickers to follow and reduces congestion in the aisles. in the literature, the majority of studies assume s-shape routing strategy in their solution approach. when assigning batches to pickers, workload balance among pickers is also taken into consideration. the proposed solution approach is applied to both a 6 aisle and 8-aisle warehouse layout. the performance of proposed solution approach is compared with first-come-first-served (fcfs) batching method and left-most depot location. the results indicate that constructing a central depot can slightly decrease the order picking distance. however, the followed batching strategy has a much greater impact on order picking performance when compared to the depot location. the proximity batching strategy can significantly reduce the order picking distance when compared to the fcfs batching approach. furthermore, pairwise comparisons demonstrate that a central depot location with a proximity batching strategy has the most positive effect on increasing order picking performance.","order batching, s-shape routing, assignment","and Future Research This study investigates the impact of depot location on order picking performance when employing a selected batching method with multiple pickers in 6-aisle and 8-aisle warehouses. Randomly generated order categories are used, with 10 experiments conducted for each category. The results of these experiments indicate that the selected batching method has a significant effect on decreasing order picking distance when compared different depot locations. In other words, batching methods significantly affect order picking performance. But the performance can also be increased a little by constructing central depot instead of left-most depot. As future research directions, the study suggests exploring the effects of storage strategies in conjunction with depot location and batching approaches, considering multiple pickers. Furthermore, investigating different routing strategies, such as largest gap or midpoint, in these future studies could be beneficial. Additionally, the development of constructive heuristics to achieve a more balanced workload among order pickers is worth exploring.","selma gülyeşil department of industrial engineering gaziantep islam science and technology university gaziantep, 27010, turkey selma.gulyesil@gibtu.edu.tr zeynep didem unutmaz durmuşoğlu department of industrial engineering gaziantep university gaziantep, 27310, turkey unutmaz@gantep.edu.tr",
5,Sagarsona-Mycorrhiza: A Miracle Bio-Fertiliser Combination  And Its Benefits In Agriculture For Sustainability,"the uniqueness of the present idea is to utilize the “combination of sagarsona and mycorrhiza” (de novo thinking product) for enhancing the productivity of paddy. the recent challenge in agriculture is how to regenerate and rejuvenate soils and stabilize production in the context of high chemical dependent production, and that will enable us to meet the goals of sustainable agriculture and provide safe and nutritious food security for all, especially the poor. sagarsona is an ideal organic manure prepared with locally available ingredients has been proved to be efficient at per with that of chemical fertilizers. while, the mutualistic associations between mycorrhiza (potent pesticide) and agriculturally important crops have shown the potential to increase crop productivity, thereby playing a key role in the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystem. the ultimate goal is to achieve sustainability by enabling local shg members along the ngo to support themselves financially in innovative ways instead of relying solely on grants and donations. essential of the success of social enterprise is an effective business model. sagar island is one of the epicenters of climatic hazards, by the recurrent cyclones (aila, etc.) in recent years and migration from the nearby island of ghoramara facing erosion into the sea and to plug them all by the recent corona pandemic and return influx of its people who ventured out for greener pastures. © ieom society international 48",,,"mahasweta guha 1* g-5/21, a.p. nagar, sonarpur, kolkata-700150, west bengal, india +919007717480; guhamahasweta2@gmail.com dr. amales misra 2 8/1b, raipur road east, jadavpur, kolkata-700032, west bengal, india +919002497090; amargram.pupa@gmail.com mahasweta guha 1* 1*asstt. teacher of pratapnagar giridhari high school, ph.d. scholar of zsi and wbsu active member of paribesh unnayan parisad (pupa). dr. amales misra 2 2retd. -scientist of zsi, secretary of paribesh unnayan parisad (pupa).",
6,Home Office Physical And Psychosocial Ergonomic Effects  On The Job Satisfaction Of Service Sector,"covid-19 pandemic brought several changes in the working conditions of employees, who had to adapt to new work modalities known as home office. the objective of this study was to identify the correlation between the physical and psychosocial ergonomic conditions of the home office environment of workers belonging to the service sector in peru and the effects of these conditions on their job satisfaction. for this purpose, a quasi-experimental methodology was designed with a mixed approach and a correlational scope, the ergonomic evaluation of the lest method and a job satisfaction questionnaire were used on a sample of 97 employees in the service sector in peru. after performing the pearson correlation using spss software, the hypothesis is rejected and, therefore, the alternative hypothesis is accepted, which confirms the existence of a correlation between the variables described before. an inverse and statistically significant correlation was found between the mental workload dimension of the lest method and job satisfaction.","ergonomics, job satisfaction, home office, lest method","that there is a significant inverse correlation between the two. This last correlation could be justified on the basis of arguments about work psychology, which consider the effects of workload in terms of stress, mental and emotional health, social interaction, among others. 5.2 Validation The finding of the present research is the inverse and statistically significant correlation between the job satisfaction variable and ergonomic conditions in the home office. Similar studies have not been found because this work modality is recent and there are still no articles about it. In this way, the importance of ergonomic conditions in the workspace is demonstrated, within the framework of a new work context that has arisen as a result of the pandemic. To expand this research, a more specific approach could be made, by studying the most covid affected sectors. The results obtained in the sample of 97 employees in the service sector in Peru, show that an average of 23% of respondents reported having average discomfort in the mental workload dimension, which compares with the study conducted in Spain by the National Institute of Safety and Hygiene at Work (INSHT). The latter establishes that 22.5% of employees consider that work has a considerable effect on their health, and 28% of these indicate stress as the determining cause and the second health problem at work (Aboitiz, X. 2008). This research has used the LEST method that is applied in face-to-face work which is originally designed for work where there is a physical and repetitive effort involved in face-to-face work... a specific tool could be developed. Based on the study. Finally, the LEST method questionnaire was used, but not in the home office. For this reason, a specific tool could be developed to evaluate the ergonomic conditions of the home office, since some companies will remain in this new modality. This is evidenced in a study by Adobe Forrester, which shows that 39% of companies state that they will adopt telework permanently. Likewise, the ILO states that the home office will not end with the end of the pandemic, as it will be part of the new normal in the future along with other digitalization tools (Forbes Staff, 2021). 6. Conclusion After performing the Pearson correlation between the results obtained in the evaluation of the LEST Method and the job satisfaction survey, it is concluded that there is a correlation between the physical and psychosocial ergonomic conditions of the home office and the job satisfaction of employees in the service sector in Peru. Finally, mental workload is the dimension of the LEST method that has the most significant correlation with job satisfaction, and since it is inverse, it indicates that the greater the mental workload, the lower the job satisfaction of the worker in the home office.","employees in peru nicolle guerinoni lahoud, lucienne valerie gygax iglesias facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima lima, peru 20170678@ulima.edu.pe; 20170698@ulima.edu.pe ezilda maria cabrera gil grados associate professor facultad de ingeniería universidad de lima lima, peru ecabrera@ulima.edu.pe",

8,"Safety Model Based On 5S, Tpm And Work Standardization  To Reduce The Accident Rate In An Sme","the construction sector is an important driver of the economy and a generator of employment, but it has high occupational accident rates each year. in peru, small construction companies lack an occupational health and safety management system, which is reflected in the number of accidents reported each year, which is as high as 3,000. therefore, it is important to look after the welfare of the most valuable asset of each company: the worker. this paper presents a proposal for a safety model based on lean tools: 5s and tpm, and work standardization to reduce the accident rate in a peruvian construction sme. the proposed model is divided into three components that represent the application of each of the tools. it also consists of four phases and a duration of two months divided into four fortnights. finally, the results obtained were favorable, reducing the accident rate by 75% with respect to the initial situation.","security model, 5s, tpm","Due to the implementation of the proposed model in which the three methodologies are applied: 5s, TPM and work standardization, a reduction in the accident rate from 5.56 to 1.39 was obtained, exceeding the expected value; These results were significant for the analysis, since with this the correct functioning of the model could be verified. In addition, it managed to improve 100% in the correct use of PPEs and standardized activities, which allows the worker to feel safe, motivated and committed to their work. In addition, accident prevention reduces time lost due to sick leave, avoids delays in projects, prevents damage to company assets and avoids interruptions within work. Safety and health at work is a relevant issue within a construction company due to the need to protect workers and guarantee their well-being. The implementation of this type of safety model can help take appropriate safety measures and form occupational risk prevention to reduce the accident rate, protecting not only the physical and mental integrity of employees, but also reducing the costs associated with accidents. such as medical expenses and compensation for work disabilities.","in the construction sector lizbeth yahaira ostos-sánchez and renzo omar livia-chuzón facultad de ingeniería. universidad de lima. lima, perú. 20183008@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20182802@aloe.ulima.edu.pe martin fidel collao-diaz research professor facultad de ingeniería. universidad de lima. lima, perú. mcollao@ulima.edu.pe",
9,Service Model Based On Standardized Work And Supplier  Management To Increase The Nps In A Sme,"the growing boom of global gastronomy has been manifested in lima with a significant increase in japanese restaurants. despite this growth, customer satisfaction, a key factor for success, presents challenges. in the particular case of a restaurant, the problem lies in a net promoter score (nps) of -2%, considerably lower than the industry average (60%). this discrepancy, mainly motivated by the quality of the food, poses the challenge of raising the nps to the 60% standard. to address this challenge, a two-pronged approach is proposed: standardized work and supplier management. the first ensures consistent processes that guarantee quality consistency, while the second ensures the excellence of the ingredients used. the validation of this approach was carried out through a pilot test, based on surveys of 385 customers. the implementation of the model yielded significant improvements: an increase in nps to 62.5%, thus surpassing the industry average. additionally, the restaurant achieved a customer satisfaction score of 75% for food quality and 81% for waiting time. these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and its techniques, showcasing its ability to solve the identified problem and improve customer satisfaction.","standardized work, restaurant, net promoter score","According to the results obtained in the pilot test, it can be concluded that with the tools used, the NPS was increased to 62.5%, slightly above the industry standard of 60%. This means that customers were satisfied and would return, in addition to recommending the restaurant to others, resulting in an increase in new customers. Therefore, it is recommended that the restaurant prepares to meet higher demand. Another problem that was solved is the quality of the food, which was the main complaint of customers. This is reflected in the food CSAT, which was 53% before the implementation of the improvement, but increased to 75% after the improvement, meaning that 3 out of 4 customers are satisfied with the quality of the food. On the other hand, waiting time is one of the main issues that customers complained about, with 62% of customers being satisfied with it. Although the waiting times have not decreased, now 80% of customers are satisfied with the waiting time because they don't mind waiting a little longer in exchange for a good-quality product. It is important to note that this study was focused solely on the quality of the food, as there are other factors such as customer service and ambiance that influence customers' decisions. Finally, it is recommended to continue with surveys to gather more feedback and obtain even more precise data, as the pilot test had its limitations. Additionally, it is recommended to create a Best Practices Manual (BPM) to ensure the preservation of the implemented improvements and for future employees.","in the restaurant sector. luis ernesto morales-quevedo, mario mauricio delgado-leon facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20171011@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20172072@aloe.ulima.edu.pe martin fidel collao-diaz research professor facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú mcollao@ulima.edu.pe",

15,Machine Learning-Based Weldability Assessment And  Optimization Of Resistance Spot Welding Joints:,"resistance spot welding (rsw) is a crucial metal joining process across diverse industries, with a prominent role in the automotive industry. this paper proposes a conceptual framework of data-driven welding analytics by building a machine learning (ml) model and parameter-less optimization algorithm to assess the weldability of spot welded joints. it leverages experimental and simulation data to train the ml model, enabling it to predict weld quality accurately. various regression-based machine learning algorithms are implemented to predict weld nugget size. the performance of these algorithms is evaluated by three performance measures: root mean square error (rmse), mean square error (mse), and r-squared. the result shows that gaussian process regression outperforms other ml algorithms in predicting weld quality. furthermore, in addition to welding analytics, the proposed framework incorporates a teaching learning-based optimization (tlbo) algorithm to optimize expected weld quality. the robustness of this optimization algorithm is confirmed through 10 independent runs, maintaining consistent population size and termination criteria.",optimization,"The present study proposed a robust framework designed to predict and optimize the weldability of the RSW process. It incorporates all analytics phases, from real-time data collection to prediction of weld quality to optimization of the process parameters. The machine learning algorithm employed in this paper has significant potential to enhance prediction accuracy and add intelligence to the welding process. This approach can reduce the time required for destructive testing, substantially improving production efficiency by reducing lead time and overall operational costs. The novelty of proposed framework is not only to predict the weld quality but also optimize the predicted value. The beauty of this optimization algorithm is that it requires only population size and termination criteria, eliminating the need for algorithm-specific parameters that often require meticulous selection along with population size and termination criteria. However, this framework is not limited to only RSW. It may also be applied to other joining processes like l arc welding, laser welding, friction stir welding, TIG/MIG welding, etc","a data-driven framework vinayak gurav , divya shrivastava department of mechanical engineering, shiv nadar institution of eminence deemed to be university ncr-delhi, india vg697@snu.edu.in, divya.shrivastava@snu.edu.in",

18,Energy Efficient River Surface Floating Plastic Trash  Cleaning And Oil Soaking Robot,"the haphazard industrial waste management of the industries located on the banks of the rivers is seen as a cause of the south asian region's rivers becoming polluted. densely populated areas also get polluted from improper management of trash collection by the government. there on the rivers, the energy efficient river surface floating plastic trash cleaning and oil soaking robot can be used to clean the floating trash from the river surface and can simultaneously soak the oil from the river water. this robot uses river skimmer technology to filter floating trash from the river's edge. the robot's forearms are attached to an oil-absorbing hydrophobic melamine sponge material, which allows the floating robot to absorb oil from river water. the design and construction of this robot for cleaning and soaking up oil are discussed in this paper. the floating trash that comes with the tide is blocked by the hands of this machine. the filtered trash is then collected by a cleated conveyor belt controlled by an arduino uno r3 smd microcontroller. using a cm30-25npp-ec1 capacitive proximity sensor, this cleated conveyor belt separates plastic waste. the sensing end of the sensor emits an electrical field from 4mm up to 25mm, in order to detect the plastic trash. throughout this experiment, the design of hardware orientation and software operation for the robot’s operation is explained with construction. the eminent idiosyncrasies can also be used for future skimmer technology based robots, which will be capable of completing tasks with complex functionality.","river, clean, soak, oil",,"anika nawar⬚1, jowad md madha, shahed rahman, sad mubassir hasan department of mechatronics engineering, faculty of science and engineering world university of bangladesh dhaka, bangladesh - 1230 anika.nawar@outlook.com⬚1 mst sumi akter department of electrical and electronics engineering, faculty of science and engineering world university of bangladesh dhaka, bangladesh - 1230",
19,Potential For Producing Liquid Fuels From Co-Processing Of  Coal Fines And Municipal Solid Waste Plastics,"this study relates to an assessment for the potential to produce liquid oils by co-processing coal fines with municipal solid plastics waste using red mud from aluminium processing as a catalyst. this research seeks to promote environmental sustainability by utilising waste coal fines and municipal solid waste without creating health and environmental hazards. using municipal solid plastic waste in the process enabled large scale production which reduced costs and prevented downtimes and improved plant economics. co-processing of coal fines with municipal waste plastics is a brilliant solution for an affordable, fuel from locally available raw materials which securing energy supply, promoting economic sustainability and protected the climatic changes associated with waste management. from experimental work, it was observed that higher temperatures and lower space velocities increase the formation of coke and gas which decreases the yield of oil. all experimental runs were conducted at 350-375 oc and a liquid hourly speed velocity of 0.70-1.70/ hat hydrogen pressure of 6 mpa yielding oils of 24-34 wt.% for naphtha, 34-45 wt.% for middle distillates and heavy distillates 18-25 wt.%. co-processing of coal fines and municipal waste is a good waste valorization strategy to produce liquid fuels.","coal fines, co-processing, heavy distillates, naphtha, middle distillates","Coal fines and waste municipal plastics can be successfully co-processed to liquid fuels as a waste management strategy using red mud as a catalyst. From this study, it was evident that using red mud as a catalyst increases most of the properties of the fuel and also promotes environment sustainability in the form of less emission and fuel consumption. Since red mud is a hazardous waste material from the aluminum industry, utilizing it for liquid fuels productions is an economically viable option. The temperature of 475 oC gives higher space velocities of 1.75h-1 which results in higher yields of 84.9%. This applied to all the temperatures investigated with the exception of 375 oC where a lower space velocity resulted in a higher wt.% yield of oil. The production of liquid oils from coal fines, waste municipal plastics and red mud is a good waste management initiative.

26,Lean Manufacturing Tools For Operations Management  Based On Pdca Cycle,"processes management allows improvement in management and productivity since it allows to have a global vision of the entire organization, at the same time, lean manufacturing tools help to improve production/administrative systems and encourage continuous improvement. this work proposes a continuous improvement model that brings together the two aforementioned approaches, taking the pdca cycle as a starting model. the methodology used in this work begins with a bibliographic review of the topics of interest, process management and lean manufacturing tools, then an analysis of the pdca improvement cycle is carried out, focusing on the scope and objective of each stage. finally, an improvement management model is presented that suggests which lean manufacturing tools are the most appropriate to develop each of the stages of the pdca cycle. the results show that the proposals effectively combine these tools, and their implementation is feasible in companies of all kinds, regardless of their size and activity. the proposed model was tested through a pilot test in a footwear manufacturing industry located in the city of cuenca-ecuador with results consistent with the philosophy of continuous improvement.",lean manufacturing,"Process management and lean manufacturing tools are a great help to improve manufacturing processes in companies that use them, since they improve productivity, quality, and manufacturing systems in general. A big problem usually faced by SMEs is that sometimes they see limited opportunities for improvement for fear of getting complicated with highly technical models or high investment, however it can be seen that the mixture of these two tools, process management and lean manufacturing, facilitate the tasks of m, so its application allows microenterprises to carry out improvement actions with low investment. It is recommended to the managers of the microenterprise Jotta Shoes to carry out the improvement plans in a meticulous way so that its application provides positive results and to be able to solve the existing problems in the best way. It is important to mention that, for the plans to give the best results, all the members of the microenterprise must work together and keep them constantly motivated to avoid the inertia of old practices. Another more technological help can be found in ERP software that can help monitor a company's processes. Although these solutions are usually expensive for SMEs, there are today low-cost, high-quality solutions like the one you mention by Astudillo Rodriguez et. al., (2020), this type of tools together with process management models cause great synergies and can substantially increase the performance of a company.","alvarez-mosquera pedro josé and arce-ureña daniela estefanía business administration school, universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador jgarcia@es.uazuay.edu.ec; arcedaniela@es.uazuay.edu.ec juan manuel maldonado-matute uda business observatory, bussiness adninistration school, production engineering school universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador jmaldonado@uazuay.edu.ec maria jose gonzalez calle, ana carolina armijos-orellana, maría isabel arteaga ortíz and pedro fernando guerrero maxi uda business observatory, bussiness adninistration school universidad del azuay, cuenca, ecuador mgonzalez@uazuay.edu.ec; aarmijos@uazuay.edu.ec; iarteaga@uazuay.edu.ec; pedromaxi@uazuay.edu.ec",

28,Management Of E-Waste In The South African Construction  Industry – A Literature Review,"in complacence with the ever-growing industrialization of different sectors, more specifically the construction sector, electrical and electronic waste management is becoming a global challenge in the construction industry posing significant environmental and health challenges. e-waste, if managed effectively, will release significant economic, resource and ecological benefits. most of the construction companies have no information about electronic waste management, electronic devices that come from the seller while damaged are sent back to the supplier for exchange. electronics that could not be repaired are sold to scrap yards and some are sent directly into the dumpsite, however, there were some electronic wastes stored inside the premises and others stored at the back of the premises directly into the ground, which decomposes and possibly affect the environment. the construction companies feel that it is the government's responsibility to provide money for electronic waste management otherwise there is no way they could manage e-waste in their business because it will not be profitable or else the users must take care of their electronic waste. the secondary data was collected through a detailed review of extant literature. in contrast, the primary data was collected using a qualitative method through interviewing the construction professionals. twelve industry professionals were invited to participate in an interview but ten were present and able to participate, representing an 83% response rate. this paper seeks to assess how electrical and electronic waste are managed in the south african construction industry.",,"This paper has reviewed the literature available on e-waste management. The section started by providing an overview of e-waste and defining e-waste, before moving on to reviewing the literature on the situation in the South African built environment. Furthermore, the paper reviewed the literature on the importance of e-waste on the economy, health of persons and the environment.

29,Recovery Of Phosphate From Municipal Sewage Sludge   M. M. Manyuchi*.And N. Sukdeo,"huge amounts of municipal sewage sludge, a form of solid waste, are being generated daily from municipal sewage treatment plants. this sewage sludge if not properly treated can cause landfilling problems that can result in climate change effects due to greenhouse gases emissions. this generated sewage sludge is rich in phosphorous and other nutrients which has potential to be recovered. the current study evaluates the potential to recover phosphorous from municipal sewage sludge using gasification as a thermal method followed by alkali treatment using naoh. the sewage sludge was first dewatered to 60% moisture content before it was gasified using hot air to convert it into ash for 120 minutes. gasification at 800 °c was considered as the waste management option for the sewage sludge due to its flexibility and energy efficiency. in this study, 50% of the phosphate was recovered from the sewage sludge ash with a phosphorous nutrient composition of 6.5-7.5 wt. %. gasification of sewage sludge to recover phosphate oxide and its subsequent alkali treatment to recover phosphate promotes environmental preservation at the same time creating a resource for fertilizer production.","alkali treatment, gasification, phosphorous, sewage sludge","Municipal sewage sludge can be value added through adoption of various technologies for phosphorous recovery. Gasification of municipal sewage sludge is a viable technology for phosphorous oxide recovery in municipal sewage treatment plants as it also creates an option for heat integration in the process. Optimal gasification of sewage sludge at 800 ℃ results and partial oxygen concentration of 0.1% resulted in almost 100% recovery of P2O5. The phosphorous recovery through alkali (NaOH) treatment was done for sewage sludge ash of which the phosphate content of 6.5-7.5 % was recovered. This was achieved under optimum heat treatment under the alkali treatment method at 850 ℃. Sewage sludge valorisation through gasification followed by alkali treatment results in high recovery of phosphorous. Further research in this area will include potential recovery of other high use minerals such as silica, magnesium and zinc.

38,Dimensions Of Energy Sustainability Measurement   Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"the overall objective of this research is to identify both current and future technologies, strategies, policy, and other measures necessary to transition the electricity and heat energy sector towards reduced greenhouse gas emissions and limit temperature rise to the target 1.5oc rise above the preindustrial level. the greatest sustainability challenge facing humanity today is the greenhouse gas emissions and the global climate change with fossil fuels led by coal, natural gas and oil contributing 61.3% of global electricity generation in the year 2020. the cumulative effect of the stockholm, rio, and johannesburg conferences identified sustainable energy development (sed) as a very important factor in the sustainable global development. this study reviews energy transition strategies and proposes a roadmap for sustainable energy transition for sustainable electricity generation and supply in line with commitments of the paris agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperature to 1.5oc above the preindustrial level. the sustainable transition strategies typically consist of three major technological changes namely, energy savings on the demand side, generation efficiency at production level and fossil fuel substitution by various renewable energy sources and low carbon nuclear. for the transition remain technically and economically feasible and beneficial, policy initiatives are necessary to steer the global electricity transition towards a sustainable energy and electricity system. large-scale renewable energy adoption should include measures to improve efficiency of existing nonrenewable sources which still have an important cost reduction and stabilization role. a resilient grid with advanced energy storage for storage and absorption of variable renewables should also be part of the transition strategies. from this study, it was noted that whereas sustainable development has social, economic, and environmental pillars, energy sustainability is best analysed by five-dimensional approach consisting of environmental, economic, social, technical, and institutional/political sustainability to determine resource sustainability. the energy transition requires new technology for maximum use of the abundant but intermittent renewable sources a sustainable mix with limited nonrenewable sources optimized to minimize cost and environmental impact but maintained quality, stability, and flexibility of an electricity supply system. technologies needed for the transition are those that use conventional mitigation, negative emissions technologies which capture and sequester carbon emissions and finally technologies which alter the global atmospheric radiative energy budget to stabilize and reduce global average temperature. a sustainable electricity system needs facilitating technology, policy, strategies and infrastructure like smart grids, and models with an appropriate mix of both renewable and low carbon energy sources. key words: energy transition; energy and electricity sustainability; sustainable electricity; renewable energy; smart grids; smart energy; 100% renewable energy; decarbonisation; electricity system optimisation proceedings of the 3rd indian international conference on industrial engineering and operations management new delhi, india, november 2-4, 2023 © ieom society international 415",,,"mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni. oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa correspondence to: moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi: mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
39,Hydrogen Production And Application In The   Energy Transition,"global energy is a very significant energy with demand gradually increasing making it a key solution to tackle global greenhouse gas emissions and global temperature rise. production technologies for hydrogen are commercially available, while some are still under development. in hydrogen is a renewable secondary energy source, and feedstock, and tool to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets and promote economic decarbonization. the unique properties of hydrogen make it a powerful enabler for energy transition, benefiting the energy system and end-use applications. hydrogen gas has significant potential to play an important role in decarbonizing hard-to-electrify sectors of the economy, like long distance trucks in transport, aviation, and heavy manufacturing industries besides providing. hydrogen and fuel cell technologies will enable this transition to a clean, low-carbon energy system resulting in greatly reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. green hydrogen energy provides clean energy, and the comprehensive utilization of hydrogen energy is crucial for the low-carbon transformation of the power sector. the production of hydrogen through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy reduces carbon emissions although it leads to an increase in demand for renewable energy generators. appropriate planning of hydrogen storage can reduce the overall investment cost and promote a low carbon transition of the power system. since hydrogen is a highly flammable fuel, to ensure safe operation and to timely detect a leakage, reliable safety sensors are applied. indoor use of hydrogen detectors is recommended for indoor fueling operations. there are safety sensors on the market that can be used for the successful deployment of hydrogen technology. for hydrogen to take its rightful place in the energy transition, as with other energy technologies is sufficient development of the technology itself. most hydrogen today is produced by steam reforming of natural gas, but green hydrogen can be manufactured by electrolysis using renewable electricity and use of renewable feedstock like biomethane.","carbon footprint, electrolysis, green hydrogen, renewable energy",,"moses jeremiah. barasa kabeyi moseskabeyi@yahoo.com; mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni.olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa","References

40,Carbon Capture And Sequestration And Carbon  Capture And Use,"carbon capture and sequestration (ccs) as ais a viable mitigation strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions in fossil-fuel power plants. although ccs technology can mitigate the anthropogenic ghg emissions, the technologies are associated with additional water requirements for chemical and physical processes to capture and separate co2 and other environmental impacts like introduction of parasitic loads imposed by carbon capture on power plants hence reduced efficiency and more cooling requirements and groundwater contamination due to co2 leakage during geologic sequestration. the energy transition requires the decarbonizing of the power, transport, and industry sectors. carbon capture and storage (ccs) and carbon capture and utilization (ccu) technologies will play a major role in this energy transition by cutting down emissions from new fossil fuel power plants. main challenges facing the ccs and ccu include low oil price to make co2-enhanced oil recovery profitable, lack of financial incentives for co2 geological storage, limited acceptance, lack facilitating government policy and ccs regulations, and high capital investment. key words: carbon capture and storage; carbon capture; life cycle assessment; climate change; environmental impacts introduction greenhouse gas emission (ghg)from anthropogenic activities are the most important environmental issues of the twenty-first century. this has made the ccs (carbon capture and storage) and carbon capture and use (ccu) important technologies and approaches particularly in power generation and industrial operations to cut down emissions released to the atmosphere. ccs (carbon capture and storage) is a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by capturing and subsequently storing co2., while ccu (carbon capture and utilization) is a way of recycling carbon in the captured co2 by converting it into products like fuels, chemicals, or other products(lerche raadal & saur modahl, 2022). the climate change resulting from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs) is one of the most significant long term environmental challenges today. the greenhouse gas emissions (ghg) from the electricity sector have been growing to ever increasing electricity demands and while fossil fuels remain the dominant source for electricity generation. there are various mitigation strategies developed aimed at reducing co2 emissions with technological alternatives for to reduce emissions from power plants to the atmosphere being. i.) switching to less carbon-intensive fuels, e.g., natural gas instead of coal. ii.) increasing the use of renewable energy sources or low carbon nuclear energy, which emit less or no net co2; and iii.) capturing and sequestrating carbon emissions. the ccs is a promising approach for reduction of ghg emissions by capturing carbon dioxide (co2) at the point of power generation and transporting to an injection site, and sequestrating for long-term storage in suitable formations. a ccs unit at thermal plants can efficiently capture about 85–95% of the co2 processed in a capture plant(eldardiry & habib 2018). proceedings of the 3rd indian international conference on industrial engineering and operations management new delhi, india, november 2-4, 2023 © ieom society international 469",,"Both CCS and CCU technologies seek to mitigate climate change, but are regarded as temporary solutions, especially options which merely delay the emissions of CO2 instead of eliminating them permanently. The CCU appears a better option than CCS since CCU is unprofitable activity, but the cost-effectiveness and the environmental impacts of CCU need to be carefully evaluated on a life cycle basis to ensure a positive economic and environmental balance. The global demand of chemicals and other products cannot provide enough capacity to capture CO2 emissions to contribute to effectively contribute to the carbon reduction targets. Another significant challenge with CCU is that the ‘storage’ time of CO2 which is limited by short lifespans of the chemicals and fuels produced. Therefore, there’re is need focus research on the development of materials and products having longer lifetimes to facilitate long term storage of CO2. Although CCS overcomes this challenge through long-term storage, CO2 leakage is a prevailing risk that can potentially cause more damage. Also significant is the fact that deployment of large-scale CCS may come too late to reverse the impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, if the above concerns can be addressed, both CCS and CCU could play a role in mitigating climate change, together with other options such as energy demand reduction, renewables, and other low-carbon technologies. The Life cycle assessment studies established that CCS could reduce the global warming potential (GWP) from power plants by 63–82%, with greatest reductio in oxy-fuel combustion in pulverized coal and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants. The lowest reduction is achieved by post-combustion capture in combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants. Environmental impacts like acidification and human toxicity for CCS, while for CCU, the GWP varies widely based on utilization option. Mineral carbonation may reduce the GWP by 4–48% compared to the no CCU. By using CO2 for production of chemicals, like dimethylcarbonate (DMC), the GWP can be reduced by 4.3 times and ozone layer depletion by 13 times when compared to conventional DMC process. The Enhanced oil recovery yields GWP 2.3 times lower compared to discharging CO2 to the atmosphere but leads to higher acidification by three times. Capturing CO2 by microalgae to produce biodiesel leads to 2.5 times higher GWP compared with fossil diesel, while other environmental impacts are significantly higher. On average basis, the GWP of CCS is significantly lower compared to CCU options, but has other environmental impacts being higher compared to CCU except for DMC production which is the worst CCU option overall.

42,Indicators Of Sustainable Energy And Electricity   Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi,"the concept of sustainability has received much attention globally because of its multidisciplinary nature and future goal which is sustainable development. the concept relies on three basic pillars of the economy, environment, and society. sustainable energy has two additional pillars of technology and institutional pillars. sustainable energy systems refer to systems that can meet present demands by maintaining an adequate balance between the economy, environment, and society, while ensuring that the energy resources do not get depleted and remain available for future use. this study identified sustainability indicators for energy sources. the various sources of energy were assessed for sustainability based on indicators like price of power generated, lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, resource availability, conversion efficiency, land requirements, social impacts, and water consumption. in the assessment, indicators were assumed to have equal importance to sustainable development and were equally important in ranking energy sources based on their sustainability. the study demonstrated that renewable energy resources are more sustainable technologies with wind power stations having the highest rank in sustainability followed by nuclear, hydro, and solar. wind was ranked the most sustainable followed by hydropower, photovoltaics and then geothermal while coal was the least sustainable. coal and nuclear are the most favorable based on price of electricity produced but based on average prices, geothermal and hydro have the lowest possible prices and hence most favorable. among renewable sources, photovoltaics has the highest average and overall cost of generation, although it remains cheaper than gas and coal at the lowest limit. on electrical efficiency, hydropower has the highest efficiency while photovoltaics has the lowest electrical efficiency. greenhouse gas emissions were low in all non-fossil fuels, with wind, hydro and nuclear have lowest values of greenhouse gas emissions while coal has the highest greenhouse gas emissions. key words: life cycle assessment; sustainability assessment, sustainable energy; sustainable development; renewable energy; sustainability indicators. introduction although energy is essential to economic, social development and improved quality of life, most of the energy is currently produced and used in ways that are not sustainable. to assess progress towards a sustainable energy future, energy indicators that can measure and monitor important changes will be needed. the supply of reliable, and adequate energy products and services at an affordable cost, and in a s secure and environmentally friendly manner and energy that conforms with socioeconomic development needs of the people, is essential for sustainable development. this is because energy is necessary input for eradication of poverty, improving human welfare and to raise peoples living standards(m j b kabeyi & a o olanrewaju, 2023; m. j. b. kabeyi & o. a. olanrewaju 2023b). the concept of sustainability relies on three basic pillars: i.e. economy, environment, and society. for sustainable energy systems, it is a system that can meet present demands by maintaining an adequate balance between economy, environment, and society, without depleting the energy resources for future use. energy system sustainability assessment requires several indicators from the five dimensions. one popular method used to evaluate energy sustainability is the multicriteria decision analysis (mcda) method. this study presents an overview of the indicators used to assess energy system sustainability (khan 2021). the need exists to identify and quantify sustainability indicators that may be site-specific and from several sources and sometimes are barely proceedings of the 3rd indian international conference on industrial engineering and operations management new delhi, india, november 2-4, 2023 © ieom society international 495",,"Sustainable energy is a very important element of sustainable development through provision of uninterrupted clean electricity to consumers. The demand for electricity is continuously increasing due to growth in world population industrialization, electrification, and technological developments. It is necessary to meet the increasing electricity demand for sustainable development, by using the consumable resources of the world in the most productive manner and minimum level to minimize the negative impacts on human health and environment. The concept of sustainability has received significant attention globally because of its multidisciplinary nature and interest in sustainable development. Sustainable development and sustainability mainly rely on the three basic pillars, namely economy, environment, and society. Sustainable energy systems should meet present demands by maintaining an adequate balance between economy, environment, and society, while remaining non depletable and thus ensuring future use. Indicators are needed in the assessment of energy sustainability from the 5 dimensions of sustainable energy. Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a popular way for evaluating the sustainability of energy systems. This study has demonstrated that renewable energy resources are more sustainable technologies compared with fossil fuel energy sources. Wind generation, nuclear, hydro, and solar power generation rank the highest in sustainability. Wind was ranked the most sustainable followed by hydropower, photovoltaics and then geothermal while coal produced power was the least sustainable. Coal and nuclear are the most favorable based on price of electricity produced but based on average prices, geothermal and hydro have the lowest possible prices and hence most favorable. Among renewable sources, photovoltaics has the highest average and overall highest cost of generation, although it remains cheaper than gas and coal at the lowest limit. On electrical efficiency, hydropower has the highest efficiency while photovoltaics has the lowest electrical efficiency. Greenhouse gas emissions were low in all non-fossil fuels, with Wind, hydro and nuclear have lowest values of greenhouse gas emissions while coal has the highest greenhouse gas emissions.","mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa oludolapo akanni.olanrewaju oludolapoo@dut.ac.za industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, durban south africa correspondence to: moses jeremiah barasa kabeyi: mkabeyi@uonbi.ac.ke",
43,Energy-Emission-Related Index Decomposition Analyses For   The Period 2016-2020: A Systematic Review And,"this study reviewed and classified energy-emission-related ida studies from 2016-2020 and assessed the relationship between the energy intensity of china and energy-emission-related ida studies on china. also, the study decomposed changes in china’s industrial sector’s energy consumption and emissions for 2016-2020 into contributing factors using logarithmic mean divisia index (lmdi). findings show that of the three hundred and fifty-one energy-emission- related ida studies, 66% of them were on china and the energy intensity of china decreased as energy-emission- related ida studies on china increased with time within the study period indicating that research outcomes and recommendations were considered by policymakers. for the additive lmdi decomposition, results revealed that there was a decrease in energy consumption occasioned majorly by energy intensity followed by energy structure. also, results showed that the increase in emissions was caused predominantly by the carbon emission factor, followed by overall industrial activity. though the decrease in industrial energy consumption indicates the application of research outcomes and engagement of energy-efficient technologies, there is still need for more environmentally friendly policies. the innovation in this study is the assessment of the impact of energy-emission-related ida studies in china on energy intensity, industrial energy consumption, and emissions in china.","energy, emission","In this study, over three hundred and fifty (350) energy-emission-related IDA studies for the period 2016-2020 were reviewed and classified. More than a decade before the study period, focus was increasingly on emission studies and pollutants, particularly with the aid of LMDI. About 75% of the studies were on emission and the focus on emission increased rapidly, perhaps due to the increased global attention on CO2 emission reduction and efforts to achieve Paris Agreement targets by 2030. As a result, there is increased attention specifically on prospective studies of emissions, energy efficiency, de-coupling of economic growth from emissions and the decomposition of de-coupling efforts using the LMDI-based hybrid method to ensure more exposition of the future. China is the most studied country with respect to energy-emission-related IDA studies. Reviewed studies could not tell whether China will achieve emissions targets on or before 2030. The good news, however, is that at various levels, sectors, regions, provinces, and cities, the most-intense energy-emission-related IDA research ever are ongoing in China, the world’s highest CO2 emitter. As a result, the impact of the energy-emission-related IDA studies on energy intensity of China was examined. The results showed that energy-emission-related IDA studies of China have a positive correlation with energy intensity of China over the study period. This suggested that policymakers in China are taking into consideration the findings from the researchers for better policy analyses and development. The additive and multiplicative LMDI calculations of change in China’s industrial energy and its determinants show that there is decrease in industrial energy consumption in China over the study period caused by intensity effect and structural effect which proposes that investment on energy-emission-related IDA studies in China are yielding dividends. It also proposes that China is engaging energy-efficient technologies and policies. LMDI computations for both additive and multiplication forms revealed that carbon emission factor, followed by overall industrial activity are the key factors responsible for increase in emission. Specifically, for additive form of LMDI, carbon emission effect and industrial activity effect; while for multiplicative form of LMDI, carbon emission factor in [2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2014-2019 and 2017-2018], as well as overall activity effect in [2014-2015 & 2018-2019] are the highest contributors to increase in emission. The above reducing and increasing agents of China’s industrial emission were partly consistent with the findings of Shi, Han, Zafar, and Wei (2019) and Xie, Shao, and Lin (2016). Although, there were indications that policy recommendations from energy-emissions-related IDA researchers were implemented, China’s industrial emissions increased as energy-emissions-related IDA studies increased over the studies period. Hence, China needs to make further investment on IDA emission studies with the view to seek options to mitigate emissions, achieve peak carbon emission before 2030, as planned.","empirical study jude james industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, south africa institute of systems science, durban university of technology, south africa judeosagie@ymail.com oludolapo olanrewaju industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, south africa oludolapoo@dut.ac.za kevin j. duffy and obiora c. collins industrial engineering department, durban university of technology, south africa institute of systems science, durban university of technology, south africa kevind@dut.ac.za and obiora.c.collins@gmail.com",

45,Implementation Of Green Supply Chain Management  Practices In South African Manufacturing Industry,"the manufacturing industry need to be more conscious of how its impact the environment. the manufacturing companies are to blame for global warming because of their waste generation, depletion of natural resources, and disruption of the ecosystem. green supply chain management (gscm) is a concept introduced to help reduce environmental issues caused by industries. the aim of this study was to evaluate the implementation of green supply chain management (gscm) in the manufacturing industry in south africa. data was collected from employees working in various manufacturing companies, from management level to lower levels. a descriptive research method was adopted to evaluate the implementation of gscm, in terms of identifying the suitable practices, the right approach, the value added as well as the benefits and challenges of implementation. it was found that the manufacturing industry is indeed aware if its impact on the environmental and have put measures in place to reduce this impact, such as adopting gscm. this study identified the suitable gscm practices that can be adopted to reduce environmental impact in the manufacturing industry as well as identify the approach to implementing the gscm practices.",lack of energy,"It was found that companies in the manufacturing industry are aware of their impact to the environmental issues and have taken measures to reduce the impact. Implementing GSCM is one way of reducing this impact, practices such as green design, green manufacturing, green logistics and packaging were found to be the most GSCM practices companies were most familiar with. This study revealed employees’ views on the practices that they feel need to be prioritized in the manufacturing industry, the most common practice mentioned among the respondents was green manufacturing. An approach taken to implement GSCM in the industry was identified, there are different approaches mentioned, however the most common was strategic planning, this was the most popular ‘’first step of implementation’’. The value of GSCM in the manufacturing industry was uncovered by this study. It was found that GSCM add value by allowing compliance to environmental regulations enhancing environmental and operation performance and contribute to a good company reputation. Apart from the value of GSCM, benefits of GSCM were also identified as company growth, competitive advantage, green image among others.","boitumelo masokoameng, khathutshelo mushavhanamadi department of quality and operation management university of johannesburg, south africa 216006035@student.uj.ac.za, kmushavhanamadi@uj.ac.za,",
46,Optimizing The Operation Of Manufacturing: Case Study At  Manufacturing Glass Company,"the purpose of the study was to evaluate the optimisation of cutting and snapping of float glass operation. it is essential for any manufacturing industry to optimise their processes to increase productivity and compete in this ever changing manufacturing environment. this is a case study of glass manufacturing in south africa, the leading manufacturer of float glass in south africa. questionnaire was designed to collect primary data and an experiment was conducted to collect secondary data. this design was preferred and allowed the researcher to collect easily onsite. both quantitative and qualitative research was used in this study to explore and examine different variables linked to the cutting and snapping process at the company. the results revealed that the variables with the most impact on the cutting and snapping operation at the company as well as the ranges at which these variables should be set to achieve optimum cutting and snapping operation in float glass manufacturing. the relationship between these variables were also examine. however, the extent to which they are interlinked should be further studied. the study findings led to the conclusion that to optimize cutting and snapping the following variables must be considered. the cutting wheel must not be worn and must have not run more than 15km, temperature must be 59 to 60 at cutting and the ribbon must be stable. these variables must be continuously monitored and should be adjusted as outside conditions drastically change.","glass company, manufacturing, optimizing","The objective of the study was to optimise the glass cutting and snapping operation by reducing losses and scrap related to cutting and snapping and identify the best combination of settings for all variables involved in cutting and snapping. To optimise the operation of cutting and snapping in float glass reduce waste associated with it one needs to understand what influences and causes cutting and snapping in the first place. The study identified three main variables that cause cutting and snapping and the defects created when those variables are out of normal range. The study identifies cutting equipment (worn cutting wheel) glass temperature (strain) and unstable ribbon as a result of product changes as the main contributors to poor cutting and snapping. To optimize cutting and snapping and reduce defects the cutting wheel must not be worn, temperature must be 59 to 60 at cutting and the ribbon must be stable. The process controllers should always strive to have these variables within targets and continuously monitor them and compensate as outside conditions changes. The objective of the study was met however an in depth understanding of these variables together as a unit needs to be further studied assuming the worst conditions as well as normal conditions to understand how they interlink. This will give guidelines to process controllers on how to compensate during the worst conditions.

47,The Impacts That The Cost Of Quality Has On South African'S  Defence Industry,"the purpose of this paper is to evaluate how the cost of quality affects the defense sector in south africa. the high cost of poor quality is one of the reasons why south africa's military industry's profits and exports are decreasing. costs of poor quality (copq) affects production efficiency and profitability to customer satisfaction and public reputation. to assess the impact of the cost of poor quality on a company's productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction, the interview questions were created and distributed to four different military firms to collect data that would allow the researcher to assess the copq's influence on each company's productivity. the interview also assisted the researcher in documenting the primary or common causes and effects of poor quality in the defense sector, allowing the author to effectively suggest a strategy to reduce the sources of poor-quality costs in military businesses. to identify and categorize internal and external failure costs from various defense organizations as well as to establish a method for evaluating the cost of poor quality to estimate the impact on an organization, the data entry forms in table 1 to table 4 below were created to record all the poor-quality costs incurred in 2020 that were recorded in each company's database. this helps the researcher calculate the cost of poor quality in 2020 for each company and determine the impact on the company's profitability. the outcomes of the research indicate that the cost of poor quality influences the defense industry’s profitability, productivity, and customer satisfaction. according to the research, a company’s productivity, profitability, and customer satisfaction can increase if the cost of poor-quality decreases.",profitability,"This research only focused on South Africa defense companies. Costs of poor-quality affects defense companies' production efficiency, profitability, customer satisfaction and public reputation. To identify and categorize internal and external failure costs from various defense organizations as well as establish a method for evaluating the cost of poor quality to estimate the impact on an organization. The study confirm that poor quality affects a company's profitability, productivity, and customer satisfaction. In military firms, excessive rework has a significant influence on organizational performance. However, frequent rework occurrences, as well as their impact on performance and productivity, should not be considered unavoidable. The development of proper awareness as well as organized procedures for rework management may significantly improve the unfavorable results associated with rework. Company profitability and Quality have a strong relationship, according to this research. In fact, for every given profitability, better quality yields a larger return on investment. Furthermore, increases in productivity of the company, capabilities to meet customer needs, or even other quality characteristics result in higher sales and market share. Customers who are happy with the company's quality are more likely to have positive feelings about it than those who do not receive high-quality items.

48,Ergonomics Risk Assessment Of Postures And Design Of  Workstation In Fastener Industry,"digital human modeling (dhm) is one of the important tools used to simulate the workplace for providing ergonomic solutions and improved workstation design. human manikins are built into software, easily manipulated to evaluate workstation design and prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. the most common complaints in small scale industries are related to msds and mismatch between operator and work station. these issues if not resolved early, may lead to further serious problems affecting the efficiency and productivity. the present work is taken up to study and analyze working posture in nut bolt manufacturing industry by rula assessment method (rapid upper limb assessment) using catia software. the manufacturing of bolts consists of cold forging, trimming, threading and heat treatment. the awkward/unnatural postures of operators are assessed for risks using rula. the actual postures are built in catia software and possible changes made to show improved postures with low or negligible risks and suggest low-cost ergonomic interventions. suggestions for improvement and low-cost interventions are based on ergonomic principles and anthropometry. the overall study highlights that working posture risks can be reduced, if proper and timely ergonomic interventions are implemented. key words: catia, ergonomics, posture, rula, musculoskeletal disorder",,"The present study was conducted at an bolt manufacturing small scale industry to find out the ergonomic risks and postural issues, which may lead to development of MSDs. Two postures which were repeatedly adapted by operator at the forging machine were selected for study and analysis. At the oiling of the MS rod and collecting the bolts from under the machine, both the postures indicated a high risk of ‘7’as per RULA analysis, which requires immediate correction and change to avoid further problems. Low cost ergonomic interventions were recommended as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 8. A CATIA model was built with the changed postures and RULA technique was applied to analyze the postures. The scores obtained were ‘3’ at the lubricating station and ‘4’while removing the bolts from under the machine in improved designed workstation. Thus it is demonstrated that ergonomic interventions are necessary to improve the workstation and reducing the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders. Similarly, such improvements can be possible at other workstations if interventions are designed and implemented successfully. The recommendations made can be implemented to reduce the risks, improve the productivity and efficiency.","veeresh s.patil student, industrial and production engineering department p.d.a. college of engineering, kalaburagi, india veereshpatils5353@gmail.com qutubuddin s.m. associate professor p.d.a. college of engineering, kalaburagi, india syedqutub16@gmail.com sagar student, industrial and production engineering department p.d.a. college of engineering, kalaburagi, india sagarsagarpatil77@gmail.com phani r. katuru, director, chainsys corporation usa phani.katuru@chainsys.com musa adekunle ibrahim department of mechanical engineering, olabisi onabanjo university, ogun state, nigeria musa-olokuta.adekunle@oouagoiwoye.edu.ng s.m.hasanuddin student, methodist college of engineering & technology, hyderabad s.hasanuddin20@gmail.com",
49,Driver Factors In Bus Accident: A Systematic Review   César Corrales,"this article presents a systematic review of the frequency of appearance of different causes in highway bus accidents, for which publications have been searched in scopus and wos databases. this systematic review has been carried out according to the element guidelines. preferred reporting method for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (prisma). factors linked to drivers have been considered and grouped into seven major items. the results show that the most frequent factors in the publications are those referring to company management, followed by factors linked to driving errors. in this way, it is possible to find where to prioritize studies to eliminate the causes of bus accidents on highways.","accident factors, bus, drivers",,"departamento de ingeniería pontificia universidad católica del perú san miguel, lima, perú ccorral@pucp.edu.pe maría del carmen pardo-ferreira and juan carlos rubio-romero school of industrial engineering, universidad de málaga teatinos, málaga, españa carmenpf@uma.es, juro@uma.es","References
