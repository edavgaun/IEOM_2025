3,5Th Asia Pacific Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ap05.20240012,"managing projects to ensure optimal performance is a major challenge. as organizations prioritize efficiency and excellence in project execution, accurate performance measurement mechanisms become more important. this study uses statistical process control principles to explore how organizations can monitor and enhance project performance, using an anechoic chamber for electro magnetic compatibility (emc) as an example to illustrate these concepts. this specialized chamber serves as a critical environment for conducting electromagnetic compatibility testing, underscoring its pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and functionality of electronic equipment. our investigation evaluates the project's performance, focusing particularly on cost and schedule management. statistical process control (spc) and earned value management (evm) methodologies are used to effectively monitor the project schedule's progress in this study. by leveraging evm, we derive key performance metrics, including the schedule performance index (spi) and the cost performance index (cpi). subsequently, spc analysis is employed to scrutinize spi and cpi outputs, discerning whether these indices fall above or below the center line (cl), thus providing insights into project performance trends. our findings provide a picture of project performance. spi study shows three months of performance above the cl, six months around the cl, and three months below the cl. similarly, cpi analysis shows three months above the cl, four months near the cl, and five months below the cl. incorporating evm and spc techniques provides the project team with actionable insights, allowing proactive decision-making and efficient problem-solving. this comprehensive strategy enables stakeholders to optimize project results, resulting in greater success.",11,"The application of Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques, particularly through the utilization of Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI) analysis from the Earned Value Management (EVM) approach, has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of our project's schedule progress and budgetary performance. Using Statistical Process Control methods, we constructed a control chart with computed center lines and control limits derived from 12 observations of the SPI indicator. This rigorous approach enabled the team to promptly detect deviations from the project timeline and facilitated targeted interventions to address underlying issues or capitalize on emerging opportunities. Moreover, utilizing the SPI provided valuable insights into the project's performance dynamics. The initial months witnessed a slower pace of progress, prompting a detailed examination of individual activities to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies. Subsequent interventions based on these findings resulted in gradual improvements, reflected in the SPI rising above the center line in certain intervals. However, the notable surge in progress during months 10 and 11 underscored the project's resilience and adaptability. This rapid advancement demonstrated the team's capacity to overcome challenges and hinted at the project's potential for overall success. Similarly, the analysis of the CPI shed light on the project's budgetary performance over time. While periods of cost efficiency were observed during the project's inception and at intermittent stages, indicating effective resource utilization, challenges with budget management surfaced during other phases. During certain months, the CPI values falling below the center line and below 1 signaled over-budget progress, necessitating corrective measures to realign expenditures with planned targets. In essence, the combined insights from SPI and CPI analysis facilitated proactive decision-making and empowered the project team to navigate challenges effectively and capitalize on opportunities, ultimately enhancing the project's chances of success. Incorporating SPC principles into the project management approach enabled the team to make informed decisions and take proactive steps to ensure project success. Moving forward, the insights gleaned from this analysis will serve as a foundation for continuous improvement, guiding the efforts to enhance project efficiency and effectiveness in future endeavors. By applying SPC principles, the project team remains committed to achieving its project objectives and delivering value to stakeholders. Future research could investigate the integration of advanced predictive analytics with SPC and EVM techniques to improve early identification of potential project deviations. The use of machine learning algorithms could enable real- time data analysis and predictive modeling, allowing for more accurate and timely interventions. Moreover, extending the study to encompass a wider variety of projects across different industries could help confirm the effectiveness of 19","project performance measurement using statistical process control: a case study of electro magnetic compatibility (emc)–in indonesian enterprise hsiang-ling chen department of industrial and system engineering chung yuan christian university taoyuan city, taiwan achen@cycu.edu.tw wawan tripiawan department of industrial and system engineering chung yuan christian university taoyuan city, taiwan g11102407@cycu.edu.tw school of industrial & system engineering telkom university bandung, indonesia wawantripiawan@telkomuniversity.ac.id","References

The results showed that (H1) there was no correlation between individual personality and the number of students involved in collaborative learning. Furthermore, it revealed that there was no correlation between the number of students who were involved in collaborative learning, the number of students who only engaged by relaying information, and the number of students who were not engaged at all. It was similar when we specified students who provided or collected the information. (H2) In some cases, there were strong connections between students with moderate levels of extraversion and openness, but otherwise no relationship was found. Therefore, when evaluating “Positive Attitude Towards Learning,” it is possible to use the number of students involved in exchange learning as a measure of evaluating performance. However, factors such as internal and external motivators for affiliation, as well as student personality should also be considered in any evaluations going forward. 78","influence of students' personality on the evaluation of their positive attitude towards learning masaya matsushita department of information science and control engineering nagaoka university of technology niigata 940-2137, japan s183367@stn.nagaokaut.ac.jp nobumichi watahiki department of information and management systems engineering nagaoka university of technology niigata 940-2137, japan nwatahiki@vos.nagaokaut.ac.jp","References

By optimizing the routes, the total distance traveled by delivery vehicles was substantially decreased. This not only reduced fuel consumption and emissions but also lowered the overall operational costs associated with transportation. The reduction in distance translated directly into financial savings, as less fuel was required, and vehicle wear and tear were minimized, leading to lower maintenance costs. Furthermore, the implementation of a new driver management approach allowed drivers to have weekly rest days without affecting the overall operations. This strategy improved driver welfare by ensuring they had adequate rest, which reduced fatigue and the risk of accidents. Well-rested drivers are more alert and efficient, contributing to safer and more reliable transportation operations. The regular rest days also helped in retaining drivers by improving job satisfaction, thus reducing turnover rates and the costs associated with hiring and training new drivers. The combination of optimized routes and improved driver management resulted in more efficient food transportation. The streamlined operations ensured that deliveries were timely and consistent, enhancing the reliability of the service. Reduced expenses and energy use contributed to a more sustainable and eco-friendly operation, aligning with broader environmental goals. Overall, the integration of TSP with advanced driver management practices enabled the farm network to operate more effectively and balanced. It demonstrated that leveraging mathematical optimization techniques, combined with strategic human resource management, could lead to substantial improvements in operational efficiency. This holistic approach ensured that the benefits were not only economic but also social and environmental, making the transportation system more robust and sustainable in the long term.","a food transportation model for optimizing driver allocation and minimizing total distance in the chicken farm business network: (a case study of nakhon ratchasima province, thailand) phichet onchaem school of systems engineering suranaree university of technology nakhon ratchasima, thailand onchaem.p@gmail.com natdanai chanlawong school of industrial engineering suranaree university of technology nakhon ratchasima, thailand natdanai@sut.ac.th",

Simulation models showed great performance to help in making a decision before implementing alternative strategies in real systems . From the experiment results, group technology, plant layout, job enlargement, and capacity expansion were able to help reduce operating cost, increase average worker utilization, as well as increasing throughput. As a conclusion, the results showed that Model C is the optimal among of three alternatives, as it exhibits the best performance indicators among all strategies. It achieves an average throughput rate of 55 units per day, effectively meeting the increased demand from 40 units to 50 units per day. Worker utilization increased from 71% to 87%, and line balance efficiency improved from 58% to 72%. Additionally, labor costs were the lowest, decreasing from $3,771 per month to $3,428 per month due to a reduction of one worker. Operational costs of $428 from the re-layout process are considered minimal when compared to the monthly labor costs. This study also demonstrates that simulation techniques, combined with Lean principles and ECRS techniques, can serve as effective decision-making tools for identifying strategies to optimally improve manufacturing process efficiency.","manufacturing process improvement with simulation technique by flexsim software case study: lighting steel pole manufacturing process kannaphat seanun systems engineering program, school of industrial engineering institute of engineering suranaree university of technology nakhon ratchasima, thailand kannaphat9531@gmail.com nara samattapapong systems engineering program, school of industrial engineering suranaree university of technology nakhon ratchasima, thailand nara@sut.ac.th",

Not a few municipalities must tackle this along with a school restructuring plan. Not only the continuing decrease in the number of students, but also the teacher shortage must be taken into account. School consolidation would be a central solution to achieve sustainability of elementary education, while residents must be patient with elongated commuting distances. Considering these, a benchmark study was conducted for a city in Tokyo Metropolitan. To yield an objective consolidation, a traditional service coverage model called MCLP is adopted. Derived from this, a capacitated model that averts excessing capacity is constructed. A case study was conducted for Machida City, located southernmost of Tokyo, where there are currently 42 elementary schools. Experimental results with the traditional MCLP revealed that: even if the number of schools is reduced to 26 from the current number 42, the population coverage would not decrease by more than 1%. The results also show that the coverage rate does not change when comparing the cases for 25, 26, and 27 schools. A key finding is that there would not be a severe problem even if a further decrease is enforced: a solution better than the current plan might exist to cope with the aging and teacher shortage. The experimental results of the capacitated model resulted in a population coverage of 49.7%. The optimal placement of the capacitated model appears to be densely populated compared to the optimal outlet of the traditional model. For the planned target of 26 schools, the maximum number of students that could be covered was 12,116, while the actual number of students covered was 9,728, along with a capacity utilization of 80.3%.","optimal layout planning for school consolidation ~elementary schools in machida city, tokyo~ hiroto yamazaki graduate school of science and engineering hosei university, tokyo 184-8584, japan hiroto.yamazaki.3n@stu.hosei.ac.jp hiroyuki goto department of industrial and systems engineering hosei university tokyo 184 8584, japan",

38,5Th Asia Pacific Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ap05.20240086,"the plastic products sector in peru plays a crucial role as a strategic ally for various industries, due to the versatility of plastic products in multiple applications. however, it faces significant challenges, including a high rate of order returns, which generates considerable economic losses and affects operational efficiency. warehouse management with lean techniques, particularly lean warehousing, has shown a potential to improve operational efficiency and reducing waste, although its application in the warehouse context requires further research. one of the urgent problems in the sector is the inefficient management of inventories and order preparation, resulting in delays and errors in deliveries. this study proposes a warehouse management model based on lean tools such as value stream mapping (vsm), slotting, and visual control principles, with the aim of reducing the return rate and improving warehouse management efficiency. necessary actions include the implementation of vsm to identify non-value-added activities, the use of slotting to optimize product placement, and the adoption of visual controls to improve order preparation accuracy. key findings of the research show a significant reduction in the order return rate, from 17.65% to 10.5%, and an improvement in operational efficiency with a 10% increase in the order fulfillment rate. additionally, the implementation of the lean warehousing model led to a 15% reduction in operational costs and a 12% increase in warehouse productivity. the academic impact of this research is reflected in the contribution to the body of knowledge on the application of lean techniques in warehouse management, while the socio-economic impact includes improved competitiveness of companies in the plastic sector and reduced operational costs, benefiting both companies and end consumers. this study calls for action for researchers and industry professionals to explore new directions in the implementation of lean techniques in warehouses, focusing on adapting tools to specific contexts and evaluating their long-term impact. the adoption of these practices can result in significant improvements in operational efficiency and the economic sustainability of companies.","lean warehousing, order returns","This research study details a case study and identifies the main problem and its causes. In this way, it is determined that the main problem is the high rate of returns on orders in a plastic products distribution company, which is equivalent to a return rate of 17.65% and represents an economic impact of approximately 380,639 PEN. For the validation of the solution proposal, the Arena simulator was used, using distributions obtained with real data from the company under study and working with a confidence level of 95%. In this way, results were obtained that allow to analyze various scenarios. Through the reports generated by the Arena simulator, it is concluded that the implementation of the solution proposal increases the level of care from 80.98% (current situation) to 90.67% (long-term improvement situation), which is equivalent to an increase of 9.69%. Also, the reports of the simulator Arena show that the cost of 79,426 PEN (current situation) is reduced to 69,582 PEN (long-term improvement situation), which is equivalent to a reduction of 12.39%. Future recommendations Because there is a shortage of information in the literature about the implementation of Lean tools in warehouses, it is recommended to develop future in-depth research on the implementation of Lean Warehouses to contribute to the literature and to the improvement of warehouse management. It is recommended to emphasize the training of personnel so that, as far as possible, mistakes in the implementation of the solution proposal can be avoided; as well, to be able to comply with the deliverables according to the established schedule. It is recommended to continuously monitor the progress of the project to comply with everything previously proposed.

The study was conducted at an automotive shock absorber manufacturer in Lakeville Minnesota. A single workstation of the main assembly line, responsible for assembling eight components and the source of 43% of quality defects, was selected for the study. Through two replications of four different experiments, assembly height, reachability of components, and the standing surface around the workstation were controlled. Each of the three factors had two levels, the lower being the current configuration during normal production, and the higher being a condition recommended for its ergonomic qualities. Ergonomic interventions are often motivated by complaints or injuries. To encourage proactive intervention, this study used profit focused metrics to measure the impacts of implementing recommended ergonomic conditions. The results demonstrate a significant difference between workstation configurations for both cycle time and product quality. Reachability of components demonstrated a significant improvement in cycle time. Workstation standing surface and component reachability resulted in significantly lower assembly quality. Assembly occurring at the recommended height was no different than the current conditions. Using results from the regression equations developed during analysis, optimal conditions considering both measures were determined. Recommended conditions of a 41-inch assembly height and components 16 inches from the assembly are expected to provide the best quality and cycle time results without the use of the recommended antifatigue mat. The two recommended conditions were not practiced during normal production at this manufacturer. This demonstrates how ergonomic intervention can positively influence the quality and cycle time of assembly.","impacts of ergonomic conditions on quality and cycle time in automotive shock absorber assembly val urman and kuldeep agarwal department of automotive and manufacturing engineering technology, minnesota state university mankato, 205 trafton science center e, mankato, mn 56001 kuldeep.agarwal@mnsu.edu",

An original dataset, comprising up to 16,000 imagery samples from various agri-food retailers, was compiled for these objectives. For agri-food classification, DL using a custom CNN with low computational complexity achieved a testing accuracy of up to 99.78% in identifying eight products. For OSA detection, TL using the ResNet50 architecture yielded a testing accuracy of up to 98.76% with a quick computation time. Despite these promising outcomes, this system still has several limitations. The current ResNet50 has not been evaluated against other architectures regarding computational efficacy and overall performance. Additionally, real- time testing of the custom CNN and ResNet50 models for simultaneous classification and OSA detection remains a critical evaluation once the prototype is fully developed. Moreover, the dataset lacks diversity in terms of obstructions, which may limit its adoption in retailing environments.

Typically, these companies only begin actively gathering information after the regulations have come into effect, which conflicts with the challenge of having a short response time.This reactive approach undermines their ability to adequately prepare for compliance, that might lead to rushed efforts to meet legal obligations. Consequently, there is a pressing need for SMEs to adopt a more proactive stance in monitoring and understanding regulatory changes to mitigate the risks associated with late compliance. Accordingly, there should be not only a general awareness raised about the topic but particularly about Cyber Resilience. The discrepancy between actively seeking information about impending regulatory changes and actual awareness can likely be partly attributed to the preferred communication media, such as business news websites and trade journals. Reporting has predominantly occurred in specialized media, which a large proportion of SMEs do not consult due to their general lack of awareness about Cyber Resilience. 625","ensuring cybersecurity compliance: assessing sme awareness and preparedness for the cyber resilience act christoph szedlak1, holger reinemann1, sophia hatzelmann² 1competence center of digitalization koblenz university of applied science koblenz 56075, germany ahc gmbh 70376 stuttgart, germany","References

72,5Th Asia Pacific Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ap05.20240163,"this study investigated the optimization of alpha-amylase inhibitory extract production from white kidney beans (phaseolus vulgaris). a box-behnken design was employed to systematically evaluate the effects of three factors on yield and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity: extraction solvent concentration (0.05 m, 0.10 m, 0.15 m), extraction time (1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours), and separation time (30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes). response surface methodology (rsm) was then used to analyze complex relationships between these parameters and the desired outcomes. the strong correlation observed between the experimental data and rsm analysis validated the effectiveness of the optimization strategy. the optimal conditions, yielded an extract with the highest specific activity (0.111 units/mg) using a pbs concentration of 0.101 m, an extraction time of 1 hour, and a separation time of 30 minutes. interestingly, a slightly modified set of parameters (0.105 m pbs, 1-hour extraction, and 30.01 minutes separation) resulted in the highest extract yield percentage (11.89%). this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a combined box-behnken design and rsm approach for optimizing the extraction of bioactive compounds from natural sources. this paves the way for large-scale production of a potent alpha-amylase inhibitory extract and its exploration in future health applications.","extraction time, optimal condition",", the presented results showcase diverse applications of RSM optimization in legume extraction. While the white kidney bean study focuses on a specific target compound and its activity, the combined studies offer broader insights into optimizing extraction methods for various legume components. Both sets of research pave the way for further investigation into the health benefits of legumes and the development of improved extraction techniques. 6. Conclusion This study successfully employed a randomized Box-Behnken design to identify the optimal conditions for extracting white kidney bean extract with maximized yield and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity. Under these parameters, the extract achieved a promising yield of 11.89 % and a notable inhibitory activity of 0.111 units/g. However, future research could research deeper into the specific components responsible for the inhibitory activity. Employing high- performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) would enable the quantification of total alpha-amylase inhibitors and active glycoproteins within the white kidney beans. This approach holds the potential to refine extraction conditions even further, potentially leading to even higher yields of extracts boasting even more potent inhibitory activity. By optimizing the extraction process based on specific bioactive components, this research paves the way for the development of more effective functional foods and nutraceuticals derived from white kidney beans.

The findings are consistent with previous research, demonstrating that tailings can be effectively incorporated into concrete mixtures, provided that the mix design is carefully managed. However, the observed deviations in mixtures with high tailing content indicate the need for further optimization and testing. Future research should focus on enhancing the mix design, conducting comprehensive durability tests, and ensuring the environmental safety of tailings-incorporated concrete. By addressing these areas, the potential for sustainable and cost-effective use of mining tailings in construction can be fully realized. 6. Conclusion The main findings of the study indicate that polymetallic tailings can partially replace sand in conventional concrete for basic structural applications. Concrete mixtures were prepared with 40% and 100% sand replacement by polymetallic tailings, and properties such as workability, unit weight, temperature, air content, and compressive strength were evaluated. The results showed that the concrete temperature remained within acceptable limits, averaging 20.2°C, and the air content was low, favoring material strength. The unit weight of all mixtures corresponded to normal-weight concrete, with values exceeding 2300 kg/m³. The compressive strength of concrete with 40% sand replacement reached 164.6 kg/cm² after 28 days of curing, demonstrating its suitability for plain concrete applications. The importance of this research lies in the need to find sustainable solutions for the management of mining tailings, which represent a significant economic burden and a potential environmental risk. By reusing these tailings in concrete production, the study contributes to the circular economy and mitigates the negative impacts associated with their storage. This approach benefits the mining sector and provides the construction industry with an alternative material for concrete production, thus reducing the demand for virgin raw materials. The contributions to the field of study are significant, as this work demonstrates the technological and environmental feasibility of using polymetallic tailings in concrete production. The research provides empirical data on the mechanical and physical properties of concrete with tailings, setting a precedent for future studies in this area. Additionally, it offers a practical and scalable solution for mining waste management, aligning with global sustainability and waste management strategies. Finally, observations and suggestions for further study are offered. It is recommended to conduct additional strength tests to ensure the long-term durability of the material and leaching tests to ensure its environmental safety. Additionally, exploring the use of setting accelerators for specimens containing tailings is suggested, as the use of tailings complicates the setting process and may affect strength test results. Minimizing contamination during tailings handling is also crucial. Future research should consider expanding the range of sand replacement and evaluating the impact of different types of tailings on concrete properties.","polymetallic mining tailings reuse within the framework of circular economy for concrete production andrea carolina ojeda-zamudio, salvador carlos montori-barba bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20181325@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20181225@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, juan carlos quiroz-flores research professor facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú jcquiroz@ulima.edu.pe",

The gyroid cores were sandwiched between CFRP laminates to create composite panels, while another set of panels used gyroid cores filled with PUF. The study aimed to explore how core density and topology affect the flexural properties of these panels. The findings reveal that increasing the core density significantly enhances flexural properties, including maximum bending load, facing stress, and core shear strength. When comparing panels with gyroid cores to those with PUF- filled gyroid cores at the same density, the facing stress and core shear strength were similar. This suggests that core density plays a more critical role in determining flexural properties than the core's topology. However, integrating PUF into the gyroid core improved the panels' ability to withstand deflection before failure, enhancing their strength and toughness. Both compression strength, modulus, and energy absorption increased with core density in both cases, but gyroid core sandwiches consistently showed higher values than their PUF-filled counterparts at the same density. The statistical analysis indicates that the tested structures reliably replicate performance levels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the design and material choices.

Utilizing Kendall notation allowed this paper to highlight arrival rates, server availability, and the capacity of a system and thus, derived an in-depth system analysis in the shoe manufacturing company. The main goal of the study was to identify bottlenecks that lead to idle time and ineffectiveness in production, the analysis in Tables 4 and 5 shows that the utilization rate in workstations 2, 3, and 6 was low. These workstations operated the lowest station rating where the task was finished quickly due to the arrival of only three materials, resulting in higher idle time. Utilized the queuing theory Kendall notation model, the paper was used to define system performance and unveiled issues within shoe manufacturing, findings also uncovered the difference in workstation efficiency, resulting in the transfer of workload to increase productivity and decrease time delays. In Table 2. Tabulated Computed Data for Single Server Multiple Customer Proposed Process, workstation 1 gained a 68% utilization rate, whereas workstation 6 had only 23% which points out a need to improve the production procedure. Table 4 Computed Data for Single Server Multiple Customer Current Process and Utilization Rate, workstation 1 shows an 18% increase in utilization, workstation 7 only an increase of 1% but in combination improves the total utilization rate. Lastly, the goal was to evaluate and measure the current arrival process to improve and minimize transportation time and idle time of a Poisson process. Table 3 provides the results of the reduction in idle time across different sections when the process was restructured and using promodel simulation software. The idle time decreased workstation 2 by 8%, workstation 3 by 8%, and workstation 6 by 6%. The queuing theory is utilized to delineate the states of the stages of the company's process through a quantitative data-driven framework (Marsudi & herlina, 2018). The final recommendation from the study is to utilize the calculation of utilization rate and probability of idle workstations. These calculations are critical factors in identifying system improvements within the three stations and thus aid in theorizing methods that can reduce idle time and increase production level and work performance. 5.1 Practical Implications of the Study Utilizing the queuing theory is a vital instrument for a manufacturing company as it elaborately identifies where and how the process can be streamlined and optimized through a capacity objective. The study found that implementing the queuing theory approach it may increase the utilization rate of the worker and a key to be efficient in performing work at the most effective rate. Furthermore, in an article by Salawu et al. 2020, the studies were conducted to create a method in an advanced manufacturing environment where waiting time was minimized by the queuing theory case model found also in the study with data illustrating the queuing model level achieved optimal values showing how the queuing model approach can amend the waiting time in an advanced manufacturing setting. This paper offers solutions that can aid the manufacturing problems experienced by the company through the use of queuing theory, the study determines that there are bottlenecks in the process. By implementing the queuing theory, businesses were able to strive for the better (Stevens, 2021). 5.2LimitationsandFutureResearch The study focuses on four M's aspects, which are the man, machine, material, and method, limiting the monetary 764","utilizing single-server multiple customer queuing theory for production efficiency in footwear manufacturing operation mari dane m. agra, christine anne l. de guzman, ali p. deocareza, robin kenshin r. sanchez, maricar m. navarro industrial engineering department, technological institute of the philippines, cubao quezon city qmdmagra@tip.edu.ph, qcaldeguzman@tip.edu.ph, qapdeocareza@tip.edu.ph, qrksanchez@tip.edu.ph, mnavarro.ie@tip.edu.ph","References

However, they resulted in different compounds in the effluents. Sugar was found when Cellic® Ctec2 was used whereas polysaccharides were found with Celluclast®. From the results, polysaccharides could be used as an emulsifier. There was no plant hormones found in any effluents studied. However, the presence of phenolic compounds normally associated with VCO, was observed in all the enzymatic cleaning effluents. Since there have been reported several uses of polysaccharides and benefits of phenolic compounds found in VCO, the enzymatic effluent could be converted into useful products. Using a mixture of Celluclast® and Acalase gave the highest cleaning efficiency. Cleaning results also suggested the possibility of using a single stage using this mixture of enzymes to clean coconut milk foulants by increasing the cleaning fluid speed. Direction of flows could also play an important role in the cleaning efficiency; this work suggested that having various directions of shear forces could improve cleaning performance. Considering water properties of the effluent from the enzymatic cleaning (Celluclast® mixed with protease) and the effluent from the alkali cleaning, TS, TDS and COD of the enzymatic cleaning were larger. This could be due to the presence of coconut oil and polysaccharides in the enzymatic cleaning effluent. Hence, a method to remove the oil and/or polysaccharides from the effluent should be considered in the treatment of the water from the enzymatic cleaning effluent. Nevertheless, the lower pH and smaller concentrations of salts in the enzymatic cleaning effluent suggested that the effluent could be treated and could have less effects on the environment.

To achieve financial viability, the analysis suggests that electricity purchase prices would need to be set at Rp2,903 and Rp4,666 for the first and second scenarios, respectively. This research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in Indonesia's energy sector. However, we acknowledge the limitations of our study and recommend future research to incorporate broader socio-environmental factors and a wider range of uncertainty variables.

96,5Th Asia Pacific  Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Published:2024,"in past decades, a multitude of event related to supply chain disruption (e.g., the earthquake in japan 2011, global economic crises in 2011, and current covid19 case) have occurred in succession, causing greats loses to enterprise or even the national scale. seaport, under global economic and supply chain integration, is also vulnerable on this event and sometime generating a domino effect to the entire supply chain network. the vulnerability of seaport thus needs to be addressed to ensure the functionality of seaport and enhance supply chain resilience. the primary goal of this study is to develop a framework that can be useful to understand: the phenomena of interdependency of the conditional risk in the seaports; and risk appetite from their entities too. this study investigated indonesian seaport operation related the supply chain disruption. in realization, this research started with observing the extensive literature review and risk document related supply chain disruption from the indonesian seaport. furthermore, this research finds that there are 10 dimensional threats factors and 61 seaport risk factors that have clear implication to disrupt supply chain continuity – not only indonesia but also somewhere seaport.",conjoint analysis,"First study – We computed the correlation network by calculating the dependency degree using rough set and genetic algorithm. The correlation network is addressed to reveal the interdependency between the supply chain threat factors (threat variables) with their risk event (conditional seaport risk as observable attributes). According to the study findings, 24 seaport risks in Indonesia pose potential threats to supply chain continuity. Second study – It was found the seaport service process should be optimized as a priority in order to reduce the disruption. The factor disrupts utility by as much as 32%, followed by the relationship process threat (A5) and planning process threat (A1). Hence, these latter two threats assume the second and third priorities, respectively. However, the infrastructure breakdown (A2) poses less threat of SSCRD at 9.9%. Moreover, the conditional seaport risk attributes significantly contribute to SSCRD and make the conditional seaport risk attributes more unpredictable. As regards the advantage related to the level of risk, the highest level of SSCR attributes is maintained at the utility level of 1%-37%. Unless the SSC utility of earthquake (a101) is zero for the first time, in the robustness test in Figure 5. It means that the utility this factor is 0 in its first occurrence. This negative trend points out that SSC entities must simultaneously focus on planning, implementation, and development directed toward enhancing SSC resilience. Third study – It introduces the concept of interdependency among the conditional seaport risk attributes and evaluate them according to the rough set parameter, such as certainty and coverage. Moreover, the MANOVA was used to check whether the dependent variables from the reduction algorithm have similar matrix correlations (variance– covariance) with the predictor features. As results, there are 16 features are considered to pose the highest potential risk to SSC continuity in Figure 6. The scale in the legend indicates the correlation referring to the interdependency and implication degrees. Fourth study– This study explaining about risk appetite model. Risk appetite of the SSC stakeholders drives the tolerance level with respect to the acceptance of risks. Using mix-integer linear programming (MILP), we selected the risk factors that have minimum tolerance level with regards to the risk acceptance. The minimum acceptance risk level helped to minimize the revenue loss; hence, we got a comprehensive understanding which conditional seaport risk that useful to minimize revenue loss and how far the revenue loss can be minimized. By this, we also computed the minimizing revenue loss problem considering two rules or scenarios, such as sporadic risk case and repetitive risk case. As a result, the potential revenue loss for the port-authority is 8.67% and followed by 7.12% of seaport-user in the sporadic case. Whereas 19% and 17% of the potential revenue loss from port-authority and seaport-user respectively is impacted from the repetitive risk case. In general, the supply chain operation should not be focused on the manufacturing perspective. The integration of the seaport should be considered in the supply chain network. Thus, the SSC operations should focus on optimizing cost, profit, and capacity. In fact, the discrepancy can be observed in real-life operations where minimizing revenue loss becomes a significant objective when the risk event occurred. In this dissertation, it has developed three model to understand the interdependency phenomena, such as supply chain threat with conditional seaport risk, conditional 903","doi: 10.46254/ap05.20240203 the seaport-fulcrum supply chain risk evaluation for an archipelagic country: study of indonesian stakeholders muhammad reza do. bagusa,b and shinya hanaokaa adepartment of transdisciplinary science and engineering tokyo institute of technology tokyo 152-8550, japan dobagusmuhammadreza@gmail.com, hanaoka.s.aa@m.titech.ac.jp bdepartment of information systems college of informatics and computer management tidore mandiri (stmik tidore mandiri) kota tidore kepulauan 97812, indonesia dobagusmuhammadreza@gmail.com","References

There is still room for improvement in the appearance and flavor of the bar. It is important to emphasize that this prototype was developed in a functional foods laboratory on a small scale, where operations such as mixing and molding were done manually. The development was also limited to using the previously mentioned ingredients, and no tests were conducted with different foods. However, there is the potential to enhance the nutritional value of the prototype by implementing or replacing some ingredients, especially those used to bind the mixture. In terms of testing, the protein analysis was limited to the Kjeldahl method in the Functional Foods Laboratory at the University of Lima, and the nutritional value tests were conducted at the SAT Peru laboratory. On the other hand, it is possible to scale production to an industrial level since the production process is simple and does not require many steps. The most complex part is the mixing of ingredients, which can be addressed with a high- quality mixing machine. 933","manufacturing of a quinoa and soy-based protein bar prototype renán pachas cueva carrera de ingenieria industrial, universidad de lima, perú código orcid 0009-0003-3985-4468 20183014@aloe.ulima.edu.pe miguel avalos ortecho carrera de ingenieria industrial, universidad de lima, perú código orcid 0000-0003-0939-634x eavalos@ulima.edu.pe","References

101,5Th Asia Pacific Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ap05.20240224,"additive manufacturing (am) also known as 3d printing led to a revolution in the manufacturing sector, as it shortened the time-to-market of new products, facilitated intricate design, and more importantly mass customization. one of the well-known am processes is fused deposition modeling (fdm) which can create polymer-based parts. the restricted size of printed part is a major problem in fdm due to its limited chamber size. the oversized model issue was addressed by some researchers, proposing the segmentation and division of large models as a solution for this problem. this study aims to investigate the effect of flat dovetail and round screw joints as segmental joining methods with the placement of cyanoacrylate adhesive between the polylactic acid (pla) segments on the flexural strength of the final joined pla parts. the results revealed that the use of cyanoacrylate adhesive significantly enhances the flexural strength of round screw joints in pla prototypes, while it reduces the flexural strength of flat dovetail joints, with the positive impact on round screw joints being more pronounced.","segmentation, 2001","An experimental study has been carried out on a set of 3D-printed PLA segments to study the effect of segmental joining methods with and without cyanoacrylate adhesive on the mechanical behavior of different joining categories under flexural loading. The key findings from this study are as follows: The mechanical behavior of joined 3D-printed PLA segments under flexural loading is greatly affected by the joining method and the adhesive usage. The combination of round Screw Joints with cyanoacrylate adhesive significantly enhances the flexural strength of the final joined part. The use of cyanoacrylate adhesive for flat dovetail joints negatively impacts flexural strength. Therefore, the effectiveness of cyanoacrylate adhesive depends on the used segmental joining method.

The main goal was to find the main principles of Total Quality Management (TQM) that contribute to the three dimensions of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) - Environmental, Social, and Economic Sustainability. The aim was also to evaluate how these principles can help in implementing sustainable development practices. The findings showed that different TQM principles have a significant but varied impact on the three dimensions of sustainability. The Evidence-Based Approach showed the strongest correlation with Economic Sustainability, indicating that making decisions based on data is essential for achieving economic goals. It is important to engage employees in environmental initiatives because their commitment has been shown to have a strong association with environmental sustainability. Process Management has been found to have a significant impact on improving Social Sustainability. This is because it plays a crucial role in promoting fair and effective organizational practices. Although there were positive correlations found, the study showed that relying solely on TQM may not be enough to achieve complete sustainability. Although TQM principles can greatly improve the social and economic aspects of sustainability, their effect on environmental sustainability is not as strong. This is evident from the relatively lower importance of Continuous Improvement in this particular area. So, although TQM is a useful framework for promoting sustainability, it's important to combine it with other strategies and measures to fully tackle the complexities of sustainable development. Future researchers could improve their study by including a wider range of participants from various regions and industries. This would help to make the findings more applicable to a larger population. In addition, it would be beneficial for future studies to investigate how TQM can be combined with other management frameworks and practices in order to create a more holistic approach towards achieving sustainability. Studying the long-term effects of implementing Total Quality Management (TQM) on sustainability outcomes could offer valuable insights for organizations looking to embrace sustainable practices.","correlation between tqm and triple bottom line (tbl): perspectives from construction companies in gauteng, south africa palesa mlimi, nita sukdeo and sambil charles mukwakungu department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg johannesburg, gauteng, south africa palesamlimi247@gmail.com, nsukdeo@uj.ac.za, sambilm@uj.ac.za",
103,5Th Asia Pacific Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ap05.20240228,"vehicle accidents have become the most significant problem on roads within south africa. these accidents could result in mild to severe damage to the vehicles (sometimes purchased expensively) and/or in the loss of human life. given the advances in pneumatics technology and automation, and the need to boost the safety capacities of vehicles to resist and limit damage to frontal collisions, this study proposes a sensor-aided pneumatic bumper activation system to reduce the impact force during a vehicle crash. we develop and analysed system-based model build-up to improve crashworthiness. the proposed system consists of a sensor transmitter, receiver unit, control unit, and bumper, and the proposed design is validated through simulation studies. the most important finding from this study was the improvement of crashworthiness in the case of a full-frontal collision between a vehicle and a barrier through the combination of the vehicle dynamics control systems with an extendable bumper. as obstacles approach the vehicle, with a control signal in place, the electronic circuit instantly activates the bumper to absorb the impact and keep it from getting too close to the vehicle's body. when the extendable bumper is deployed, the occupant's longitudinal displacement and acceleration are greatly reduced. the cost of high-end cars can be reduced by adopting this concept and providing equivalent levels of safety. also, the importance of pneumatics technology in automation, modern machine shops, and space robots is emphasized.","vehicle dynamics, crashworthiness, pneumatic system, extendable bumper","The major goal of this system's design is to improve accident prevention techniques while also lowering the risk of accidents such as vehicle damage, human harm, etc.We discovered that our effort could achieve all the necessary goals. Cars with airbags have a high initial cost. We can cut the cost of high-end cars by adopting the Sensor-Aided Pneumatic Bumper Activation System and providing equivalent levels of safety. Airbags are useful for providing interior safety to passengers in vehicles, but in our proposal, we will give both internal and external safety to protect the vehicle from harm. As a result, we will lower the initial cost of cars while simultaneously providing additional benefits.Vehicle crash structures, vehicle dynamic control and extendable bumper systems are mostly part of the system introduced in this study. In addition, to capture the occupant dynamic response, a mathematical model has been constructed. Numerical models have shown that the extended bumper absorbs more collision energy than the typical structure at the same crash speed. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated with the programmed system’s results that the extended bumper actuated by a cylinder reduces intrusions and aids in keeping vehicle deceleration below acceptable limits. From the results obtained, the system has improved such that the controller introduced will be used to calculate the chance of collision. The extension of the bumper increases the time of impact and reduces the force of impact. Force is inversely proportional to time therefore when time increases, force will decrease. In so doing the injuries to the passengers will be reduced if not avoided. To improve on this study, combining numerous elements into this system to give greater protection through the intelligent braking system in real-time applications can be achieved. Some of the probable adjustments are as follows: A limit switch can be used to set the minimum speed at which the system will be activated. The bumper design can be improved to include external airbags. With a few tweaks, the project may be utilized with timer circuits to apply brakes and extend the bumper after a few milliseconds of delay, ensuring that the bumper does not extend until the vehicle is within crashing distance. Finally, comparative studies with other possible results using related techniques in the Literature will provide more insights into the efficacy of our designed system.","a sensor-aided pneumatic bumper activation system to reduce the impact force during a vehicle crash boitumelo gloria khuthama department of industrial engineering, operations management and mechanical engineering vaal university of technology, vanderbijlpark south africa kutamatumi59@gmail.com taiwo lolade ladipo department of industrial engineering, operations management and mechanical engineering vaal university of technology, vanderbijlpark south africa taiwol@vut.ac.za gbeminiyi john oyewole school of mechanical, industrial, and aeronautical engineering university of the witwatersrand, johannesburg, south africa gbeminiyi.oyewole@wits.ac.za",

The results from the Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) revealed that variations in input factors such as gender, prior experience with simulation games, domain-specific knowledge, and practical experience did not exert a statistically significant influence on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Lead Time, Throughput, and Error Rates. The absence of significant effects is likely attributable to the homogeneity within the student cohort, where limited demographic and experiential diversity may have mitigated the potential impact of these input variables. Conversely, the analysis of communication patterns underscored the critical role of active and equitable engagement in driving performance metrics. Teams that exhibited higher levels of participation, motivation, and balanced communication were markedly more efficient, achieving reduced lead times and enhanced throughput. Moreover, teams that engaged more frequently with facilitators and neighboring groups, particularly during the optimization phase, produced a greater number of solution proposals, thereby highlighting the importance of cross-team interactions in fostering innovation. Nevertheless, certain limitations must be addressed. The study’s emphasis on the quantity of communication, rather than its qualitative content, constrains a deeper understanding of the specific interactions that influence performance. Additionally, the inherent challenge of objectively assessing participation and motivation introduces a potential bias, suggesting a need for future research to adopt a more comprehensive approach to exploring these dimensions. The study’s small and homogenous sample further restricts the generalizability of the findings, underscoring the necessity for research involving more diverse and larger populations. It should also be noted that the underlying logical model excluded several influencing factors. Despite efforts to keep these constant, their impact on the present learning environment cannot be ruled out. Additionally, other confounding variables may not have been captured at all. A structured analysis of confounding variables should be addressed by future research. Future investigations should focus on the qualitative dimensions of communication, exploring how specific content and interaction types contribute to performance outcomes. Additionally, examining the differential impact of participant engagement across various demographic groups could yield more refined insights into optimizing team-based simulations. Despite these constraints, the findings reinforce the vital importance of cultivating both internal collaboration and external engagement to enhance the effectiveness of team-based learning environments.","measuring the effects of face-to-face interactions on performance in business simulation games christoph szedlak and bert leyendecker competence center of digitalization koblenz university of applied science koblenz 56075, germany szedlak@hs-koblenz.de",

Because the model adapts to changes in the system, it minimizes the occurrence of financial risks due to over-maintenance or under-maintenance. Hence, it has practical applicability in real-world maintenance decision-making. The primary issue here is that it is quite hard to correctly estimate the transition probabilities between system states, and for that purpose, lots of data are to be collected. Besides, it is assumed that the budget is fixed, while under normal conditions, production equipment is exposed to an increased failure rate with time.

The social implementation of LSECBs has been shown to bring a variety of unanticipated benefits to the community. For example, they can act as a mechanism to generate conversation among community members and connect various community organizations. It is important to evaluate not only the technical aspects of these new vehicles such as LSECBs, but also the social aspects. The value that LSECBs bring to the community also needs to be discussed in detail based on a socio-technical approach.

121,5Th Asia Pacific Conference On Industrial Engineering And Operations Management  Doi: 10.46254/Ap05.20240275,"we evaluate the impact of ai applications in power systems on energy security. we analyze the benefits and risks associated with ai implementation on the european power grid, focusing on four dimensions of energy security: availability, affordability, accessibility, and acceptability. we investigated the benefits of ai using pypsa-eur, a python-based model of the european electricity system. three ai applications were parametrized: load reduction, load shifting, and wind wake steering. we compared scenarios in which these ai applications are widely deployed against a baseline scenario without these applications. we also analyze risks associated with ai deployment in the power grid. we developed a risk taxonomy centered around six high-level categories: cybersecurity, jurisdictional or sovereignty issues, unexplained or unexpected actions by the model, unethical or illegal decision-making, reliance and trust in decision-making, and supplier dependency and vendor lock-in. we conducted a back-casting exercise with subject- matter experts to determine positive and negative future outcomes of ai deployment and identify actions to create positive outcomes and avoid negative ones. we find that ai applications can improve energy security in power systems. in the scenarios we tested, behind-the-meter applications have a greater impact on energy security.","energy security, ai, power grid","AI applications could help improve energy security AI would seem to offer much to balance the competing pressures and opportunities the electricity system is facing. Its ability to rapidly see patterns in large amounts of data and from a range of sources, and to make decisions with that information much faster than a human could, seem well suited to complex electricity systems. These systems could use the help. More is being asked of aging electricity infrastructure, as growing populations and changing demand patterns put pressure on systems not designed for it. Moreover, a warming climate, and the extreme weather that comes with it, not only further raise the electricity demand, but also increases the risk to the infrastructure that generates and supplies it. Added to this, rapidly changing technologies raise the cost for energy companies in updating their infrastructure, while also raising the opportunity cost – as the risk of investments being more quickly rendered obsolescent is higher now than in the past. The business model is changing, and this presents fundamental and even existential questions for companies in energy generation and supply. AI’s potential to sift through and balance supply and demand across an increasingly stressed system, isolate problems before they spread, and identify where the greatest gains from new investment might be found has seen some energy suppliers already introduce AI into their operations. These gains may only become sharper and more apparent as AI technology improves, and our means of testing those gains also improves. The benefits mainly lie behind the meter This study sought to test the potential for AI to improve the level of energy security in electricity systems. The research team found significant potential benefits for the application of AI behind the meter, which are applications installed on consumer premises that directly try to make energy consumption more efficient. For example, we found that AI applications that aim to make heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) installations more efficient could have a significant positive impact on the overall energy security of the system. In addition, AI applications that can guide demand response and help consumers react more dynamically in response to changing electricity prices also had a clear impact. However, the research team found negligible benefits detected in front of the meter. This was surprising – we expected the benefits of AI to be seen more broadly throughout the system. Nevertheless, our analysis showed that AI-driven wake steering of wind turbines did not markedly improve energy security. We also noted that the combination of different front-of-meter and back-of-meter AI applications led to tradeoffs between the benefits offered by the different applications. The risks of AI should not be overlooked Despite these opportunities, the deployment of AI applications in the electricity system also comes with risks. Our research points to cybersecurity risks, jurisdictional or territorial sovereignty issues, the risk of unexplained or unexpected actions, unethical or illegal decision-making by the model, a failure in human-machine interaction, and supplier dependency and vendor lock-in. Commercial pressures may see electricity supply companies look to institute AI before it is mature or save costs on human oversight. Manipulating AI or the system around it is also a compelling vector for a nefarious actor to exploit, with potentially widespread consequences. It may be difficult to undo the implementation of AI application in the electricity system. Policymakers, regulators, and energy companies should therefore carefully balance the opportunities and risks offered by specific AI applications. Our approach has limitations The research team faced some obstacles and limitations in undertaking this research. Our quantitative modeling was limited by the availability of sufficiently complete generation and consumption data of the European electricity system, as well as useable data or projections about the performance of AI applications. We also found a surprising reticence among experts, both in and out of the energy business, to speak to the research team about the pros and cons of AI. In some cases, this appeared to be due to a dearth of potential participants who felt comfortable engaging with both the AI and the energy supply sides of this research, highlighting a potential knowledge gap. It may also have been the case that this is a commercially sensitive area, and some invited participants were reluctant to engage on that 1117","the use of ai for improving energy security: exploring the risks and opportunities of the deployment of ai applications in the electricity system ismael arciniegas rueda, hye min park rand 1100 south hayes street, arlington va, usa irueda@rand.org; hmpark@pardeerand.edu henri van soest rand europe rue de la loi 82, brussels, belgium vansoest@randeurope.org","References
