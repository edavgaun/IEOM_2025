0,Cloud-Based Technology Can Revolutionise Operational  Planning At Reduced Change Management Cost,"integrated business planning (ibp) has evolved from the sales and operations planning (s&op) process as a methodology for assessing and optimising financial performance of operational plans. however, despite the engagement of finance in the planning processes, many ibp implementations have suffered the same engagement and sponsorships challenges as s&op. this paper examines implementation from the perspective of using a “change vehicle” – technology – as a tool to both lower the barriers to change and provide participants with the momentum to move thought the change steps of: creating a sense of urgency, providing a guiding coalition, enlisting volunteers, enabling action and generating short-term wins around a strategic vision and instituting change. we examine the sap cloud product ibp through the lens of change management and its potential to overcome the barriers observed in traditional ibp and s&op implementations. a key finding from the analysis in this work is that the standard spreadsheet user interface provided by the solution in effect removes the need to transition users from the comfort zone of using spreadsheets to a new solution space. the implications of this work are that s&op and ibp may be implemented using the sap ibp cloud solution at reduced management time cost to an organisation, facilitating improved operational outcomes using more junior leveraging operational teams than was previously possible under traditional business process re-engineering.",process,,"dr. david paynter centre for transformative innovation swinburne university of technology, australia dpaynter@swin.edu,au",
1,Green Lean Practices And Reverse Logistics: Evidence From  Manufacturing Industry Of A Developing Economy,"the past literature has seen considerable growth in lean and green concepts in the context of developed countries. however, despite the increasing interdependencies between developing and developed economies, little is known in the context of developing economies. this study investigates the impact of green and lean practices, and reverse logistics on organizational performance in the context of a developing economy. we employ a quantitative research design, where a sample of 170 responses was generated from senior managers of manufacturing firms in pakistan – a developing economy. the analysis uncovers those green practices have a significant positive nexus with organizational performance in a developing economy like pakistan. further, we find that lean practices and reverse logistics serially mediate the relationship between green practices and organizational performance. we thus suggest green practices, lean practices, and reverse logistics as key levers to enhance performance and gain a competitive advantage for the firms in the developing economy like pakistan. this is among the few studies testing serial mediation of lean practices and reverse logistics between green practices and organizational performance. the findings offer numerous contributions to both theory and practice.","green practices, lean practices, reverse logistics",,"muhammad junaid ahsan phd scholar, department of economics and management university of pisa, pisa, italy m.ahsan@studenti.unipi.it muhammadjunaid0803@gmail.com muhammad hasham khalid department of management sciences riphah international university, islamabad, pakistan hasham091@gmail.com dr anas iftikhar lancaster university management school, lancaster university, uk a.iftikhar@lancaster.ac.uk","References

11,Supply Chain Performance Measurement Using Scor  Model In Chemical Industry: A Case Study,"chemical industry is a company that processes the main raw material in the form of pine resin. this company faces the challenge of complexity in the organizational structure, which causes the company to find it increasingly challenging to plan and manage. if it is not addressed, it will impact the difficulty of communication between the company and supply chain partners, which also affects the effectiveness and efficiency of the supply chain in the company. therefore, an evaluation of the company's supply chain performance is needed, which aims to identify indicators that can represent the company's supply chain flow process and determine the value of supply chain performance in the chemical industry. this study uses the supply chain operation reference model (scor) method to discuss the supply chain performance measurement. measurements are made based on 5 core processes, and performance metrics are presented as key performance indicators (kpi). then, each metric is weighted using ahp. according to the results of the study, it was found that the achievement of the company's performance was 82.42% which was included in the pretty good category.","scor, performances, supply chain, core model","Based on the results of the performance measurement system in the company, there are 8 KPIs that have been identified to represent the company's performance. 1 KPI represents the Plan process category, 1 KPI represents the Source process category, 2 KPI represents the Make process category, 2 KPI represents the Deliver process category, and 2 KPI represents the Return process category. KPI identification is made by discussing and adjusting to the SCOR Model. The company’s overall performance can be said to be fairly good, namely the achievement of 82.42%. Overall, the company's performance, especially in the upstream sector related to suppliers and processing systems, has not yet met the company's expectations. Meanwhile, the downstream performance, closely related to the customer, can be said to be fairly good.","ilza athiyatamimy hanun department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia ilzaathiyatamimyhanun@student.uns.ac.id wahyudi sutopo university centre of excellence for electrical energy storage technology research group industrial engineering and techno-economic industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia wahyudisutopo@staff.uns.ac.id","references approach (a case study in a batik company), Proceedings of the International Conference on

12,The Influence Of Sound Exposure Onset And Duration To The  Hearing Loss Prevalence In Musicians,"musicians are often exposed to loud music during practice playing their instrument or performance on stage, so they are at risk of permanent cochlear nerve damage or hearing loss. however, the risk of hearing loss is not well understood since there is a significant inter-individual variation in susceptibility and degree of hearing loss. hearing properly is vital for musicians for hear the right notes and words to playing in the correct pitch and key. since it is not often possible to avoid the noise exposure, some changes of risk factors and use hearing protection devices are suggestion for preventing of hearing loss. study aims were to determine the influence of sound exposure onset and duration to the hearing loss prevalence in musicians. this study was an observational analytic study using a cross sectional design conducted on 35 among musicians in yogyakarta city indonesia during october 2019 - february 2020. we collected demographic data, type of instruments, onset and duration exposure, complaints about hearing and the used of protective device. all participants underwent ear clinical examination and pure tone audiometry interpreted by an audiology consultant. the data obtained were described by frequency and percentage and compared ratio analysed using chi-square test. the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss in musicians at this study was 20%, an audiometric notch in one or both ears were found in 5.71 % and 14.29 % of the participants, respectively. the main complaint was tinnitus reported by 21 (60%) and only 2 (5.71%) of the participants wore hearing protection. bivariate analysis using chi-square test between the sound exposure onset with hearing loss prevalence obtained p value of 0.578 (p > 0.05), and between the sound exposure duration weekly with hearing loss prevalence obtained p value of 0.02 (p < 0.05). the sound exposure onset is not significantly influence to the hearing loss prevalence, while the weekly sound exposure duration is significantly influence to hearing loss prevalence in musicians. since lack of knowledge and awareness most musicians never used protective devices.","hearing loss, sound exposure, onset and duration","The sound exposure onset is not significantly influence to the hearing loss prevalence, while the hours of weekly sound exposure duration is significantly influence to hearing loss prevalence in musicians. Musicians exposed to high levels of sound but low levels of care for their hearing health, it’s caused a highlight the need for extensive hearing conservation programs for this group.","asti widuri doctoral program in faculty of medicine, public health and nursing universitas gadjah mada (ugm), yogyakarta, indonesia otorhinolaryngology department faculty of medicine and health science universitas muhammadiyah yogyakarta (umy) yogyakarta, indonesia astiwiduri1972@mail.ugm.ac.id garry gartiwa, medical student, faculty of medicine and health science universitas muhammadiyah yogyakarta (umy) yogyakarta, indonesia garrygartiwa@gmail.com eko pujiyanto department of industrial engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta (uns) surakarta, indonesia ekopujiyanto@staff.uns.ac.id",
13,The Quality Of Work Life Development At Pt  Telekomunikasi Selular: An Evaluation,"quality of work life is one of the management system approaches to coordinate and connect the potential of human resources, where the quality of work life in the company is a management effort to meet the needs of employees simultaneously and continuously. implementing the right work quality program through fair career development opportunities, conducting proper supervision and working relationships, providing compensation, benefits and rewards in accordance with the salary market and 3ps as well as managing and guaranteeing working conditions and environment are very important, thus the company is expected to can retain the best employees, so that employee turnover is small, commitment, loyalty and optimal performance will be generated by employees.","career development, supervision, compensation","1. Whereas the aspect of career development opportunities must be one of the concerns for company management so that every employee has the same opportunity in developing a career through training organized by the company, but not a few employees have not been touched by career development patterns; the sub-aspects of career development have not gone well and competency development is still a priority scale based on a high competency gap and active employee involvement. So it can be concluded that the career development process based on competence has not gone well, as well as the sub-aspects of promotion, rotation and mutation opportunities. And there is a trend that some promotions are not transparent and not objective, so that if this happens continuously, an unfavorable atmosphere will occur which will lead to low engagement and commitment. 2. Aspects of supervision and working relations carried out by the leadership have been going well, the sub-aspects of supervision and teamwork still need to be improved so that the company's performance will be better, but it is hoped that the company's leaders will continue to improve it. 3. Whereas the aspects of compensation, benefits and rewards in general, employees have received their rights adequately. The sub-aspects of salary according to the market salary are concluded to be in accordance with the salary market in the telecommunications industry in Indonesia and have been reviewed regularly by adjusting the company's financial condition while compensation based on 3P (pay for person, position, performance) has also been carried out although it still needs improvement. 4. Whereas aspects of working conditions and environment, the company has tried to create a safe, comfortable and healthy working environment and climate by ensuring employees work in safe and protected conditions including ergonomic facilities so that employees can work healthily, reducing stress and fatigue. 146","soraya agustina situmorang management department binus business scholl undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 soraya.situmorang@binus.ac.id","References

16,A Study Of The Association Between The Parameters And  Sound Quality Of The Designs Of Headphone Core,"in the current research study, an investigation of the intervention of artificial intelligence in the designs of headphone cores was conducted so that the automated process can be accomplished with the trained network. with the empirical experience in the industry of earphone manufacturing, it can be seen that the design of the headphone was commonly referred to as the culmination of empirical experience, while a large portion of the products was developed based on the modification of diversified and attempts and prototypes. therefore, the design and production rely on the experience of the senior developers consolidated from the practice, while the associated process is costly and involves extensive wastage. due to the complexity and the nonlinear association between the selection of the parameters and the resulted sound quality, the intensive involvement of the senior staff and the unpredictable outcomes are commonly seen, while it also limited the rapid development of the products. thus, the objective of the study is to adopt the machine learning technique to explore the connection between the parameters and the targeted outcome so that a guided and systematic design can result. practically, the research work characterized the design with the selection of types of divers (dynamic driver/moving coil, balanced armature driver, and planar magnetic driver), magnet (n35, n40, n45, and n50 grade neodymium magnet), voice coils (copper wire, copper-covered aluminium wire, and silver wire), and diaphragm (polyethene terephthalate, polyethene naphtholate, polyetheretherketone, and polyetheretherketone + polyurethane) along with the options of single and double drivers in order to simplify the design problem. then, the outcome of sound quality was attributed to six parameters, including total harmonic distortion, output power, frequency response, signal-to-noise ratio, speaker impedance, and headroom with seven levels. as a result, the earphone design problem was simplified as 8 inputs and 6 outputs, while the research work was dedicated to finding the black box in connection with the inputs and outputs. the current study adopted the linear regression method, the principal component analysis, and the neural network for the exploration in order to conduct the performance evaluation. after the full investigation of the models, it was found that the neural network provided a promising performance in terms of root mean square error due to its nonlinear nature of it. on the other hand, the limitation of both linear regression and principal component analysis exhibited the limitation in the characterization of the linkage between the independent and dependent variables. finally, the trained models can be utilized in the design of the earphones for the sake of alleviating human intervention and generating practical impacts on the earphone design process.","earphone design, neural network",,"lui kwai hong, lucas poly university of hong kong hung hom, hong kong lucas.lui@connect.polyu.hk",
17,Towards Developing Real-Life Models: A Simulation  Modelling Of An Ideal Vehicle Assembly Line Using Arena,"we present an ideal model of a typical vehicle assembly plant by generalizing selected case studies from the literature. the ideal model was extended to capture certain realities of material handling to obtain new scenarios. the arena simulation platform was used to model both the base and scenario models. data and probability distribution were obtained from specifications from the literature and random projections. using the number of outputs from the vehicle assembly plant, the base model and the scenarios were analyzed. results of the sensitivity analysis of the scenario models confirm that as real-world systems emanate from the ideal systems for example by capturing material handling realities, the production or service outputs are constrained either positively or negatively. thus, showing the need for understanding different configuration settings of material handling equipment when scaling up production outputs is desired. the simulation modelling and analysis employed are useful both as classroom illustrations on material handling, aid for engineering education and other users in need of general understanding and applications of discrete event simulation modelling.",,"In this study, a simulation model of a generic vehicle assembly plant was presented to illustrate the transitions of real models from ideal models using material handling assumptions. The conveyor and resource-constrained capacity scenarios were modelled into an ideal vehicle assembly model. Sensitivity analysis showed that in the short run material handling devices have the likelihood of either increasing, decreasing, or keeping constant the outputs of a typical operation or process such as vehicle assembly. Therefore, showing the importance of different configuration settings and trading of variables to yield intended results for production outputs. Findings from this study are useful during material handling and design specification to observe the possible relationships among certain variables of the system being designed. In addition, the discrete event simulation and modelling logic employed in this study could be a useful aid in engineering education research to study the flow of students under possible semester and assessment constraints. This study could be improved with the use of more real-life data. In addition, several assumptions considered could be removed to see how this will impact the results. For example, some plants operate continuously, and steady-state modelling might be appropriate. Furthermore, resource schedules and failures could provide more practicality when considering resource utilization. More performance objectives such as the throughput, utilization of resources, cycle time, and average number in the queue for each process could also provide more insight into the material handling process. Lastly, complex robotic features, automated conveyors, automatic storage, and retrieval systems are realities to consider as the world moves in the fourth industrial revolution direction.

20,3320,"between 2020 and 2022, an extensive number of papers about the covid-19 pandemic have been developed to help authorities in the decision-making process to tackle the pandemic. one of the key functions to achieving a timely response to all the activities is scheduling. therefore, this paper presents a literature review of all the research regarding scheduling and the covid-19 outbreak. the search was conducted in scopus and snowballing, gathering a total of 323 papers. a systematic review was conducted, and 43 articles were included. this literature review is classified into five sections: vaccines, testing, developed tools, healthcare scheduling, and others. it was found that the scheduling function is mainly concentrated on designing vaccination strategies. the discussion section provides insights from the literature, including descriptive analysis, used methods, and implemented models.","scheduling, vaccine allocation, covid-19","Between 2020 and 2022, a large amount of research on the COVID-19 pandemic has been developed to understand better and help authorities tackle the outbreak. This literature review showed how scheduling models and simulations could contribute to the decision-making process toward the best strategies to target desired objectives (e.g., minimizing mortality and maximizing vaccinated people). Although the findings of this literature review are clearly clustered, it is essential to mention that some of the included literature does not implement scheduling from an optimization perspective. Still, their contributions are highly necessary for developing accurate scheduling models. For instance, some papers focus on arranging appointments based on people’s preferences, providing further researchers with more accuracy in the appointment scheduling models. Limitations of this research are regarding the selection process of the documents, classification, and interpretation of them, which could lead to biases given the human intervention.

22,Continuation Use Of Digital Wallet Using Extended Ecm  Model In Indonesia,"previous research has been using expectation confirmation model (ecm) model, but the model does not cater many related aspects about continuation to use, therefore this research aims to study the continuance intention of digital wallet by using extended ecm model. in this paper, satisfaction, confirmation, and perceived usefulness, with additional of promotion, mobility, and cost saving are used as the independent variable to measure the dependent variable of intention to continue use digital wallet. the data were collected from 236 respondents between age 18 to 55 years old who live in jabodetabek area that use the top five digital wallet in indonesia (ovo, gopay, shoppe pay, dana, link aja). the data were evaluated by utilizing structural equation modelling approach. the outcome show that perceived usefulness does not significantly affect continuance intention of using digital wallet. however, satisfaction, promotion, mobility, and cost saving significantly affect the continuation use of digital wallet. also, perceived usefulness and confirmation significantly affect the satisfaction of using digital wallet. furthermore, satisfaction significantly mediates positive relationship between perceived usefulness with continuance intention and confirmation with continuance intention. this study provides practical implications for digital wallet provider that satisfaction is the factor that influence the continuance intention, not perceived usefulness.","digital wallet, ecm model, continuation use, mobility","This paper determines the factor that impact continuation use of digital wallet, with Extended ECM model, using promotion, mobility, and cost saving. Nine out of ten hypotheses are supported. The remaining one hypothesis about the effect of perceived usefulness to continuation use of digital wallet is rejected. Extended variables, namely promotion, mobility, and cost saving factor positively affects the continuation use of digital wallet. Thus, factors that impact the continuance intention of digital wallet is confirmed in Indonesia. This study contributes to existing theory by observing the continuance intention after adoption of digital wallet. Furthermore, this study contributes in observing continuance usage of digital wallet, by adding extended variables, namely promotion, mobility, and cost saving, to the ECM model. Very few studies analyze the effect of the extended variables, especially in digital wallet continuance intention to use. To increase continuance intention, digital wallet provider should not only increase usefulness of the application; but they should make users are satisfied with the experience of using digital wallet. This can be done for example, by creating an efficient UI/UX or by smoothing the API; so that the experience of using digital wallet can be satisfactory. Moreover, digital wallet provider can also use the benefit offered by promotion activity and cost saving, because it shows that both factors help in retention of digital wallet user. Lastly, digital wallet provider can also cooperate with lots of merchant since mobility also affect digital wallet user retention. By having lots of merchants that accept digital payment, users will feel that they can use digital wallet anywhere. This study has some limitations that should be considered. The cross-sectional method was used in this study, so it only collects the response in one specific time. A longitudinal study is recommended in the future research to explore how our respondent could change their response over time. Furthermore, additional variable such as merchant network and risk factor might be added in the future research.","asnan furinto doctoral research management, school of business management bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia afurinto@binus.edu dewi tamara, diana hartono and eduard simamora mm executive, school of business management bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia dtamara@binus.edu, diana.hartono@binus.ac.id, eduard.simamora@binus.ac.id",

24,Improving The Quality Of Brake Lining Production Of Nonasbestos 2 (Na2) Type Using Six Sigma Method,"currently, indonesia's manufacturing sector is expanding at a respectable rate. this encourages business owners to focus on the quality of their products. good production standards will result in high-quality items. a consumer- satisfying product can enhance the company's sales. this study was conducted in a plant that has produced brake linings exclusively since 2002. cracks and bloating faults are still present on the surface of the brake linings at this manufacturer; therefore, changes are necessary. the goal of this study was to identify the types of defects, quantify the degree of faults, identify and analyze the variables generating defects, and make recommendations for improving the quality of the company's brake lining manufacture. as evaluated by the sigma value, the current production quality of the non-asbestos 2 (na2) type brake lining is 3.93 sigma. utilizing the phases of define, measure, analysis, improve, and control, six sigma’s is employed (dmaic). this study's outcomes include proposed enhancements and comparisons of sigma values before and after implementation. the conclusion of this study is that there are two types of defects, namely cracks and bloating, resulting from of a number of factors. standard operating procedures (sop), checklists, standard forms for measuring raw materials, and investment in more advanced machines are proposed as means of improvement. the implementation findings yielded a sigma value of 4.59 (an increase of 0.66 sigma from before).","brake lining, defect, dmaic, quality","In the production of brake linings of the NA2 type, there are two primary categories of faults. The two forms of problems are brake lining surface swelling and brake lining surface cracking. During the production of NA2-type brake lining, a number of reasons contribute to the product's deficiency, including improper material composition, improper temperature management, and varying operator hardness test results. There are a number of suggestions for overcoming the issues that lead to the product's deficiency, including the proposed standard formula table form, the proposed checklist for the quality of raw materials, the proposed standard operating procedure (SOP) for the operation of the hot press machine, and the proposed investment for a more advanced measuring instrument, namely Brinell Digital. Hardness Tester Zonhow model LHB-3000A, with the proposed addition of an abrasive wear quality test using the Dongguan Hongtuo model DH-TA-01 abrasion testing equipment. The DPMO value for the manufacture of brake lining type NA2 from January to June 2021 is 7,454,376 with a sigma value of 3.93 sigma. With these figures, the NA2 type brake lining manufacture quality can still be enhanced. After implementing the recommended enhancement, the DPMO value reduced to 985.2217, resulting in an increase in the sigma value to 4.59. This demonstrates that the proposed enhancement has a positive effect on production quality. In addition to the conclusion, the company can also be given the following recommendations for producing the NA2 type brake lining: considering the proposed improvement to purchase a Brinell Digital Hardness Tester machine so that measurement results between operators are more accurate and feasible; and considering the proposed improvement. Purchase the Dongguan Hongtuo Abrasion Testing Machining machine, type DH-TA-01, to add to the abrasive wear quality test. If the standard is decided by the hardness test, it is judged insufficient, so the NA2 type brake lining product requires an additional test, namely the abrasive wear test.","mohammad agung saryatmo, helena juliana kristina and sandy yehezkiel irwandi department of industrial engineering universitas tarumanagara jakarta, indonesia mohammads@ft.untar.ac.id; julianak@ft.untar.ac.id; sandy.545180015@stu.untar.ac.id",

27,Foresight In Product Development A Review On Existing  Understandings And Approaches,"early consideration of the future market environment of a new product favors its success. therefore, the future environment and requirements derived from this must be considered in the development of a product. foresight provides several instruments for identifying different potential future developments, according to the time horizon referenced in the development of the product. especially for a medium to long-term time horizon, trends and scenarios are suitable. with scenarios, alternative environments of the future can be described and distinguished. in strategic product planning, future requirements are derived with the help of scenarios to enable a more efficient and often less expensive definition for a product. due to a volatile market environment, the product must be adapted in many cases or fails to meet the future needs of customers, users or suppliers. there are several approaches to manage this uncertainty. however, there is a lack of an overview of common understandings. in this paper, 29 relevant publications were identified with a systematic literature review considering 382 publications. six existing understandings were identified but they are not used consistently. based on the commonalities, two key orientations were found: future- robustness and future-orientation. with future-robustness, developments can be understood which results in products positioned robustly against several alternative futures. the products can be adapted to different future developments with minor adjustments. in contrast, with future-orientation the development is focused on a specific alternative future and thus the product design is made for one chosen solution concept. therefore, product changes are effortful.","future robustness, future orientation, foresight",,"carsten thümmel, michael schlegel, maximilian kübler, stefan schwarz, andreas siebe and albert albers institute of product engineering (ipek) karlsruhe institute of technology (kit) 76131 karlsruhe, germany carsten.thuemmel@kit.edu, michael.schlegel@kit.edu, maximilian.kuebler@kit.edu, stefan.schwarz@kit.edu, siebe@zukunftsingenieur.de, albert.albers@kit.edu bastian nolte, sebastian sommer and thomas vietor institute for engineering design (ik) tu braunschweig 38108 braunschweig, germany b.nolte@tu-braunschweig.de, sebastian.sommer@tu-braunschweig.de, t.vietor@tu-braunschweig.de",
28,Bi-Objective Model For Multi-Warehouse Inventory For  Fresh Produce With Transhipment,"this paper presents a bi-objective multi-warehouse inventory optimization model for fresh produce, allowing transhipments between warehouses. initially, we extended our previous proposed mixed-integer quadratic programming model by allowing transhipment between warehouses. next, we introduce a bi-objective function, as there is a conflict between two cost components: energy cost of warehouses and product deterioration cost. in the bi- objective model, the first objective minimizes energy costs of warehouses, preparation costs of warehouses, inventory holding costs and transhipment costs. the second objective aims to minimize the quantity of deteriorated products. we performed computational experiments using gurobi optimization using a number of randomly generated instances under three different scenarios based on the value of transhipment costs compared with holding costs (lower, similar or higher). in the first phase of the computational experiments, we consider only transhipments between warehouses (not using the bi-objective function). these results show that considering lateral transhipments decrease the overall costs in all scenarios. next, we repeat the computational experiments, using the bi-objective function and the transhipment between warehouses. we calculated the weighted sum of both objectives using nine different combinations of weights for the two objective functions testing on the same instances. the resulted pareto fronts provide a decision-making scheme for managers to decide on the best trade-off between warehousing and inventory costs (first objective) and the quantity of deteriorated products (second objective).","inventory control, transhipment","This paper considered the multi-period, multi-product, multi-warehouse inventory control optimization problem for the inventory management of fresh produce. We have extended a proposed mixed-integer quadratic programming model (Pam et al., 2022), allowing transhipments between warehouses and presenting a bi-objective function. We tested the mathematical formulations in two phases. First, we tested the performance of the model only with transhipment between warehouses (without the bi-objective function). Next, we tested the model employing the bi- objective function and transhipment between warehouses. For both computational tests, we used the mathematical optimisation software Gurobi using 25 instances randomly generated based on the case study from Pam et al. (2022). In the first phase of the computational experiments, the transhipment costs are divided into three categories, which are less, similar, or greater than the electricity costs. The results show that, independently of the transhipment cost, the overall inventory system costs are minimised. Finally, in the second phase, we conducted computational experiments using the model with the bi-objective function and allowing transhipment between warehouses. We have summed both objective functions with weights from w1=0.1 and w2=0.9, to w1=0.9 and w2=0.1, and we presented the Pareto front results. The Pareto front results (Figure 1, 2 and 3) shows the trade-offs between both objective functions, suggesting possible strategies to managers. 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 180000 100000 110000 120000 130000 140000 150000 160000 Quantity of deteriorated fruits (OBV2) Warehousing and inventory costs (OBV1) w1=0.9 w2=0.1 w1=0.1 w2=0.9 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 100000 120000 140000 160000 100000 110000 120000 130000 140000 150000 160000 Quantity of deteriorated fruits (OBV2) Warehousing and inventory costs (OBV1) w1=0.9 w2=0.1 w1=0.1 w2=0.9 278","regina berretta college of engineering, science and environment the university of newcastle, nsw, australia regina.berretta@newcastle.edu.au parichehr paam asset lifecycle, program delivery sydney water,nsw, australia parichehr_paam@yahoo.com","References

29,Extraordinary Strains In Food Supply Chains: A Literature  Review On Covid-19 Induced Food Supply Chain,"as a new agitator of supply chain disruptions, covid-19 global pandemic has significantly triggered an extraordinary series of shocks on food supply chains worldwide including bottlenecks in farm labor, processing, transportation, and logistics, as well as the significant swings in customer demand. many of these strains are the consequences of policies enacted to prevent spreading the virus. the food industry is one of the important sectors in each economy. while the consequences of covid-19 are still being felt, past experience has shown the necessity of a well-organized and foreseeable global trade environment in ensuring that food reaches people in need. in order to avoid the impending global food crisis, it's critical to examine how covid-19 has impacted food supply networks and to discover the potential remedies. hence, the main objectives of this literature analysis are to examine the nature of covid-19's induced food supply chain disruptions in worldwide and to highlight strategies needed to mitigate the adverse effects of pandemic on the food supply chains as well as to enhance the resilience of worldwide food supply chains. this scrutiny has been conducted using a comprehensive and systematic review of literature published in relation to the impact of covid-19 on food supply chains and this study included the content of 30 articles which were selected as per the prisma approach. in reviewing the selected literature, steps of thematic analysis are considered to derive the major findings. the covid-19 pandemic necessitated the adoption of emergency-preparedness procedures and the development of food supply chain contractual transactions across the worldwide nations. without reverting to the previous state of food supply chains, novel experience resultant from covid-19 emphasized the importance of building a smart food value chain with the involvement of all value adding stakeholders in order to ensure the resilience amidst and beyond the crisis.","covid-19 pandemic, food supply chain","COVID-19 had the possibility to worsen the poverty and malnutrition, particularly in developing countries with inadequate social safety nets. COVID-19 resulted in travel restrictions of laborers, consumer demand fluctuations, shutting down the food manufacturing facilities, restricted food trade legislation, and financial limits in the food supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the significance of guaranteeing public food security during such extraordinary economic shocks, as well as the risk of exacerbating existing food insecurity issues in the countries which need to be addressed effectively. While there have been obvious difficulties and issues in developing countries, food supply chains in the developed countries have shown remarkable resilience and robustness in the face of COVID- 19. While the consequences of COVID-19 are still being felt, past experience has exhibited the necessity of a well- organized and foreseeable global trade environment in ensuring that food reaches people in need. Exemptions from lockdown restrictions for food and agriculture, measures to ensure the health of agriculture and food workers, loosening visa restrictions to attract foreign seasonal workers, and administrative flexibility were among the policy measures taken to protect the functioning of food supply chains. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the adoption of emergency-preparedness procedures and the development of food supply chain contractual transactions across the worldwide nations. Immediate economic assistance initiatives required to avoid this health catastrophe from escalating into a food crisis, and governments should participate in better data collection in order to equip policymakers with the adequate information so that they can form policies that successfully develop comprehensive food value chains. Without reverting to the previous state of food supply chains, novel experience resultant from COVID-19 emphasized the importance of building a smart food value chain with the involvement of all value adding stakeholders in order to ensure the resilience amidst and beyond the crisis. These lessons learnt from the COVID-19 epidemic will be valuable in dealing with the impending food crisis and the further research on the ripple effects of disruptions in food supply systems is needed to enlighten the prospective solutions.","disruptions and resilience navodika karunarathna sliit business school, sri lanka institute of information technology (sliit), malabe, sri lanka navodika.k@sliit.lk dr.d.r.j. siriwardhane & prof. p. g. s. amila jayarathne faculty of management studies & commerce, university of sri jayewardenepura, sri lanka. amilaj@sjp.ac.lk, d.siriwardhane@sjp.ac.lk",

During the last two decades, the worldwide scientific community has been researching and proposing methods and strategies to manage the waste generated in the fishing sector. The use of the VOSviewer tool allowed knowing these methods through the topics that cover them. It was learned that the topics are diverse in each scientific community; however, there are common themes between them which generates a greater intrigue to know what they propose and why it is so much discussed today. Based on two selection criteria, it was possible to determine the most relevant topics in waste management issues, among which wastewater treatment, anaerobic and biological treatment, wastewater reuse and chitin and biogas production stand out. Through these topics, a discussion could be held about how they could contribute and generate a change in the Peruvian fishing industry. Based on the data analyzed from said industry, it could be suggested that it has the potential to invest, develop and improve these waste management methods since, according to the authors, these issues have the capacity to generate environmental benefits because it has a high effectiveness to treat waste; social benefits because they generate greater sustainability with marine resources as well as greater safety for the community and, finally, economic benefits since in addition to reducing costs and optimizing water and energy consumption, they can provide the option of creating new production lines by reusing and giving a commercial value to certain waste that was previously destined only to be treated and subsequently discarded.","fabian minaya and eduardo valdivia facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, perú 20170978@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20172736@aloe.ulima.edu.pe yvan garcía facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingeniería industrial universidad de lima lima, perú ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe",

It's a type of ledger technology. The technology allows two people to directly record and exchange cryptographically linked financial assets. Since its inception in 2008, the price of the technology has skyrocketed, partly due to its volatility and increasing use. Although the application has gotten much attention, in South Africa, Bitcoin is the most well-known component of a blockchain. The technology has grown enough to spawn tokens and continues making strides in the future of technology. As Cryptocurrency is used, the blockchain network allows users to transact financial activities and transfer funds. However, it can be dangerous to institutions and clients due to risks such as money laundering and theft. Regulating and policy can penalize such criminal activity, offering more safety for users.

35,Benefits And Barriers To Total Quality Management (Tqm):  A Review In South African Industries,"this study aims to examine if the approach of tqm is still helpful for enhancing both customer satisfaction and business performance. the following were listed objectives of this study: (1) to review the current state of affairs on tqm use in south african industries; (2) to identify the tqm benefits in south african industries and finally; (3) to barriers to tqm's implementation in south african industries. the study followed a review approach; it gathered the predetermined articles, journals, and textbooks, did a brief review, selected the papers to proceed with an in-depth study, and classified them into four groups. the study reviewed 48 papers, from 2013 to 2021. the results revealed that total quality management systems (qms) are an essential issue to south african industries. reviewing the literature on total quality management (tqm) and organizational performance is the goal of this study. south african organizations must be able to meet client demands and expectations in today's competitive market and complex business environment, including excellent product quality, quick delivery, and affordable pricing. total quality management (tqm) is regarded as one of the most well-liked concepts for thoroughly managing the quality of goods and services. this study also examines if the approach of tqm is still helpful for enhancing both customer satisfaction and business performance. it thoroughly evaluates the literature systematically gathered from various industry areas. the findings demonstrate that many organizations still adopt this idea today, and by so doing, this helps organizations become more competitive, develop their businesses, be more sustainable, and boost employee morale.",,"and future research Total Quality Management (TQM) is still widely practised in numerous businesses and nations worldwide. TQM is focused on increasing customer satisfaction by improving the quality of products, services, and overall quality of the organization to deliver the best product or service solution to the customer. This is one of the main reasons why TQM is still appropriate in this modern environment. Another reason is that TQM is implemented with complete commitment from management and total employee involvement. It becomes a strong concept that is straightforward to comprehend and simple to implement. Furthermore, as TQM adoption in the organization must be quantified to continuously improve and stay competitive in today's business environment, the standard measurement method is required to identify the level or score of TQM implementation. Additionally, it is strongly advised to conduct research on various industry sectors, especially for new start-ups like e-commerce or digital start-ups, to ensure that TQM is still appropriate for such sectors.","webster mthulisi mncube, eric mikobi bakama and khathutshelo mushavhanamadi department of quality and operations university of johannesburg johannesburg, south africa webstermncube@gmail.com, bakamae@uj.ac.za, kmushavhanamadi@uj.ac.za",
36,Project Management-Related Delays And Mitigations To  Power Generation Planned Turbine Maintenance Outages,this research determines and mitigates project management delays during turbine maintenance outages. such mitigations would benefit the organisation in improving plant availability and increasing electricity availability to the consumers through load shedding reduction. the research was triggered by turbine maintenance outages which override the targeted contractual date due to deficiencies in the implementation of project management philosophies and controls. the scope of this research begins at the outage planning phase and ends when the machine returns to service. this study formulates a list of project management delays and mitigation strategies for the said delays to achieve project objectives. it further arrives at conclusions that are directed at the power generation industry and maintenance industries in general.,,"This research aimed to determine and mitigate project management-related delays to planned power generation turbine maintenance outages. Based on a qualitative analysis of literature and through interviews during the study, it can be concluded that there is a wide spread of project management delays that affects the project due dates in power generation turbine maintenance outages. Such delays negatively impact on electrical power availability to the national grid. Mitigation strategies formulated through this research have to be followed to reduce the unreliability of power supply due to planned turbine maintenance outages that override the targeted contractual dates.","nhlakanipho blose, annlizé l. marnewick and jan harm c. pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the build environment university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa amarnewick@uj.ac.za, jhcpretoruis@uj.ac.za",
37,An Investigation Of The Earphone Design With Regression  Analysis,"the current research work provides an investigation into the connection between the design parameters of an earphone and the sound quality performance in order to generate recommendations for future designs. as the earphone design was highly dependent on the empirical experience of the engineers, along with extensive trial and error, it was found to be difficult for research and development. therefore, the current study sought a systematic approach to deal with the design. along with the simplification of the earphone design problem, the sound quality performance outcomes were characterized by six factors, including total harmonic distortion, output power, frequency response, signal-to- noise ratio, speaker impedance, and headroom with seven levels with eight design parameters for the selection of types of divers (dynamic driver/moving coil, balanced armature driver, and planar magnetic driver), magnet (n35, n40, n45, and n50 grade neodymium magnet), voice coils (copper wire, copper-covered aluminium wire, and silver wire), and diaphragm (polyethene terephthalate, polyethene naphtholate, polyetheretherketone, and polyetheretherketone + polyurethane) for the two drivers with zeros for the earphone products with a single driver. after the consolidation of the data from the manufacturer, regression analysis was conducted, while the six equations were formulated, and the models highlighted the importance of the selection of the type of primary driver and the irrelevance of the type of secondary driver. the result not only provides a direct and evidence recommendation for the research and development of earphones, but the research work also proposes an innovative way for knowledge generation from the information as well as existing data.","earphone design, regression model",,"lui kwai hong, lucas and lee ka man, carman poly university of hong kong hung hom, hong kong lucas.lui@connect.polyu.hk","References

38,Product Dispatch Work Process Line Improvement Using  Arena Simulation And Modeling: A Case Study,"simulation and modeling is the process that aids in mimicking the behavior of a real system for the purpose of conducting a study in order to understand operational processes and optimize the outcomes thereof by directly implementing the positive findings from the model in real life situations. the application of simulation and modeling using arena simulation software has seen successful implementation based on its outcomes in many cases such as manufacturing process lines optimizations and in overall, improvement of supply chains in both manufacturing and service sectors. this study aimed at improvement of dispatch work process line by making use of arena simulation modeling as tools for identifying areas of improvement of in a coal fly ash processing plant of a manufacturer situated in sasolburg, south africa. the manufacturer struggled with daily truck dispatches, arena simulation modeling software has revealed that key process waste was on amount of time spent on each dispatch work process lines. with the current dispatch process layout, 22 number of trucks are dispatched within an 8 hour shift, time improvement estimations on dispatch work process stages improved the number of trucks dispatched to 30 which was 36% improvement, meanwhile simulation of proposed new dispatch work process layout coupled with work process stages time interval estimate reduction showed an improvement of number of trucks from 22 to 40 which was 45%. it was recommended to the manufacturer to focus on either improving the time requirement within the work process stages using the current layout or opt for completely altering the layout and increase the length of the one out of three available dispatch weighbridge which was 16 meters, thus to 24 meters in order to accommodate all types of trucks, particularly trucks with tankers and pub in order to improve daily number of truck dispatches which is directly linked to sales.","classifier, oee, simulation","Based on the outcome of the simulation and modeling, it was evident that there was a time wastage on various process stages within the dispatch work process lines which needed to be optimized. The improvement in the time on each process line directly improved the total number of trucks that can be dispatched per day in an 8 hour shift, with number of trucks improving from 22 to 30, that was, 36% improvement, meanwhile in the case proposed new dispatch work process layout added with improved time within work process stages, improved the number of trucks dispatched in an 8 hour shift, thus from 22 to 40 which was 45% improvement. These signified that the implementation of the process stages time intervals improvement and improvement of dispatch work process layout combined process stages time intervals improved the daily sales of the manufacturer as the number of trucks per day is directly proposal to sales. Simulation and modeling is the based tool for continuous improvement of work process within the management of operations.","asser letsatsi tau, emmanuel innocents edoun, anup pradhan and charles mbohwa faculty of engineering and the built environment school of mechanical engineering and industrial engineering department of quality and operations management university of johannesburg, 55 beit st, doornfontein, johannesburg, 2028, south africa gobetse.t@gmail.com, edounsen@hotmail.com, anupp@uj.ac.za and cmbohwa@yahoo.com",
39,The Roles Of Employee And Management In The Application  Of Quality Management System (Qms) In South African,"quality is an important aspect that all companies in world because it is the ability of satisfying the needs of the customers by providing items that meet their criteria. the management of quality is very important as it enable customer satisfaction at lower price and continuous quality improvement. quality control is all about analyzing the project results to see if their meet the quality standards or not, finding the solution to eradicate the causes of the target standards’ failure. quality assurance main aim is to do regular and continuous assessment of the general project to meet quality standards.the research study focused on empirical testing and practical applicability of theoretical concepts of quality management system in manufacturing industry in south africa. the study was conducted in south africa and in johannesburg specifically. this study covered only quality management in the manufacturing industry (manufacturing plant) and the warehouses as well as employees and their roles in the implementation of qms.a quantitative method was used to conduct this study. the quantitative method was used for collecting and analyzing data. this means that the researcher used a well-structured questionnaire to collect data. findings revealed that focus on client’s satisfaction, focus on customer needs, involvement in the qms application process, work as a team, attend training sessions, contribute to improvements, encourage and motivate other employees are the major roles of employee and management in the application of qms in south african manufacturing organizations.","quality control, customers, empirical testing, qms","and Recommendations The study seeks to determine the roles of employee and management in the application of QMS in South African manufacturing organizations. It was revealed from the result of the primary data that focus on client’s satisfaction, focus on customer needs, involvement in the QMS application process, work as a team, attend training sessions, contribute to improvements, encourage and motivate other employees, share knowledge and skills, motivate colleagues in sharing ideas take into consideration the shared ideas, accept change of cultures and systems, share their knowledge, accept new ideas from colleagues, take ownership of the company success are the roles of the roles of employee and management in the application of QMS in South African manufacturing organizations the in order of priority. These findings support the general saying that clients or customers are the king of business. Without the consideration of customers, the business is subjected to fail. Although the South African manufacturing industry is making every effort to increase the applicability of QMS to enhance the continuous improvement of quality performance. It is important to point out a course of action to assist them in understanding how to channel their efforts in the right direction. Based on this submission, it is recommended that as it has been established that focusing on client need determines the continuity of the manufacturing industry, the managers and the supervisors should set a strict rule to place the requirements of the client at the centre of quality management application. Based on the limitation of this study to only Gauteng province of South Africa, future research that uses a larger sample size and broader the research location needs. In addition, other industries can be studied to ascertain if these results are applicable.","manufacturing industry engr. festus uche uwadia, e.i edoun, anup pradhan and c mbohwa faculty of engineering and built environment department of quality and operation management university of johannesburg, university of johannesburg, 55 beit st, doornfontein, johannesburg, 2028, south africa festus_u@yahoo.com, edounsen@hotmail.com, anupp@uj.ac.za, c.mbohwa@uj.ac.za",
40,Dynamic Capability From Product Development Services In  Incubated Smes: A Technology Management Perspective,"the role that technology business incubators (tbis) play in the development of new ventures is of utmost importance for innovative enterprises especially in preparing them to adapt during times of fast-changing business environments. establishing the effects that incubation services have on these innovative ventures particularly small to medium enterprises (smes) can assist in understanding how they develop capabilities that can enable surviving in the market once they have graduated. the survival capabilities utilised by smes in changing business environments can be referred to as dynamic capabilities. this paper explored the dynamic capability developed by smes from product development services offered by tbis. a qualitative research method approach was utilised where 16 technology business incubation managers were assessed to determine their perceptions of a dynamic capability developed from product development services. the results of the study reveal that technology management is a dynamic capability developed from product development services during the business incubation process. this study contributes to better understanding of the dynamic capabilities view (dcv) theory when looking at incubation services and their impact on innovative smes, particularly product development services. it practically explains the relationship between product development and technology management. this is important for incubation practitioners to understand when providing their services to smes. it is equally relevant for entrepreneurs in preparation for the inevitable change in business environment as it provides a perspective on how to adapt to this change by building technology management capacity from the product development services received during incubation. the study adopted a unique approach of combining two critical enterprise development instruments which are business incubators and technology stations into one component. these two entities were viewed with one lens and adopted an umbrella term that called these two entities combined as technology business incubators.",business incubation,"Given that Technology Management is the dynamic capability identified as being developed from product management services of business incubation. The Technology Management capability reflected from the respondents above gives an indication that products can be modified by the incubated SMEs based on adjusting their manufacturing process to adapt to changing business environment when they arise. This can be attributed to assistance received in the form of RandD and operations management which leads to better management of the technology by the incubated SMEs who have acquired product development services from technology business incubators and Technology Stations in particular (or from the global phenomenon, TBI). Central to the DCV perspective is the aspect of resource reconfiguration (Cyfert et al., 2021). From a reconfiguration perspective, in this study this aspect has been displayed, for instance the resources identified were products and technology as enabled by manufacturing and continuous improvement capabilities of the SMEs in the dynamic capabilities’ development process. The main question that the study asked was: What is the dynamic capability developed from product management services of technology business incubation? The results found that Technology Management is a dynamic capability developed from Product Development services during the business incubation process. This is important for the incubation process in three levels. Firstly, at a services level. Secondly at a dynamic capabilities level. Thirdly at a managerial level for SMEs in terms of how they make their decisions in assisting their enterprises thrive during business environmental changes which is at the essence of DCV.

41,Improving Buildings’ Energy Efficiency Through Smart  Technologies: Case Study Of South African University,"energy demand is a global crisis. since the year 2010, most buildings’ energy consumption across the globe has increased by almost 14% (paris agreement, 2018). as a result, energy-supplying utilities have had to increase the burning of coal and gas to meet the demand, which results in high carbon emissions causing global warming (ecometrix africa, 2021). this study evaluates the impact of implementing smart technologies in high-density residential zones by utilising a system that is energy-efficient and cost-saving. the study compared the energy consumption of two mixed student residences of the university of johannesburg, where one is equipped with smart technologies while the other functions with a traditional energy supply system. the results obtained show that there is a 46.26% variance between the two residences' energy consumption. this study's results show that the implementation of smart technologies in high-density residential units can reduce energy consumption by approximately 46% compared to a traditional way of energy supply. the results also reveal that the implementation of smart technologies can reduce the contribution of carbon emissions by 33%.","smart technologies, energy saving, energy intensity","The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of implementing smart technologies in residential buildings. It was achieved by analysing and comparing the energy consumption of the University of Johannesburg’s Mayine and Thomas Sankara’s residences during the 2019 calendar year. The energy consumption and their respective energy costs data were analysed and compared graphically. The difference between the two energy consumption means values indicates that there is a 46.26% variance between the two residences' energy consumption. This means that the consumption at Mayine residence is almost double that of Thomas Sankara residence. The reason for this significant variance is because various energy-saving initiatives have been implemented at Thomas Sankara, such as occupancy, energy-saving lights, installation of high-efficient showerheads, installation of water heat pumps, as well as control ripple relays. The Mayine and Thomas Sankara residences contribute 234.36 tons 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 year and the 157.11 tons 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 year of carbon emission. These reveal that the implementation of smart technologies can reduce the carbon emissions of residential buildings by 33%. The analysed data showed that most energy consumption occurs during the winter season. The research findings also prove that there is higher consumption during the peak hours, from the morning at 6 am to 10 am and also in the evening from 5 pm till 10 pm. Furthermore, the electricity consumption rate during the winter season is more expensive as compared to all the other seasons. In addition, other significant energy consumption contributors that are not taken seriously at residences are the passage, bathroom and toilet lights which are always left on even when there is no activity taking place. These are the most crucial areas which need smart technology systems in the residences of institutions. For energy reduction at the residences, it is recommended that residence management implement an incentive strategy that will encourage an energy-saving culture in students, for example, hosting energy awareness per semester and during the event reward the residents who have used less energy for that semester. In addition, management can implement a programme where residents of university accommodation come up with innovative ideas for energy- saving, such as designing motion sensor lighting systems and smart plug systems. These ideas can then be sponsored and implemented at the university residences as a means of energy efficiency. Furthermore, it is recommended that all the existing residential buildings are retrofitted. It can be done through the use of smart windows, smart roofing systems, smart plug systems and other innovations.","residences siyabonga mamba, patrick s. pouabe eboule, jan harm c. pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the build environment university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa patrickpe@uj.ac.za, jhcpretoruis@uj.ac.za",
42,Exploring The Causes Of Premature Failures Of Water  Pipeline Systems In South Africa,"water is a vital commodity for human life. to that end, a pipeline is a critical component to transport water from the source to end-users. the pipeline system is a highly complex network in and of itself. as a result, the dependability of such a component is critical in ensuring the stability and security of an uninterrupted water supply. the purpose of this research is to investigate the causes of premature failures in the south african water pipeline system. to accomplish this goal, this study examines the factors causing premature pipeline failures using existing literature and archival data. according to the findings, the major causes of premature water pipeline system damage include both internal and external corrosion, damage by others (vandalism, sabotage, and theft), miscellaneous, operator error, welding, mechanical damage, equipment, joint leaks, over-pressure and pig traps. it is expected that the findings of this study will help various stakeholders save billions of rand that are spent to replace damaged pipelines.","water distribution, pipeline system, 2001","Around the world, it becomes a great worry for water utilities when the water pipeline distribution systems deteriorate and fail before they reach their expected lifespan. As a result of this deterioration process, pipelines eventually fail and therefore cause the system to transport less water than it was designed for. Another worrying factor is that the water distribution system might get contaminated. With limited resources available to water utilities for repairing the pipeline infrastructure, it outlines the importance of assessing the current and future state of the water pipeline systems. To this end, over the last decades, it has been observed that many areas in South Africa are facing a serious water crisis. This water crisis is largely attributed to the existing water pipeline systems, which in most cases are failing before they reach their expected lifespan. To resolve this problem, the South African government is required to allocate additional funding to sustain existing infrastructure. However, with the current economic crisis, the government does not have sufficient financial resources. Therefore, the research objective of this study was to explore the causes of premature failures of the current water pipeline systems. The findings revealed that the major causes damaging the water pipeline system prematurely include both internal and external corrosion, damage by others (vandalism, sabotage and theft), miscellaneous, operator error, weld, mechanical damage, equipment, joint leaks, over-pressure and pig traps. It is, therefore, believed that the outcome of this study would assist decision-makers in the South African water utility to save billions of rand that are often allocated to replace damaged pipelines.","thabo naledi, bheki makhanya, jan harm c. pretorius postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the build environment university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa thabo.naledi@gmail.com; bheki.makhnaya@transnet.net; jhcpretoruis@uj.ac.za",

Second, which strategies can best accelerate the CoJ metropolitan municipality's poor public service delivery? Several contributing factors were identified in the study's literature review. The study used quantitative research methods with the support of the survey research strategy. The study further used a questionnaire with close- ended questions as a data collection tool. The findings revealed that, amongst others, poor public office ethics, lack of adequate resource capacity, lack of strategic awareness by key personnel, lack of staff training & development, undue political interference, lack of digital transformation, the lack of accountability & transparency were the top-ranked contributing factors towards decelerated public service delivery raised within the CoJ. Meaningful stakeholder engagement and public participation, employee skill development, and hiring adequate and qualified candidates were rated as the top strategies that could help to improve service delivery in the CoJ municipality. Depoliticizing and professionalizing local government was ranked last among all strategies. It is expected that this study would contribute to and inspire a constructive argument to debate possible management strategies for the identified problems confronting the local government. Finally, it is further hoped that the findings and recommendations of this study would assist the CoJ metropolitan municipality and offer a paradigm shift in the local government sphere in South Africa as far as accelerated public service delivery is concerned. The study's limitations include the fact that it was only conducted in one local municipality (the CoJ metropolitan municipality) in South Africa. It would be ideal to study and compare results from various municipalities in South Africa and around the world. Some service delivery factors within the CoJ metropolitan municipality are dynamic. As a result, this study was unable to address all of the factors associated with poor service delivery within the municipality. The opinions expressed in the results were limited to the Likert scale items created by the researcher. It would be more beneficial to allow respondents to express their individual perspectives on the subject using their words in future research.","tumelo thabang, bheki makhanya, hannelie nel postgraduate school of engineering management faculty of engineering and the build environment university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa jtthabang@yahoo.co.za, bsm3174@yahoo.com, hannelien@uj.ac.za",

3.3 Application of Common Technologies in the Business 
Figure 5 presents common applications of technologies within SMEs under study. It highlights that the SMEs under 
study are using technology for different purposes, including communication, administrative processes and promoting 
their products online. Majority of the respondents (96%) reported the availability of Internet connection in the premises 
within their organization, and 85% indicated possession of official enterprise website. It was observed that the use of 
official websites to promote the company's products are popular among e-businesses. About 78% of the respondents 
reported to use the Internet to search for potential suppliers, while 77% reported to use the Internet for sharing 
information between the company and the government tax agency and also submitting online tax returns. Majority of 
the respondents also mentioned using technologies for administrative procedures (84%), and communications (e.g., 
email) (81%). The findings highlighted a high usage of basic technologies in SMEs.

47,Sustainable Development Goals As A Guide For Sustainability  Evaluation Of Wind Turbine Decommissioning Scenarios,"a top priority for most countries and major organizations is to focus on actions to align with the 17 sustainable development goals (sdgs) established by the united nations in 2015. today, the installed capacity of wind generation is steadily growing worldwide, while 34,000 wind turbines are 15 years or older. furthermore, the number of decommissioned wind turbines is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. in this context, the evaluation of the waste management processes for wind turbine decommissioning in terms of sustainability is imperative. wind turbine decommissioning options have to comply with sdgs linked to the safe disposal and/or recycling of energy production systems. this study aims to develop an indicator-oriented framework to evaluate the environmental, economic, and social impacts generated by different decommissioning scenarios of a wind turbine system to ensure it complies with these goals. initially, a life cycle assessment (lca) is performed to generate values for indicators that are related to each decommissioning scenario. next, those indicators that are directly related to selected sdgs are identified. the proposed methodology applies data envelopment analysis (dea) to assess the efficiency of alternative wind turbine decommissioning scenarios based on selected criteria. these criteria are directly related to the previously identified indicators satisfying specific sdgs. alternative decommissioning scenarios are benchmarked using different sustainability criteria/indicators as dea inputs/outputs and utilized to determine best practice-based decision-making strategies. the joint application of lca and dea could represent a methodological framework for sustainability assessment and benchmark definition of waste management alternatives.",,,"applying an integrated lca and dea approach stavros gennitsaris m.sc. department of industrial management & technology university of piraeus piraeus, greece sgen@unipi.gr stella sofianopoulou professor department of industrial management & technology university of piraeus piraeus, greece sofianop@unipi.gr","References and DEA-Solver Software, Springer, New York, 1999.

This issue is a little bit sensitive and therefore, this article aims at investigating social justice toward this minority group. Seen from the situation on the field, it appears clearly that the solutions are all non-local based and episodic, as well as an exit politics need to be implemented as suggested by Connell. It is the Suara Kita NGO from Jakarta that have incited Ms. TRS to seek recognition through the Badung and Denpasar Disdukcapil offices. In Singaraja the process went smoothly after Suara Kita got in touch with Mami SC in Singaraja, because Mami SC is a public figure and personally knows the regency head and the head of the Buleleng regency Disdukcapil. The exit politics advocated by Connell was played a major role in Wargas community through Mami SC.

53,"New Normal Life Strategy Through Local Indigenous Penta  Helix Collaboration: Case Study Of  ""Kampung Tangguh","kampung tangguh semeru wani jogo suroboyo is a program initiated by the surabaya city government to combat the covid-19 outbreak. this innovation is a replication of the national kampung tangguh program but was created with the local language of surabaya. this program is an integration of various interrelated programs to combat covid from multiple fields. this article studied using the library research method. as a result, the use of the local dialect succeeded in creating a close bond between the community and the program. this bonding has a significant impact on the effectiveness of this program to deal with the covid-19 outbreak. even though statistically, the number of covid-19 sufferers in surabaya did not decrease directly after the program was launched, this program was able to reduce the negative impacts, especially on the socio-cultural aspects of the community. through collaborative innovation using the local language typical of surabaya, the community becomes more familiar with the function of this program to increase the active participation of all elements of society. in addition, this innovative program with a local language can make other parts of the penta helix collaboration scheme feel like a unified whole in fighting the covid-19 outbreak.",penta helix,"and Recommendation The Kampung Tangguh Semeru Wani Jogo Suroboyo Program is a derivative program of the National Kampung Tangguh program. While the Kampung Tangguh program targets people throughout Indonesia in general, Kampung Tangguh Wani Jogo Suroboyo adopts a psychological approach among Surabaya residents by utilizing local dialect terminology typical of Surabaya. The use of regional dialects is expected to strengthen bonds between communities so that the effectiveness of this program can be more optimal. This collaborative innovation by adopting local dialects has succeeded in controlling the negative impact of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Surabaya. Although numerical data states that Surabaya City had become a black zone, thanks to the collaboration between the community, government, private sector, academia, and the media, the social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can be appropriately controlled. Social relations between citizens, which are predicted to fall apart due to the pandemic, have happened the other way around. Thanks to a shared commitment built with the typical Suroboyo slogan, the community became more concerned about each other. Bonding with fellow citizens of Surabaya has increased public awareness, not only social concern but concern for economic, security, and health aspects, so that it can be concluded that the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic will be more effective using policies that are based on local wisdom. 7.

55,Are Efficiency And Responsiveness Good For Performance?  The Mediating Role Of Competitive Capability,"efficiency and responsiveness are widely identified supply chain strategies and capabilities. in most of the supply chain fit literature, a positive relationship between efficient/responsive strategy and performance has been presumed. however, the question is left unanswered whether these strategies are indeed positively related to performance and, if so, how. the answer is not straightforward, particularly when efficiency, a widely accepted supply chain strategy, is also considered a standard qualifier that may not be an order winner in a competitive marketplace. in this work, we ask whether these strategies are indeed positively related to performance. specifically, we aim to answer the following research question: are efficient and responsive strategies and capabilities effective in achieving performance improvements? specifically, we consider the two dimensions of efficiency and responsiveness as directed by the supply chain strategy and indicated by the operational capability. based on the competence-based theory (cbt) of the firm, we propose a conceptual framework between strategy-driven innovation, competitive capability and performance, and specify the associations in both efficiency and responsiveness dimensions. a large dataset from new zealand (nz) businesses is used to test the relationships, and access to the data is obtained from statistics new zealand. we also examine the mediating role of competitive capability in both to the relationship, and investigate how these associations differ with product characteristics. overall, we find a negative relationship in the efficiency dimension and a positive association in the responsiveness dimension. while the mediation effects are generally supported, the hypothesized moderation effects are partially supported as product type moderates the relationships in a direction opposite from what is suggested in the supply chain fit theory. as such, this work improves our understanding of how strategies in efficiency versus responsiveness can affect firm performance. we make several contributions. first, we contribute to the growing supply chain fit literature, by evaluating the mediating role of operational capabilities in both dimensions and answering whether and how efficient and responsive strategies improve performance. we find that product type moderates the relationships in the opposite direction from what is suggested by the supply chain fit theory. second, we contribute to the supply chain strategy literature and find that efficiency could be negatively associated with performance. third, this work contributes to the current body of knowledge by empirically investigating the impact of efficient and responsive strategies for new zealand exporters. though results derived from single-country data might seem not immediately generalizable, this work provides important insights for businesses in new zealand and other countries facing similar contexts; we hope this could inspire future work extending the study into other contexts.","supply chain fit, efficiency, responsiveness, and is 531",,"quan spring zhou faculty of business and law, university of wollongong, nsw 2522, australia szhou@uow.edu.au tava olsen and timofey shalpegin department of information systems and operations, management, university of auckland, auckland 1010, new zealand t.olsen@auckland.ac.nz, t.shalpegin@auckland.ac.nz",
56,The Influence Of Motivation And Competence On Health  Care Quality And Its Impact On Patient Satisfaction In,"the research objective was to determine and analyze the influence of motivation and competence on health care quality and its impact on patient satisfaction in the general hospital (rsud) majene regency at emergency department. the population in the study consisted of 185 employees with the status of civil servants and emergency inpatient (igd) patients. the sampling technique was carried out through accidental sampling, meaning that it carried out the selection on anyone who happened to be met at that time, so they were directly used as the research sample. data collection techniques are through observation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, while data analysis uses path analysis. the results showed that competence has a significant role in supporting the improvement of service quality. competence is also able to affect patient satisfaction; better competence can keep increased patient satisfaction. apart from competence, the motivation variable is another variable that plays a role in improving service quality and patient satisfaction. the motivation for health workers is shown by power, willingness, forming expertise, responsibility, and goals. the indirect effect is healthcare quality as a variable that can moderate the motivation and competence variables on patient satisfaction. healthcare quality is an intervening variable that maximizes service functions to encourage patient satisfaction in receiving services. the influence of motivation on patient satisfaction through healthcare quality is an indirect effect, with the most negligible impact showing that it can feel patient satisfaction with a better level of service quality. the different thing in this study is the use of motivation and competence variables as independent variables. achieving the level of satisfaction for patients is not always measured by competence alone. but with motivation is a predictor that triggers someone to maximize themselves with their competence to do something better and optimal.","motivation, competence, healthcare quality",,"hospital emergency room (igd) in majene regency tasniah, mattalatta mattalatta and purnomo purnomo sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop makassar, indonesia tasniah@gmail.com, fadelgun@yahoo.co.id, muhammadnatsir@gmail.com feby triadi sekolah tinggi ilmu administrasi puangrimaggalatung, makassar, indonesia feby.triadi@mail.ugm.ac.id andries lionardo university of sriwijaya, palembang, indonesia andrieslionardo@fisip.unsri.ac.id muhamad chairul basrun umanailo universitas iqra buru, indonesia chairulbasrun@gmail.com chairun nasirin college of health sciences (stikes), mataram, indonesia chairun.nasirin@stikes-mataram.ac.id","References

58,User Responses Of Agricultural Product Applications   In The Era Of The Covid-19 Pandemic,"this paper aims to find out the effectiveness, usefulness, and negative responses of customers to the fruit and vegetable shopping applications. the theory used by the researcher is digital society according to immanuel castells. the results showed that from dozens of applications that sell fruit and vegetables, the applications sayur box, happy fresh, tanihub, and brambang were the most widely used. the sayur box and happy fresh applications were downloaded by nearly 1 million subscribers, had 12-20 thousand reviews and investors from home and abroad. the positive and negative responses conveyed by customers in using the application are related to the ease of using the application, affordable fruit and vegetable prices (not much different from prices in supermarkets and markets), maintained product quality, speed of service, also friendly and quick response. the behavior of application users who feel the ease and speed of service cannot be separated from the characteristics of a digital society that prioritizes practicality and convenience with the presence of information technology. this includes expressing opinions that tend to be firm, straightforward, and impolite to become an inherent part of digital society.","digitalization, agriculture, through middlemen, traders","The flow of digitalization cannot be dammed, affecting people's lives, including meeting the daily needs of fruits and vegetables. The behavior of buying fruit and vegetables has changed, from traditional markets or supermarkets to online shopping trends, this happens considering the ease and benefits of applying them coupled with the pandemic situation that restricts movement outside the home. These factors cause fruit and vegetable shopping applications to grow and are widely downloaded by the digital community. In this study, it can be found that the use of fruit and vegetable shopping applications increases every year because of its convenience, speed, and quality which are not much different from the quality of goods from supermarkets and traditional markets. Judging from the application used, the more complet and easy to use, of course, the more people will use the application, this cannot be separated from the capital that funds it. The thing that needs to be educated and becomes a general trend of using language in social media is that the delivery of messages is more polite. The results of this study are very descriptive and only map the basic conditions of a digital society that uses fruit and vegetable shopping applications. This research needs to be followed up more deeply with consumers by contacting them for data clarification and further to farmers, whether they receive benefits from the presence of this application that facilitates the marketing of agricultural products.","as part of a digital community in indonesia muryanti sociology study program, faculty of social sciences and humanities, state islamic university sunan kalijaga, yogyakarta, indonesia muryanti@uin-suka.ac.id",

63,Galvalume Concrete Composite Panel Puzzel With Iron  Reinforcement,,,"The results of the concrete panel test show the results of 7.000 kg/cm2, 8.000 kg/cm2 and 7.800 kg/cm2. Based on these results, it shows that composite concrete panels can be used as part of simple building structures. In addition, the sand test obtained results for sand humidity of 0.77%, sand absorption in water of 17.9%, the volume weight of sand without a joist was 1.56 gr/cm3, with a vibration of 1.76 gr/cm3, with a vibration of 1.71 gr /cm3, cleanliness of sand against mud 2.6%. Coarse aggregate test results found that the humidity of crushed stone was 0.01%, the absorption of crushed stone to water was 2.6%, the volume weight of crushed stone without being jostled was 1.49 gr/cm3, with joist gr/cm3, the cleanliness of crushed stone against silt 0.2%, crushed stone specific gravity 2.22%. The sand used is from the sand of Lumajang City which is adjacent to Mount Semeru The recommendation that can be given is that when implementing concrete puzzles in the field, skilled workers are needed and understand the world of construction techniques so that basic training needs to be held first in making galvalum composite panel concrete. Galvalume composite concrete panels are a relatively recent innovation, so the precision and design of the panels is not yet precise/accurate. The use of galvalum as a filler in the manufacture of composite concrete panels needs to be proven through a long time test to determine weather resistance and so on. 610",,"References

65,Carbon Footprint Reduction During The Wire Drawing  Process At An Electrical Cable Manufacturing Company,"this study proposes improvements in one of the processes of the operational flow of an electric cable manufacturing company with the objective of reducing the environmental impact of its emissions. the improvement focuses on the copper annealing sub-process, in relation to the wire drawing operation. under an experimental design, a diagnosis was made of the 2.5 mm diameter wire production process. it was found that it generated unnecessary waste of electrical energy in the annealing stage. with the help of a group of experts, the carbon footprint indicator was also calculated. the solution implemented consisted of the partial elimination of the primary drawing annealing operation and recurring adjustments for the efficient operation of the rest of the process. the benefit of the proposal, validated through laboratory tests, was calculated at usd 2.81 per year for each dollar invested. the results show that the wires only changed in their mechanical properties, having mainly an elongation of 35%-36% for the soft wire and 2% for the hard wire. however, the change in these mechanical properties does not chemically affect the quality of the final product thanks to the adjustments made, reducing the carbon footprint by 1444,186 tco2 per year. this proposal could be replicated in similar companies in the metallurgical sector.","carbon footprint, wire drawing, annealing","The implementation of the improvement proposal achieved the main objective of the research by reducing electricity consumption related to the company's carbon footprint during the annealing process. Furthermore, by applying industrial engineering tools in the implementation design, an economic saving was achieved, which was measured through the cost-benefit indicator, obtaining 2.81 USD, supporting the feasibility and being attractive for professionals and/or researchers who wish to replicate or improve the developed proposal. 634","luis manzanedo facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú lrmanz1999@gmail.com mechelle prado facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima lima, perú mechelleprado.11@gmail.com marcos fernando ruiz-ruiz associate professor universidad de lima lima, perú mruiz@ulima.edu.pe","References

66,Determinant Factors For The Restaurant Sector Since The  Covid-19 Pandemic: The Peruvian Case,"the situation of the restaurants sector in peru, since the covid-19 pandemic, has varied in comparison to the rise that was expected in the sector before the sanitary crisis. due to the massive contagions and the uncontrollable nature of the disease, government regulations were implemented, and the process of adjusting to the protocols for serving the public took time, affecting the progress of businesses in this area. this study focuses on this problem with the objective of identifying the most determining factors to promote the development and growth of the restaurant sector, in a stage that some call the new normality. to this end, a compilation of documents related to the subject was carried out and two rounds of open interviews were conducted with the participation of seven experts on the subject. thereafter, the factors were identified and ranked according to their level of mobility and dependence in a matrix of impacts with the help of micmac software (matrix of cross impacts multiplication applied to a classification). the findings of the study show that the most influential factors of the system are compliance with the required protocols, reinforcement of the delivery service and training in hygiene and disinfection. these results serve as a basis for planning possible scenarios aimed at the future development of the sector, as well as local strategies that can be transferred to other contexts in the region.","restaurant sector, covid-19, delphi","Different factors affecting the restaurant sector in Peru as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. After analysis, the results show that factors 3, 4 and 6 (compliance with required protocols, reinforcement of delivery service and training in hygiene and disinfection) are the most representative of the conflict area (upper right quadrant). This makes them the most important factors for the restaurant sector in the sanitary situation and should be considered by the managers of these businesses in order to act on them strategically. To a lesser extent, factors 5, 10, 11 (innovation in the face of the pandemic, financial concerns and increased customer confidence), also located in the conflict area, should be recognized by the sector for their evolution. Therefore, with a high number of factors in the conflict area, more than 50% of the total number of factors, which generate a high degree of mobility and dependence, it follows that the map of influences and dependencies presents an unstable system. In this scenario, any decision on one of the factors has repercussions on all the others and turns back on itself. Therefore, the main factors that influence the improvement of the operations of several restaurants in pandemic are identified, as well as the less influential factors for the recovery of these businesses. Finally, the identification of factors aims at establishing elements of judgment for a strategic planning of future scenarios, leading to an eventual prospective analysis oriented to the development of the restaurant sector in the studied context, which can be transferred to other scenarios in the region.","diego rafael limaymanta-rojas, carlos antonio olguín-rodríguez, alberto flores-perez and marcos fernando ruiz-ruiz faculty of engineering and architecture, university of lima, lima, perú 20142915@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20171090@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, alflores@ulima.edu.pe, mruiz@ulima.edu.pe",
67,Adaptation Of Muhammadiyah Members  To The Religious Tradition Of Nahdlatul Ulama Gorontalo,"the purpose of this study is to discuss the forms, the factors and the implications of adaptation of muhammadiyah members to the religious tradition of nahdlatul ulama. robert k. merton's theory was used to see the adaptation process which has been carried out by muhammadiyah members in gorontalo. the study applied a phenomenological qualitative approach. in the process of collecting data, the study used observation and interview techniques. the data analysis classified the data including primary and secondary data. the results showed that the adaptation of muhammadiyah members was in the form of implementing the religious tradition of nahdlatul ulama. they were: mongaruwa (spirit prayer), molibungo (female circumcision), and be'ati (oath of allegiance). the factors that caused the adaptation of muhammadiyah members were the process of collaboration, and continuously mutual openness with nahdlatul ulama members in the community. in addition, the implications of the adaptation: first, there was a harmonious social life among muslims. lastly, muhammadiyah members were not rigid in the midst of the religious traditions of the nahdlatul ulama members and the local traditions of gorontalo.","adaptation, nahdlatul ulama","Muhammadiyah members still exist carrying Islamic modernism and puritanism, even though they are in the midst of traditional society. Their (da'wah) religious proselytizing strategy is to implement social adaptation in the midst of the Nahdlatul Ulama Muslim community. The goal is to survive and be accepted in developing a progressive Islamic mission. The form of adaptation that they do is carrying out the religious traditions of Nahdlatul Ulama such as tahlilan, yasinan, maulidan, and other traditions. This factor is influenced by community members who are open to each other, including Muhammadiyah members, so as to create a free, open and fluid atmosphere. Geographical proximity makes the two organizations open to each other. Because Gorontaloness are in urban areas, especially in rural areas, they will be judged to deviate from customs; if they close themselves off from other people. The other factor in the form of collaboration among the Gorontalo Muslims community, especially those with Muhammadiyah and Nahdlatul Ulama backgrounds, always occurs, both at the elite level in the organizational structure and in the midst of ordinary people. Meanwhile, the implication of the adaptation of Muhammadiyah members is to create a harmonious and humanistic atmosphere in socio-religious life. 7. Acknowledgments The researcher would like to thank the administrators and members of Muhammadiyah who have shared the information. It was about their attitudes in the midst of the religious tradition of Nahdlatul Ulama. He is also extremely grateful to Prof. Irwan Abdullah through the IA Schoolar Foundation who has guided him in writing this article.

71,Cross-Sector Coordination Of Village Community Social  Institutions And Agricultural Intensification,"in rural studies, the themes of rural community social institutions, agricultural intensification, and food self- sufficiency are interesting studies. coordination of village community social institutions is still weak. the agricultural intensification system is still experiencing problems. food independence is still vulnerable. the purpose of this study is to analyze the coordination of village community social institutions, and the intensification of agriculture to support food self-sufficiency. the study from the perspective of rural sociology was carried out in 4 villages, namely plawangan, kertawinangun, soge, and ilir, indramayu regency, in 2021. the four villages are downstream areas with semi-technical, rain-fed, and irrigated downstream areas. this research method is qualitative. collecting data through field observations, documents, interviews, and focus group discussions. data analysis by triangulation. the results showed that the coordination of village community social institutions was able to control irrigation water to farmers' fields, with a shifting system. crop failure (puso) due to flooding or lack of irrigation water can be overcome. agricultural intensification can work, and can increase crop productivity by around 6 to 7 tons of grain per ha per growing season. agricultural intensification is able to support food self-sufficiency for the region concerned.","rainfed, shifting, puso","Based on the results of the discussion, it can be concluded as follows; Cross-sectoral coordination between village community social institutions, which is carried out synergistically involving village institutions, sub-district agencies, agricultural agencies, irrigation agencies, and security agencies can guard the entry of irrigation water into farmers' fields, with a rotating system. Cross-sectoral coordination between village community social institutions is able to strengthen the role of village community social institutions. Cross-sectoral coordination between local government and village community social institutions is able to overcome puso risk. Cross-sectoral coordination between the local government and the social institutions of the village community is the supporting capacity for carrying out agricultural intensification. The cause of crop failure (puso) is due to lack of irrigation water supply or due to flooding caused by high rainfall. The problems of flooding and drought can be overcome, through cross-sectoral coordination between the local government and the social institutions of the village community. The rotational irrigation system, which usually occurs during the gadu (sadon) season, is able to reduce conflicts over irrigation water struggles between farming communities; Agricultural intensification is able to increase crop productivity by around 6-7 tons of unhulled rice per hectare per growing season. Intensification of lowland rice farming can continue by implementing the Sapta 704","to support food independence sudirah sociology lecturer, fhisip, universitas terbuka, tangerang selatan, indonesia sudi@ecampus.ut.ac.id","References

72,Compromise: Social Interactions Of Political Elites Build  Voter Networks,"this paper aims to find a positive form of practice that the political elite practices at the time of the election. the process of social interaction that shapes individual behavior in politics is also a means of political elites supporting interests. the study tries to find a form of political strategy that political elites can use to create an agreement. the relationship between the public as voters and the political elite certainly gave rise to many models of social exchange. to minimize the bad image of politics, the author seeks to explain the positive procession of social interactions born from both sides. the method used by the author with a qualitative approach was sourced from secondary data in the form of books and journals. this paper reveals that positive values can be formed in a political contest. the interaction of political elites gives birth to relationships and social networks that can be used as a tool of support. the behavior of the political elite closely related to negative imagery indicates stigmatization carried out by the lay community. in the end, the author found a storyline related to the compromises made by the political elite, namely as a means of mitigating conflict, the process of interaction that gave birth to the agreement, alternative politics to the strengthening of networks for the politics of sustainability. furthermore, compromise can be seen as behavior that is beneficial to the public interest and politics can be interpreted as a form of the common good.","political elite, compromise, social interaction, voters","The social interaction of political elites to build voter networks raises an understanding of positive strategies that can be used in the social exchange process in political contestation. One of these efforts is to use compromise as an exchange strategy. Compromise is a virtue for lobbying and negotiations carried out by the political elite. This action is supported by the communication skills of the political elite to find an analysis of the form of the vision and mission they will make. A good compromise and in accordance with the needs of the community as voters, in fact, can have an impact on the acquisition of significant votes. This behavior is a form of contesting elite long-term political intelligence. As a means of reducing conflicts of interest, compromise is the middle way to formulate a collective agreement. The actions of the political elite who prioritize positive communication through compromise also create political trust by the public as voters. Trust built on the basis of social exchange does not always correspond to nominal value. The behavior of the political elite maximizes the needs of the community to replace financial capital. Compromise merely reduces the pragmatic political attitudes and incapacity of the political elite. Therefore, compromise can be categorized as an attempt by the political elite to establish personal closeness both during the election process and until the elite will take office. Because what must be done by political elites when they have power must continue to build their voter network so that the election process does not require expensive political costs and negative actions that can damage democracy.","mahatva yoga adi pradana student, sociology doctoral program, university of brawijaya, malang city, indonesia mahatva.pradana@student.ub.ac.id muhammad lukman hakim head of sociology doctoral program, university of brawijaya, malang city, indonesia em.lukman79@ub.ac.id",

There are disturbances that come from outside (external), such as government development policies and pandemic disasters. However, there are also those that come from within, namely internal conflicts in accessing livelihood sources from oil palm smallholder cooperatives that cause social inequality. From these various disturbances, the Mapur indigenous community in Air Abik was able to anticipate by carrying out a cultural identity negotiation strategy to maintain life and social integration. The negotiation of cultural identity is implemented through the adaptation of PT Timah Tbk's interests related to CSR funds and the interests of the local government related to vaccination on the one hand, and on the other hand the interest to develop Mapur culture through gebong memrong as a historical and cultural tourism destination as well as the preservation of traditional medicine to prevent pandemics.

76,Intersectionality Regulations For Handling Crisis Of Women  Trafficking During The Pandemic,"human trafficking that occurs in vulnerable groups such as women is a crime that violates human rights. until now, the practice of buying and selling human beings, especially women, continues to multiply, especially in the pattern of victim screening. the reality is that the covid-19 pandemic has not reduced the number of cases of trafficking in women who have socially experienced various inequalities and particular vulnerabilities due to their marginal social position, thus making them entangled in indications of trafficking in women that dominate and pose a significant threat. the study of intersectionality is considered capable of seeing the different situations faced by women and marginalized groups. it becomes a meeting point study on gender issues, especially during the current pandemic, which shows the increasing cases of trafficking in women. and the purpose of this research is to explain the form of handling the crisis of trafficking in women with intersectionality law regulations. this study uses a qualitative method by collecting data on intersectionality law regulations through report documents, literature, news, and journalism related to the research. data analysis used the nvivo12 plus qualitative data processing application with crosstab query tools analysis and cluster analysis group. furthermore, the study results show that intersectionality legal regulations refer to gender equality. however, these regulations are still ineffective and still discriminate against women or are less gender-sensitive to suppress the spread of cases of trafficking in women. the vulnerable sector is shown in the sex trade, worrying, especially during the current pandemic. based on the study results, it is concluded that there is a need for new legal regulations regarding intersectionality that provide legal construction as a basis for women in fighting against unfair hegemony and guaranteed in various legal instruments, both international and national law.","crisis, intersectionality, pandemic, regulations","The crime of trafficking in women is a problem that has long been a major international problem and continues to this day. Criminal behavior is also triggered by various indicators where the vulnerable sectors that trigger and become motivators of crime are at the economic, social, and cultural levels, where the targets of trafficking in women are mostly traded as sex workers and unskilled workers. In addition, at this time, the need for social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic is also a factor in increasing unemployment due to layoffs, which is a problem for increasing crime because victims of layoffs are unable to meet their daily needs. This research also overall shows that in eradicating trafficking in women, the government must increase efforts and cooperation with related parties dealing with child trafficking such as Komnas HAM, police, courts, etc. law so that every regulation in the country does not conflict and the public understand the importance of legal certainty when faced with serious problems directly. From this research, it is also hoped that the obstacles and shortcomings in the handling of trafficking in women and children can be addressed with new legal regulations that bind firmly and clearly for the safety of the community.

88,Difable Women: Marginalized Identities  Varinia Pura Damaiyanti,"women in their gender identity is second sex, which is the second sex which means occupying the subordinate position of the first sex (male) as the dominant position. this is inseparable from the patriarchal culture that places the position of women below men, as well as women have limited roles, especially in public spaces. it cannot be denied until now the domestic sphere is still considered as a responsibility of women. what about women with disabilities or people with disabilities? disabled groups are a minority group that has been neglected for their rights. they are a minor, marginalized group, whose disability identity often stigmatizes helplessness and incompetence. women with disabilities, of course, have problems that can be said to be more complex than 'normal' women in general. not only confined to patriarchal culture, the negative stigma labeled becomes increasingly severe for women with disabilities. this study was about women with disabilities who experience stigma, not only stigma against women, but stigma against difable women. their identity as women with disabilities is an experience that represents the marginalization of this minority group. the subjects of this study were women with disabilities who were both married and unmarried. the results showed that the stigma labeled on women with disabilities seemed to be an identity attached to them. it is then even believed by them themselves. nevertheless, there is a subjective awareness in these disabled women to then try to get out of the negative stigma, but the support that is expected to come from people with disabilities. their surroundings are less felt. the research method used is a qualitative research method with a symbolic interaction perspective. the theories used are george h. mead's theory of symbolic interaction and the theory of stigma and identity of erving goffman.","women, difabled, stigma, identity","People with disabilities are part of society and they are a minority group in terms of numbers and subordinated in terms of position. They are seen as anomalies, outside of normalcy, this causes them to be positioned unfavorably, they are viewed as poor and marginalized. This is in contrast to the growing stigma in society that disability is a disgrace, an evil, one that should be avoided that gives rise to compassion and supposition of incompetence. The stigma about disability causes society to also view people with disabilities as weak, helpless, unable to do anything, have no job, no hope, as people who should be pitied, as people who are 'lacking',incomplete, and not perfect creatures. The negative stigma is so attached to people with disabilities, sometimes even forcing people with disabilities to 'become' as perceived by society. That is, if people with disabilities are considered weak, then the community (audience) expects people with disabilities to behave or look weak, because that is how they are constructed. This is what Goffman calls virtual social identity,which is the demand about how an actor(with a disability) is required to behave or display his identity. While in the self-disabled themselves, there is a desire to show what he is actually able to do, contrary to what society considers their abilities. What people with disabilities are actually able to do is what Goffman calls the real social identity in the whole self as part of the way they construct their identity. Disabled women are becoming increasingly subordinated, traditional and patriarchal views on women demand that women meet the criteria of 'perfect' women in society, but when women are disabled, the position of subordination turns into highly-subordination. Disabled women are increasingly being compressed, not only by society, even from their own families, and also from another ‘normal’ women.","department of sociology, faculty of social and politics lambung mangkurat university, indonesia varinia.damaiyanti@ulm.ac.id",
89,The Power Relation Of Rural Governments In Developing  Indonesian “Unicorn Village”: Study Case In Sleman And,"the political reformation in indonesia has become an important mainstay of rural developments. through the rural act, indonesia's central government considers developing a village-based economy by disbursing village funds alongside by establishment of a village-owned public agency (badan umum milik desa). that idealism yet leaves much noteworthy criticism as exemplified by the existence of backward villages, impoverishments, and the demise of village-owned public agency issues that remain neglected. to the exception, both sambirejo village in sleman and kutuh village in badung have shown a contrast presage to which considered as an impotent village. those villages categorize as unicorn villages with an income of over idr one billion per year. as researchers, we decide to choose the previously-mentioned villages as a subject of our research in the field of political pillar studies. applying qualitative research methods, we analyze political pillars through the theory of power (relational power) which incorporates governance actor market actors. by this article, we persist to explicate how actors and its relational power influence the rural development process by using the highest region's own source revenue (pendapatan asli daerah or pades). thereafter we try to identify the best practices of rural development innovations. to sum up, the success factor of rural developments is the results of villages’ governance intersectionality with various sectors and stakeholders, through the dint of rural tourism developments.","unicorn villages, governance actors, power relation, local government","The tourism sector is growing and developing well in both study locations. The growth and development of this sector is supported by the work of governance actors with unique dynamics in each village. Each research location, both in Sambirejo Village and Kutuh Village, has a different socio-cultural background. Sambirejo, which is located in the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY), owns the land owned by Sultan Hamengkubohuno. While in Kutuh Village, which is in Bali Province, there are two leaderships in one village, namely the leadership of the Traditional Village and the leadership of the Service Village. The socio-cultural context that characterizes each location becomes the color in the context of their government and policy making. Governance actors in the two study villages played a role in village development, thus contributing to the high income of the village. However, the dominant role appears to be in the hands of each village government, namely the village government in Sambirejo and the customary village government in Kutuh. The majority of community and private involvement did not come from their own initiatives but came from village government initiatives in each location. Especially the relationship between the village government and the community looks asymmetrical, with the dominance of the Village Government which relies on the leadership quality of the village government. However, even though they are asymmetrical, this condition has succeeded in bringing both villages into the unicorn category. In Sambirejo Village - especially at the Tebing Breksi tourist location - the institutionalization of tourist villages is manifested in BUMDes formed by the village government, Pokdarwis formed by the district government, Village Economic Center which was inaugurated by the central government and Lowok Ijo which is a local community group. In Kutuh Village, the institutionalization of tourism villages is manifested through BUMDA and BUMDes where both are the result of the intertwining of the authorities of the actors in the duality of leadership led by the Traditional Village Head and Perbekel (Head of Village Service). Apart from the village government, development in the two villages cannot be separated from the role of supra- village governments such as district/city governments, provincial governments and the central government. This study found that the provincial government had a greater contribution than the district government in the two villages. This can be seen from the policy and infrastructure support by the DIY Provincial Government for Sambirejo Village, as well as capital loan support through the LPD by the Bali Provincial Government for Kutuh Village. Meanwhile, the role of the district government in both locations does not appear significant. However, although the role of each actor is not the same in supporting the realization of a tourist village, the relations and roles between the governance actors are always dynamic. In terms of development success, the focus of development in the tourism sector has not only succeeded in showing output but also succeeded in showing positive development outcomes. One of these outcomes are shown through their ability to empower the residents' economy, not only internally from their respective villages but also residents from other villages. However, this development outcome certainly needs to be investigated more deeply considering that first, the rural communities in both locations are agricultural communities with a subsistence 875","badung ali maksum, juwita hayyuning prastiwi and wida ayu puspitosari brawijaya university, malang, indonesia alimaksum@ub.ac.id, juwita_hayyu@ub.ac.id, widapuspitosari@ub.ac.id","References

90,Political Alms: Patronage Practices In The 2019 Legislative  Election In South Sumatra,"patronage has become more massive since the change in the electoral system to open proportionality. this article discusses variations in the practice of political patronage incumbents and new legislative candidates for the 2019 general election from the perspective of political sociology. data was collected by using candidate shadowing techniques, interviews with legislative candidates, success teams and voters. primary-secondary data were analyzed and then interpreted qualitatively in depth. the results of the study indicate a tendency to shift from active legislative candidates to voters through brokers or successful teams. giving to voters is interpreted as a political charity, goods are positioned as symbols of attention and service as a bonus. contribution of research in the context of patronage variations and the concept of political alms, active voters. in addition, the strategy of sharing votes in one family, if receiving money from several candidates. the factor of the amount of money, proximity to the candidate becomes the basis of choice. so that the practice of patronage does not guarantee the electability of candidates. political patronage has broad implications, apart from damaging the image of democracy, it also fosters the practice of money politics and corruption.","patronage, candidates, giving","Based on the above discussion, it can be concluded that the massive political patronage practice is considered a habit of politicians and the public, whether it is the provision of money, goods (basic food), services and services, both incumbent and new candidates, all of them practice patronage, except for one candidate only with goods. Meanwhile, service patronage and business opportunities are limited to incumbent candidates, because they already have political capital, particularly bargaining power with the executive. The incumbent also has power, so it is easy to recruit other people to work with him. However, the incumbent candidates who have contributed, if they do not give money, will not be elected by the citizens. Giving money creates opportunities, and the money seems to have just become a ticket, like the dowry of a candidate in the post-conflict local election. There are concerns from the legislative candidates that if they do not conduct patronage, there will be no chance of being elected as a member of the council. Giving is not necessarily chosen, especially if you don't give at all. Voters almost all received money, apart from goods that were later called ""political alms (sedekah politik)"". Apart from the concept of political almsgiving as an invention, the amount of funds for candidates per electoral and per voter issued by candidates and how the process reaches the voters is also a finding and novelty. Likewise, the strategy of voters in one family to divide votes based on the amount of money received by candidates or timses is also a novelty of this research. There is a tendency for voters to receive multiple gifts, in addition to receiving double alms, money politics, also receiving goods, while hoping to get a job or service. Even those who think that money is a ""proposal"", while the Early payment • Money Proof of buying • Goods Bonus • Work- service 887","ridhah taqwa and zulfikri suleman university of sriwijaya, palembang indonesia ridhotaqwa@fisip.unsri.ac.id, zuleman2003@yahoo.com","References

91,"The Challenges, Opportunities, And Strategies To Strengthen  The Social Enterprise Resilience During Covid-19 Pandemic","social enterprise towards community empowerment are commonly developed as poverty alleviation strategies by combining community, corporates, and government strengths and initiatives. the development of social enterprise in indonesia has rapidly grown over recent years. in the middle of covid-19 pandemic influences the uncertainty condition to keep the business able to survive. in this disadvantaged situation, many social enterprise organizations face vulnerability situations regarding problems and challenges that occurred. however, some social enterprises can survive by facing the challenges into opportunities. thus, developing some strategies becomes the best choice for resilience. the study conducts a qualitative method by focusing on in-depth interviews by using interviews, literature studies, and social media documentation. this study aims to describe the challenges, opportunities, and strategies of the best practices from three social enterprise organizations in indonesia. the finding reveals that multi-stakeholders including government, higher education institutions, media, other companies, and local communities finally able to encourage the social enterprise organizations in formulating and implementing the strategies to strengthen their resilience during the pandemic.","covid-19 pandemic, organization, social enterprise","This study showed challenges that emerged during the covid-19 pandemic. However, these situations were responded as the opportunities to strengthen the resiliency through formulating some strategies. Based on the best practice we learned through these three social enterprise organizations towards community empowerment, their resilience resources include the community-market sustainability, digital technology adaptation, and multi-stakeholders’ collaboration involving the local community, government, media, higher education, and partnerships with the other companies. Furthermore, the strategies are modified towards all sectors to create adaptation and innovation in response to the challenges and opportunities during the unpredictable situations or crises. Also, based on the findings and discussions, it is essential for social enterprise organizations to put in concerns on the resources availability for developing the networks. This paper contributes to the idea that local community becomes the essential source for maintaining the social enterprise organization social benefit during the crises. However, the other significances are related to initiating the adaptive strategies rather than waiting for the assistances or help from other sources. This action would be the best choice to develop the organization resilience in economic and social uncertainty. Also, social enterprise organizations may develop their role for bridging the collaboration between the stakeholders to deliver the wider social benefit for the community. However, a limitation of this study was only based on a small sample of recruited participants from the best practice social enterprise organizations making this research finding difficult to generalize. Therefore, there is necessary to study larger samples recruited as the representative population. Another limitation of this study was only captured in the limited period during covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, to capture the nature of social resilience of the organizations, longitudinal studies are expected to provide deeper and more valuable insights.","(a case study of three social enterprise organizations towards community empowerment in indonesia) getar hati department of social welfare, ewha womans university, 03760 seoul, south korea getarhati@ewhain.net ratih indraswari department of international relations, parahyangan catholic university, bandung, indonesia ratih.indraswari@unpar.ac.id",

93,Revisiting Indonesian Youth Nationalism In The Indonesiamalaysia Borderland,"young people are the next generation of the nation. the future of the nation's life is in the hands of the younger generation. therefore, the spirit of nationalism is very important for the younger generation, especially young people in border areas. this study aims to review the nationalism of young people in the indonesia-malaysia border area. this study uses a mixed-method research method, combining quantitative and qualitative research methods. the quantitative descriptive in this study is a description of the variables of national, socio-economic, and political insight. the national insight variable consists of various indicators, namely bhinneka tunggal ika, the proclamation of independence, the indonesian president, the meaning of the red and white flag, the youth oath, religion in indonesia, the basis of the state, and pancasila. the socio-economic variables consist of several indicators, namely daily needs, food commodities, currency, social welfare, infrastructure, education, health, religious freedom, tolerance, nationality, and language. the political variables consist of various indicators, namely corruption, race, religion, ethnicity, terrorism, narcotics, militarism, smuggling, and regional leaders. while on the qualitative aspect, this research reflects the nationalism of young people in the border area of sebatik island, both from the reflection of national, socio- economic, and political insights.","border communities, sebatik island","The conclusion in this study is that the Indonesian identity of young people in Sebatik Indonesia has been reduced. Nationalism is only limited to ceremonies, not yet rooted in their souls. Many of them chose to become Malaysian citizens. Factors causing the reduced sense of youth nationalism at the border are for example socio-economic conditions, such ad the occurrence of economic inequality and other factors. This study also concludes that youth nationalism at the border has 2 types of identity, namely identity change and identity split. This social reflection reviewing the nationalism of young people in the Sebatik border area is the trigger for further studies related to nationalism at the border. This study contributes to both theory and practice. Theoretically, this research contributes to the field of study of youth nationalism at the border.

94,The Role Of Religious Leaders In Hiv/Aids Prevention And  Management: Study In Malang City,"research on the role of religious leaders in hiv / aids prevention and control has not been widely carried out in indonesia. this study aims to map the role of religious leaders in the prevention and control of hiv / aids in malang as the city with the second highest number of hiv / aids sufferers in east java. this study showed that religious leaders have not had any concrete efforts to prevent and control hiv / aids among their followers nor having deep knowledge about hiv/aids itself. however, these religious leaders always remind their followers to stay away from free sex (adultery) in order to avoid sin and ugliness in the world, which can actually be used as part of efforts to prevent the spread of hiv / aids in society. through spirituality cultivation, religious leaders can function as the first bastion in preventing hiv / aids. religion can also be used as a means of overcoming the stigma experienced by plwha through teaching people to return to religious teachings (repent). unfortunately, this effort was not seen by the government or related parties so that these religious leaders were not directly involved in hiv / aids prevention and control in malang city even though they were willing to be involved by the government to do so.","role, religious leader","The leaders of five religions in Malang City have the same opinion regarding the causes of HIV / AIDS, where the five of them associate HIV / AIDS with free sex behavior which is considered deviant and sinful behavior by all religions, although there are many factors of HIV / AIDS transmission. These religious leaders then provide guidance to their followers through sermons or lectures or recitation so that their followers stay away from free sex. This effort can indirectly become an effort to prevent HIV / AIDS transmission based on spiritual or spiritual strengthening carried out by religious leaders. Unfortunately, the lack of knowledge about the spread of HIV / AIDS, which is caused by the lack of involvement of religious leaders and religious organizations in the prevention and control of HIV / AIDS by the government and the absence of reports on PLHIV among their respective religious communities has led to religious leaders and religious organizations in Malang City has not made HIV / AIDS a priority problem that needs to be resolved. In fact, religious leaders can become strategic actors in HIV / AIDS prevention precisely through their teachings to stay away from free sex and to fully accept the repentance of people who violate the teachings of God's religion, this can be a way to reduce the stigma of PLWHA in society.","titi fitrianita and ucca arawindha universitas brawijaya, malang, indonesia fitrianita.titi@ub.ac.id, uccaarawindha@ub.ac.id",

This is due to differences in the assessment elements in each pillar of the measuring tools. However, the three measuring tools show that the company is at the same maturity level: mature (Expert) in implementing Industry 4.0. By comparing the level of readiness of the same company with different measuring tools, the advantages of each measuring tool used by the company in developing its business can be seen. At the same time, the shortcomings of the measuring tools used today can be complemented by other measuring tools Acknowledgments This research was funded by The Directorate of Research, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, through the RTA Program with Grant Number 5722/UN.1/P/III/Dit-Lit/PT.01.05/2022.","siti afiani musyarofah industrial engineering program department of mechanical and industrial engineering universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta 55281, indonesia agency for industrial standardization and services policy ministry of industry jakarta, indonesia siti.afiani.m@mail.ugm.ac.id alva edy tontowi, nur aini masruroh and budhi sholeh wibowo industrial engineering program department of mechanical and industrial engineering universitas gadjah mada yogyakarta 55281, indonesia alvaedytontowi@ugm.ac.id, aini@ugm.ac.id, budhi.sholehwibowo@ugm.ac.id",
97,The Impact Of Total Productive Maintenance On  Performance In The South African Food Manufacturing,"consumer demands and global competition continuously increase, compelling south african food manufacturers to constantly improve resource efficiency and quality. total productive maintenance (tpm) is a program aimed at equipment effectiveness. while tpm can improve maintenance aspects of equipment, food manufacturers are also mandated to implement a total quality management system (tqm), often requiring the same resources and skill set as tpm. this paper aimed to investigate the impact of tpm on the organizational performance of a food manufacturing company while identifying tqm synergies and common barriers to success. the researchers aimed to work towards a practical model for successful tpm implementation for companies facing similar challenges. a large multi-national company was used as the population and 12 of its factories were used as a sample. the 12 factories represented a diverse yet representative mix of food-producing plants. quantitative data collection and analysis were used to understand the impact of tpm and its core construct, i.e., overall equipment effectiveness (oee), on performance. subsequently, a qualitative case study analysis was done to deliver an understanding beyond the data, identifying barriers to success and opportunities. the results indicated that tpm implementation in a food manufacturing environment does not necessarily lead to an increase in oee. there is insufficient evidence to suggest that oee can be used as a predictor of performance in productivity.",,,"industry jacques weideman, andre vermeulen and jan harm c. pretorius postgraduate school engineering management faculty of engineering and built the environment university of johannesburg, po box 524, auckland park 2006, south africa avermeulen@uj.ac.za, jhcpretorius@uj.ac.za, jacquesweidemann90@gmail.com","References

98,The Effect Of Village Fund Allocation And Village Funds On  Increasing The Welfare Of Village Communities Through,"the expected objective of this research is to determine and analyze the effect of village fund allocation and village fund allocation on improving the welfare of rural communities through performance management in the jeneponto regency. this research was conducted in 11 villages in 11 districts in jeneponto regency and lasted for approximately 2 (two) months from january to february 2021. the population in this study were the existing village apparatus and village consultative body (bpd). in 11 villages in 11 sub-districts in jeneponto regency, as many as 258 people. the sampling technique used simple random sampling, and the final sample included was 165 people. data collection techniques through observation, interviews, questionnaires, and documentation, while data analysis using path analysis. the results showed that the allocation of village funds, village funds, and performance management encouraged increased community welfare as indicated by the rise in village community income, improved health, availability of savings, adequate conditions and facilities, and ease of service. village fund allocation is realized through the development of village communities individually, meaning that there is empowerment, creating peace, serving village communities, encouraging self-reliance, and increasing village income. this is different from village funds intended to promote the village economy and make the community the subject of development. on the indirect effect, performance management is an intervening variable that can moderate both the independent and dependent variables. the difference in this study is the use of the variable allocation of village funds and village funds separately, proving that the budget allocation for the two sources of funds can have different implications in promoting welfare.",village funds,"Based on the research results, it can be concluded that a location of Village Fund, Village Fund, and Performance Management can encourage the improvement of community welfare. It is indicated by increasing the income of the village community, improving health, savings, adequate circumstances, and facilities, as well as ease of service. The allocation of village funds is realized through the development of individual village communities, meaning creating empowerment programs, creating peace, village community services, encouraging self-help, and increasing village income.

109,Transnationalism Of Sebatik Island Malaysia-Indonesia:   A Regional Economic Integration Perspective,"transnationalism refers to the spread of economic, political, and cultural processes beyond national borders. sebatik island is unique because the northern region of the island is owned by malaysia and the southern region belongs to indonesia. no fence or wall was built to separate the two communities, and there is an informal cross border movement between malaysia and indonesia communities. the existence of cross-border trade between two neighboring countries reflects economic ties between border communities. the objectives of this study are 1) to measure the degree of socioeconomic ties between communities across borders between sebatik malaysia-indonesia; 2) to assess the feasibility of creating sebatik border trade center for regional economic integration. this study employed an in- depth interview with the stakeholders involved in the governance of development in the study area. the selection of stakeholders was based on purposive sampling. secondary data relating to economic activities was also used to strengthen the findings of the in-depth interview. fieldwork to sebatik island was also carried out for observation of the current economic scenario. the economic fundamentals of sebatik island malaysia-indonesia were examined with the feasibility of regional economic integration by establishing a border trade center in the island. thus, transborder economic development can be planned systematically by both the government of malaysia and indonesia as a strategic approach to strengthen the sebatik economy. the development rubrics of the sebatik border trade center will take into account economic considerations, while maintaining security approaches to enhance economic development in the border areas.","border trade, sebatik island","Transnationalism on Sebatik Island is attributed to formal and informal cross-border activities and practices, as well as the intensity of cross-border exchanges. Ethnic and religious bonds also strengthen cross-border activities. Trade ties also indirectly promote bonds of togetherness between communities on Sebatik Island. In assessing the feasibility of creating Sebatik Border Trade Center, this paper proposes two alternatives: Sebatik Barter Trade Center and Sebatik Special Border Economic Zone. A one-stop inspection system must be designed for the Sebatik Barter Trade Center in Wallace Bay to increase the efficiency of the barter trade system and achieve seamless supply chain connectivity between Nunukan and Tawau. Since Sebatik Barter Trade Center is located on Malaysian territory, it also requires the cooperation of the Indonesian government and barter trades to comply with the Malaysian government's rules and regulations. As the volume of barter trade between Nunukan and Tawau intensifies, the Sebatik Barter Trade Center is expected to provide locals with economic and employment opportunities. A unified set of policies and incentives in finance, taxation, investment, trade, and customs regulations need to be enacted for SBEZ. This means that close institutional collaboration between the Malaysian and Indonesian governments, especially at the Malaysia-Indonesia Socio-Economic Cooperation Committee (Sosek Malindo) level, is crucial for the establishment of the SBEZ on Sebatik Island. In order for SBEZ to succeed, both governments must develop soft and hard infrastructure components in the SBEZ. The hard and soft infrastructure components will strengthen transboundary economic activities and further facilitate the development of Sebatik Island. The current issues, such as the suspension of Indonesian PLB for cross-border mobility and Indonesian vessels' compliance with international maritime safety standards imposed by the Malaysian government, as well as outstanding border problems between the two countries, must all be addressed for the Sebatik Barter Trade Centre or SBEZ to succeed.","sandy nur ikfal raharjo research center for politics national research and innovation agency (brin), jakarta, indonesia sand007@brin.go.id abdul rahim anuar institute for indonesia, thailand and singapore (uumits), universiti utara malaysia, malaysia abdulrahim5796206@gmail.com",
110,Women’S Participation In Fulfillment Of Household Need  Through E-Warong Kube Pkh:,"this study uses a qualitative descriptive method on five different groups in banjar city who use e-warong kube as a source of their daily income. this research was conducted in october 2019 before covid-19 became a global pandemic. we use the concept of gotong royong proposed by john r bowen to see the participation of women in maintaining household needs through e-warong kube pkh. we addressed two questions: in which ways are women managing e-warong kube pkh as a jointly managed retailed business? and how they can meet their household needs through this activity? so far, gotong royong is seen as an ideology that is politically reflected in social life. relying on our observations and interviews on our information network, we found a new face of gotong royong and its attachment to women’s activities in maintaining household needs, especially family food security. our recommendations are addressed to relevant stakeholders to be able to accommodate, provide skills training, and bridge the group with relevant csr programs in each region as an effort to establish a sustainable business solution for actors of e-warong kube pkh, especially in the age of covid-19","women’s empowerment, participation, household needs","Even though it has been running since 2016, the E-Warong KUBE PKH is still existing. The idea for its establishment started with the integration of digital-based inclusive finance so that the distribution of assistance could be done in a non-cash manner. However, in its implementation, women organize themselves through the gotong-royong mechanism to maintain the E-Warong KUBE PKH with various kinds of innovations. They learn to convert their spare time into another form of capital, maintaining social relations through social funds. These women also widen their social network through E-Warong KUBE PKH. Money in their minds is not only about nominal, but from the value attached relationally to other aspects. Therefore, the bond between members and administrators of E-Warong can be maintained. With a relatively low non-fixed income, these women can still provide for their household needs by working as temporary workers. Social funds that bind the administrators can also run according to their functions. This indicates that there is mutual trust. Trust is one of the strong assets that can be used as an embryo for empowerment. Therefore, the recommendations from this study are addressed to relevant stakeholders to be able to accommodate, provide skills training, and bridge the group with relevant CSR programs in each region. Thus, empowerment is a form of development that can be carried out by cross-actor, it can be Government or companies, or both of them. So that the meaning of mutual assistance (gotong royong) does not only become village-centric but also penetrates the development of the urban context.","a qualitative study in banjar, west java, indonesia nuzul solekhah, fatwa nurul hakim junior researcher, research center for social welfare, village and connectivity, national research and innovation agency of indonesia nuzulsoleka@gmail.com, hakim.fatwa@yahoo.com",
111,"Virtual Tour “Batik Tiga Negeri” As Innovation Of Tourism  Sustainability During The Outbreak Of Covid-19 In Lasem,","the pandemic of covid-19 affects several sectors, mainly tourism. the tourism entrepreneur should innovate and adjust to the current situation. it is necessary to maintain the sustainability of his enterprise. however, the number of visitors declined dramatically, but the tourism products can be sold online. lasem, situated in rembang regency in central java, has some cultural tourism potential, especially the local creation of batik tiga negeri (three countries batik). this study aims to describe the virtual tour of batik tiga negeri, initiated by a lasem heritage foundation collaborate with tourist agency, and the effect of its innovation in maintaining the sustainability of cultural tourism in lasem. three categories of social resilience based on keck and sakdapolrak’s theory were used to analize this result. this study found that (1) the virtual tour of batik tiga negeri narrates the story of its batik and the process of colouring lasem batik in three areas so that it might attract the virtual tourists to donate as they wish; and (2) the contribution of tourists could help the sustainability of the batik maker in lasem. the batik makers faced a declined income during the pandemic.","innovation, virtual tour, batik tiga negeri","The Covid-19 pandemic has paralyzed the world's tourism sector, including in Indonesia. Lasem District, Rembang Regency, Central Java Province, Indonesia which is recently promoted as historical and cultural tourism was affected by the pandemic. The absence of tourist visits in Lasem, result in the decrease of the batik sale so that the welfare of Lasem batik is threatened. The stakeholders tourism in Lasem who are members of the Lasem Heritage Foundation and Kesengsem Lasem have local belongingness to their area. This is a spirit for tourism actors in Lasem to cope this problem. They utilize the resources in Lasem as a commodity in maintaining sustainable tourism. This effort is the coping capacity of tourism actors in Lasem. The tourist attractions and history are used as the resources to attarct the visitors. Adaptive capacity of tourism actors is the idea of a virtual tour of Batik Tiga Negeri. They choose one of the cultural tours where the perpetrators are mostly affected by the pandemic (old Lasem batik makers with daily wages). The virtual tour combines between technological innovation and Lasem tourism actors, as a result of collaboration with travel agents, namely traval.co. The virtual tour activity tells the history of the three basic colors of Lasem batik and the ancient batik house which is still operating. In the virtual tour, the tour guide offers tourists Lasem MSME products in its virtual market, namely the Lasem People's Market. The transformative capacity in this innovation is that tourism actors have the courage to network with various parties, such as: (1) travel agents; (2) government institutions; (3) private institutions in the implementation of virtual tours. The Batik Tiga Negeri virtual tour contributes to the sustainability of tourism actors in Lasem, especially the Lasem Heritage Foundation and the Lasem batik artisans.","rembang, indonesia prisca kiki wulandari 1doctoral student of national resilience science, universitas gadjah mada, 2lecturer at universitas brawijaya indonesia priscakiki91@mail.ugm.ac.id m. baiquni geography department, universitas gadjah mada, indonesia mbaiquni@ugm.ac.id ahmad zubaidi philosophy department, universitas gadjah mada ahmad.zubaidi@ugm.ac.id",
112,Why Do Preparedness And Response To Covid-19 Pandemic   Need Community Development Approach: An Experience,"this article examines strategies to respond to the covid-19 pandemic using a community development approach, namely pemberlakuan pembatasan kegiatan masyarakat (ppkm) mikro or community activity restrictions at the micro level. this study was conducted in malang city, east java province, indonesia. this study found that this strategy has distributed greater authority to community members to participate in preparedness and response to the covid-19 pandemic. there are two mechanisms that have been established to implement ppkm, which are the zoning system and the establishment of covid-19 headquarters at the rt/rw level. this study found that ppkm has succeeded in reducing positive cases and preventing transmission of the coronavirus. the strategy of ppkm has replaced the prior strategy, which employed a top-down approach and relied on dominant agent roles, such as government, medical experts, politicians, public health officials, and economists. this strategy could be problematic because, in some cases, it has provided an ideal setting for authoritarian practices.","covid-19, pandemic","This study shows that a community development approach is required to prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach has been adopted to the Indonesian partial lockdown, namely the Pemberlakuan Pembatasan Kegiatan Masyarakat (PPKM) mikro or Community Activities Restriction at the micro level. This strategy has involved many community members from the lowest level of government in Indonesia, which is RT/RW. This strategy also gives greater authority to the members to undertake some mechanisms or strategies, including the establishment of a zoning system and COVID-19 headquarters. In Malang, East Java Province, there is a unique strategy for conducting the zoning system. This strategy has utilized different colors of flags to inform people regarding the number of people who are confirmed positive for COVID-19 in each RT. From the lowest until the highest level of case, each flag informs the stage of positive cases, from the green flag for the first stage (zero cases), yellow for the second stage (1–5 cases), orange for the third stage (6–10 cases) and red for the fourth stage (more than 10 cases). Another strategy is to establish Covid-19 headquarters in each RT. This headquarters is required to undertake several responsibilities, which include not only responding to the positive case of COVID-19 and its impact, but also conducting preparedness to prevent the transmission of coronavirus. This study demonstrates that PPKM micro, which adopts a community development approach, has become an effective way to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. From the evidence, it can be shown that Indonesia has the best COVID-19 Recovery Index in ASEAN. 1070","from indonesia anif fatma chawa and moch hisyam putra department of sociology, faculty of social and political sciences, universitas brawijaya, malang, indonesia anif_chawa@ub.ac.id, hisyammhp87@gmail.com","References

113,The Resilience Of The Tablighi Jamaat During Covid-19  Period,"the covid-19 pandemic has not only shifted religious patterns but has also raised sentiments against certain groups in society. the cases that occurred was the covid-19 cluster case from the tablighi jamaat after holding the ijtima 'ulama throughout asia in gowa, south sulawesi. participants who took part in these religious activities came from various regions, including wonosobo regency. holding religious events by inviting large crowds during a pandemic is considered inappropriate. so, the activity became a new cluster for the spread of covid-19 determined by the government. this study examines changes in the socio-religious life of the tablighi jamaat and community sentiment towards religious sects during the covid-19 period in wonosobo regency, central java. this study uses qualitative research with interviews as a data collection technique. this study uses the dimensions of religious commitment from charles y glock and rodney stark. this study found that the socio-religious life of the tablighi jamaat experienced a shift due to increasing public sentiment towards religious groups. changes in group religious rituals adapt to social conditions even though they are contrary to religious beliefs and obedience. so that new ritual practices are carried out to survive the larger sentiment.",tablighi jamaat,"The impact of holding the Ijma Ulama during the pandemic has brought the Tablighi Jamaat into a religious organization that many people talk about. During the pandemic, it is not allowed to hold events that invite many people. However, the Tablighi Jamaat carried out Ijma' Ulama activities, which followers of Tablighi Jamaat attended throughout Indonesia and from various countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Thailand. Even though the reason for the event has been prepared, the community cannot tolerate it. Thus, the Tabligh congregation who returned from Goa, South Sulawesi, as the location for the Ijma 'Ulama event was considered a cluster of covid, which was considered disturbing by the general public. It resulted in sentiment by the community towards the Tablighi Jamaat group. The increasing public sentiment towards the Tablighi Jamaat group during the Covid-19 pandemic requires adaptation in the Tablighi Jamaat group. These adaptations include the dimensions of religious rituals (Macro) and the dimensions of ritual obedience (Micro). These two dimensions can be explained as follows: Some Tablighi Jamaat followers were labeled as a cluster of the Covid-19 spread when they returned to their place of origin. Neighbors and the surrounding community began to stay away because of the COVID-19 cluster label carried by people who had just returned from Goa, South Sulawesi, where the Ijma' Ulama was held. It does the practice of worshiping the Tablighi Jamaat to be opposed by the community. It is feared that Tablighi Jemaah will transmit the virus to the community. So that, some community resistance was carried out, such as spraying the prayer mat of one of the Tablighi Jamaat, avoiding, alienating, and stigmatizing the Tablighi Jamaat and their families. The form of adaptation carried out is by reducing communal activities among the Tablighi Jamaat, such as congregational prayers, Jaulah, Khuruj, and other religious activities. It is to keep away from the potential for more significant community resistance. Through the common fate of being shunned by the community, the Tablighi Jamaat group becomes more solid. Support each other, such as donating to the Tablighi Jamaat family, who is currently in isolation in the hospital, comforting and strengthening each other, and praying for each other. Tablighi Jamaat's internal relations are getting closer because they feel they are experiencing the same problem. Tablighi Jamaat, who has positive signs of Covid-19, should be isolated in the hospital. While in the hospital, religious practices such as Ta'lim, Reciting Al-Quran, and other forms of religious practice increased compared to worship in 1079","pardamean daulay lecturer, department of sociology, universitas terbuka, banten, indonesia pardameandaulay@ecampus.ut.ac.id nur afni khafsoh lecturer, department of sociology of religion, uin sunan kalijaga yogyakarta, indonesia nur.khafsoh@uin-suka.ac.id","References

114,"Regional Government Design During The Pandemic: The  Challenges Toward Agile Governance In East Java,","the covid-19 pandemic has demanded many adaptations in all life aspects, including the governance performed by governmental organizations. in consort with indonesia's social restrictions policy which is carried out widely in continual periods, impacts on the performance shown by the local governments are quite blatant, which appears to hinder the success of duties they are responsible for. basically, the current study seeks to describe the provincial governance resilience in east java in dealing with the covid-19 crisis. through agile governance perspective, the research is aimed to discover information related to what extent east java province governments have been demonstrating agile governance with due regards to the six key principles implemented during the pandemic. moreover, a qualitative research method, by means of descriptive explanation design, was applied. research data, in addition, were collected through document searching and in-depth interview with some related agencies. concerned on four governance dimensions, i.e., the government, bureaucracy, civil society, and economic community, the research had shown that despite their efforts to perform the agility, the east java province governments could not fully and properly meet the whole principles of agile governance yet. it means that with all the improvements or accelerations made for the sake of work under the state of agile governance, a number of aspects were left weakened, and needed enhancements still.","covid-19 pandemic, governance, agile governance","Based on the foregoing analysis on agile governance approach applied in the observation, this research concludes that the governance of East Java Province, in the time of pandemic, has been basically implementing agile governance. It is evidenced by a number of innovations which can be referred to as a reflection for working under agile principles, covering: good enough governance, business-driven, human-focused, based on quick wins, and systematic and adaptive approach. Meanwhile, those six principles are embodied in various policies or priority decisions, exclusively in dealing with the new normal situations based on the varied dimensions. This excellence must be acknowledged that it is closely linked to the willingness shown by related governmental agencies to make innovations based on primary aspects of technology. For example, in civil community, the East Java Province Government, through a PMD Service, has made use of varied technological aids to carry out several agendas for village communities. By such a pattern, the government can warrant that numerous priority programs intended for rural communities are still running despite face-to-face limits. However, though some dimensions of agile governance principles generate successes, especially in the new normal, not all of these principles can be actualized, nonetheless. These limits obviously occur, therefore. For instance, data problems are becoming a serious challenge, to date, for the Social Services Office. The identification is based on the low-quality state of Systematic and Adaptive Approach, especially in case of data integration between the provincial and municipal/regional governments. It, therefore, results in cases of inaccurate distribution of social assistances for communities. Furthermore, the governance applied in East Java, primarily during the new normal era, can be considered improved or either accelerated in terms of running agile government. Despite such a fact, there are still some dimensions remaining for further enhancements.","indonesia muhammad lukman hakim and iqbal fajar dwiranda department governmental science, university of brawijaya and department political science, university of brawijaya, malang, indonesia em.lukman79@ub.ac.id, dwiranda47@gmail.com",
115,The Conflict In The Iron Sand Mining Construction In  Yogyakarta (A Study Of The Society’S Social Movement,"national development often causes various kinds of problems. the problems happen because the policies about national development made by the indonesian government tend to take sides with businesspeople and impact on the oppression of the society. national development argued for the society’s welfare eventually turns out to be detrimental for the society and threatens the survival of the society. moreover, it tends to destroy the natural environment where the society depends its life. currently, there are many natural resources that should be used as much as possible for the society’s welfare. however, many of those natural resources are controlled by businesspeople that are regulated in the free market and camouflaged in democratization existence. the indonesian government, which is supposed to have a significant role in protecting the society, evidently takes sides with businesspeople in the interest of seeking financial benefits without paying attention to various aspects of the society’s life. this condition has brought several kinds of the society’s social movements as the response to neoliberalist policies that basically eliminate the concept of the society’s sovereignty. the social movement conducted by the society of the southern coastal area of yogyakarta, as a discussion focus of this paper, is a form of the society’s response to the government’s policies related to national development in the iron sand mining construction project that tends to take sides with businesspeople and harms the society in many aspects.","social movement, iron sand mining","The case of the society’s social movement conducted by the society of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta against the iron sand mining construction project actually occurs because of the differences in interests and perspectives related to the natural resources management. The government and businesspeople view that natural resources of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta, especially in Kulon Progo Regency, is an object and asset belonging to the government that can be exploited to earn billions of rupiahs in profit each year. Meanwhile, the society of the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta views that the southern coastal area of Yogyakarta is the fertile land that they have managed for decades as a legacy from their ancestors. Moreover, the coastal land is the main source of livelihood for the local society which is used to fulfill the society’s daily needs. The society also views that changing the function of land into the iron sand mining area can damage nature which can cause major disasters that threaten the society's life. With this view, the society places nature as a subject that is able to give feedback on the treatment given, if nature is preserved and treated well, then nature will also provide the benefit in the form of providing sources of life that can be used to 1100","against the iron sand mining construction project) muhammad alhada fuadilah habib universitas islam negeri sayyid ali rahmatullah, tulungagung, indonesia habibhada@gmail.com asik putri ayusari ratnaningsih universitas airlangga, surabaya, indonesia mukhammad fatkhullah community development officer, pt kilang pertamina internasional unit dumai dumai, indonesia siti muslihatul mukaromah madrasah aliyah negeri 7, jombang, indonesia ella erliyana stiamak barunawati, surabaya, indonesia","References

116,Challenges Of Party Autonomy To Party Institutionalization:  A Case Of Internal Party Conflict,"party autonomy is one of the critical indicators of political parties' institutionalization. the party's ability to be freed from other influences in managing its organizations and policies can assess how far the institutionalization of political parties is. using a sequential-mixed method by combining quantitative analysis, which is elaborated more by the qualitative one, this study found that the management of party policies and internal conflicts still portray the influence of external factors. this external influence affects the party's independence while facing and resolving internal party conflict. party autonomy is a severe challenge for party institutionalization because it will affect internal cohesion and solidity. relatively, independent political parties will be able to manage their organizations and avoid intervention from external parties.","party autonomy, party organization","As one of the crucial institutions of democracy, the institutionalization of political parties becomes an essential step for political parties to maximize their functions. This institutionalization covers one of the significant issues, namely party autonomy. Party autonomy describes how the party has the ability autonomously over various resources owned by the party. This capability requires the support of a solid internal mechanism for external influence, in this case, the intervention of parties outside the party to influence organizational policies or decisions. The internal perception of the party is mainly reflected in this study showing that the party is relatively independent of various opportunities that provide external parties to be involved in the organization. The challenge is how the party's autonomy in dealing with internal disputes. Although the party has mechanisms that can prevent the party from potentially splitting up, several internal party conflicts show that the party is still vulnerable to external party intervention. When external parties are involved in the business affairs of political parties, especially in resolving internal conflicts, the idealism, autonomy, and independence of political parties are questioned. When these three things are missing from a party, a political party becomes an organization with no design for a better policy change direction for a country. It happens because the party has intervened so that its ideology or platform that should be the party's footing has been blurred. Instead, the party grew into a political institution that would serve the needs of its patrons, not for the people, and the consolidation of democracy was threatened.","ridho imawan hanafi, mouliza k. donna sweinstani and esty ekawati research center for politic-national research and innovation agency, jakarta, indonesia ridhoimawan@gmail.com, email: moulizadonna@gmail.com, email: esty1wati@gmail.com",
117,Civilizing Process Of Football In Indonesian Schools  Indhar Wahyu Wira Harjo,"football is favorable by indonesian people, not only as sports. although football is crucial in social life, it does not excite social scientists to conduct a comprehensive academic review. this article aimed to extensively review football. the review was carried out by examining football as a civilizing process involving individuals and a social structure. the notions are based on the viewpoint of football as a part of national human civilization through schools. the study results show that schools significantly contributed to the introduction and passion fostering for football. schools have been proven to introduce football to young generations since the colonial era until today. ultimately, football is a sport inseparable from its surrounding social world.","sportization, colonial, education, soccer","Civilizing process in the football milieu in Indonesia can be understood from the shifting that happened in Dutch colonialism. Native people previously adoring sport with physical contact to humans and animals then have slowly changed through school education. Schools for natives during the colonialism introduced and developed the Indonesian people’s fondness of football. Those kinds of efforts can be found in Indonesian school until today. Football as a form of sport cannot be separated from the social world that surrounds it. The presence of football in Indonesia has proven to be inherent in the process of colonization and modernization of people's lives. Gradually, football also permeated people's lives through formal education initiated by the colonial government. Then, the popularity of football found the right habitat when it was taught within the walls of schools and spread to society on a wider scale (Bourdieu, 1978, p. 832). However, without realizing that education created conditions that were not desired by the colonial government when football fans declared the establishment of a football association that had the spirit of nationalism, namely the All-Indonesian Football Association. A search of the history of football in Indonesia shows that sport is related to the life of a complex society. Indeed, the school has succeeded to be an institution that introduces and maintains people's interest in football through its sports education curriculum. However, other factors have accelerated the development and spread of the football game, 1117","department of sociology faculty of social sciences and politics, universitas brawijaya, malang, indonesia indhar.wahyu@ub.ac.id","References

118,Empowering Digital Twin For Production Operations With  Deep Learning: A Case Study,"this study aims to establish an intelligent cyber-physical production system (cpps) with closed-loop control and self-optimization of process parameters. empowered by a deep learning (dl) agent, the digital twin (dt) simulation can focus on the most significant process routes and eliminate 92.53% of unnecessary exhaustive iterations. on the other hand, dt can provide the most accurate simulation result for fast convergence to the optimal parameters of dl and no need to waiting for the result after the process completed. though collaborative and autonomous interactions between dt and dl have been proposed recently, the practical integration of dt-dl and cpps in the electronic manufacturing service (ems) industry has yet to be validated in official publications. with such novelty approach, the improvement of the production throughput (t/p) and rolled throughput yield (rty) is 7.513% and 0.86%, respectively, which is on top of the contributions from traditional industrial engineering (ie) productivity tools.","deep learning, digital twin, cpps, simulation",,eric c.h. wai department of industrial and systems engineering the hong kong polytechnic university hong kong sar chwai2003@hkstar.com dr. carman k.m. lee department of industrial and systems engineering the hong kong polytechnic university hong kong sar ckm.lee@polyu.edu.hk,"References

119,Designing Project Risk Contingency Using Tornado Diagram  Luthfia Salma Gumbira,"company x is a service and production company in telecommunications and information technology (it). at the end of 2021, company x has a collaborative project, which is a refurbished project. during the execution of the project in previous terms, company x often experienced delays in project completion or the deliverable in the contract was not achieved. one of the factors that caused delays due to several risks that occurred and had a large cost impact for handling them, so company x could not handle risks immediately because they did not have a budget for risk mitigation. the purpose of this paper aims to estimate the value of contingency reserves for identified risk so it can anticipate the priority risks and prepare for the required budget if it happened. the method that will be used in this paper is expected monetary value (emv) and tornado diagram. evm is statistical calculation to determine the cost that will be used in the future to overcome the risk that happens in a project. based on this research, the results show that there are 34 risks that can be inserted to the contingency risk cost. the total cost required is us$5071.09 out of 0,1% of the total project budget. in addition, there are 5 risks that have the highest cost impact based on tornado diagram, including negative and positive risk. the top negative risks include delay in product delivery, defect product during delivery, additional request for product delivery, expired software license. however positive risk is also identified such as additional fund that may enhance for taking the opportunity.","risk, cost impact","Contingency reserves is a quantitative aspect of a risk that is important to do because it can help companies prepare the contingency reserves needed if a risk occurs. With contingency reserves, it will prevent schedules and costs at any risk from causing projects to experience delays and cost overruns. Based on the results of calculations using the EMV method, the results obtained are that there are 34 risks that are prepared for cost reserves if these risks occur. The total cost required for any risk which may occur and also handle is US$ 5.071,09 which is only 0,1% from the total project budget. This indicates that the refurbished project team must prepare cost reserves, so that if a risk occurs and requires a budget, the project team can immediately act without need to use the main project budget. For the next research, the risk assessment can use more integrated data for example project performance integration so all the stakeholders can monitor the risk movement and also more responsible for any risk that may threat to the project objectives.","school of industrial and systems engineering faculty of industrial engineering telkom university bandung, indonesia luthfiasalma@student.telkomuniversity.ac.id devi pratami school of industrial and systems engineering faculty of industrial engineering telkom university bandung, indonesia devipratami@telkomuniversity.ac.id gn. sandhy widyasthana school of industrial and systems engineering faculty of industrial engineering telkom university bandung, indonesia sandhy.widsyasthana@mdi.vc",
120,A Heuristic Solution Method For Solving Job Shop  Scheduling Problems Considering Crane Interference,"in this study, we propose a heuristic method for obtaining a good approximate solution to job shop scheduling problems with bidirectional conveyance operations. in previous studies, there are heuristic solution methods and an exact solution method. the former are applicable only to problems with one way conveyance. the latter addresses problems with bidirectional transport, but it cannot solve medium to large scale problems in practical time. the objective is to minimize the makespan. the work order of jobs on each machine, crane assignment, and time to transfer job are determined. we consider a job shop scheduling problem with two cranes located in a straight line. all jobs are transported by one of the cranes to the machine between the two yards. the two cranes must maintain a safety distance of at least one address to avoid collision. crane interference is a case in which the crane transfer time is longer than the minimum to avoid a collision. we seek a schedule that prevents crane interference. the unit time is a discrete value, which is the time it takes the crane to move one address. the positions of the yard, machine and crane are given by discrete addresses. we obtain good approximate solutions in multiple steps. we derive approximate solutions based on the mtwr rule and an effective machine assignment method for the flexible job store scheduling problem. the mtwr rule is a rule to select the job with the largest total remaining work time and transfer time for each job. in the first step, the work order of jobs on each machine is determined by selecting with a certain probability the mtwr rule and the random rule, respectively. crane assignment is determined by selecting with a certain probability the ccfj rule, the sttt rule, and the random rule, respectively. the ccfj rule is a rule to select the closest crane from the job. the sttt rule is a rule to select the crane with the smallest total transfer time . if two jobs are to be transferred simultaneously, time to transfer job is determined by setting the time when both cranes transfer in the same direction. if the makespan is not updated t times, the process is terminated. in the second and subsequent phases, time to transfer job is determined based on the job order at each machine and crane assignments obtained in the first phase. each crane transfers the job at the earliest transfer start time. if the makespan is updated, the solution is saved. if all processes are completed at the earliest transfer start time, the solution is output．numerical experiments on several example problems have shown that the system successfully obtains good approximate solutions for some of the problems. in the future, we aim to construct a solution method that combines the proposed solution method and metaheuristics for medium and large scale problems.","heuristics, crane interference",,"kosuke kobayashi and hideki katagiri department of industrial engineering and management, faculty of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202270110la@jindai.jp, katagiri@kanagawa-u.ac.jp takashi tanizaki department of informatics faculty of engineering kindai university hiroshima, japan tanizaki@hiro.kindai.ac.jp",
121,Investigating Relationships Between Digitalisation And  Warehouse Performance: An Application Of Fsqca,"digital transformation (dt) of warehousing systems has become crucial for logistics firms in saudi arabia to become and remain competitive. it will help to streamline the supply chain and improve warehouse performance, which, in turn, will enable saudi arabia to be positioned as a global logistics hub. therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the antecedents of digitalisation and their impact on warehouse performance in saudi arabia. data were collected from warehouse managers who are involved in the it deployment. the study uses a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsqca) approach to analyse the collected data. the results show that achieving high warehouse performance in saudi arabia depends on the configurational effects of both resource orchestration theory (rot) and digitalisation. specifically, they reveal that digitalisation has the most significant effect on warehouse performance. this study will contribute to the theory by assessing the configuration design of the dimensions to gain an understanding of the digitalisation process. additionally, it will guide managers to develop a step-by-step procedure for implementing the digitalisation process in their warehouses and assess the type and level of the resources required for the digitalisation of their warehouses. in addition, this study will help managers to clearly identify the various roles of digitalisation in improving performance.","digitalisation, warehousing","Although many countries are implementing digitalisation for various reasons, research indicates that Saudi Arabia is still behind advanced economies in the contribution of their digitalisation to gross domestic product.

122,A Heuristic Solution Method For School Lunch Menu  Optimization Problem Considering The Frequency Of,"japanese school lunches are said to be more nutritionally balanced than those of other countries. this is due to the fact that school lunch menus are prepared in consideration of various items such as food categories and coloring of dishes. as a specific example, japanese school lunches include not only meat-based dishes, but also rice and side dishes as part of the daily menu. in japan, there is a style of cooking called washoku. it is an expression of the japanese people's respect for nature, and has been selected as an intangible cultural heritage because it is a traditional social practice that has been passed down from generation to generation. in the field of school lunch, there is a need for a system to support nutrition teachers in menu planning. there are many restrictions to be considered in menu preparation, such as nutritional intake standards, ingredient costs, and cooking time, and it takes a lot of time and effort to complete a menu. in japan, the intake of 13 nutrients is determined according to the school meal intake standards established by the ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology (mext). therefore, when preparing menus, it is necessary to keep within the upper and lower limits of the standard's intake. previous research has proposed a menu planning model using a mathematical optimization solver that takes into account about 70 different constraints. however, the model has two problems: first, it does not adequately take into account the frequency with which food items and dishes are served. second, the solution time is too long (about 6,000 seconds). the second reason for this is the number of decision variables and constraints in a month, which are enormous: approximately 200,000 and 10,000, respectively. on the other hand, another previous studies using genetic algorithms (hereafter referred to as gas) have produced menus in a relatively short time. however, the number of constraints considered is quite small (six), and the frequency of serving ingredients and dishes is not taken into account. in general, in ga, as the number of constraints increases, the solution generated by crossing becomes infeasible in many cases, and it is time-consuming to change to a feasible solution. in this study, we formulate an automatic menu creation model that takes into account the frequency of serving ingredients and dishes as a mathematical optimization problem. using the tabu search method, we propose a heuristic solution method that can find a good solution in practical time 1151",,,"ingredients and dishes himawari takeuchi department of industrial engineering and management, graduate school of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202270137cl@jindai.jp takeshi uno field of applied mathematical science, department of mathematical science, graduate school of technology, industrial and social science, tokushima university tokushima, japan uno.takeshi@tokushima-u.ac.jp kazuki ota and hideki katagiri department of industrial engineering and management, faculty of engineering kanagawa university kanagawa, japan r202170199fz@jindai.jp, katagiri@kanagawa-u.ac.jp",
123,Order Picking Optimization In O2O Supermarkets With  Customer Interference,"the advancement of omni-channel retailing brings opportunities and challenges to traditional supermarkets. it is becoming more and more popular for omni-channel retailers to make use of local establishments to complete online customer orders. however, the complex store operational environment has brought huge challenges for online order fulfilment, which hinders the use of order picking optimization models of traditional warehouses in o2o supermarkets. pickers responsible for online customer orders may encounter interference from in-store customers. one of the main interference situations is that pickers responsible for online customer orders may have to wait in queue with in-store customers during the peak period. this study, in particular, incorporates pickers’ waiting in queues during order fulfilment operations. we first analyze the similarities and differences in order picking processes between the traditional warehouse and o2o supermarkets, emphasizing the complex store operational features. we construct an order picking optimization model to minimize the total due time of online customer orders, with particular consideration of pickers’ possible queuing time. an efficient heuristic is proposed to resolve the optimization model. furthermore, this paper discusses the effect of various factors, i.e., the quantity of order, the calculation method of queuing length and order picking methods, on order fulfilment performance in different computational environments. numerical experiments were carried out and experimental results were statistically analyzed. the computational experiments evidence the effect of order batching, order quantity, and possible waiting time in queues on online order fulfilment performance. the lack of consideration of customer interference may significantly impair order fulfilment performance. lastly, managerial suggestions were put forward for o2o supermarket operations.","o2o supermarkets, business school",,"kexin gao and shandong mou business school central university of finance and economics beijing, china 2022211256@email.cufe.edu.cn, smou@cufe.edu.cn",

125,Fecal Coliform Reduction Management In Manila Bay  Bathing Beaches: A Case Study In The Philippines,"manila bay is considered as one of the best locations to experience sunset, visitation for relaxation, and a place for gathering. however, the constant draining and dump coming from different industrial sectors has developed to a bay which constitutes to high level of pollutions. the need to address the issue with regards to water body pollution has been underexplored. the paper investigates several fecal coliform reduction methods: the use of secondary and tertiary treatments like sand filtration and uv disinfection processes bolstering activated sludge processes, membrane bioreactor technology systems, and intermittent filtering. the following methods were examined to resolve manila bay’s bathing beaches’ high fecal coliform levels. the use of intermittent filtering with the filter media of unsorted sand yielded the highest reduction rate of 6.3 log10 compared to common activated sludge processes averaging only 0.38 log10. the mitigation of the bays could potentially reduce ecological and environmental problems. food, water, and energy are primary concerns for a country’s sustainability. with the involvement of pollution, the rise of capital scarcity would be evident which would reduce businesses, development, livelihood, and eventually the quality of life. the need to promote and mitigate water of bodies such as bays is therefore highly important for management. thus, policymakers and government sectors may take this into consideration for promotion and conservation of natural resources.","fecal coliform, manila bay, reduction methods, sustainability","and Recommendations Thus, implementing these changes may help mitigate Manila Bay’s Bathing Beaches’ fecal coliform levels. The use of refrigerated wastewater systems to cool the system’s temperature can be implemented but are rather costly. Furthermore, parameters must be instilled to restrict raw wastewater from entering plants such as the use of sand to further sift through pollutants. This links to the use of UV disinfection coupled with sand filtration, which can serve as the secondary and tertiary treatment processes of fecal coliform reduction levels with a typical primary treatment. Also, the conventional use of activated sludge seemed inferior to many other treatment processes such as lagooning. If intermittent filtering processes are favored, the filter media used is crucial in maximizing the time of moving wetter front, which impart increased retention time just as pressure dosed systems did. Thus, future studies scrutinizing the implementation of intermittent filtering using unsorted sands within the context of a tropical, heavily-urbanized bay can be examined. This may help determine if the effectiveness of unsorted sand as a filter media is unaffected by the Manila Bay climate or its water conditions. 1165","kyler hewitt sy international school manila university parkway, fort bonifacio global city, taguig, philippines 1634 kylersy@gmail.com ardvin kester s. ong school of industrial and engineering management mapua university 658 muralla st., intramuros, manila, philippines 1002 aksong@mapua.edu.ph","References

126,Application Of Lean Six Sigma Methodology In Defect  Reduction: A Case Study Of Kalahari Ash Salt Bagging,"the purpose of the current manuscript is to discuss the application experiences of lean six sigma (lss) process improvement methodology in defect reduction. the work discussed in the manuscript pertains to the results that were obtained in the quality control improvement project of the 50kg bagging plant process of kalahari ash processing company, botswana, to eliminate product defects. the defects in this case, were defined as the 50 kg filled salt bags not meeting the expected standard weight as per customer specifications. at any given month, these defects amounted to an average of 17.6% of the total production output with a yearly customer compensation loss of about us$40 000. several lss tools were applied within the dmaic (define-measure-analyze-improve-control) process improvement methodology from defining the problem through control and up to recommendations that could eliminate the process defects. tools such as sipoc (supplier-input-process-output-customer) diagrams, process maps, cause and effect diagrams, process capability analysis and gage repeatability and reproducibility (gage r&r) were applied in the project. a solution selection matrix was then applied to provide concrete recommendations to eliminate the identified process defects. through stability, linearity and bias tests the results showed that the weighing equipment was a major source of process variation leading to the observed percentage defects. this variation was due to several factors, one of which was the frequency and timing of the calibration of the weighing equipment. the analysis showed that, by changing the frequency and timing of the calibration of the equipment, a significant defect reduction percentage and improvement in customer satisfaction ratings could be achieved.","lean six sigma, quality control, defect reduction",The current manuscript discussed the application of Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology in solving real life practical problems by careful selection of the LSS tools and the systematic procedure of utilizing these tools throughout the life of a project. Production challenges that were experienced by the case study company were fully investigated and a solution was recommended to address the challenges that were experienced. The approach adopted in the study and solutions recommended can be applied to similar processes to potentially reduce production defects in similar settings.,"plant phillip m. baaisi, robert o. k. monageng, kobamelo mashaba, venkata kommula and gandure jerekias mechanical engineering department university of botswana (ub) gaborone, botswana monagengr@ub.ac.bw",
127,"Production Increase Of A Peruvian Sleepwear  Manufacturer Sme Through Slp, Tpm, Poka Yoke And","currently, the peruvian textile sector, especially the msmes and smes, is affected by several factors that have lowered its productivity. this industry is already dealing with complex markets for a high level of competitiveness and informality. for this reason, it is imperative to counteract these factors internally affecting the companies' operating processes. most companies, intending to lower costs, seek to hire personnel with a certain level of experience since it is assumed that they would support them in carrying out the work in their position, meaning that the personnel hired are not trained to perform their tasks. likewise, maintenance is minimized or non-existent, and plants are not adequately organized. all these factors result in a decreased level of productivity. this paper seeks to demonstrate that regular training, planned maintenance, and proper plant layout will reduce the negative effects mentioned above. for this purpose, there are specific tools available that will be mentioned in this article, such as slp, autonomous maintenance and/or planned maintenance (tpm), poka yoke, and standardized work, as they will be implemented for intervention in the production process in a company aimed to manufacture sleepwear, where an increase of 14% in their productivity level was achieved.","standardized work, slp","Table 2 shows the most importants indicators. The increase in these indicators means a negative effect on productivity. However, it can be seen that they were reduced after the improvement was made, making a positive impact. Likewise, in Table 3, we can observe a significant reduction in cost and an increased in the units produced. In conclusion, the study carried out on the Peruvian sleepwear manufacturing SME achieved the established objective of this paper, which is to improve the company's production process using the described engineering tools. Thanks to standardized work, cycle times in production are reduced. As for the Poka Yoke, by preventing errors in the processes, the percentage of defective products is reduced. With respect to the SLP, it was possible to reduce the total route time; finally, with the results of the TPM, it was decided to train the operators regarding the management of the autonomous and planned maintenance of the machines used in the production line.

131,Industry Revolution 4.0: The Challenges In Oil And Gas  Industry In Saudi Arabia,"the 4th industrial revolution (4ir) has caught the attention of many researchers and organizations around the world and they have started to work towards the implementation of such technological advancement. saudi arabia has caught the attention of local industries in the implementation of 4ir technologies. however, local oil and gas companies may encounter challenges that affect their business in implementing 4ir technologies. this paper aims to identify challenges affecting the implantation of 4ir technologies in the oil and gas sector. several challenges have been identified in this study based on the literature and experts interviewed. data were collected and analyzed using descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify, analyze and justify the main challenges affecting the implementation of the 4th industrial revolution technologies in oil and gas companies in saudi arabia. the top 5 ranked challenges were identified as having ‘security issues as the first and main challenge, following are ‘low 4ir understanding’, ‘lack of integration of technology platform’, ‘lack of global standards and data sharing protocols, and ‘lack of government support and policies. tackling these top 5 main challenges now will provide a clear path to implementing the 4th industrial revolution technologies in local oil and gas companies.","industry 4.0, oil and gas","This paper identified and highlighted the challenges of Industry 4.0 implementation in the oil and gas sector. These challenges were identified based on the literature and expert interviews. A survey/questionnaire was then developed which consists of 3 sections, demographics, company behavior towards 4IR, and 4IR challenges. The main purpose of this paper was to identify the main challenges affecting the 4th industrial revolution implementation in local oil and gas companies. The identified 17 challenges from the literature were utilized in the survey, in addition to a few more reasonable challenges added which accumulates to 20 challenges in total. The survey results were then collected and analyzed through descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and hypothesis testing to identify, analyze, and justify the main challenges affecting 4IR implementation in local oil and gas companies. The findings indicated that ‘security issues’ is the main challenge towards the implementation of 4IR technologies in local oil and gas companies, along with ‘low 4IR understanding’, ‘Lack of integration of technology platform’, ‘Lack of global standards and data sharing protocols’, and ‘Lack of government support and policies. Tackling these top 5 main challenges now will provide us with a clear path in implementing the 4th industrial revolution’s technological goals. Oil and gas companies in Saudi Arabia don’t seem to have any financial issues, their main concern is more about the adaptability of applications which may affect the security of such implementation. 1230","awsan mohammed construction engineering and management department; interdisciplinary research center in smart mobility and logistics; king fahd university of petroleum and minerals, dhahran 31261, saudi arabia awsan.mohammed@kfupm.edu.sa","References

132,Circular Economy In Climate-Related Disclosures  Hirotsugu Kitada,"investor interest in the circular economy (ce) is growing. investment in ce has exceeded $1.3 trillion, and the issuance of related equity funds and sovereign debt has increased several-fold each year after 2018. one of the reasons investors are interested in ce is that it is expected to contribute to the climate change mitigation. it has been noted that while about 55% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are derived from energy use, the remaining 45% come from product manufacturing and food production. conversion of energy use is not sufficient to limit temperature rise to below 2°c, which is currently a mainstream action for climate change under paris agreement. this gap can be resolved through transition to ce. the tcfd recommendation, a disclosure framework for climate-related information, recommends disclosing the development of ce-related solutions in the climate-related opportunities section. recently, the international financial reporting standards foundation and governments have been working together to promote mandatory disclosure of climate-related information. understanding the ce information in climate-related disclosures is therefore important for the process of transition to ce. the purpose of this study is to clarify how ce information is addressed in corporate climate-related disclosures. textual analysis is employed as the research method for this purpose, and the analysis is complemented by interview research. among the companies registered with tcfd supporters, those belonging to the chemical industry were selected for the analysis, and it was found that 55 of 94 companies disclosed tcfd information. this is because these companies deal with the production of plastics, which are a major point of contact for ce and climate-related information, especially in the short term. we, first, analyze textual data from the tcfd disclosures of these companies and, based on these results, interview individual companies. the results of the analysis showed that 14 companies explicitly used the term ce in their tcfd disclosures to refer to their activities, including 6 japanese companies, 2 us companies, 3 eu companies, and 3 other companies. however, there were also some companies that disclosed similar activities, such as alternative material and recyclability, in their tcfd reports even though they don't use the term ce, what they are promoting is actually ce. therefore, the diffusion of the ce concept in the description of corporate sustainability strategy is still limited. regarding the descriptions of ce, firstly, the provision of alternative materials (e.g., biomass raw materials) and recycling technologies related to plastics were mentioned as strategically important ce-related business opportunities in the chemical industry. some companies explained this in relation to transition risks through changes in legislation and consumer trends, indicating that companies understood the impact of future social changes on the expansion of their ce business. second, some companies are emphasizing ce within the group's business strategy. these companies do not limit their ce initiatives to sustainability activities, but is seen as a factor that will affect corporate performances and strategies in the medium to long term.","circular economy, tcfd, text analysis 1233",,"associate professor faculty of business administration hosei university tokyo, japan kitada@hosei.ac.jp masaatsu takehara masaatsu takehara specially appointed associate professor faculty of sustainability study hosei university tokyo, japan masaatsu.takehara.17@hosei.ac.jp",
133,Performance Measurement Of Gas Station In Indonesia  Based On Ownership Status Using,"the growth of the gas station business in indonesia is increasing from year to year. it requires companies in oil and gas industries to improve performance. oil and gas company state-owned in indonesia have 3 ownership schemes, namely coco (company owned, company operated), codo (company owned, dealer operated), and dodo (dealer owned, dealer operated). this study analyzes differences in the performance of the three schemes. the results can be used as company's strategic planning. gas station performance measured by the efficiency of each gas station unit, also differences between the three schemes. two-stage data envelopment analysis (dea) is used to calculate the efficiency of each gas station. in the first phase of dea, measuring efficiency in the operational aspects of gas stations with the aim of maximizing sales and transaction numbers. in the second stage of dea, it measures cost efficiency at gas stations, by minimizing the cost at gas stations. according to the findings of the study, dea analysis of the two stages is that there is no significant difference, however coco gas station has highest efficiency, followed by the codo gas station, and in the last place the dodo gas station with the lowest average efficiency.","two-stage dea, efficiency, oil and gas","The Data Envelopment Analysis method is useful for determining the performance of units within a company, by using the efficiency value of each DMU. Gas station performance is important for the sustainability of the company, especially where the company has various gas station ownership schemes. According to research, COCO (Corporate Owned Corporate Operated) gas stations have the highest efficiency of all aspects analyzed in this study with average efficiency value is 0,84. CODO gas stations (Corporate Owned Dealer Operated) have the highest efficiency value in terms of cost efficiency with efficiency value 0,88. The Last, DODO gas stations (Dealer Owned Dealer Operated) have the lowest efficiency in the two stages of DEA.","two-stage data envelopment analysis priani nadhira sudarma and isti surjandari departement of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, indonesia priani.nadhira@ui.ac.id, isti@ie.ui.ac.id","References

136,Study Of Advanced Car Design For Vehicles Of 2030 Using  Virtual Reality Technologies,"the aim of this project is to give a practical demonstration of the most recent and revolutionary methods used at a professional level for the structure and design phases of developing a new car. therefore, we need to clarify the steps that go from the birth of a new idea to its transformation into a virtual product. the result of the project is the design of a cutting-edge car that encompasses the technical, stylistic, and social needs of a potential user in the near future. a further purpose of the path was to demonstrate the main innovative technologies available, to date, in support of the design, which allows us to define the product at an extremely reduced time and cost. subsequently, allowing feedback from the market in the first few stages of development and implementing a maximally customer-oriented design. in this project, for the first time, virtual reality has been combined with the classic 3d modeling methodologies. this allowed to have immediate feedback on the product without having to wait for the completion of the 3d screen modeling on a 2d screen. it is therefore a new criterion that allows for fast and reliable response, thanks to the clearer display given by virtual reality. we are therefore talking about a new design that, iteratively, allows you to test the product, modify it and improve it quickly and without wasting materials.","car design, virtual reality","The development project for the 2030 car was the result of a structured and systematic process, the one indicated by the IDeS methodology, which allowed us, in about 8 months, to understand the car of the future, what characteristics it should have, what needs it satisfy and to generate a well-defined virtual model. The ""Auto 2030"" program, in addition to representing a further validation of the IDeS methodology, demonstrates how to apply the most modern technologies available to design support to arrive at a digital product in a very short time and at low cost. In particular, the implementation of augmented reality as a project system is a new and outstanding method which has made it possible to combine the classic 3D modeling with a virtual three-dimensional space thanks to which, directly in the design phase, some corrections have been made directly under construction. This made it possible to have immediate feedback on the product without having to wait for the completion of the 3D modeling on the classic flat screen. It is therefore a new criterion that allows for fast and reliable feedback thanks to the clearer feedback given by virtual 1267","giulio galiè, federico guerra, giulia alessandri, edoardo pignatelli, giampiero donnici and leonardo frizziero department of industrial engineering alma mater studiorum university of bologna viale risorgimento, 2 – 40136, bologna, italy giulio.galie2@unibo.it, federico.guerra7@studio.unibo.it, giulia.alessandri5@unibo.it, giampiero.donnici@unibo.it, leonardo.frizziero@unibo.it","References

146,Managing Complex Geometries Through Rhinoceros:  Voronoi Cells,"this research describes the possibility of handling complex geometries through rhinoceros, three-dimensional modeling software, by means of some parameterization blocks. more specifically, by processing programming codes in an internal rhinoceros environment (grasshopper), it is possible to parameterize geometries, allowing accurate and dynamic modeling. the geometry analyzed in the following discussion is an unconventional closed-cell structure. it is based on the application of voronoi diagrams in the three-dimensional field, thus creating closed cells in a foam- like manner. the objective pursued is to further study the properties of such structures and possible applications, ranging from the automotive to the biomedical field. the possibility of modeling complex structures with easiness, combined with the possibility of realizing them through modern additive manufacturing techniques, leads to the development of new, unconventional materials with unique mechanical properties and fully customizable behavior.","complex geometries, voronoi cells, rhinoceros","Through the use of Rhinoceros and Grasshopper, it was possible to create a parametric workflow for the realization of closed-cells Voronoi like structure. The dimension and density of the cells can be adjusted in real time, without the need of a complete redrawing of the geometry. Thanks to FDM 3D printing process capability and the possibility of processing polymers such as TPU, it was possible to make a first foam like cube with this type of structure. The choice of printing parameters is vital to reduce the creation of artifacts on the printed geometry or under extrusion zones/extruder failure due to filament buckling. The combination of the presented geometry combined with the appropriate choice of settings gives us a stable result and good starting point for future development. The next step is to improve both the obtained Voronoi geometry, improving its printability, and the realization of the geometry itself, optimizing the Grasshopper programming flow to allow Rhinoceros to process these structures even on larger array scales. It may be of interest once the Grasshopper workflow has been optimized, to integrate the cell fabrication process with a density-based optimization process (continuously variable density) that changes the Voronoi cell density based on, for example, a stress or strain field. In this way, the density can be increased where needed, leading to foams optimized for the specific application or purpose. Of course, accurate mechanical tests need to be conducted to evaluate the compressive stress-strain behavior of these types of structures, including evaluating the effect of density variation on mechanical properties. Having done that, it would be possible to make Ashby-Gibson curves in which to plot, for example, the reduced Young's modulus versus the reduced density, so as to get a better view of the behavior of these foams. Because of the anisotropy introduced during the layer-by-layer printing, it would be necessary to do compression tests not only along the Z direction of printing, but also in the XY plane. This type of testing would require a very large number of samples, resulting in wasted material, time and high costs. The solution to this problem is the possibility to accurately predict the behavior at different density and different compression plane using FEA (Finite Element Analisys) simulation performed on specific software. The simplest method to simulate these porous materials is to create a nonlinear RVE and then validate it at some specific points on the Ashby-Gibson curve (defined reduced density values). This would greatly reduce the number of tests to be performed, but would ensure that the behavior of these foams can be predicted at any density value. 1351","giulia alessandri, izer isufi, giulio galiè and giampiero donnici department of industrial engineering alma mater studiorum, university of bologna, bologna, 40136, italy giulia.alessandri5@unibo.it, izer.isufi@studio.unibo.it, giulio.galie2@unibo.it, giampiero.donnici@unibo.it","References

147,Does Human Resources Management (Hrm) Practices  Impact On Seaport Competitiveness?,"efforts at modernising seaports and improve their operational service efficiencies for competitive advantage have remained unabated given the changing demands of shipping customers. to address seaport inefficiencies, most advance nations have generally adopted infrastructural and technological upgrades/ implementations. however, this approach has failed to solve the lingering poor seaport performance in emerging economies, suggesting efforts must be directed at other areas to identify and explain the persistent inefficiencies at emerging economies’ seaports. this paper therefore examine whether there is a relationship between seaport inefficiency and hrm practices of at a given seaports. the study is based on a case study of the nigerian seaport, nigeria being the largest economy in africa. findings reveal that hrm practices have to be fully aligned with seaport business objectives for achieving optimal port competitiveness. specifically, the nigerian seaports’ hrm practices exhibits non-alignment with the business objectives due to unfair staff recruitment and promotion practices leading to poor staff morale, loyalty, commitment and productivity, resulting in significant business diversion to neighbouring seaports.",seaport,"There are two broad implications of this study These are theoretical and practical. Theoretically, there are two things it will contribute to literature. First is that investment in HR practices will have significant positive impact on workforce capability building in the context of a developing country. The second is that merit-based recruitment and promotion is very vital to improve workforce morale, loyalty, commitment and productivity in order to improve seaport competitiveness Practically, there are learnings the seaport managers to improve the competitiveness. They have to address issues with HR development. They must emphasize merit-based recruitment and promotion and also address issues with working condition of staff to improve productivity and provision of modern seaport technology. If the issues with HR development and practices are addressed, then this can be used as benchmarking for other African seaports to become competitive.","kayode adeyemi, shams rahman and muhammad abdulrahman school of accounting, information system and supply chain royal melbourne institute of technology (rmit) university, melbourne victoria 3001 australia s3263857@student.rmit.edu.au, shams.rahman@rmitedu.au, muhammad.abdulrahman@rmitedu.au",
148,Knowledge Management In Disaster Preparedness: An  Analysis Of 7.0 Magnitude Earthquake In 2022 Luzon,"in the past decade, reported disasters are becoming more severe and the number of deaths also increases. the impact of disaster could be reduced significantly with enough disaster preparedness. most recently, knowledge management has become a key part in disaster management specifically in the disaster preparedness phase. the aim of the study is to explore how individuals and the communities applied their knowledge in disaster preparedness. a survey method was utilized to measure their disaster preparedness before, during and after the luzon, philippines 7.0 magnitude earthquake last july 2022. from the 46 randomly selected respondents that experienced the said earthquake, the results showed that the majority of the respondents have information about disaster preparedness. social media is the biggest source of disaster preparedness information. roughly, 63% said they have attended training for disaster preparedness in an earthquake. around 37% of the total respondents stated that they understand disaster risks and disaster-prone locations. roughly, 30% said they knew the evacuation routes and evacuation procedures in which they lived. during the earthquake, the majority of the respondents were inside a building where they work. around 96.6% of the respondents took cover under the table to protect them from the earthquake. after the earthquake, the majority of the respondents seek a safe place. it is recommended to have an improved disaster preparedness design to increase participation in disaster preparedness activities.",seneviratne,"The study aims to explore how individuals and the communities applied their knowledge in disaster preparedness before, during and after disaster. The study illustrates that knowledge management could be utilized by the community before, during and after a major disaster happened. The study shows that the community were able to apply the guidelines set by authorities during training and simulation. The study was able to explore the actual response by the people who experienced the disaster, thus having a better understanding of how people apply their knowledge. However, further improvement in the aspect of knowledge transfer is still necessary to have more participants and to encourage more communities to conduct disaster preparedness training and simulations. Since most of the information came from social media and mass media the use of technology should be adopted.","philippines ma. teodora e. gutierrez assistant professor iv industrial engineering program technological institute of the philippines quezon city, philippines dhorieg@gmail.com , ma.teodora.gutierrez@tip.edu.ph",

150,Success Model Of Cloud-Based Erp Using Six Sigma Method  (Case Study Of Pt Gamma – Food & Beverage Company In,"enterprise resource planning (erp) has become essential as a result of the acceleration of digitalization and the necessity of companies to integrate their business processes. erp has various models depending on the system scalability e.g. for small and medium entities (sme) and enterprises. pt gamma is one of the food and beverage chains with massive growth in indonesia which uses oracle netsuite (erp for sme). due to non-scalability, management decided to migrate to the enterprise erp not so long after usage. this research follows the roadmap of six sigma (dmai: define, measure, analyze and improve): (1) define the root cause of non-optimum implementation of erp using in-depth structured interviews with key users; (2) measure the sigma value based on projects document; (3) analyze and code interview result to define which critical success factors (csfs) are more dominants then distribute questionnaire (1-10 scale) to define the risk priority number (rpn); and (4) formulate solutions for dominant issues and ask key users for verification. sigma value showed 3.234 (moderate level) through calculations number of outstanding issues compared to all issues rose during january-august 2022. dominant factors identified by decision-makers are technological (71%) and organizational factors (19%), meanwhile supporting users are technological (42%), organizational (25%) and external party factors (17%). suggestions for management are the alignment of erp selection with the long-term company’s strategic vision, avoiding over- customization, performing regular checkpoints, and selecting the best consultant for re-migration. suggestions for further research are a longer research period and a more extensive method of six-sigma.","six sigma, money","and Future Research Based on the results of the evaluation of project documents (issue logs) during January-August 2022, PT Gamma's sigma value is moderate, namely at 3,243 because the company has minimized unnecessary customizations and is looking for workarounds if there are implementation limitations on the system. Based on the coding of interviews and questionnaires to measure the RPN index from the results of these interviews, the dominant factors in implementation are: (1) technological (2) organizational; and (3) external factors. Another factor that is also influential but not dominant is the human resource factor. The less influential factor is project management because both the decision makers and the main users feel that the existing project management is good, the communication between the consultant and PT Gamma is good and progress is updated regularly. PT Gamma chose a good decision to replace the current ERP system (Oracle NetSuite) with a Small Medium Entity (SME) business scale to an ERP system for a larger business scale of ERP (SAP Cloud Hana) after considering the return on investment (ROI) of both decisions. PT Gamma has also made a good decision to consider the selection of an enterprise ERP system according to the long-term needs and roadmap of the company (manufacturing company). SAP (more suitable for the manufacturing industry) than Oracle (more suitable for the service industry) after benchmarking against similar industries that have succeeded in using the system. PT Gamma chose to use a premium (first tier) consultant who is a top player in system migration and has realized the importance of qualified consultants in the successful implementation of the system. With this, risks such as re-migration due to changing consultants can be minimized. Based on interviews with decision makers and business users, the suggestions that can be given are: (1) conduct a detailed review for the blue print and consider future practicability for system customization; (2) coordinate with consultants to make detailed user guides/manual books according to the company's business processes; (3) conduct regular training whenever there is a new module to be implemented; (4) perform UAT (User Acceptance Test) using data as real as possible in the sandbox; (5) perform data cleansing before data is entered into production; and (6) conduct regular post implementation audits, to check whether the objective of a system modification is in accordance with the company's goals. Due to the limited time of the study and also the object of research, the researcher recommends further research to use DMAIC method – Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (not only DMAIC – Define, Measure, Analyze, and Improve) and extends the research period to get more robust research results.","indonesia) chrysan kirana and prio utomo department of technology management faculty of business universitas multimedia nusantara banten, indonesia chrysan.kirana@student.umn.ac.id, prio.utomo@umn.ac.id mohammad ichsan and julbintor kembaren business management binus business school bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia mohammad.ichsan@binus.edu, julbintor.kembaren001@binus.ac.id",

157,"A Mental Workload Assessment Of Jeepney Drivers On The  Tanay-Siniluan Route In Tanay, Rizal","this study shows the assessment of mental workload for jeepney drivers in tanay, rizal. this aims to observe the bottleneck and evaluate jeepney drivers’ circumstances that affect their mental workload and identify the factors influencing the mental workload of the jeepney drivers while on duty. the researchers applied slovin’s formula to get the correct sample size appropriate for the study. the mental workload of the jeepney drivers was assessed through the use of nasa-tlx (national aeronautics and space administration task load index) with six subscales such as mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration. the six-step measurements in nasa tlx were also used in this study, i.e., weighting, provision rating, scoring, weighted workload (wwl), weighted workload score, and scoring interpretation. in accordance with the gathered data, the research shows that the indicator physical demand (pd), with a score of 351.46, which is in the very high category on the scale, is the most dominant factor among all the other indicators, and frustration level, with a score of 98.33, will be the least contributor factor among the remaining five indicators. furthermore, the one-way analysis of variance (anova) was used by the researchers to compare the means of two or more independent variables and to see if there is statistical evidence that the related population means differ significantly. findings conclude that physical demand is the most prominent among all the indicators and the leading contributor to the mental workload of the jeepney drivers that drive trips along the tanay-siliuan route.",or jeeps,"This study was conducted by the researchers in order to provide a comprehensive assessment and measurement on the jeepney driver’s mental workload on Tanay-Siniluan route while they are on their duty and determine which factor poses as the major bottleneck in the day-to-day mental workload of the jeepney drivers. Thus, the correlation between the indicators and the average working hours shows statistically significant data with Effort (EF), Physical Demand (PD), and Performance (OP). The correlation matrix for mental workload indicators displays p-values less than 0.05 for three (3) indicators: effort (EF) and physical demand (PD), frustration level (FR) and temporal demand (TD), and frustration level (FR) and effort (EF). In accordance with the gathered data, the research shows that the indicator physical demand (PD) with the score of 351.46, which is on the very high category on the scale, is the apparently the most dominant factor among all the other indicators. This indicates that the volume and magnitude of the physical demand necessary to accomplish the task is very high and can be considered as the major contributor to the mental workload of the jeepney drivers on the mentioned scope. On the other hand, the frustration level with the score of 98.33, although still on the high category of the scale, has the lowest score and indicates that the insecurity, stress and irritation felt by the drivers upon the duration of the completion of task is the least contributor to the mental workload the jeepney drivers have experienced on performing their jobs.","ina karmela m. enriquez, joan valen l. lamadrid, john michael palomar, gwyneth kim f. reyes and ramon joshua e. roxas students, industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines – manila quiapo, manila, philippines mikenrique@tip.edu.ph, mjvllamadrid@tip.edu.ph, mjmrpalomar@tip.edu.ph, mgkfreyes@tip.edu.ph, mrjeroxas@tip.edu.ph janina elyse reyes professor, industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines – manila quiapo, manila, philippines jereyes.ie@tip.edu.ph",
158,Workload Assessment Of Online Classes On Teachers In,"the covid-19 pandemic drastically changed the education system and forced schools to adopt online teaching. however, it affects the teachers' workload globally. the study aims to assess the workload level of the 95 teachers at the technological institute of the philippines - manila during the online setup. using the nasa task load index assessment tool, the researchers could evaluate the different workload sources. the analysis of variance and pairwise correlation analysis were also used so that the researchers could determine if their demographic profile significantly affects their current workload and if the different sources have a significant relationship with each other. after this, the findings revealed an 80.86% on teachers' workload level, which is greater than workload acceptability. the current setup also demands good performance, intense thinking, and effort in the new learning setup. the researchers found that the result is still the same even though they are weighted based on their demographic profile. moreover, there is a low positive relationship between temporal and mental demand and a very low positive relationship between effort and performance. the relationships between effort and temporal demand, performance, and temporal demand also show a low negative correlation. at the same time, there is a very low negative relationship between frustration and physical demand, performance and mental demand, and physical and mental demand. the recommended practices for the school and teachers are also created to help them ease and reduce zoom fatigue without jeopardizing the quality of education they deliver to the students.","online classes, modular group, teachers","The result from the conducted survey reveals that the online classes caused the teachers at Technological Institute of the Philippines – Manila to have zoom fatigue due to several conferences, meetings, and classes conducted virtually. The online setup also makes most of them feel drained, burned out, frustrated, irritated, and stressed. It is due to their prolonged exposure to computers, poor internet connection, and too much workload, which are also the main contributors to the decrease in professors' performance in teaching virtually. Moreover, the study findings showed that the most challenging work aspect is checking requirements and meeting deadlines because they have many students and subjects to handle, especially when there are late submissions. It is hard for the teachers to check the students' papers online, causing them to have prolonged exposure to their computers. According to them, the Modular Group (MG) development is poor, and its schedule (6 weeks per modular group) is not enough for most college teachers to discuss all the lessons since it is fast-paced and has limited time. The current setup also requires more module preparation since they handle many subjects. Each has a different preparation, which is time- consuming, and needs to fit all the topics within the schedule of 6 weeks. This result supports why the present workload level (80.86%) of teachers in an online class is well beyond 50, which means it is less acceptable. Moreover, the study reveals that their online class demands good performance and intense mentality or thinking, significantly affecting their workload. Too much workload could also have a reverse effect on the teachers' performance and may affect their mental health. On the other hand, teachers' demographic profile does not have a significant impact on their workload. The correlation analysis also showed that the relationship between temporal and mental demand and between effort and performance indicates a weak to very weak positive relationship. In addition, there is a weak to very weak negative correlation between effort and temporal demand, performance and temporal demand, frustration and physical demand, performance and mental demand, and physical and mental demand. These results suggest that it will considerably enhance the TIP teachers' overall working routine and level of service by addressing the employees' mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration.","thea g. espinueva, vincent matthew f. labrador, angel shaine n. martin, christine joy v. olanosa and mary jo m. santiago industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines - manila mtgespinueva@tip.edu.ph, mvmflabrador@tip.edu.ph, masnmartin@tip.edu.ph, mcjvolanosa@tip.edu.ph, mmjmsantiago@tip.edu.ph janina elyse a. reyes industrial engineering department - adviser technological institute of the philippines - manila janina.elyse.reyes@gmail.com",
159,"Fundamental Analysis Of Cryptocurrency Price  Fluctuations: A Socio-Economic, Political And Psychological","cryptocurrency price fluctuations are very complicated to solve. some practitioners of cryptocurrency traders suspect that socio-political variables also often become the determinants of the price of this digital asset commodity. however, these assumptions are not certain. however, for traders this is actually an assumption to decide to invest in cryptocurrency assets. in other words, the subjective assumptions of traders have become a reference for dealing with price uncertainty in the future, while on the other hand cryptocurrency asset investment is a type of investment that is high risk and high return, with a very extreme level of price volatility. this condition confirms that forecasting future prices is not an easy matter. requires precise and scientific fundamental analysis. the novelty of this research is to present in detail the fundamental analysis, what factors determine the fluctuations in the price of cryptocurrency assets. where the results of this study aim to be an investment reference for market participants, including investors, especially for novice investors in investing, so as to minimize risk and get maximum profits. the method used in this study is descriptive analysis, with the n-vivo tools approach as an analytical tool. the data used is sourced from https://tradingeconomics.com/ which presents cryptocurrency price fluctuations and https://tradingeconomics.com/ which displays economic fundamental indicators. the results of this study found that the economic factors that determine cryptocurrency price fluctuations are determined by internal and external factors of an asset. internal factors include the amount of supply of crypto coins and tokens, the amount of market capitalization and the utility aspect of the blockchain technology owned. meanwhile, viewed from external factors, namely influenced by global macroeconomy conditions such as inflation trends, interest rates, unemployment rates, growth, investment, trade balance, debt, and economic recession, including fiscal and monetary policies. judging from the social variables, the popularity factor (hype), the strength of the community, the role of important figure influencers on a coin and cryptocurrency token are variables that affect price fluctuations. meanwhile, from a political approach, it is influenced by regulatory factors and deregulation of the legalization and prohibition of cryptocurrency adoption as well as global political instability factors that also affect cryptocurrency assets, for example the phenomenon of war, political sanctions, economic embargoes. finally, when viewed from a psychological approach, among others, caused by factors of fear and pesimism and the level of public trust and optimism in the market becomes a psychological sentiment for the level of price fluctuations. thus, it can be concluded that the dominance of economic factors on cryptocurrency price fluctuations is still very dominant in determining market prices, but these economic factors do not stand alone, but there are social, political and psychological factors that influence the cryptocurrency market price. the implication of this research is that market participants should be really careful and conduct in-depth research before making investment decisions, not just fear of missing out (fomo) buying cryptocurrency assets.","cryptocurrency, price, socio-economic, political","The results of this study found that the economic factors that determine cryptocurrency price fluctuations are determined by internal and external factors of an asset.

160,A Cross-National Examination Of The Newsvendor Behavior  Ümmühan Akbay,"previous behavioral operations studies have revealed that there is a significant amount of individuality and heterogeneity in the ordering decisions made by human decision makers. several studies investigated the effect of personal factors such as cognitive capabilities, personality traits and cultural norms on these decisions. in this study we conduct a simple lab experiment under newsvendor setting and investigate the effect of national differences in turkish and american decision makers. the experiment scenario is based on two different settings, namely buyback setting and an equivalent revenue sharing setting. specifically, under the buyback setting any leftovers are sold back to the supplier (which is represented by the computer) and under the revenue sharing setting for each sale made a revenue share is paid to the supplier. the data of the american subjects is obtained from the study conducted by katok and wu (2009) with the courtesy of the authors. the data of the turkish subjects is obtained through a new experiment designed to match the setting of the american study. our analysis shows that both groups of decision-makers under both settings place orders that are significantly lower than the optimal. for both cultural groups, under revenue sharing setting the subjects place lower orders than under buyback setting. though, the difference is on average. when we compare turkish and american decisions, we see that turkish subjects place lower orders than american subjects, yet the difference is again on average. we also compare both groups in terms of decision heuristics and find that demand chasing behavior is more prevalent in the turkish subjects.","newsvendor model, mean anchor, demand chasing","and Discussion In this study we compare the cross-national differences between Turkish and American decision makers under the newsvendor problem. Our analysis shows that there is in fact a significant cultural difference between the two nations that affect their ordering behavior. Considering Turkish culture is more conservative, and individualism is more prevalent in American culture, we conjecture that Turkish subjects would order smaller quantities and would be affected by decision heuristics more and we have found partial support for our hypotheses. Here, we must note that the two studies that are compared are conducted by different researchers following different procedures. Hence some of the results observed in the data can be attributed to the differences in the experimental procedures. What is equally likely is that the procedural differences may have hindered some other differences in the ordering behavior. Furthermore, the sample sizes are considerably smaller than the ones that are preferred by the most recent studies. This paper should be regarded as an exploratory call for further research into cross-cultural examination of the newsvendor behavior.

161,Can Hexaco-100 Personality Inventory Predict Newsvendor  Behavior?,"it has been well established by a plethora of experimental and empirical studies that human decision makers deviate from the newsvendor optimal order quantity. in this study we try to predict newsvendor behavior through an out-of- experiment personality inventory, namely hexaco-100. we consider a simple scenario of a perishable product with random consumer demand. the decision-makers determine the stock quantity for 40 consecutive periods. in this exploratory study we investigate if there is any correlation between order decisions or expected and realized profit and any of the personal characteristics measured by hexaco-100. our results show that order decisions are negatively correlated with social self-esteem and fairness. sincerity and fairness are positively correlated with expected profit and realized profit values. greed-avoidance is also positively correlated with realized profit. the experiment is based on low-profit margin setting and generally decision-makers order more than the optimal in this setting. hence smaller order decisions are better and lead to better profit values. combining this with the correlation results, we conclude that subjects with higher social self-esteem, sincerity, fairness and greed-avoidance scores make smaller order decisions and earn higher profit values. we also observe significant demand chasing behavior in the data and show that “dependence” and “sentimentality” have significant positive correlation with demand chasing behavior.","newsvendor model, personality traits","In this study we explore the correlation between newsvendor ordering behavior and Hexaco personality inventory. We show that order decisions are negatively correlated with fairness and social self-esteem scales. Expected profit is positively correlated with fairness, social self-esteem and additionally sincerity and honesty-humility as a whole facet. When we check the results for realized profit, we see that similar to expected profit it is positively correlated with sincerity, fairness, social self-esteem and honesty-humility facet. Additionally, greed-avoidance also positively impacts realized profit. Demand chasing behavior is prominent in the ordering decisions. And we see that there is significant and positive correlation between dependence and sentimentality scales and demand chasing behavior. Though small, we believe these findings are significant for the future research. A bigger study with larger sample sizes and both low and high profit margin settings can further investigate these connections we have revealed in this study and make an important contribution to the literature.","ümmühan akbay department of management, işık university, istanbul 34980, turkey ummuhan.akbay@isikun.edu.tr",

163,Effects Of Hexaco Personality Traits On Contracting  Behavior,"in this paper we investigate the correlation between hexaco-100 personality traits and supply chain contracting behavior. we consider a simple one-supplier-one-retailer supply chain under linear consumer demand. first the supplier determines their price share, then receiving this information, the retailer determines their price share and these price shares in total determine the selling price and thus the demand. in this exploratory study we investigate the relationship between the aforementioned contracting behavior and the personality traits measured by hexaco-100 inventory. our results show that organization and creativity have significantly positive correlation with supplier price share. in terms of retailer decisions, modesty significantly reduces price decisions whereas social-boldness significantly increases.","newsvendor model, personality traits","In this study we explored the connection between Hexaco-100 personality traits and supply chain pricing decisions. We have seen that parallel to earlier literature, Honesty- Humility scale leads to suppliers offering smaller prices to the retailers. Altruism has a similar effect on supplier decisions, as well.

164,Aligning Education And Workforce Training With Industry  Needs:  A Perspective On Human Capital Development,"the purpose of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of workforce training and education programmes. according to the global manufacturing index, there has been an increase in workforce aging within the manufacturing industry, which led to a decline in the high-tech skilled workforce. there is no doubt that the workforce is facing challenges of advancing technology, globalization, and demographics to name a few. equally, these forces are challenging institutions, organizations, and industries to respond by supporting the workforce to reskill and upskill constantly. as a result, there is a need to focus on articulating the skills, competencies, and capabilities that will be necessary in a near future, and to determine the effectiveness and flexibility of workforce training and education programmes to establish relevance in a way that addresses life-long learning and work, and that addresses long-term unemployment solutions. the findings are based on a recent literature review that focuses on workforce development and aligning education and training with industry needs. these findings suggest that aligning education and workforce training with industry needs is a worldwide challenge for both developed and developing economies to invest in human capital development, especially with the focus on the manufacturing sector workforce which has been in decline in the past few years. the impact on education, skills, and career development forces institutions to reflect on their education and training programmes as to whether they should respond to the national mandate. the findings will provide some insight to education and training institutions, organizations, industries, workers, students, and job seekers of what is underway and what skills will be needed more, as well as on how to build and sustain a skilled workforce and economic growth while strengthening career pathways and guiding skills attainment for the nation.","workforce training, digital areas","and future research The human capital development and workforce aging is a challenge globally despite all the interventions that other economies have been implementing. On the other hand, is digitalization era as well that forcing organizations, industries, and institutions to reposition their strategies to adapt quickly while attending to issues of under-over- qualified workforce. It is imperative that future research investigate there factors contributing to lack of workforce upskilling and retraining. Most importantly, how to bridge the gap of inequality income and the unethical business practices. The African business ethical systems require serious attention from the policymakers and the leaderships. Hence corruption, bribery, self-preservation hinders social economic development and economic growth. 1518","nelson sizwe madonsela faculty engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg p.o. box 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa corner kingsway and university road, auckland park, south africa nmadonsela@uj.ac.za","References

165,Critical Success Factors Addressing Covid-19 Pandemic:  Case Of Tawakkalna Application In Saudi Arabia,"this research aims to understand the critical success factors (csf) of saudi arabia (sa) in addressing the covid-19 pandemic. moreover, it proposes approaches to decline the bottlenecks of the current process of checking the health status in tawakkalna application (smartphone app help the authorities to check the vaccines status and infected people). three hundred eighty-four responses were collected via an electronic survey representing the population with a 5% confidence interval (ci). data were analyzed to determine participants' agreement and recurrence of the problems identified by observing the checkpoints in malls and their opinion about the suggested solution. the results show promising indicators as the practitioners express agreement on the bottlenecks identified and the proposed solution. in addition, the analysis showed that the participants had an average of 1.62 minutes to pass the checkpoint. yet, the expected average time after implementing the solution is 0.44 minutes. however, the current study did not study the effect of the solution on the cost. future work should investigate examining different facilities.","covid-19, pandemic, tawakkalna app","and Future Research All the factors mentioned in this paper are considered essential factors that should be considered in any future pandemics or similar circumstances. We believe that the factors mentioned, found, examined, and reviewed in this research helped in minimizing the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to the success story of addressing the virus in SA. The importance of the factors could also be seen and reflected through the made literature review, as shown in table 1. However, some other factors were not mentioned and could have an effect, and the mentioned factors are considered the most important ones based on the researcher's literature review. The C2 factor was examined since the researcher believes it is one of the most critical factors. Yet it needs a longer time to show the effect while it is a new approach. Hence, not many papers mentioned this factor. Based on the study of (47) Tawakkalna is the most effective app and easy to use among other apps developed by the SA government. Therefore, this paper examined many problems and areas of improvement in the app that affect people's daily lives. After observing and investigating the current process of examining malls visitors' health status on Tawakkalna, the process was found to have two main problems and activities that were considered non-value-added and bottlenecks processes. While a survey was used to confirm the data obtained by observing the process, the results showed a verification and a clear indicator that the problems were frequently happening and wasting and increasing the processing time. Furthermore, the survey results highlighted that the recommendation of applying a widget tool to the app is helpful and will make the process faster, less costly, and more efficient. An in-depth analysis of the effect of applying the solution on the cost should be made in future. In addition, future work should consider examining facilities other than malls since the same approach can be used to other facilities to have a better flow and a better process while reducing the waste of time and cost. All the mentioned suggestions could be utilized for different purposes other than Tawakkalna. The first alternative can be used to improve any process or event that is crowded; for example, it could be used for checking the tickets for football games, events, etc. As for the second alternative could also be utilized for different purposes such as linking the driving license with it, linking the national ID, etc.","dr. murad andejany associate professor college of engineering, department of industrial and systems engineering university of jeddah jeddah, saudi arabia mbazzar@uj.edu.sa iba sounni, abdulqader akbar, faisal alsubaie college of engineering, department of industrial and systems engineering university of jeddah jeddah, saudi arabia isounni0001.stu@uj.edu.sa; aakbar.stu@uj.edu.sa; falsubaie0038@uj.edu.sa",
166,Effect Of Deploying Routing And Facility Location Methods  On Power Transmission To Increase The Reliability Of The,"power generation, maintenance scheduling, and transmission have been a serious concern in the last few decades because of the high increase in power demand. large electricity producing company is providing electricity to the most populated areas through both connected and non-connected power plants (pps). this research discusses the most common issue of overhead power transmission lines in the western region. the main purpose of the study is to reduce the high-level power transmission cost by lessening the logistics expenses and by increasing the reliability of the power network. this problem is addressed by developing an algebraic framework for connecting different cities to a single loop having a minimum length between maintenance centers and setting up an appropriate number of teams. furthermore, research also considers certain constraints for a more consistent and cost-effective transmission mechanism. for this purpose, western region cities are selected and the mlip mechanism is used by feeding the matlog data for the current study. research has contributed by proposing a certain number of maintenance centers and an appropriate number of teams by deploying an algorithmic solution for the data analysis and results. the study found some constraints that need to be further investigated in future studies for more reliable results.","lrp, mlip, matlog, scp",1544,"power network and minimize the total logistics cost dr. abdullah m. alharbi assistant professor college of engineering, department of industrial and systems engineering, university of jeddah jeddah, saudi arabia amealharbi@uj.edu.sa","References

So, this research urges business actors to innovate again with more strategies innovative so that customer buying stakes can increase and influence purchasing decisions. The data analyzed shows no effect of green marketing influencing purchasing decisions through customer buying interest. This means that customers in making purchases even without the aspect of buying stake, customers can make purchasing decisions because of the green marketing aspect carried out by customers of Hotel Risata Bali Resort & Spa. This finding is like the results by Kusuma et al. (2017), where buying interest is proven not to be an intervening variable in mediating the relationship between green marketing and purchasing decisions. With this result, it is hoped that it can encourage these parties to consider other marketing strategies so that further customer buying interest can positively influence aspects that are applied by hotels or other businesses. The data analyzed shows that there is no influence of hotel atmosphere on purchasing decisions through customer buying interest. The results of this study are in line with research conducted by Yanti and Budiatmo (2020) that is not proven to be an intervening variable in mediating the relationship between hotel atmosphere and purchasing decisions. If observed from the direct effect, buying interest has no impact on purchasing decisions and the hotel atmosphere variable, which does not influence the decision. There is no direct influence of buying interest on buying decisions as an initial indication if customer buying interest at Risata Bali Resort & Spa does not significantly affect purchasing decisions and the natural result of the hotel atmosphere. 6. Conclusion Based on the research results, it can be concluded that green marketing and hotel atmosphere do not affect purchasing decisions through the customer buying interest at the Risata Bali Resort & Spa Tuban Bali Hotel. Thus, to improve purchasing decisions through customer buying interest, consistency is needed to understand customers that all activities carried out regarding green marketing and those carried out are genuinely implemented and friendly to the environment. In addition. the importance of the hotel atmosphere or the atmosphere of the domain. It is the image of a hotel in the minds of customers. When a good idea of a hotel already exists in customers’ minds, it will indirectly create buying interest, influencing customers in making a purchase decision. 6.1 Suggestion Based on the discussion raised in the previous section, in detail, positive suggestions can be made for developing understanding or practical needs. The results show that the green price is part of green marketing at Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotel. Does the primary focus that customer expect to be re-evaluated? This illustrates that most customers think that the price offered by Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotel is not comparable to the facilities and benefits. That can be felt related to the green marketing program or green hotel offered. Therefore, the Risata Bali Resort & Spa Hotel 1553","risata bali resort & spa tuban bali fahrizal ardianto, nur naninsih and hasniaty sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop makassar, indonesia fahrizal@yahoo.com, yahya.muhammad@yahoo.com, trimayacm11@gmail.com saiful irfan politeknik pelayaran surabaya, indonesia saiful.irfan76@gmail.com edi winata sekolah tinggi ilmu manajemen sukma medan, indonesia edwinsukma1960@gmail.com sutarno sutarno politeknik cendana, indonesia sutarno123@gmail.com asri sanusi politeknik lp3i medan, indonesia asrisanusi.lp3i@gmail.com","References

Besides functioning as a communication tool, smartphones can now be used as a tool in learning English. Through smartphones, students can access applications that can be used in learning English wherever and whenever they want, both in the classroom context and outside the classroom. Without realizing it, they have become autonomous learners when using smartphones to learn English. The smartphone is a tool to make it easier for them to learn English the way they want. Thus, it can be concluded that smartphones can be used as a means of autonomous English learning, therefore, Smartphone-Assisted Language Learning is a breakthrough for the autonomy of learning English.","santiana, fera sulastri, asri siti fatimah, abdul gafur marzuki, saidna zulfiqar bin-tahir and andi asrifan english education department, siliwangi university, west java, indonesia ferasulastri_90@gmail.com, sitifatimah@gmail.com, aasrifan@gmail.com",

180,Development Of Solar Power Generation Prediction System  Using Artificial Intelligence,"in this paper, although photovoltaic power generation has recently shown the most remarkable growth in the field of renewable energy worldwide, defects may occur if power outages or manufacturing facilities remain despite the increase in demand and demand for photovoltaic power generation. a machine learning algorithm that predicts the optimal development to solve these problems was obtained through experiments. by implementing the algorithm in the system, it will be able to contribute to reducing operating costs and popularizing it. neural network, svm, and deep learning are used as prediction algorithms, and the optimal algorithm is selected by using the root mean square error (rmse), which is the most used when identifying prediction errors. we propose a predictive model whose prediction rate is expanded by changing the algorithm structure and modifying constants. then, a defect detection system is developed by applying the predicted results to the domestic regional data.",solar power,"Due to their nature, photovoltaic power plants have many difficulties in early identification in the event of defects. To detect defects, the amount of power generation was predicted and the defect was determined through comparison with the actual measured amount of power generation. To select the optimal prediction algorithm, climate data and power generation data were normalized and applied to SVM, neural networks, and deep learning. As a result of using the RMSE value as an evaluation method of the algorithm, deep learning showed the best prediction rate. To apply this to domestic data, 280 days of data were obtained from the National Climate Data Center and the Jeju Botari Power Plant and used as learning data. The solar power defect detection system can contribute to the decline and popularization of solar power plants in Korea by predicting power generation using learned deep learning algorithms and determining defects using panel data.","lee ji yun, shin dong ho student and professor, my paul school 12-11, dowontongmi-gil, cheongcheon-myeon, goesan-gun, chungcheongbuk-do, republic of korea eavatar@hanmail.net",
181,Workers Clustering Based On Their Feeling Toward  Downward Social Comparison,"in a variety of manufacturing enterprises, there are still many tasks such as manual assembly that need to be processed by hand, it is as important as ever to improve workers performance. motivation is also a powerful energy that drives and excites workers, which results in their maximum performance. in order to improve workers’ performance, some factories have applied social comparison theory to prompt workers to compete against each other so as to raise workers’ motivation toward assembly tasks. as there is a lack of researches on the effect of social comparison on workers’ performance for assembly tasks, we have designed a laboratory experiment of cell production to investigate the effect of social comparison. we have built a structural equation model to clarify the psychological mechanism that the workers’ personality traits, mediated by their social comparison orientations, affect their response to the downward social comparison, and consequently have a significant influence on the workers’ motivation and performance. it is clear that the development of burnout or stress caused by the downward comparison has a negative impact on the workers’ performance. in this study we give a detailed examination on how did the workers feel toward the downward comparison. we designed a questionnaire, which has eight items and is conducted after the experiment. we carried out a correlation analysis between the workers’ feeling and their personality traits as well as social comparison orientations, and then conducted a cluster analysis of the workers based on their feeling toward downward social comparison. we intend to making the following contributions through these investigations: (1) as there is a lack of study to consider how did the workers feel toward the downward comparison, this study aims at filling this gap through conducting a questionnaire and providing detailed investigating results to clarify the individual difference in the feeling toward the downward comparison. (2) instead of explaining the psychological mechanism that personality traits affect the social comparison process, and consequently influence individual’s motivation and job performance, this study places our emphasis on figuring out how many workers feel uneasy or stressed about the downward social comparison, and how many workers didn’t respond to the downward social comparison. (3) although many companies have applied the social comparison theory to motivate the workers for improving their performance, almost all of the companies conduct social comparisons according to the supervisors’ experiences or intuitions. this paper intends to provide some key points for practitioners to conduct social comparisons more effectively.","social comparison, motivation",,"yanwen dong cluster of science and technology fukushima university fukushima city, japan dong@sss.fukushima-u.ac.jp qin zhu professor school of public policy and administration nanchang university nanchang, china zhuqin@ncu.edu.cn",

183,Building Models To Predict The Diagnosis Of Emergency,"there are circumstances in which patients require immediate medical care. usually, hospitals have a specialized unit ready to take care of emergencies such as: strokes, heart attacks, sepsis, severe wounds, and other medical conditions that are also classifies as emergencies. this research compared models based on artificial neural networks (ann) to predict the diagnosis of patients received at the emergency department (ed) of a public hospital. the research was carried out following a classic 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. during the analysis, patient records collected by ed personnel during 2020 were thoroughly reviewed and preprocessed. during the design, some of the records were selected and divided into several subsets following specific criteria. each subset was a set of independent variables used as input to build a prediction model. technical considerations relate to the artificial neural networks (ann) such as the number of hidden layers and the number of epochs, batch size, size of the training and test set, and size of the validation dataset were also defined at these point. the phases of construction and the validation are carried out entirely using the weka 3.9.6. numerous experiments, trial and error adjustments, and replications were necessary to produce the results shown in this article. for the purposes is the present work around 15,000 records were considered. the complete dataset was divided in two parts: 80% for training and test, and the remaining 20% for validation. the approach to predict the patient diagnose considered the construction of anns with of independent variables. during the construction several configurations of anns were tried to achieve better results. only the records allocated for training and test dataset is used during the construction. the performance of the proposed models was measured in terms of the rate of correct predictions made with records allocated for validation. the experimental result revealed that, depending on the number of diagnoses, the values of the target class, the proposed models were able to predict correctly between 55% and 85% of the cases. in conclusion, ann-based models can help predict ed patients’ diagnosis with a reasonable degree of certainty. however, the success of the model depends greatly on the numbers of values that the target class has.","machine learning, supervised leaning","Data collected during 2020 allowed researchers to have a valuable insight of daily operations at an ED. The application of adequate tools and techniques helped obtain valuable information than can be used support the decision making and to improve the management of the existing resources. Data preprocessing and the initial analysis revealed that a significant number of the ED records were associated to a rather small number of all possible diagnose. In fact, during 2020, the five most recurrent diagnose covered almost 14% of all ED records. ANN-based prediction models offer and interesting alternative to support management tasks such as planning and scheduling. Although counting with a rather large dataset, the models proposed in this investigation intended to minimize the use of data and processing time. Therefore, only a fraction of ED database was used. In total, only six attributes were considered to predict patient diagnose. The transformation of the attribute Reason for visit from a string to a vector of words supplied extra pieces of information by means of creating additional attributes that helped construct more complex models. When working with machine learning algorithms, instead of simply holding out part of the data it is advisable to apply a cross-validation scheme to minimize the influence of the dataset split up. Averaging several results is better than having only one result. Furthermore, running replications helped reduce the bias caused by the fold partitioning. Besides that, having a set of unknown data only for validation helped confirming whether the models could generalize properly or not. Experimental work confirmed that those models with a smaller set of target class values produced higher correct prediction rates. For example, with five class values the correct prediction rate was over 80%. In contrast, with 20 class values the rate was barely over 50%. Another interesting fact is the consistency in the experimental results obtained when applying a cross-validation scheme, a validation set with unknown data, and a battery of replications. In particular, the predictions made with unknown data proved that at least the model with 5 class values was able to generalize well. Finally, correct prediction rates and confusion matrices suggested that the ANN-based models with 5 and 10 class values can predict ED patient diagnose with reasonably good results. 1677","carlos hernández, jaime castillo departamento de procesos industriales universidad católica de temuco temuco, chile carlos.hernandez.zavala@uct.cl, jcastill@uct.cl","References

184,Developing Models Based On Machine Learning Algorithms  To Estimate Medical Staffing Needs At Intensive Care Units,"generally, hospitals and health centers have a specialized area called intensive care unit (icu) aimed to provide treatment for people who are extremely ill. an icu is staffed with highly trained professionals who operate advance equipment. patients are referred to icus when they have a condition that cannot be treated in a regular hospital room. for example: after being in a serious car accident, after having a heart attack or stroke, when suffering a serious infection such as pneumonia, or after having major surgery. the present research focusses in the development of prediction models based on machine learning algorithms to help planning and allocating medical staff at an icu. the research was carried out following a classic 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. in the analysis, independent variables such as patient’s age, gender, reason for visit, and arrival mode are identified. data are then pre-processed and prepared for the following phases. specialize software packages for data mining and machine learning were selected for the investigation. most of the investigation’s activities were planned at this point. during the design, different subsets of the independent variables were selected to be build prediction models. the size of the training and test set as well as the size of the validation set were also defined here. the phases of development and validation were carried out entirely using the software weka 3.9.6. by means of executing a battery of experiment and “trial and error” adjustments the prediction models were completed. to accomplish the goals of this research, thousands of records collected from a public hospital were considered. the dataset was divided in a part for training and test (80%) and another part for validation (20%). the approach to predict the medical specialty require for the arriving patients considered the development of models based on artificial neural networks and decision trees. in all cases, instead of a simple hold-out, a 10-fold cross- validation scheme was applied. results showed that, in general, prediction models with fewer classes generate higher rates of correct predictions and, therefore, they can be more useful when planning and allocating medical staff at an icu. even though correct prediction rates fluctuate significantly from one model to another, between 80% and 83%, some of the proposed models are reliable. in conclusion, results showed that prediction models based on machine learning algorithms can help planning and managing the need for professionals and support staff at icu. the research might help understand the benefits of using machine learning in hospitals and health centers.","prediction model, machine learning",ICU database with patient records gathered during 2020 provided a valuable insight of the daily operation at a public healthcare hospital. 1690,"carlos hernández and dafne lagos departamento de procesos industriales universidad católica de temuco temuco, chile carlos.hernandez.zavala@uct.cl, dlagos@uct.cl","References

185,Applying Prediction Models Based On Ensemble Machine  Learning Algorithms To Estimate Resource Requirements At,"either a high complexity hospital or a smaller clinic, healthcare centers have to withstand the constant pressure of the incoming flow of new patients. while some patients require a simple medical procedure, others will need further examination and probably have remain in observation for some time. this situation is particularly complicated in times of sanitary crisis. since the infrastructure, supplies, and medical staff are limited resources, there is a real need for utilizing them efficiently. this research is focused on the use of ensemble machine learning algorithms to develop models for predicting the destination of patients who are discharge after a stay at an intensive care unit (icu). the investigation was carried out following a 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. during the analysis, an extensive review and preprocessing of patient records collected from a public hospital was carried out. then, during the design several ensemble machine learning algorithms were compared and selected for the investigation. to name a few: linear regression, decision tree, stacking, bagging, and random forest. the following phases, development and validation were completed using data processing software. in all models proposed here, instead of a simple hold-out, a 10-fold cross-validation scheme was applied. for the purposes of this research, twenty thousand patient records collected in 2020 were considered. the complete dataset was split in two subsets. one subset for training and test with 80% of the data and another dataset for validation with the remaining 20%. during the development of the models, only data for training and for test were used. the validation data were used only to measure the models performance with unseen data. results revealed that regardless the size of the training and test dataset, there was a notorious consistency in the correct prediction rates. the proposed ensemble scheme made of three base learner plus a meta algorithm, systematically leaded to correct prediction rates close to 82%. in conclusion, the proposed models proved that, with based on the existing data, high rates of correct prediction can be achieved when an ensemble scheme is used. in this case, with a reasonable certainty, it was possible to predict whether a patient was going to be referred to another unit or sent home after his or her stay at icu.",machine learning,"The extensive ICU database allowed researchers to gain a good understanding of a critical hospital unit. The application of adequate tools and innovative techniques can certainly be of great help during the decision making process by means of revealing more improvement opportunities. It always interesting to see how once and again the principle of Pareto is present. During the preprocessing of data, it was verified that almost 70% of all hospitalization were associated to only 20% of all medical specialties. Decision making support tools based on techniques and software packages to extract valuable information from large repositories of data, undoubtedly are an alternative that deserve proper attention. Although counting with a rather large database, the proposed models minimized the data requirements and yet delivered promising results. In total, eleven fields were considered to develop the prediction models. The transformation of the field Reason for visit from a string to a vector of words provided additional pieces of information that helped develop more complex models. In general, the use of an ensemble scheme to combine the features of different learning algorithms produces better results than the use single algorithms predicting alone. When working with machine learning schemes, it is advisable to apply a cross-validation to minimize the influence of the dataset split up instead of simply holding out part of the data. Averaging several results will be better than having only one result. Furthermore, running replications help reduce the bias caused by the fold partitioning. Additionally, having a set of unknown data only for validation help confirming whether the models can generalize properly or not. The experimental result showed that having larger datasets does not necessarily lead to better results in terms of the rate of correct predictions. Either with four or sixteen thousand records, the correct prediction rate fluctuated barely around 82%. The consistency found in the prediction rates obtained with a cross-validation scheme on training and test data, with a set of unknown validation data, and with set with unknown data proved that the proposed models were able to generalize properly. 1702","healthcare centers carlos hernández and paola leal departamento de procesos industriales universidad católica de temuco temuco, chile carlos.hernandez.zavala@uct.cl, pleal@uct.cl","References

186,Predicting The Number Of Emergency Department Patients  With Forecasting Models Based On Machine Learning,"an emergency department (ed) is a specialized area where patients usually arrive in critical condition and require immediate care. medical staff know that in these cases reacting quickly is crucial for saving patients’ life. since supplies, personnel and infrastructure are limited resources, the efficiency in their use is fundamental to operate adequately. therefore, planning well in advance is fundamental to optimize the use of the existing resources. this research presents an interesting approach to forecast the number of patients received at the ed of a public hospital by means of implementing and comparing model bases in machine learning algorithms. this investigation was carried out following a 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. during the phase of analysis, the ed database with recorded collected during 2020 was reviewed and preprocessed. data were prepared and organized to show number of patients visiting ed every day. during the phase of design, machine learning algorithms for forecasting were analyzed and compared. among others: linear regression, artificial neural network, machine support vectors, and gaussian methods. the development and the validation phases were carried out entirely using the data processing software weka 3.9.6 with the forecasting package version 1.1.27. in total, over seventy thousand records corresponding to ed visits occurred during 2020 were used in the investigation. data were divides in two datasets: one for building forecasting models and another one for comparing predicted and actual values. six forecasting horizons were study: 60, 45, 30, 15, 10, and 6 days. for each horizon four machine learning algorithms were used to predict the number of ed visits. to evaluate and compare predictions, the usual error metrics were considered: mae, mse, rmse, and mape. forecasting results revealed notorious differences in the accuracy of the predicted values. although no big differences are noticeable when forecasting short periods, the prediction error is considerable when forecasting a long period of 60 days. in this case, mape fluctuated between 39% and 16% depending on the algorithm. when forecasting short periods, for instance 5 days, mape varied between 17% and 14%. in conclusion, experimental results showed that ml-based forecasting algorithms can be used to predict the number of ed visits with accuracy even when with long forecasting horizons. the application of such approach might be of great help to estimate resource requirements and to support decision making.","demand forecasting, linear regression","ED database is an extensive collection of data from which valuable information about daily operations can be extracted. Since the efficiency in the use of limited resources is crucial for the public health system, it is worthwhile exploring new approaches, methodologies and tools to help support planning and managing tasks. Monthly number of ED patients revealed the presence of trends, seasonality, and randomness. All of which is an obstacle for any prediction attempts. Contrary to classical and well-studied approaches, this works was focused in the use of machine learning instead. The idea was simple, splitting up the data leaving a fraction for building forecasting models and the part for comparing predicted and actual values. Four algorithms were used to forecast and four error measures were used to compare results. In all cases, six forecasting horizons were compared. Experimental work showed that for short forecasting periods all algorithms were able to forecast accurately and MAPE fluctuating between 14% and 17%. In the case of long forecasting periods, for instance 61 days, predicted values were usually far from actual values. However, values predicted with ANN and SVM were clearly closer to actual values than those ones predicted with models based either on linear regression or Gaussian processes. Here MAPE fluctuated between 13% and 57%. Another interesting fact is the consistency in the accuracy of the prediction with the SVM-based model regardless the magnitude of the forecasting horizon. Other models’ performances seemed to be affected by the extension of the forecasting period . Finally, this word showed that some forecasting models based on machine learning algorithms delivers good results even when the dealing with long forecasting horizons. The consistency in the accuracy of the predictions obtained with a SVM-based model indicates that the proposed approach can be useful to predict the number of ED patients and therefore, it could be used to support planning and managing tasks.","carlos hernández, paola leal departamento de procesos industriales universidad católica de temuco temuco, chile carlos.hernandez.zavala@uct.cl, pleal@uct.cl",

188,Design Of Preventive Healthcare Services: A Brief Review  Mumtaz Karatas And Levent Eriskin,"the main purpose of preventive healthcare services is to minimize the risk of serious health conditions and increase the probability of early detection and diagnosis of serious illness. therefore, the effectiveness and efficiency of a preventive healthcare service design play a crucial role in increasing the level of participation in such services. additionally, the recent covid-19 outbreak once again showed that implementing an effective preventive healthcare service design can make substantial savings on healthcare expenditures while promoting the welfare of society. preventive healthcare-related location studies are relatively young compared to other studies considering other healthcare facility location studies. although academic research on determining preventive healthcare facilities dates back to the early 2000s, there exists a body of literature that can be a review study topic. hence, in this study, we present a brief review of the literature that considers location and design problems related to preventive healthcare facilities. we also discuss the basic features of the preventive healthcare service design problem and solution approaches proposed.",facility location,"The ultimate goal of this study is to introduce readers to the most prominent preventive healthcare service design and facility location problems. Although the literature on this topic is sparse, we encountered several studies published in the last two decades. Our review also revealed that although the problem investigated in this review is in the operations research arena for nearly two decades, it is gaining interest in the last 5 years. This is probably due to the social awareness on the benefit of using preventive and screening services as well as the lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic. The need for designing more efficient and effective healthcare systems and resource allocation plans led to an increased number of studies. We hope that this review can be a useful and inspirational source for further research on preventive healthcare facility location problems. Our study reveals that one of the common features of these studies is that they are all discrete location models, i.e., facilities can be established only at candidate demand points (locations). Secondly, most studies only focus on the travel time and waiting time and their relationship in the mathematical formulations developed. One reason for that might be the simplicity of this assumption. However future studies could incorporate other factors such as service quality, service cost, parking time and availability, etc. Another future research direction can be the use of stochastic user equilibrium. Finally, the location and routing of mobile screening and preventive test centers could be a topic of research for future studies.

189,Emergency Medical Service Station Location-Allocation And  Sizing Problem For Istanbul,"emergency medical services (emss) provide necessary urgent medical care and transport patients to the nearest medical center for treatment. due the to nature of the service, response time is of utmost importance for reducing mortality and alleviating human suffering. moreover, the availability of service at the time of the call is another planning factor that should be considered. in fatal traffic accidents, for instance, the probability of death increases dramatically as a function of response time. therefore, locating ems stations and allocating ambulances to emergency calls requires careful and analytical planning. in this study, we aim to determine the locations and sizes of ems stations in istanbul. we formulate a multi-objective integer programming model that finds optimal locations of service stations and the number of ambulances to be stationed while satisfying response time and availability constraints. our model also addresses allocation decisions where each demand point (subdistrict) is allocated to an ems station that will ensure predetermined service levels in terms of response time and availability. in order to determine the number of ambulances to be located at a station, historical ems calls are analyzed. to ensure a particular level of availability, the problem is formulated as a q-coverage problem where the total number of ambulances to be stationed at an ems station is driven by the demand (ems calls) of subdistricts that are covered. the objectives of the model are to minimize the total cost of opening ems stations and to minimize the total demand weighted distance of subdistricts to ems stations. we solve the problem for the anatolian side of istanbul.",facility location,"In this paper, we aim to solve the EMS station location-allocation and sizing problem for the Anatolian side of Istanbul. Establishing an efficient EMS system is of utmost importance for saving lives and alleviating human suffering. The time between an emergency call being received and an ambulance arriving at the location of the incident is critical because the probability of death increases dramatically as a function of response time. Therefore, locating EMS stations and allocating ambulances to emergency calls requires careful and analytical planning. To that end, we formulate a multi-objective integer programming model that finds the optimal locations of EMS stations and the number of ambulances to be stationed while satisfying response time and availability constraints. EMS location-allocation and sizing problem inherently involves multiple objectives to consider. Hence, we seek to minimize the total cost of establishing ESM stations which comprises the cost of opening (installing) EMS stations and the acquisition cost of ambulances while minimizing the total demand weighted distance of subdistricts to EMS stations. Having two conflicting objectives to optimize, we adopted a posteriori approach and generated a representative set of non-dominated solutions which constitute the Pareto frontier. In this regard, we presented comprehensive solution information to the DM to provide adequate decision support for selecting the most preferred solution among the five Pareto-optimal solutions. There are two research directions for future work. Firstly, our model does not consider uncertainty within emergency call demand. However, the demand for EMS is inherently uncertain and varies with respect to the time of the day. Therefore, a stochastic or robust modeling framework that also addresses operational decisions such as relocation and dispatching can be utilized to hedge against uncertainty. For this purpose, historical data should be obtained and analyzed thoroughly. Secondly, other preference elicitation approaches such as a priori and interactive methods can be used to elicit DM preference structure","levent eriskin and mumtaz karatas department of industrial engineering national defence university, turkish naval academy istanbul, turkiye leriskin@dho.edu.tr, mkaratas@dho.edu.tr",

Therefore, the study contributes to relevant existing theory and practice by advancing a proactive possible solution to the short term consumer interest rate conundrum. The results basically advocate for market driven solutions such as addressing the interest rate cost drivers to market problems unlike policy regulatory measures which are based on the inadequate reductionist methodology. Therefore, the results suggest the foregoing approach to be the most appropriate approach as suggested by the positive suitability, acceptability and feasibility assessment feedback from key stakeholders.","henry lukama chikweti and lubinda haabazoka graduate school of business, university of zambia, zambia chikwetihenry@gmail.com , lhabazoka@yahoo.com jackson phiri school of computer science, university of zambia, zambia jackson.phiri@cs.unza.zm",
191,A Study Of The Effects Of Cryptocurrency Usage On Money  Laundering And Tax Compliance In Zambia,"cryptocurrency usage has been on a rise in zambia and other countries. many concerns have been raised regarding the bad vices that have emerged as a result of cryptocurrency usage. however, little evidence exists on the effects that cryptocurrency usage has on money laundering and tax compliance in zambia. this study sought to assess the relationship between cryptocurrency usage, money laundering and tax compliance in zambia. the study was conducted on the fic, dec and zra for in-depth interviews and 106 survey respondents consisting of employees of one of the commercial banks in zambia. the study adopted a mixed approach, with the utilization of an interview guide to collect information through an in-depth interview with the key informants and a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data from the survey respondents. correlation and regression analyses were used to establish the relationship among the variables of the study. the results of the study showed that cryptocurrency usage has a positive but insignificant effect on money laundering and negative but insignificant effect on tax compliance in zambia. the study further established that a strong negative correlation exists between money laundering and tax compliance in zambia. perceptions from the respondents were that an increase in cryptocurrency activities, due to unregulated crypto environment, would increase money laundering activities. this is only supported by the observed sign of the correlation coefficient. in addition, since no legal framework has been put in place to guide the legal jurisdictions and operation of digital assets, levels of none tax compliance would become high in zambia and this is equally supported by the observed sign of the correlation coefficient. the study has identified other effects such as fraud, terrorism, interfere with consumer protection and increase in the scamming levels in association with cryptocurrency usage. prevention of these vices was pointed to the centralization and unifying the cryptocurrency transaction by the central bank. the study thus recommends that zambia should consider investing in the investigation of how digital transactions can operate in order to quicken the regulation process of crypto operation. the government should also consider setting up an institution that can be strictly responsible for monitoring and regulating digital assets transactions in order to focus resources in the formulation of legal frameworks.","cryptocurrency, money laundering, bankers, politicians","and Recommendations 6.1 Summary of findings The overall objective of this study was to assess the relationship that Cryptocurrency usage has with Money laundering and tax compliance in Zambia. The study was conducted on one of the commercial banks in Zambia with a sample size of 116 employees of that commercial bank. 91 out of the 116 respondents appeared to have knowledge on Cryptocurrency and so they constituted the sample of interest and the results presented were based on the 91 respondents. Evidence from the correlation analysis revealed that there is no significant correlation between Cryptocurrency usage and money laundering in Zambia. Further, no significant correlation was observed between Cryptocurrency usage and tax compliance in Zambia. However, the correlation coefficients have a positive sign for the Cryptocurrency usage – money laundering relationship and negative sign for the Cryptocurrency usage – tax compliance relationship. Further evidence was observed from regression analysis for the cryptocurrency usage – money laundering – tax compliance relationship. The results show that Cryptocurrency usage has an insignificant effect on both money laundering and tax compliance in Zambia. 6.2 Conclusion Despite the insignificant effects, there have been many concerns highlighted by the respondents regarding the use of Cryptocurrency. These concerns are around money laundering and none-tax compliance.

Managers at major conglomerates find themselves asking where their goods are, are their goods on time, how much they have in inventory, and how much safety stock they have. End-to-End Enterprise Visibility allows these Supply Chain Managers to answer these questions and more in a tenth of the time. Visibility gives these managers unparalleled access to data across an organization and allows them to ensure they have complete and accurate information truly. This enables SCMs to communicate and collaborate effectively to beat stakeholder and customer expectations, engineer better product offerings, and optimize business processes to build value and support institutional goals. SCMs can then review and leverage the data End-to-End Visibility provides with Descriptive Analytic technologies. Descriptive Analytic technologies are tools that aggregate data and apply statistics and modeling to create reports depicting an institution's past and current data. That said, the greater an organization's visibility, the more accurate and complete data a Descriptive Analytic software can utilize to create more strategically useful insights. These improvements and scalebacks can be applied anywhere within an organization to improve everything from cash flow management to NPI and the development of future products. Furthermore, more recent advances in Descriptive- Analytic Technology have enabled Supply Chain Managers with the opportunity to apply multiplex mathematical models and Machine Learning to copious amounts of historical data to perform predictive analytics. This aids Supply Chain Managers in predicting near-future events, thus providing them with further insight into possible next steps their organization could take to ensure future success.","mohamed awwad industrial and manufacturing engineering department california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa kazim@calpoly.edu, zawagone@calpoly.edu, sgiangre@calpoly.edu, wemarque@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",

This has resulted in greater costs for products, as well as increased transportation costs. Some of the main problems are the lack of available chassis, which negatively affects the possible movement of containers, as well as too many empty containers and a lack of truck drivers, which decreases the number of possible products that can be transported on land. In addition to this, there are a plethora of other issues, including but not limited to a lack of warehouse space. Possible solutions caused by the lack of chassis could be to vertically stack more than the allowed two pallets on each chassis. This would possibly decrease safety, but if done well and safely would increase the possible amount of work done by each chassis. This would also require legal intervention. Additionally, we could vertically stack cargo more often to decrease space utilization as well as use empty land to store cargo. Many of these solutions would require modifications to current laws. Other solutions involve hiring more workers, such as truck drivers, to increase the amount of possible work done, as well as expanding the operating hours of the port. In conclusion, many of our solutions involve working through certain regulations to allow us to move and store cargo more efficiently by increasing the workforce and time spent operating.","industrial and manufacturing engineering department california polytechnic state university san luis obispo, ca 93407, usa tdeis@calpoly.edu, zatkins@calpoly.edu, kgupta06@calpoly.edu, dddam@calpoly.edu, mawwad@calpoly.edu",

195,Quantification Of The Strategic Fit Between Process Choice  Criteria And Production Systems,"manufacturing systems are the mode through which organizations can achieve competitive advantage by producing products with the desired wants. hence, selecting a manufacturing system is one of the critical decisions in formulating a manufacturing strategy. currently, there exist four traditional production systems (tps) (i.e. job-shop, batch-shop, mass, and continuous) and additive manufacturing system (ams), which appeared as the alternative for tps during industry 4.0 era. different process choice criteria (pcc) need to be considered while determining a suitable system from five or a hybrid (ams + tps) configuration. this research has developed a framework comprising delphi, voting analytical hierarchy process (vahp), and machine learning (ml) based bayesian network (bn) method techniques for selecting a suitable production system by quantifying the strategic fit between pcc and production systems. initially, a pertinent body of knowledge is researched to identify the critical pcc and further validated by industry experts through delphi. this results in retaining thirty-six pcc. the relative importance of an individual criterion concerning a particular production system is computed using vahp in the second stage to understand the alignment of pcc in different production systems for exhibiting the congruence between pcc and manufacturing systems (tps and ams). total 22 cases falling under different production systems are evaluated for strategic fit computation to understand the benchmarked values of pcc in each of the production system environments (tps and ams). finally, a suitable production system is selected for a special case of hydraulic and pneumatic valve manufacture using a bayesian network method. the findings offer critical insights into the different pcc and their level-of-fit in tms and ams, which can assist researchers and practitioners in evaluating a suitable manufacturing system for an organization using identified pcc.","production systems, strategic fit, delphi",,"vishwas dohale research fellow operations and supply chain management national institute of industrial engineering (nitie) mumbai – 400 087, india vishwas.dohale.2017@nitie.ac.in business analyst goldratt consulting, india vishwas.dohale@goldrattgroup.com",
196,How North Sumatra Is Dealing With Covid-19  (An Overview Of Communications Management),the coronavirus disease-19 (covid-19) cases that occurred in north sumatra continued to show an increase from time to time. this pandemic has an impact on the weakening of the economy in north sumatra as well as the increasing unemployment rate. this condition is exacerbated by the low level of public trust in the government in handling covid-19. the purpose of this study was to analyze the handling of the covid-19 in north sumatra which was carried out by the local government and the covid-19 handling task force. the analysis was carried out using a communication management approach. this study recommends the need for government intervention on the people's economy through the formation of a task force at the environmental level which is the lowest part of the government structure.,,"In the perspective of communication management, the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in North Sumatra is indicated to have problems in five aspects that are reviewed in this study. This situation arises as a result of the pandemic's impact, which has resulted in an increase in the number of unemployed people and a falling economy. The impact of the Covid-19 epidemic is expected to become a frequent occurrence in Indonesia because it affects many areas of the country. Because the pandemic has hit nationally, the central government has also implemented various structural policies down to the provincial level. The North Sumatra Provincial Government with the Covid-19 task force in North Sumatra is an extension of the central government in handling this pandemic.","dedi sahputra, taufik wal hidayat, ilma saakinah tamsil, and ara auza communication science study program, faculty of social and political sciences, universitas medan area, north sumatera, indonesia dedi_sahputra@staff.uma.ac.id, taufikwalhidayat@staff.uma.ac.id, ilmapayi@gmail.com, ara@staff.uma.ac.id, bahrum jamil, beltahmamero simamora, and marlina deliana public administration study program, faculty of social and political sciences, universitas medan area, north sumatera, indonesia bahrumjamil@staff.uma.ac.id, beltahmamero@staff.uma.ac.id, marlinadeliana@staff.uma.ac.id",
197,"Government Policy On Tourism Management In Situngkir  Village, Pangururan District, Samosir Regency, North","this study aims to determine government policies on tourism management in situngkir village, pangururan district, samosir regency, north sumatra, indonesia. the importance of this research is because situngkir village is included in the tourism trajectory of lake toba and situngkir indah beach is one of its mainstay tourist destinations. of course, the existing government policies need to pay attention to the development of tourism in this village. one of them is the toba batak traditional house which can become an icon for the indah situngkir orphanage, for then those along the road to tourist attractions, there are several that have been revitalized by government assistance. the type of research in this study is qualitative with a descriptive approach. data collection techniques in this study are observation, interviews and documentation. observations were carried out directly at the research site by observing the subject and object of the study. direct data collection was carried out through in-depth interviews with informants, namely village officials, inn owners, food and souvenir traders, cleaners, parking and security guards, inn employees and visitors. documentation is done by recording and documenting the subject and object of research. based on the results of the study, that in situngkir village, there was already a government policy which was then carried out by the village government in supporting tourism, namely the existence of government assistance to revitalize the batak toba traditional house which was along the road to pantai indah situngkir. based on the government regulation of the republic of indonesia no. 72 of 2005 concerning villages, article 15, that the role of the village government is not only to carry out village autonomy but also to manage the potential of the existing village so that there is prosperity in the community. thus, guidance to the community for the advancement of tourism is also carried out, maintaining the relationship between the village government and the owners of capital for the progress of development and the economy of the community in tourism areas. homestay that uses traditional houses as a place to live for tourists (generally foreign tourists) is an effort to preserve traditional houses so that they are increasingly known in the international arena and an effort to preserve and promote the culture of the local community.","government policy, management, tourism, destinations, development","The influence on tourism with the existence of government ecology in Situngkir Village, namely the existence of policies that pay attention to the environment in tourism development, Then there is a cooperation between the village government and the community as well as the respective functions of the community and village government in the advancement of tourism, the community also has the function of policy the. Not only that, ecologically, the village government system in Situngkir Village is very influential on tourism, this is indicated by the existence of a village fund policy that includes advanced tourism programs in its decisions. The role of the village government is very important in developing the potential of Pasir Putih Parbaba Beach, namely as a party that has authority in the regulation, provision, and allocation of various infrastructures related to tourism needs. Not only that, but the regional head is also responsible for determining the direction of tourism travel. The relationship between capital owners and the government in building projects is not good if the projects built are outside the agreement. For example, the construction of the Jitty pier is a problem because the owner of the capital builds a project outside of an agreement with the village government.","sumatra, indonesia agung suharyanto, bebby masitho batubara and adam public administration study program, faculty of social and political sciences, universitas medan area, indonesia agungsuharyanto@staff.uma.ac.id, beby@staff.uma.ac.id, adam@staff.uma.ac.id armansyah matondang and syafruddin ritonga communication science study program, faculty of social and political sciences, universitas medan area, north sumatera, indonesia armansyah@staff.uma.ac.id, syafruddin@staff.uma.ac.id, m. citra ramadhan and anggreni atmei lubis faculty of law, universitas medan area, north sumatera, indonesia citra@staff.uma.ac.id, anggreni@staff.uma.ac.id",

The unique thing about the brawl between residents in the city of Belawan is that it has been recorded that this event has been going on for about 40 years continuously and is passed down from parents to their children. The security forces seemed powerless to solve this case, causing a growing issue among the people of the city of Belawan that the brawl was masterminded by the drug mafia as a diversion every time drugs entered through the sea in Belawan Port. The issue of the drug mafia behind the brawl between residents is also a fact that has occurred in the community of Belawan city. However, in the news they provide, the mass media only focus on reporting on brawl events without touching on the issue of the existence of the drug mafia, which is also a fact that occurs in the community of Belawan city. In other words, there is a focus bias between the mass media and the public in seeing the reality of the brawl between residents in the city of Belawan. 5.","dedi sahputra and rehia isabella karenina barus communication science study program, faculty of social and political sciences, universitas medan area, north sumatera, indonesia dedi_sahputra@staff.uma.ac.id and rehia@staff.uma.ac.id bahrum jamil, agung suharyanto and nina angelia public administration study program, faculty of social and political sciences, universitas medan area, north sumatera, indonesia bahrumjamil@staff.uma.ac.id, agungsuharyanto@staff.uma.ac.id, and ninaangelia@staff.uma.ac.id niarita bukit management department, faculty of economic, universitas sisingamangaraja xii tapanuli, north sumatera, indonesia niaritabukit@gmail.com agus mulia agency for language development and cultivation regional agency for language in north sumatra province, indonesia. agusmulia2020@gmail.com",

201,Comparative Mental Workload Assessment Of Work  Arrangements For Call Center Agents,"with the repercussions of the pandemic continuously affecting the different parts of the world, the emergence of varying work arrangements became vital for industries. implementation of work-from-home, office-based, and a combination of both work arrangements are necessary to deal with the restrictions imposed by the government. the researchers conducted the study to compare the mental workload of the call center agents among their work arrangements. the researchers used slovin’s formula to calculate the sample size using a 5% margin of error. for assessing the mental workload of the call center agents associated with their work arrangements, the researchers utilized the nasa task load index. it is found that the mental workload of work-from-home call center agents is just high, with a mean weighted rating of 72.16 compared to the very high mental workload of call center agents working office-based and in combined work arrangements, with the mean weighted rating of 77.53 and 79.60, respectively. furthermore, to determine if the work arrangements, types of call center agent, types of service, and work shifts of the call center agents have a certain effect on their mental workload, the researchers conducted the analysis of variance tests. as a general result, no main effects and significant interaction of all the factors to the call center agents’ mental workload were found, thus, combination of all these factors are what makes the mental workload high and very high.","call center agents, work arrangements, mental workload","In the survey conducted, 60% of the call center agents are now working from home, and 31% are still office-based, while only 9% are under the work arrangement of the combination of both. Assessment of the mental workload of the subjects is conducted through NASA TLX six subscales, namely Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration. Combination of both work arrangements yields the highest mental workload mean weighted rating of 79.60, followed by office-based work arrangement of 77.53, and finally, work- from-home with a 72.16 mean weighted rating. The work-from-home arrangement having the lower mental workload weighted rating among the three work arrangements proved why 59% of the respondents prefer to have this work arrangement. Though no main effects and significant interaction among the MWL weighted rating and other factors such as type of call center agents, type of service, work shift, and six subscales are found when compared one by one, the collective of these factors are the reason for the high up to the very high mental workload of the agents. Overall, helping or making the employees like their schedule can be a factor in boosting performance. With that, the researchers proposed a working schedule for those who have a combination of both work arrangements, which has the highest mental workload. The main recommendation is to at least have one-day office-based and four days of work-from-home, from the five days a week normal work schedule, and it’s up to the employees if they want to work overtime. This is preferred to alternating work arrangement of office-based and work-from-home weekly because the majority of the respondents believe that not all should be present at the company and employees should be scheduled accordingly, also to lessen the adverse effects of COVID-19. 5.1 Recommendations The study revealed the mental workload of call center agents from the three work arrangements. It has also provided test results regarding the status quo of the call center agents among their respective types of service and type of call center agent. Thus, the researchers formulated recommendations and are hereby presented: 1. Since most of the respondents prefer working from home, and with the re-arising of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, the management should consider transferring their agents in a remote setup. Moreover, it is also found out that the performance of work-from-home call center agents is the highest among the call center agents in all of the work arrangements. Furthermore, call center agents working from home have the only ‘high’ level of mental workload while the rest have ‘very high’. Additionally, no main effects and interaction between the given factors that affect the mental workload of the call center agents have been found out. Thus, there is no reason to primarily provide the call center agents a particular work arrangement depending on their type of service and what type of call center they have or are, to lessen their mental workload. 2. The provision of complete essential equipment, especially computer sets, working desks, and high-speed internet, is highly encouraged to help the call center agents working remotely perform their tasks at a satisfactory level with less chance of getting stressed out, frustrated, and anxious. It is also to help lessen the physical demand of working from home as it shows on Table 2. As there is no evidence provided in the study showing why even working from home is physically demanding, it is recommended for future researchers to further research on this kind of topic to amplify the findings of this study. 3. If the management ever wants to push the office-based working arrangement, it will be better if they provide shuttle services for its workers. Mass transportation is not enough to accommodate the number of workers working on site, and limited passengers are only allowed inside. 4. When opting to provide a combination of work arrangements, the management should provide the specific recommendations stated in numbers 2 & 3. Keeping in mind the recommendation stated in the last paragraph of the conclusion, which states that having at least 1 day of office-based and 4 days of work-from-home would be the most ideal than alternate weekly of work arrangements. The researchers also adopted some of the recommendations from the study: “Ergonomics Assessment on the Mental Workload of Work from Home Employees” of Dasmariñas et al. (2020), as they are also related to the study.","charlene h. ballad, sheeno f. dasmariñas, john margel a. otalla, rhea ann g. perez, and maria louise c. valenzuela industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines – manila 363 p. casal st., quiapo, metro manila, philippines mchballad@tip.edu.ph, msfdasmarinas@tip.edu.ph, mjmaotalla@tip.edu.ph, mragperez@tip.edu.ph, mmlcvalenzuela@tip.edu.ph janina elyse a. reyes professor of industrial engineering department technological institute of the philippines 363 p. casal st., quiapo, metro manila, philippines jereyes.ie@tip.edu.ph",
202,Practice Makes Perfect: New Empirical Data And Statistical  Analysis To Test Preconceived Notions,"“practice makes perfect“ is passed around frequently without much evidence to support it. although there have been experiments using mice to test if practice time and maze completion time are correlated, the results cannot directly be applied to humans. this experiment uses a custom website that randomly generates different mazes. the participants used the arrow keys to navigate through the mazes. each participant completed four increasingly difficult variations, as the function of the arrow keys were changed for each variation. after practicing for a certain amount of time, they solved three timed mazes before resuming practice. a two sample t-test determined that participants improved with practice, but only for the most difficult variation the experiment also featured participants of ages 8 to 73 to determine whether maze completion time would increase with the participant’s age. a linear regression analysis shows that younger people generally solved mazes faster than older people.","learning, adaptation, practice, cognition","As the complexity of the variations increased, some participants continued to solve the mazes quickly while others lagged behind. This explains the increasing variability in more difficult variations as shown in Figure 2. The two sample t-tests in Table 1 show that variations 1 and 2 were not much different from each other in terms of difficulty. This supports our initial hypothesis that the difficult variations will require more time to complete than the simpler ones. As displayed in Figure 3, the participants struggled with variation 3 after only one minute of practice. However, they quickly adjusted to it after 3 minutes of practice. From this point onwards, a further improvement in the maze completion was marginal. Even though the median maze completion time did not improve from 3 to 7 minutes of practice, the variability did decrease. This indicates that the participants were consistently performing better as a group. These results support our initial hypothesis that participants would become ‘better’ after practicing for longer periods of time. My original metric of becoming ‘better’ at solving mazes was the completion time. However, I also realized through the experiment that becoming consistent was another metric of measuring ‘better’. In Figure 4, the regression fitting indicates that older people performed worse than younger people. This could be attributed to younger people being more exposed to technology and able to adapt more easily to environmental changes. In Figure 5, grouping participants by decade increases the R2 value for the polynomial regression. The differences within an age group were canceled out, yielding an averaged data point that represented the overall trend better. This is especially for participants in their 40s, who had diverse occupations running from house-makers to doctors; we suspect that certain occupations prepared the person to adapt to environmental changes while others did not. These findings support the initial hypothesis that younger people are better at adapting to a change in variation than older people; this does not directly support that younger people are better at technology or adapting to changes. However, it can be inferred that there lies some underlying trends that are worth studying. All in all, our preconceived notion that there is some negatively correlated relationship between age and adaptability to changes were, to some extent, statistically supported through this study. This study also provides support for the saying, “Practice makes perfect” when the task was difficult. 1875","tei kim stanford online high school redwood city, ca 94063, usa teidkim@ohs.stanford.edu","References

205,Management Of Innovation In Functional Food Products For  Stunting Prevention As A Research Dissemination In,"using local resources, food processing experts have focused on functional food research for stunting prevention since 2018. this is intended to aid the government's stunting prevention initiatives, with a focus on nutritional therapies for infants and toddlers. the purpose of this study is to produce an appropriate description and set of recommendations for the distribution management of institution x's revolutionary functional food items created for stunting prevention. this study employs a qualitative approach with a case study design to explain field data about the management of functional food dissemination developed by institution x to combat stunting. this study illustrates the necessity of researchers collaborating from the onset with health practitioners specializing in stunting prevention and industry to identify the most effective local resources for functional food stunting. to attain toddler nutritional adequacy, institution x and the government must distribute regionally appropriate functional food product innovations, particularly those based on animal protein. to maximize strategic measures so that the affordability of intake or use of functional meals to avoid stunting are directly on target, it is necessary to consider many factors, including the actors involved and the informational media.","functional food, dissemination, nutrition food","Based on the findings of this study, it is possible to conclude that cultural changes in the behavior of pregnant women, infants, and toddlers (focused on the first 1000 days of life/HPK), particularly the consumption of animal protein, should be the primary focus for preventing stunting. Various research sources about the treatment of malnutrition, particularly stunting, include the consumption of food with a balanced nutritional value, particularly in animal protein, as Peru has succeeded in reducing the prevalence of stunting with a program requiring the daily consumption of at least one egg during the first 1000 days of life/HPK. The stunting management program can more precisely refer to prior research sources, allowing for faster implementation of initiatives to reduce the prevalence of stunting. Moreover, numerous government entities play significant roles in the multisectoral reduction of stunting. Through functional food research, Institution X, an Indonesian research institution, also helps to the government's attempts to minimize the prevalence of stunting. According to the conclusions of this study, institution X should place a greater emphasis on functional and complementary diets for adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, and toddlers. The research on functional foods conducted by Institution X to prevent stunting should pay close attention to the functional food classification. It must be modified so that the texture, variety, flavor, and amount conform to the nutritional adequacy rate value. The emphasis should be switched from generating functional foods from local resources to including or utilizing those generated from animal protein. The sources of animal protein are livestock, poultry, fish, and seafood. This is because animal protein includes nutrients that are more readily absorbed by the body than those found in plant-based foods. Children, especially newborns and toddlers, have a higher protein requirement than adults. The focus of the study on functional foods is on teenagers and pregnant women, particularly food sources that can prevent anemia, such as iron and folic acid, zinc, calcium, etc. There is a substantial possibility for research on the nutritional value of marine items, including fish and others, which can be employed as a food source to prevent stunting. Institution X must work with industry from the outset to profit from its research products and mass-produce them for stunting prevention efforts. Institution X is required to engage with various associations, professions, or health advocacy groups concentrating on stunting prevention. Additionally, Institution X must actively educate the public on stunting facts to market its research products. There is a need for institution X to actively participate in stunting prevention efforts through various media to introduce research products that are easily accessible to the public via social media. The necessity for institution X to aggressively engage with other governments, such as the Ministry of Health with Puskesmas and Posyandu, to aid in the prevention of stunting through research products. This research is constrained by the limited time available for data collection. Researchers have a hurdle due to the lack of integrated information data regarding research and research progress.

206,Engineering Management In Australia:  An Overview Of Current Practices,"engineering management (em) has a long history in australia as far back as 1968. however, a review of scholarly papers has revealed a lack of attention from researchers for this discipline in the past 10 years, especially topics about industrial demand and competency. this paper is to provide a review of current em practices in australia, classified into occupation and market demand, professional society, and required qualifications and competency. a review of em practices in australia has been conducted through 24 scholarly papers from 1991 to 2022 along with a statistical analysis of data from government and professional society. the review has revealed the increasing market demand for engineering managers (emers). temporary and permanent visa has been offered since 2005 and 2012 respectively to fill the gap in the domestic market. the em career path with required years of experience and the trend of qualifications are also synthesized from different research and data. different from the us, australia is lacking a professional society that is dedicated to the management and promotion of this discipline in the country. em competency is currently defined by engineers australia (ea) only for migration purposes. the paper raises the awareness of management skills for all engineers on their engineering career path. this paper also provides implications for strategic plans, particularly for educational institutions in developing engineering management programs. further, recommendations for future research directions are outlined. this is the first literature review paper on em practices in australia.","occupation, career path, competency, education","This paper has filled the gap of a review paper on EM practices in Australia. The data has revealed the high demand for this occupation in the market with the solution of the temporary and permanent visas for EMers to bridge this gap. The career path with the requirements of qualification and experience years is also analysed with the results of the dominance of higher education, the average year of 6.5 -8.3 years in engineering roles and 20 years in management roles. Furthermore, the EM skills are also analysed by reviewing the competency requirements from a professional society. The paper ends with recommendations for strategic plans for educational institutions in developing EM programs at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. A suggestion of a professional society in collaboration with other international association to leverage EM society in Australia is also provided. Last but not least is the directions for future research with the need of broad-scale research on the current practices and future of the EM discipline.","june ho, viken kortian and nazmul huda school of engineering macquarie university sydney, australia june.ho@mq.edu.au, viken.kortian@mq.edu.au, nazmul.huda@mq.edu.au",
207,Ensemble Classifier With Missing Data In Control Chart  Patterns,"the control chart patterns recognition (ccpr) is one of important tools in statistical process control (spc). the performance of ccpr depend on many factors, one of those the prediction algorithm. furthermore, when data is substantially missing, the rate of false alarms and misclassification is high. this paper reported an investigation of five classifiers namely, decision tree, ann, linear support vector machine, gaussian support vector machine, and knn-5 with ensemble classifier. the results are compared with perfect sample pattern (without missing data) and sample patterns with missing data 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. two datasets having normal ± 3σ shifting range, and small shifting range less than ± 1.5σ was investigated. the results show that the ensemble classifier have higher recognition accuracy for sample patterns without missing data 99.55% and 98.64% for sample patterns with 20% missing data.",,"The ensemble classifier has the capability to get higher recognition accuracy compare with individual classifier. This paper investigated several missing data percentages for two dataset namely normal shifting range for mean (±3σ) and small shifting range for mean less than ((±1.5σ). The recognition accuracy without missing data 99.55% with ensemble classifier when it is 98.64% with 20% missing data for normal shifting range and 93.69 within small shift range in mean. The ensemble classifier can achieve higher recognition accuracy within missing data better than individual classifiers which used in previous studies. The EWMA computation to compensation the missing data it is better than another computation methods. The proposed method can handle the missing data with 50% missing data and the recognition accuracy still over 94%. For the future wark we suggest to investigate another classifier algorithms with ensemble classifier and investigate missing data in CCPR with data lees than 1.0 Sigma.

208,Analyzing Challenges To Utilizing Renewable Energy In The  Context Of Developing Countries: Policymaking Implications,"utilizing renewable energy (re) to minimize the use of fossil fuels is an emerging concept throughout the globe to attain energy sufficiency while reducing the negative impact on the environment. since the existing infrastructures and concepts of energy consumption stand on burning fossil fuels for hundreds of years, ideas for replacing those by implementing re often stumble with several barriers, especially in developing countries where there are numerous resource constraints. these barriers create critical policymaking challenges to achieving comprehensive energy sustainability. several studies discovered the challenges to utilizing re in the context of developing nations. however, no study has yet been conducted to prioritize the challenges and examine the relations among them. this study, thereby, utilizes the decision-making trial, and evaluation laboratory (dematel) method to identify the prioritization, and examine the relations among the critical challenges to utilizing re in the context of developing countries. thirteen challenges were identified from reviewing literature and expert feedback, which were then analyzed by the dematel method. the findings revealed that ‘large land requirement’, ‘uncertain supply’, and ‘end life management difficulties’ are the three most prominent challenges to utilizing re in developing countries. the explored cause-effect relations among the challenges indicate ‘long economic recovery periods’ to be the most causative and ‘lack of social awareness and acceptance’ to be the least causative challenge. this study is expected to assist the policymakers of developing nations in successfully utilizing re sources to achieve long-term energy sustainability, thus achieving sustainable development goals (sdgs).","renewable energy, challenges",,"for achieving sustainable development goals md. tanvir siraj department of industrial and production engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka 1000, bangladesh. tanvir25392@gmail.com mohammad tanvir hossain chief executive officer reactron bangladesh private limited, dhaka, bangladesh. mth@reactronglobal.com s.m. faysal ahmed, spandan basak payel department of mechanical engineering bangladesh university of engineering and technology, dhaka 1000, bangladesh. smfaysalahmed@gmail.com, spandanbasak@gmail.com",
209,Prognostics And Health Management On Master-T Radar  Maintenance Using Failure Mode Effect And Criticality,"the readiness of military defense radar is absolute in effort to maintain indonesia air sovereignty from potential threats that may enter and endanger the security of citizens and residents throughout indonesia territory. currently, the radar health condition monitoring system has not been integrated in a whole system integrated manner between the subsystems each other, it causes a relatively long time to identify critical failures that may arise in the related subsystems. prognostics and health management (phm) takes the current state of the system as a starting point, combined with structural characteristics, parameters, environmental conditions, and historical data of objects, to monitor the equipment working status with various knowledge, algorithms, and models based on advances in sensor acquisition technology. phm on master-t radar maintenance is proposed using the method of failure mode effect and criticality analysis (fmeca) which aims to predict critical failures, thus preventing fatal damage that can result in system breakdown. predictive maintenance is added to conventional maintenance, thereby minimizing idle time when repairs must be made with the radar system inactive. the application of this method obtains a risk priority number (rpn) which is used as a reference in determining critical components that must be repaired immediately.","military radar, fmeca","PHM with FMECA method on MASTER-T radar maintenance develops a more advanced maintenance from conventional maintenance into predictive maintenance, able to predict potential critical failures to prevent fatal damage on the system. Prognostics on monitoring the entire radar system provides RUL information for each subsystem, so that it can determine equipment maintenance time before system breakdown occurs and extend its service life as a long-term goal. The simulation shown can make the difference to the overall health monitoring of the radar system more quickly to technicians and operators in the hope of helping make decisions about the series of maintenance actions that must be done immediately. The prototype of the health monitoring model that is designed can be used as an initial step to determine the maintenance and repair priority of the affected subsystems according to the order of the RPN value is that appear in the monitoring system. As an example, in the paper when diesel engine item that has an RPN value of 300 (the highest at certain time) is anticipated from failure, fatal damage to the radar system and the radar crew can be avoided, and the operational time of the radar system can continue to last longer. The FMECA method can provide priority calculations of critical failures that must be done immediately, the 1938","analysis method to predict critical failures and extend life hendrawan candra purnama master graduate program in industrial engineering department, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta jl. ir. sutami, 36a, surakarta 57126, indonesia cps2ti2021@student.uns.ac.id; chepe2006dipha@gmail.com susy susmartini industrial engineering program, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta jl. ir. sutami, 36a, surakarta 57126, indonesia susysus2011@gmail.com lobes herdiman industrial engineering program, faculty of engineering universitas sebelas maret surakarta jl. ir. sutami, 36a, surakarta 57126, indonesia lobesh@gmail.com","References

215,Characterization And Prediction Of P420 Laser Cladding For  Digital Twins,"modern manufacturing technologies such as additive manufacturing are a vital pillar of industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing systems. one of the most promising am techniques is directed energy deposition (ded) which uses a thermal source to generate a melt pool on a substrate into which metal powder is injected. laser cladding (lc), a ded additive process, is widely used in machine parts repair and functional coating due to its advantages, such as the low heat input into the substrate. compared to conventional welding, this results in less induced stress, lower dilution rate, small heat-affected zone, and good metallurgical bonding between the coating and the substrate. the lc technology is not as robust or standardized. the part quality, mechanical properties, and microstructure of laser- cladded parts are neither as commercially predictable nor controllable. this research aims to develop deep learning models that predict and classify the lc process for lc coating and single and interfering-bead samples. the ml models will detect faulty process input parameters and predict the quality. this detection and prediction take place in real time, which is vital in producing the additive process’s data model component of a digital twin (dt). digital imaging of a coaxial cmos camera and melted pool temperature measurements using a lascon lpc04 pyrometer are being used as in-situ sensory devices. a plethora of articles have limited their ml models to individual combinations of substrate and powder and focused on the three main process parameters (laser power, laser beam scanning speed, and powder feeding rate). this research project expands the scope to include a different substrate and powder combinations, utilize additional parameters, and exploit different powder/substrate combinations. the inputs 1983",,,"malek mousa production & operations management research lab university of windsor windsor, ontario, canada dash3@uwindsor.ca hany osman production & operations management research lab university of windsor windsor, ontario, canada systems engineering department college of computer sciences and engineering king fahd university of petroleum &amp; minerals, kingdom of saudi arabia. hany.osman@uwindsor.ca ahmed azab production & operations management research lab university of windsor windsor, ontario, canada azab@uwindsor.ca fazle baki odette school of business university of windsor windsor, ontario, canada fbaki@uwindsor.ca",
216,Implementation Of The Six Sigma Methodology To Improve  The Process Performance In A Mype,"those in charge of directing small and micro companies many see the application of improvement tools as something unnecessary; since, they think that they are complicated development methods that will represent unnecessary expense of time and money, and therefore they prefer to remain in the same situation and do not take advantage of the possibility of improving and growing as an organization. in the development of this research, the influence of the application of the six sigma methodology is studied and approached in a practical way; tool that allows to measure the performance of a process for the identification of defects and determine the ideal improvements to apply, in a mype. different articles were analyzed, where the six sigma model had been applied; which presented improvements for the organizations to which they were directed. in addition, the six sigma methodology was implemented in a mype that provided the car wash service; whose process initially had a non-optimal performance, but by implementing the six sigma method, improvements were achieved such as: the increase in the availability of the pressure washer machine from 84.31% to 92.78%, the increase in the number of vehicles washed, reduction of 122 hours stopped for maintenance and reduction of rejected vehicles.","six sigma, improvement, availability, dmaic","This article has presented the application case of the Six Sigma methodology in an MYPE from Lima-Peru dedicated to providing the vehicle washing service that seeks to improve the performance of its process. In the development of the investigation, the entire human group that makes up the vehicle washing center was involved, since it is a small group of people between operators and those responsible for the administration of the place where the service is provided, all were duly instructed. about the steps to be involved and the benefits that will be brought to the company. Likewise, the data collection was carried out carefully and with the greatest possible precision to avoid errors in the measurement phase, when the improvements were implemented, they were complemented with control measures that allowed each person to remember and recognize their role in each stage of the process. process and that the results are within the expected limits. At the end of the Six Sigma implementation process, it was possible to improve the performance of the process by increasing the capacity of vehicles washed on average per month from 748 to 845 vehicles, reducing the number of hours stopped from 226 to 104; All of this could be demonstrated numerically by means of the process capability indicator (Cp) obtained by means of the Minitab tool, reaching a value of 1.33, which demonstrated that the performance of the process is optimal. If the commitment of all the parties that belong to an MYPE is achieved, the impact of the Six Sigma methodology will translate into improvements that will allow a better development and development of the same with the aim of being more competitive and productive.","giancarlo alexander arrasco juarez student of industrial engineering faculty of architecture and industrial engineering, university of lima lima, perú 20170112@aloe.ulima.edu.pe cristian alexander ortiz velasquez student of industrial engineering faculty of architecture and industrial engineering, university of lima lima, perú 20172427@aloe.ulima.edu.pe",

It can be concluded that, although the products with turnover rates and sales flow are the products of first need, however, many of these are not characterized by being marketed under a specific brand, but rather under individual units. O2: Identify strategies that increase sales and generate healthy margins in companies in the retail sector. It is highly important to recognize the usefulness of the algorithm to automate the process of identifying potential sales, since this allows not only to speed up this process, but also to make commercial decisions for the elaboration of new effective strategies. O3: Interpret and compare the main statistical indicators of the A priori Algorithms It can be concluded that, although it is true that support represents a key indicator in the structuring of all association rules, this is not a factor with which just having it is enough to make trading decisions.","gonzalo manuel infante caldas universidad de lima carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20180936@aloe.ulima.edu.pe (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5315-042x) xiomara dayana molina rubio universidad de lima carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20181210@aloe.ulima.edu.pe (https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4524-0844) yvan jesus garcia lopez universidad de lima carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe (https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9577-4188) josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima instituto de investigación científica lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1711-6603)",
221,Use Of A Machine Learning Model For The Reduction Of  Backorders In The Cross Docking Sales Process For The,"in this work, it is necessary to analyze the increase of back order in the attention of crossdocking orders in the attention of homecenter customers due to the lack of definition of purchase planning processes, resulting in logistics costs, fill rate charges and low service level. thus, it is intended the companies that handle high volumes of inventory and constant orders should have a forecast plan to cover possible stock-outs. the main purpose of the research is to explain a way to prevent stock-outs using an artificial intelligence model, based on historical sales data of a medium- sized company that manages inventories, as well as to determine the machine earning model to predict and reduce backorders. for the data analysis, the orange software was used, where the data was trained with different artificial intelligence models such as decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, and neural networks. the most accurate model was defined according to numerical indicators such as the confusion matrix, the area under the curve (auc) and the roc curve analysis. thus, we opted for the neural network model, which presented the most accurate data. finally, the results are presented and a suggestion is made at the management level regarding decision making in the supply process. for this purpose, itis considered pertinent to delve into the subject of the variables that influence the accumulation of backorders.","machine learning, backorders, demand forecasting","Today's companies seek maximum efficiency in all their processes in order to satisfy the requirements of their customers and thus achieve maximum responsiveness. To this end, good inventory management is considered important for decision making and to face uncertain futures. One of the main problems that affects the level of, service is the accumulation of pending orders due to stock shortages, thus generating additional management costs and penalties that in most cases companies are obliged to pay for non-compliance. In the present work, ‘the modeling and comparison of performance indicators in the prediction using four classifiers in the Orange software was carried out, An analysis and interpretation of the main indicators is then performed to choose the best classification model. According to the training of the data by the neural network model, we obtained as results those variables that affect the decision making at the time of managing the supply process. Thus, it is considered important to establish an inventory policy according to the sales to determine the lot to order and to propose a safety stock according to the variability of the orders. Then it can be determined that in some SKUs that have trends and seasonality in sales, the sales forecast can be calculated with the statistical model of triple additive exponential smoothing: in this case it is necessary to clean the data on some dates due to anomalous sales peaks or factors that lead to an important alteration in the orders. However, with the application of an artificial intelligence model, the data cleaning procedure was optimized because the model learns from previous events and transforms the atypical sales.","homecenter order service garcia lopez yvan jesus senior lecturer faculty of engineering and architecture industrial engineering career lima university lima, peru orcid.org/0000-0001-9577-4188 ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe jamil panduro y sebastian pumayauri faculty of engineering and architecture industrial engineering career lima university lima peru orcid.org:0000-0002-1303-6200/ 0000-0001-7790-8429 20173692@aloe.ulima.edu.pe , 20173749@aloe.ulima.edu.pe",
222,Determinants Of Big Data Adoption: An Empirical Study  On Sri Lankan Firms,"big data (bd) is a vital cog in industry 4.0 technology that modern organizations adopt to gain competitive advantage. although the factors that lead bd usage are documented in the literature, there is lack of understanding as to how these factors are related to one another in predicting and explaining bd usage. this study fills the gap by developing and empirically testing a theoretical model, using the sri lankan industry as the context. technical, organizational and environmental (toe) framework is used as the theoretical lens for theory building. the seven constructs of the theoretical model were identified by sifting through a large volume of literature to identify the critical success factors (csfs) of bd usage. the relationships between the constructs were also hypothesized from the extant literature. the model posited that top management support drives the organization’s analytics culture and information systems competence to enhance its analytics capacity, to cause bd usage. in addition to analytics capability (the internal factor), the study posits that competitive pressure and government pressure also act as additional causal antecedents of bd usage. a questionnaire was developed to capture different manifestations of the seven constructs and partial least squares structural equation modelling (pls-sem) technique was used to analyze the data collected. in the main, the data supported the hypotheses underpinning the theory. analytics capability and competitive pressure found to have strong and medium effects on bd. the only exception was that the government pressure was found to have no effect on bd usage (p=0.332). having demonstrated construct validity of all seven constructs, the study estimated the strengths of the theoretical relationships between the constructs; the latter also enabled the researcher to provide suggestions to top managers as to how bd usage can be increased in their firms. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to formulate a theory that explains how different organizational elements work together to improve the bd usage. the questionnaire and the practical implications of the empirical findings will be useful to bd organizations for continuous improvement.","big data, big data adoption, industry 4.0","The three objectives were achieved, and it is argued that the study attempts to make an academic contribution by way of formulating and testing a theory to explain the BD usage phenomenon. Previous studies posited several enables/determinants of BD usage. They were presented merely as predictors (independent variables) that predict BD usage. This study identified the critical predictors (through a sifting process) and organised them in a causal predictive manner. This is to create a path model that not only to predicts BD usage, but also explains how BD usage is caused. The path model/theory is useful for both the academia and practitioners alike to understand or distinguish successful BD implementation from unsuccessful BD implementation. The validated survey instrument (the questionnaire) means that managers can use this instrument for continuous improvement and benchmarking purposes. Managers can conduct self-assessments to take baseline measurements (scores) for each CSF (determinant or enabler) of BD usage and keep improving their scores by taking appropriate action. This is the first practical contribution of the research. It is acknowledged that improving the scores of some CSFs will be more difficult than the others. For example, improving the score of the Analytics Culture could be more challenging than improving the score of IS Competence because a technical resource can be acquired more easily (e.g., via recruitment) than a soft, intricately bundled, resource (specifically, the culture) which is deep rooted. It is suggested that the study be replicated in larger economies to improve the external validity of the findings.","sachini nidusha weerasinghe department of management of technology faculty of business university of moratuwa, 10400 sri lanka sachiniweerasinghe5@gmail.com nihal jayamaha department of operations & engineering innovations school of food and advanced technology massey university private bag 11222, palmerston north 4442 new zealand n.p.jayamaha@massey.ac.nz",
223,Comparative Analysis On Cost And Benefit Of The Rejected  Brine Valorization Technology For Sustainable Brine,"when disposed of improperly, rejected brine, a byproduct of the desalination process used in power plants, can negatively affect the environment. however, because it includes compounds that companies require, rejected brine may be a useful resource. sustainable brine management is crucial to ensure environmental and human safety due to dynamic and complex requirements for its composition and purification. the valorization strategy changes the paradigm of rejected brine from waste into resources for various purposes. this technology can produce a nacl solution from rejected brine to be used as an alternative raw material for the chlor-alkali industry, especially for indonesia company. this paper aims to compare the cost and benefit of the rejected brine valorization technology from membrane-based technology, that is, electrodialysis (ed), reverse osmosis (ro), and osmotically assisted reverse osmosis (oaro). there are three schemes to be analyzed, named scheme 1 (uf-ed), scheme 2 (uf-nf-uf- ro), and scheme 3 (uf-nf-ro-oaro). the result shows that all the schemes gave a negative net beneﬁt in each case. the total cost for scheme 2 was lower than another scheme. however, the total benefit for scheme 3 is higher than another scheme. furthermore, it can be seen that scheme 3 has more economical and environmental benefits than scheme 1 and scheme 2.","valorization, rejected brine, oil and gas","Implementing new technology requires no small amount of money, so decision-makers need to look at other benefits derived from the planned implementation of the technology. Analyzing the cost and benefits can systematically estimate the feasibility of investing in technology. However, the application of this method in the rejected brine sector, especially the valorization of rejected brine, is still limited. based on calculations, the values for net benefits for scheme 1 is USD -92,47, scheme 2 is USD -87,11, and scheme 3 is USD -87,22. Each technology has its own advantages and drawbacks regarding water recovery rate and energy consumption. Future research should look at combining different membrane technologies to optimize brine concentration with a reasonable water recovery rate and operating cost. The recovery of value-added minerals from brine offers both economic and environmental benefits. Nevertheless, the processes need to be further optimized to improve the high precision separation of single elements from others, and boost the benefit-cost ratio.","management: an indonesia case study ayu erliza, arie rakhman hakim national research and innovation agency (brin) jakarta, indonesia ayu.erliza@brin.go.id; arie035@brin.go.id",
224,Impact Of Petroleum On National Debt As A Decomposed  General Macroeconomic Theory Non Linear Stationary,"national debt has been identified as a major economic problem affecting the developing world in general where vital national resources are diverted from developmental functions to meeting debt obligations in interest and principal repayments. a multiplicity of literature portraying the causes of the debt build up have tended to bring out petroleum imports as one key contributor to third world indebtedness. the study reanalyzes this proposition by studying the relative impact of the zambian petroleum imports on its national debt as a decomposed general macroeconomic theoretical process utilizing a time-varying two state multivariate markov-switching autoregressive model (msar) with zambian national debt as the dependent variable and petroleum imports, non petroleum imports, government expenditures, gross capital formation, exports, private final consumption and gdp as the regressors, using annual time series data from the early 1980’s to 2019. the study established national debt reducing effects to have run from petroleum imports, gdp, gross capital formation and private consumption expenditures in both the dormant and expansive states of the model. debt increasing effects were brought out to have run from government expenditures and national exports in both states of the model. it was only from non-petroleum imports that results were inconclusive.","national debt, petroleum imports, gdp","The relationship between petroleum import expenditures and national is brought out by the study as running contrary to most of the reviewed studies and where the long run relationship is of an inverse nature where increased petroleum import expenditures had debt reducing effects. This meets the general objective and the specific objective of evaluating the extent to which crude petroleum imports impacted Zambian national debt as the study showed that petroleum imports did have an impact on the Zambian national debt and the impact was debt reducing. The model brings out GDP increases to be an equally long run national debt reducing factor though with relatively lower magnitudes than the petroleum impact but consistent in both the dormant and expansive states of the model. This equally met the objective of evaluating the effect of gross domestic product on the Zambian national debt. The objective of investigating the impact of private domestic consumption on the Zambian national debt was met by the study equally bringing out a debt reducing impact from the Final private consumption in both states of the model. Gross capital formation was another general macroeconomic variable that had a long run national debt reducing impact on national debt. This met the specific objective of investigating the impact of gross capital formation on the Zambian national debt where the result was consistent debt reducing impact in both states of the model. Economically we may attribute this contribution to the reduction in national debt through the gross fixed capital formation positive boost to the economic growth channel. The objective of evaluating the effect of government expenditure on the Zambian national debt was achieved by the study establishing that government consumption had consistent national debt increasing effects in the long run whose economic reason is largely that the government has been financing its expenditures through borrowed resources in the long run which has translated into this consistent and significant contribution of government expenditures to national debt. Quite in contrast to the general macroeconomic theory expectation, the objective of determining the impact that exports had on the Zambian national debt was equally achieved by the study revealing that there had existed long run national debt increasing effects from national exports in the Zambian case. Ideally exports are supposed to be contributing to the current account surplus if not reducing the deficits. In the Zambian case this has not been the long run case. Finally the study brought out a non-consistent and as such inconclusive results on the effects of non- petroleum imports on the state of Zambian national debt which made the objective of evaluating the extent to which non - petroleum imports impacted the Zambian national debt in the period of the study a an inconclusive result open to further analysis. 2076","markov switch process chibwe joseph d.b lecturer school of business economics and management university lusaka (unilus) lusaka, zambia chibwejdb@gmail.com; jchibwe@unilus.ac.zm dr. lubinda habazoka and dr. kasongo mwale richard graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia lhabazoka@yahoo.com; engkasongo@gmail.com","References

225,Optimization Of The Bicycle Assembly Process By Applying  Tools Lean Manufacturing: A Case Study,"the investigation was carried out in the workshop area of the company giant ibarra, whose main problem is the delay in the delivery of finished bicycles causing a breach of the demand requested by the commercial area. this reason influences the proposal of an improvement within the production process, which allows a decrease in productive time, guarantees efficiency, and reduces the use of resources that do not add value to the process through the application of tools of the lean manufacturing methodology. the development of the proposal required the design and description of operational tools such as 5's, kanban, and manufacturing cell; for the latter, the new working method that will increase efficiency was determined. through the value chain map (vsm) tool, it was possible to obtain the results of improvement based on certain indicators, where a decrease in lead time of 27.55 minutes is observed; on the other hand, the production capacity is increased to 27 bicycles generating an efficiency increase of 8.05%.","lean manufacturing, lead time, takt time, 5's, manufacturing cell","1. Based on the documentary research of the company, fieldwork, and application of the VSM tool in it, it has been found that the workshop has shortcomings that start from its planning, where the existence of over processes and waits within the assembly of rings was found which directly influences the general assembly time. 2. The Kaizen Events allowed to determine the strengths and opportunities that the company has, so by establishing strategies that improve its performance, it was possible to increase the efficiency of the company from 84.43% to 92.48%. 3. The 5s were of utmost importance to generate a habit of order and cleanliness which influenced that there is a better organization and therefore there is a decrease in time that does not add value in a total of 3.94 minutes thus seeing an increase in the evaluation of the 5s starting from the current situation with 46% to the data obtained through the proposal of 84%. 4. By applying the design of the new working method and the manufacturing cells, it is possible to reduce the cycle time from 158.58 minutes to 131.03 minutes, in the same way the distance or travel during the flow of the process was shortened since the warehouse 1 and the workshop were unified, thus being a route of 10.14 meters with respect to the current situation which denoted a total of 17.8 meters; this through the support of the 5s to locate the materials and resources that evidenced an improvement in their productive capacity to 27 bicycles per month increasing their productivity to 0.45 bicycles/hours. 5. The establishment of a working method through the pre-assemblies contributed to the increase of the fulfillment of the orders eliminating the existing waste being the most important the delays in the processes, that is how, the bottleneck originated in the subprocess of assembly of rings was eliminated giving way to a continuous productive flow.","pamela v. escobar-arroyave, yakcleem montero-santos, ramiro v. saraguro-piarpuezan, jenyffer a. yépez-chicaiza and edgar v. lema-cáceres facultad de ingeniería en ciencias aplicadas universidad técnica del norte ibarra, ecuador pvescobara@utn.edu.ec, ymontero@utn.edu.ec rvsaraguro@utn.edu.ec jayepez@utn.edu.ec evlema@utn.edu.ec fortalecimiento de las capacidades productivas (focapro)",

227,Multiple Regression Analysis On The Physical And Perceived  Attributes Of Quezon City Free Bus Service To Passenger,"in the philippines, the daily commute of filipinos has always been a challenge, even before the pandemic. the covid- 19 pandemic has substantially impacted the public transportation sector and made commuting even more challenging. the quezon city bus service or qcity bus service is one of the initiatives developed by the quezon city government to alleviate the challenges brought about by the pandemic by providing free bus rides. the study aims to identify factors that influence passengers’ satisfaction and determine how physical and perceived attributes impact passenger satisfaction to present relevant findings and recommendations that can help construct a more effective and strategic administration of free public transportation services. the physical attributes considered in this study were reliability, frequency, speed, accessibility, information provision, ease of transfers/interchanges, and vehicle condition. on the other hand, comfort, safety, convenience, and aesthetics were the perceived attributes used in this study. a total of one hundred fifty (150) respondents were taken from commuters who avail of the qcity bus service. the questionnaire was categorized into two parts: socio-demographic information and satisfaction rating. the researchers used a 5-point likert scale to evaluate and quantify the passengers’ satisfaction with the physical and perceived attributes and overall satisfaction with the qcity bus service. correlation and multiple regression analysis will be used to analyze data. the research aims to test the claim that physical attributes have a significant relationship with passenger satisfaction and that perceived attributes have a significant relationship with passenger satisfaction at α = 0.05 level of significance.","physical attributes, qcity bus service","To determine the relationship between quality attributes and satisfaction and identify the significant variables that affect passengers' satisfaction with the Quezon City free bus service, is the goal of this study. The researchers were able to successfully gather data from respondents by conducting an online survey. Different statistical methods were used to evaluate the relationship between variables. To summarize, the results show that: 1. The majority of the respondents are men, and their ages typically range from 10 to 25. The majority of respondents work, and most of them live in Quezon City. The majority of riders utilize the QCity Bus 1-2 times a week, and Route 1 is the most frequently traveled route. 2. The researchers found that reliability, frequency, accessibility, and ease of transfer are Physical Attributes that greatly influence passengers’ satisfaction with Quezon City’s free bus service. 3. Comfort, convenience, and aesthetics are Perceived Attributes that greatly influence passengers’ satisfaction with Quezon City’s free bus service. 4. 𝐻𝐻01 is rejected and 𝐻𝐻𝑎𝑎1 is accepted, thus concluding that there is a significant relationship between physical attributes and the passengers’ satisfaction with Quezon City’s free bus service. 5. 𝐻𝐻02 is rejected and 𝐻𝐻𝑎𝑎2 is accepted, thus concluding that there is a significant relationship between perceived attributes and the passengers’ satisfaction with Quezon City’s free bus service. 6. Based on the findings above, the researchers created the PLS-SEM figure that also serves as the passenger satisfaction model. There is a statistically significant relationship between both perceived and physical attributes and the passengers' satisfaction with Quezon City's free bus service, as shown by the PLS-SEM model, that every numerical value in the inner and outer models exceeds the required standard value. This study aims to provide comprehensive data about the correlation between Quezon City Bus Service attributes and customer satisfaction that can influence how strategically public transportation systems are implemented and how well passengers' requirements and wants are achieved. The study could potentially benefit both passengers and the local/national government since it evaluates and determines the factors that affect passenger satisfaction in Quezon City, thus providing a new perception of the free Bus Service administered by the Quezon City Government. Given the significance of transportation in our everyday lives, improving system efficiency in the Philippines remains an extreme challenge. The results may be utilized by the national and/or local government units (LGUs), Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), non-governmental organizations (NGO), etc. who seek to provide their fellow countrymen with efficient and convenient public transportation. Implementers of free public transportation services may consider factors such as reliability, frequency, accessibility, ease of transfer, comfort, convenience, and aesthetics to fulfill and satisfy passengers’ physical and perceived demands and deliver a higher overall satisfaction with their service.","satisfaction elijah louise g. briones, criselle mary grace d. dagami, luzvimindo p. garbo jr., shanette v. gemino, ian gabriel inay, junna jemina a. lazaro, romalyn l. galingan and arianne a. palisoc department of industrial engineering, college of engineering and architecture technological institute of the philippines – quezon city cubao, quezon city, philippines qelgbriones@tip.edu, qcmgdcdagami@tip.edu.ph, qlpgarbo@tip.edu.ph, qsvgemino@tip.edu.ph, qig-inay@tip.edu.ph, qjjalazaro@tip.edu.ph, rgalingan.ie@tip.edu.ph, arriane.palisoc@tip.edu.ph","references in regional public transport: a literature review.

228,"Cross Docking Distribution System Design  Albertus Laurensius Setyabudhi, Humala L. Napitupulu, Rosnani Ginting And Meilita","pt. xyz is a logistics service company located in batam. the problems that occur at this time are the problem of overcrowding in the warehouse and wrong sorting. this study aims to identify how the proposed efficiency improvement in the distribution system of goods using the cross docking method. the method that will be used in this research is the cross docking method. cross docking is eliminating the storage process in the warehouse, so it can save time and money. the cross docking distribution system does not have continuous storage of goods, because its function is only a transit point for a shipment of goods. goods are not stored for a long time, so the flow of goods is received until they are sent back, which is about 2-3 hours, or a maximum of 12 hours, in the warehouse, there are no available shelves or zero inventory. based on the research, the data processing and discussion results are very profitable, namely efficiency for zero inventory. shows that if the company adds 1 sorting table to 6 sorting tables with a result of 90,000kg, once loading and unloading aircraft is ±77,000kg, this can be shown to be 90,000kg>77,000kg efficiency is generated because the output of the sorting table is greater than the incoming input so that there are no goods stored in the warehouse and increase the number of trucks by 10 units, then the delivery of goods can be done one way and no goods are stored in the warehouse. the results of the analysis can be said that the application of cross docking in the company gains efficiency in the distribution of goods to expedition partners.","cross docking, efficiency, distribution, warehouse","Based on the results of the design of the distribution center warehouse in the research that has been carried out using the cross docking method, the conclusions are: 1. Before designing the distribution center cross docking system, the thing that needs to be done is to identify the old warehouse first and then make a detailed schematic sequentially regarding the tasks and arrangement of the workflow of the distribution of goods. 2.

229,A Socio-Technical System For Rural Community  Engagement:  The Gwakwani Project,"the united nations (un) defines community development as “a process designed to create conditions of economic and social progress for the whole community with its active participation and the fullest possible reliance on the community’s initiative”. within the context of a community engagement project, the technological solution and systems installed in the community to solve the problem, cannot be viewed in isolation. the community engagement project must be viewed from a socio-technical perspective, where the design, development and implementation of the solution must consider the impact on the community and their interaction with the solution. the implementation of technological solutions to community needs must therefore consider both the societal and technological inter-relationships; as well as creating an awareness of the sustainability and impact of the engineering activity on the social, industrial, and physical environment. this paper considers rural community engagement as a socio-technical construct and discusses the value and contribution of technological intervention within the social and economic system of a rural community towards self-sustenance.",,The Gwakwani Project offered the University of Johannesburg the opportunity to engage in rural community development as a socio-technical system.

230,Determination Weight Prioritized Of Multi-Attribute  Decision-Making For Diversification Product,"the pangasius agroindustry has significant potential to boost added value, build economic processes, raise the commercial community, offer jobs, generate economic opportunities, and strengthen the national economy. the base value of the pangasius agroindustry is due to the need for more innovative product development, which is essential to sustainable agroindustry. making the appropriate option when selecting a new product development concept is crucial to generating a successful new product. the selection of concepts is crucial for mitigating risk in a variety of market and uncertainty settings. ahp is appropriate for dealing with decision-making challenges involving multiple connected aspects. combining ahp with fuzzy set theory has created a recent offshoot known as fuzzy ahp. this innovative method widens the decision-making application scope much further. despite the widespread use of fuzzy ahp, only some studies have compared the priority weight vectors generated by fuzzy ahp with those of classical ahp. this research compares the two ahp techniques by examining the weight vectors derived from real-world case studies. four distinct fuzzy ahp techniques were derived from past research and tested using a variety of fuzzy fundamental scales and weight aggregation to determine which produces the most equivalent outcomes to standard ahp. the principal findings and outcomes from the four methodologies are presented and thoroughly explored.","f-ahp, in this case","and Recommendation Classical and fuzzy AHP has been actively used for various objectives, including assessing technology and equipment. Four distinct techniques were studied by altering the basic fuzzy scales and weight aggregations. Fuzzy AHP approaches were evaluated to determine which delivers the most equivalent outcomes to standard AHP. The following are the primary conclusions from this extensive study: 1. The priority weights were generated on a given decision hierarchy using four alternative fuzzy AHP techniques. The results showed that the weights might change greatly depending on the design of the fuzzy membership functions. The mistake rate rose when more elements were included in an assessment matrix. 2. The rank reversal was detected in all fuzzy AHP techniques examined and was most prevalent in the Pangasius Fillet and Surimi Based Product categories. Small discrepancies in ranking factors are unavoidable, owing to how they handle pairwise comparison matrices. 3. It is important to consider the fuzzy basic scale to employ with whatever weight aggregation. 4. Overall, M5 performed the best compared to a classical AHP method, while M3 performed the worst. The recommendation is that the fuzzy AHP technique necessitates extra calculations, owing to comparing two fuzzy integers' degrees of possibility (V values). More comparisons are made with more elements, and this growth is exponential. Six comparisons are needed for a matrix with three components, whereas thirty are needed for a matrix with six factors.","in pangasius agro-industry andreas tri panudju; marimin; sapta raharja department of agro-industrial engineering, faculty of agricultural engineering and technology bogor agricultural university, bogor 16680-indonesia andreaspanudju@apps.ipb.ac.id, marimin@apps.ipb.ac.id, saptaraharja@apps.ipb.ac.id. mala nurilmala department of aquatic product technology, faculty of fisheries and marines sciences, bogor agricultural university, bogor 16680-indonesia mnurilmala@apps.ipb.ac.id","references for a different kettle of fish cake.

231,Organizational Excellence And Agility: A Correlation  Model,"the strive to sustain excellence within organizations has increased with the constant change in customer demands and toughening of competition. with these rapid changes occurring, the need for organizations to be agile has become a significant element in their operation schemes to sustain the excellence and be future-ready. this need raises the question of the relationship between organizational excellence and agility. various models and frameworks have been developed to achieve excellence and agility in organizations. however, limited studies have correlated the two. this research investigates the relationship between excellence and agility within organizations and develops an assessment correlation index matrix between the two domains. that will help organizations understand their states in agility and excellence. the out-take for an organization is to know its categorization in the correlation model (beginner, master, conservative or fashionist) and determine the under- achieving pillars in each domain. the results of the study have shown that there is a high positive correlation between the two domains in both the public and private organizations. although while one would expect that private organizations would have higher correlation between the two domains, it has been observed in this study that public organizations within the uae have shown higher correlation data. this could be attributed to the fact that the government of the uae has introduced various initiatives since the 90’s that encouraged public organizations to implement excellence models such as dqa and skea. moreover, the study has shown that regardless of the size of the company, the correlation between agility and excellence is highly positive.","agility, excellence, correlation, model","made from previous researchers that agility is a driver and enabler of excellence (Al-Hammouri 2020). Since the organization is quick in overcoming unexpected changes without affecting its performance, it has become excellent at what it does. One would expect those who focus on agility without being excellent either they modified their business to stay competitive or have gone out of business. With the fashionist category having only two organizations, it shows that organizations have seen the true importance of excellence within the organization, especially with the latest challenge the whole world faced (COVID 19) and had to change the entire operation processes to be able to survive in the new way of work. A minor number of organizations have been reported in the beginner category, which indicates that some organizations are yet to work on their capabilities in both domains. Such organizations may need to focus on their value adding pillar. The average of the organizations in the category have achieved a low score in their service and product delivery utilizing innovative and proactive methodologies. Moreover, they should focus on investing in the human talents and creative capabilities within their organization to be able to improve their excellence. Within the categories, most of the organizations fall under the master category. This shows that as organizations grow and operate, they have gained a great learning curve from their journeys. This is due to the constant changes and challenges that is faced by the organizations. The more challenges they face, the better the organizations become at budling their agile capabilities. The results have shown only one organization falls under the conservative classification, very close to the intersection of all classes. Like the conclusions made on the Fashionist class, organizations understand the importance of the correlation of the two domains. However, this company needs to focus on improving their capabilities in being agile, as well as excellence. Not having companies in the extreme of the conservative class shows many companies already have realized the importance of agility and implemented it in their operation to a good degree. The analyses conducted in this research could be expanded for further conclusions to be made and confirmed. The study can be conducted using a larger sample which would lead to a wider participation range. The sample size in this study was of a moderate size that allowed for basic conclusions. With a wider sample size, the categorization of the organizations can be detailed to describe the key capabilities of the organizations in each category. Using the detailed characteristics, further research can be done to guide organizations in moving from the category they are currently in to become in the master category. 6. Conclusion In this study, the correlation between organizational agility and excellence has been analyzed. Utilizing a detailed questionnaire, the performance of organizations in the UAE was gauged in both domains. The aim was to build a model that would categories organizations based on their capabilities in agility and excellence. With a sample size of 53 organizations, it was found that there is high positive correlation between agility and excellence. This finding confirms the conclusion found in the previous studies about the link between the two domains. Moreover, it was found that the organization size is not a factor that influences the correlation between the two domains. It is possible that this conclusion may differ with a wider sample size. Furthermore, it was identified that the public organizations within the UAE had shown a relatively higher correlation between agility and excellence. This could be due to the initiatives taken by the UAE government in increasing excellent capabilities within public organizations. The model used in this study is to be further developed by taking a larger sample size to gain better categorization of organizations. Moreover, mapping the domains of excellence to those of agility in details so that recommendations for organizations to move from the lower categories into the master category of agility and excellence is to be developed. 2154","karam al-assaf masters of science in engineering management dubai, uae karam.al-assaf@outlook.com dr. slim saïdi associate professor of industrial engineering dubai, uae slim.saidi@rit.edu","References

232,An Investigation Of The Risk Factors Affecting Financial  Sustainability In Non-Governmental Organisations,"financial sustainability is the ability of public administrations to continue now and in the future current policies without causing the debt to rise continuously. both local and international ngos in lusaka have had challenges on financial sustainability. however, there is little evidence on key risk factors affecting sustainability of local ngos in lusaka. this study thus, sought to examine the risk factors that affect the financial sustainability of ngos in zambia. the study took a quantitative approach and a total of 53 respondents interviewed, out of the 65 invited representatives of the local ngos in zambia. inherent risk factors, collateral risk factors and environmental risk factors were used as independent variables while financial sustainability of ngos was the dependent variable. linear regression analysis was used to establish the significance of the effects and correlation analysis was used to establish relationships. the results showed that none of these risk factors has a significant negative effect on financial sustainability of ngos in zambia. despite the mixed coefficient signs, no significant correlations were established. thus, the study recommends a strong need for ngos leaders to set up a clearly defined funding policy and the framework for tracking the financial flows of the organization. in addition, policy makers should consider opening up more partnership opportunity for local ngos and focus much on empowerment programmes so as to level the ground field for all ngo players in zambia.",,"and Recommendations 5.1 Summary of Findings This study sought to investigate the risk factors that affect financial sustainability of local NGOs in Zambia. Three risk factors were established and these are; the inherent risk factors, collateral risk factors, and the environmental risk factors. Each of these factors was measured using some risk components. To arrive at the findings, the study engaged 53 respondents from 53 different NGOs in Zambia. These respondents were the representatives and key informants in their respective NGOs. The study employed three methods of analysis. These were: regression analysis, correlation analysis and analysis of variance. The results of the study revealed that there is no significant negative effect of any of the risk factors on financial sustainability of local NGOs in Zambia. Further, no significant correlation was established in this study. 5.2 Conclusions It is therefore concluded in this study that inherent risk factors, collateral risk factors and environmental risk factors are not key influencers of financial stability of the local NGOs in Zambia. 5.3 Recommendations Based on the findings of this study, the researcher recommends the following: 1. There is strong need for NGOs leaders to set up a clearly defined funding policy and the framework for tracking the financial flows of the organization 2. Policy makers should consider opening more partnership opportunity for local NGOs and focus much on empowerment programmes so as to level the ground field for all NGO players in Zambia 3. Other researchers may also take this piece of writing as a benchmark study in Zambia and extend the scope of this study by including other risk factors that may significantly influence financial sustainability of NGOs.","(ngos): a case study of lusaka ngos hope mutchule nunkwe graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia hopenunkwe@yahoo.com dr lubinda haabazoka director and senior lecturer graduate school of business university of zambia lusaka, zambia lhabazoka@yahoo.com dr esnart mwaba nunkwe research assistant-woman 2 study women and newborn hospital university teaching hospital lusaka, zambia esnart.nyimbwa@gmail.com",
233,A Multi-Criteria Va/Ve Design Case Study For Fabricating  Stainless Steel Equipment 304 And 430,"value analysis is the study of the features of an item and their corresponding cost concerning its ability to perform a function or render a service, on the other hand, value engineering is a technique for product or process function, this technique will provide significant information to the overall function of the product and process. this also provides information about the reduction or elimination of cost for those functions that do not add value to the process or product. a systematic approach is applied to maintain the required quality and reliability of the product or process. the design of the stainless steel rack was based on manual and automated operation, similarly, the fabrication process will merely depend on the design. the design of the product and process were analyzed based on the six criteria: va/ve on material, va/ve on product, va/ve on process, material handling cost, waste/emission, and life cycle cost. the two designs were analyzed based on the trade-off analysis based on the perspective of the designer and customer. the results of the design evaluation for stainless steel overall satisfy va/ve approach. this study recommends 304 stainless racks which have higher corrosion resistance, good mechanical properties, and the least life cycle cost compared to 430 materials. total cost savings will be achieved using 304 stainless steel","corrosion, life cycle cost, trade-off analysis, value analysis","and Recommendation This paper developed a case methodology that will represent the optimum value to the manufacturer and customer using VA/VE approach. The method used is to analyze and interpret the results based on design ranking. The solutions show that high scores from designing a 304 material will give benefits to the manufacturer and customer based on Value Analysis on material, product, process, material handling cost emissions, and its product life cycle cost. Value Engineering is not only advantageous but also necessary because Improvements in the project's functioning frequently result in significant initial and life-cycle cost savings. The assurance that all plausible alternatives have been investigated comes from taking a ""second look"" at the design created by the designers. A thorough review is done to ensure that no costs or scope statements have been overlooked or understated and best value will be obtained.

236,Analysis Of The Implementation Of The Smed Methodology To  Reduce Machine Setup Times And Die Change In The Food,"this research seeks to spread the use of the single minute exchange of die (smed) tool. according to the literature reviewed, there are few investigations where this tool is applied in companies in the food sector. the objective of the study is to conduct an analysis of the research carried out on the implementation of the smed tool in the food industry. a systematic review of the literature was implemented, 3 categories and 7 study subcategories were formed to analyze 30 articles published between 2015 and 2021. it was found that 64% of the articles were concentrated between 2017 and 2019, and that 43% were made in latin america. also, it was found that work methods are the main cause that affects the changeover time and 67% of the articles reviewed mention the increase in productivity as the main benefit. the principal obstacle to the implementation of this methodology is the lack of staff training. the major limitation found in this research is that the cost reduction calculations mentioned are not detailed. for future research, it is recommended to detail the quantification of cost reduction after smed implementation.","lean manufacturing, food industry, productivity, smed","The purpose of this study was to conduct a literature review to determine the main benefit, characteristics, and contributions found by the authors about the SMED methodology. It was found that the main benefit of implementing the SMED methodology, mentioned by 67% of the articles reviewed, is the increase in productivity, reducing die change time by up to 49.43%. Also, the authors describe other benefits such as increased flexibility, quality, lower costs and lot size reduction. Likewise, it was found that the principal cause affecting die change time is inadequate work methods and that the main obstacle for the implementation of this methodology is the lack of personnel training. On the other hand, of the 30 articles reviewed, it was found that 64% were published between 2017 and 2019, and 43% of the studies were conducted in Latin America. The main limitation of the research is that the articles reviewed do not detail the quantification of the reduction of costs after the implementation of SMED, so it is recommended that for future studies a more detailed explanation of the calculation be made, since some articles only mention the value of savings or the percentage reduction. Finally, the main contribution of this research from a business point of view is that it will promote the implementation of SMED in food industries in order to reduce production times and increase productivity. 2210","industry: a literature review mayra alejandra barrantes gerónimo, luz cecilia silva lostaunau and luis jesús córdova aguirre facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura carrera de ingenieria industrial universidad de lima, lima, perú 20170151@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20171479@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, lcordova@ulima.edu.pe","References

238,Simulation Analysis Of A Military Casualty   Evacuation System,"this paper aims to analyse several parameters of the casualty evacuation system and their effects through the simulation platform. a discrete event simulation (des) model is used for the analysis. five scenarios contemplating different fleets' prerequisites for survival, ambulance allocation and casualty treatment allocation parameters are used to test the performance of the military evacuation system. the result shows that change in parameters such as ambulance return time, redeployment time, transport duration etc., effects the time of evacuation as well as the time of resuscitation and damage control surgery. the percentage of casualties that required damage control surgery that received it within the required time is on average, 63.78 % and the waiting time for bed is 0 minutes. in order to facilitate the evacuation of combat casualties, this simulation model supports decision-making. this analysis can also be used to support the resource allocation of the military casualty evacuation system.","casualty, evacuation system, simulation","Time is a very crucial factor for any evacuation system. It is directly related to casualty survivability. On the other hand, proper casualty treatment by providing sufficient logistic support such as beds and transport can make the evacuation system efficient. This study has been conducted to analyse the casualty evacuation system and support the military in decision-making. Evacuation time, resuscitation time and damage control time are evaluated based on different scenarios. Casualty estimation and ambulance allocation to transport casualty are also assessed based on several input parameters in the simulation model. It is found that there is a direct relation between the input parameters and the performance of the evacuation system. However, there are still some shortcomings; for example, it is not enough to come up with a decision by considering a few parameters for analysis. As the evacuation system is a complex system, several factors are related to its performance that needs to be considered altogether. Therefore, further rigorous analysis is needed to make efficient such a complex system like the military evacuation process that can assist the defence planner and decision maker.

240,A Comparative Analysis Of Knowledge Sourcing Strategies  And Innovation: Manufacturing Firms In Highand Middle-,"this study compares knowledge sourcing strategies (kss) employed, and innovation performed, by manufacturing firms in high-income (hi) and middle-income (mi) countries using global innovation data derived from the unesco institute for statistics (uis). kss consists of both closed innovation (internal r&d) and open innovation. this study provides new empirical evidence at country level on the link between kss and innovation across manufacturing firms in hi and mi countries. in the case of r&d activities, evidence from this study reveals that there is a significant different between manufacturing firms in hi and mi countries. manufacturing firms in the former group of country is significantly performing internal r&d greater than in the latter group of country. within hi and mi economies, practicing open innovation in isolation alone does not lead to high level of innovation output. evidence from hi countries shows that other factors such as r&d activities and r& investment that is also supported by iprs are correlated to innovation. the key contribution of this study is to provide new empirical evidence on the comparison of kss – innovation association in the context hi and mi countries that to date is relatively few. relevant theoretical and practical implication are drawn from this study.",,,"income countries arif hartono department of management, universitas islam indonesia (uii) yogyakarta, indonesia arif.hartono@uii.ac.id",
241,Business Process Analysis In Continuous Airworthiness  Management In The Low-Cost Carrier Airline In Indonesia:,"indonesia has an alarming safety level leading to the ban to fly to other countries from 2007 to 2018. even though the government and the aviation industry in indonesia have tried to resolve this problem, reports from the indonesia national transportation safety committee have shown that up until 2021 there were notable numbers of accidents and incidents resulting in a number of fatalities. in this paper, the authors aim to propose a framework for the improvement of the continuous airworthiness business process. we gathered the data from the available studies and applicable regulations. interviews and surveys were conducted with airworthiness experts in indonesia to define the critical success factors of continuous airworthiness. then, we analyzed the current quality process in an indonesian low-cost carrier airline with the compliance management framework. the study shows that the existing business process lacks the critical control point in accordance with the applicable regulation. for further research, business process reengineering can be carried out to take the compliance management process into account.",,"To have a continuous airworthiness business process that fully complies with the requirements and is effective to maintain the safety level of the airline is critical for the future of the company. A thorough analysis of compliance management is sometimes forgotten if the process has been implemented in a long time or has been approved by the competent authority without a deeper analysis of the process effectivity. The study that we conducted on the audit process of an Indonesian low-cost airline can reach to these conclusion: 1. An organization can neglect an existing compliance issue on the business process once a process has been approved by the competent authority, 2. Continuous improvement is important in compliance management to be able to keep the compliance to ever changing regulation. Future research on the improvement of the business process is needed to propose a framework for the improvement of Indonesia's aviation safety.","a case study diaddra pramudito, novandra rhezza pratama, rahmat nurcahyo department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering universitas indonesia kampus ui depol, 16424, indonesia diaddra.pramudito@ui.ac.id, novandra@ui.ac.id, rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id",

243,Therapeutic Landscape And Its Impact On Restorative   Experience And Health Perception,"this research is designed in order to respond to the phenomenon of tourism shifting trends from sightseeing natural landscape to physical health and mental recovery. guided by therapeutic landscape theory and attention restoration theory (art), this study is developed to examine the relationship among the therapeutic landscape (physical, symbolic and social landscape) to restorative experience and health perception. this research is planned to be carried out in three provinces in indonesia (jogjakarta, central java and east java) with tourism destinations which represent the therapeutic landscape contexts. quantitative approach is chosen as a research method, by distributing questionnaires online to tourist respondents. four propositions were developed to explain the relationship between the therapeutic landscape, restorative experiences and the health perception. restorative experience is proposed as mediating variable between the therapeutic landscape and health perception. the contribution of this research is so that tourism management has more innovative steps to meet the aspects of recovery and health that are increasingly becoming tourism demands today. theoretically, is to enrich tourism literature which connect between tourism and health.",health perceptions,"This research is designed in order to respond to the shifts in tourism trends that are meeting more for health needs. Using the theoretical basis of therapeutic landscape and Attention Restoration Theory (ART), this study builds a model that connects the therapeutic landscape (physical landscape, symbolic landscape and social landscape), restorative experience and health perception. Restorative experience consisting of five dimensions (limited extent, fascination, compatibility, being away mentally"" and ""being away physically) act as a mediating variable of the relationship between the therapeutic landscape and the perception of health. The conceptual model of this research is also strengthened by the condition of the post-pandemic community which shows higher demand on a healthier lifestyle and chooses healthy tourist activities. This research will survey tourists who travel, especially in three provinces in Indonesia, namely Jogjakarta, Central Java and East Java. These three areas cover diversity of destinations that have symbolic, physical and social landscape. Quantitative research methods are selected by distributing questionnaires online. The SEM statistical analysis tool (Smart PLS) will be used in analyzing the data due to the presence of two multivariate variables in the proposed model concept (landscape therapeutic - physical, symbolic and social) and (restorative experiences - extent, fascination, compatibility, being away mentally and being away physically). The contribution of this research will theoretically enrich the lack of literature in the field of tourism that combines with health aspects, especially the restorative effect of destinations. In addition, for tourism manager, they should be more aware on the health motivations underlying why people traveling. This awareness is important for the tourism management to develop better destination strategies that cover greater health related benefits in tourism industry.","ratna roostika, muafi senior lecturer universitas islam indonesia ratna.roostika@uii.ac.id, muafi@uii.ac.id tomi agus triono, reno candra sangaji student of doctoral program management universitas islam indonesia 22935006@students.uii.ac.id, 22935005@students.uii.ac.id","references.

244,Bibliometric Analysis Of Publications Related To The  Implementation Of Agile Methodologies In Project,"software development in it companies is a whole process, so it is important to define the ideal methodology before starting a project. this study describes the literature on project management in 2 periods 2010-2019 and 2020-2021, through a bibliometric review of research indexed in scopus and web of science. the vosviewer tool has been used to visualize the relationships between authors and","the main authors, journals, thematic areas","Companies have undergone various changes in their organizations, and in response to this, agile methodologies can satisfy a wide range of software development projects and any other environment, where these small teams work in Sprint and self-organize, allowing them to learn topics and evolve the learning process, valuing collaborative work. Science and research in the IT sector are important for the development of a country, which is reflected in the technological progress of this industry in nations such as the United States and Brazil. This study will modify, identify and show the differences in scientific research on agile methodologies in IT project management before and after the pandemic in internationally recognized databases. It showed that the number of publications on this industry has been increasing and is expected to continue to do so in the coming years; however, there is no evidence of a large number of publications that are related to Covid-19. It must be taken into account that it is important to fully comply with the learning principle of these methodologies in order to adequately achieve autonomous management in agile projects.","management in it companies, in the period 2010-2021 bendezu herencia, paola katherine faculty of engineering and architecture industrial engineering career universidad de lima lima, peru 20171895@aloe.ulima.edu.pe obregon valderrama, rocio fernanda faculty of engineering and architecture industrial engineering career universidad de lima lima, peru 20171079@aloe.ulima.edu.pe garcia-lopez yvan jesus faculty of engineering and architecture industrial engineering career universidad de lima lima, peru ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe","References

245,Why Is The Variation Of Weather Insurance Index Adoption/  Uptake Exhibited As Such Among Small Holder Farmers:,"understanding the reasons why smallholder farmers do not use financial instruments to protect themselves against losses brought on by climate change concerns is currently a subject of rising relevance. getting to the bottom of the underlying issues contributing to this status is important for future designs of financial innovations like a weather insurance index (wii) that can help farmers hedge their losses. therefore, this study considered testing the 5 technology characteristics that rodgers identified for uptake to take place. these include trialability, complexity, compatibility, relative advantage, and observability, covering a period from 2014 to 2020. the study used a concurrent mixed-methods approach to ensure both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the study were considered, given the complexity of the inquiry. the study used purposive sampling to select 4 districts in zambia: choma, petauke, chongwe, and mumbwa using the standard sample size table provided by sekeran (2003), which provided for a sample size of 1024 at a concentration of 0.035 with an accuracy level of 95% confidence. the farmers were interviewed using structured questionnaires. an ibm statistical analysis in social science (spss) was used to analyze quantitative data, and thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. from the study 50.82% of the farmer’s said wii is not consistent with the p-value of 0.001, which was significant, and further, 40.8% of the farmers indicated the importance of bundling the services to have relative advantages of the product with a p-value of 0.001. 47.87% of farmers indicated they were not satisfied with the payout system, with a p-value of 0.001, which was significant. the study concluded that paying attention to the innovation characteristics as suggested by the diffusion innovation theory by rodgers is important and that the theory can extend its views by considering the functionality of the market. farmers do not adopt innovations at the same time, which has practical ramifications for the study’s findings.",uptake,,"testing the theory of technology adoption if it applies, case of zambia joshua munkombwe graduate school of business studies university of zambia, lusaka, zambia joshua@musika.org.zm /mutabi.munkombwe@gmail.com jackson phiri department of computer science the university of zambia, lusaka, zambia jackson.phiri@cs.unza.zm",

247,Assessment Of Assignment Problem Using Hungarian  Method,assignment problem corresponds with the product distribution between demand points and supply points. many algorithms were suggested to find the optimal result. the purpose of this study is to propose an appropriate model to explore the solution to the assignment problem. this paper focuses on hungarian method. this study has conducted a detailed case study to find a feasible solution to the assignment problem. the computational outcomes suggested that hungarian method provides an optimal solution and can handle any complex scenario. the findings of this study can be used as a reference for decision-makers to mitigate production-related risk and adapted to sustainable market changes.,"assignment problem, hungarian method","Future Recommendations Both balanced and unbalanced problems for allocating a task to a particular machine are taken into consideration in this study. To determine whether the approach is more feasible, the total cost for assigning those jobs is computed in both cases. Five jobs are divided among five separate machines in the balanced assignment problem. It was simple to allocate five jobs to five distinct machines because the number of machines and jobs are equal. However, because there are more jobs than machines in the unbalanced problem, a dummy row for the machine is inserted, and its cost is zero. By using the Hungarian Method, it can be demonstrated that the one task for the unbalanced problem that is given to machine 5 has no cost. Because of this, the overall cost of the unbalanced problem is lower, whereas the cost of the balanced problem is higher. Additionally, it can be seen that Jobs 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to the same machines, namely Machines 1, 3, and 4, for both the balanced and unbalanced methods. Job-4 and Job-5, however, have different machines assigned for both techniques due to that false row The second procedure is regarded as being more practical than the first since the total cost in the unbalanced problem is 27, which is significantly lower than the total cost in the balanced problem. However, because machine-5 is hypothetical, it has no associated costs; as a result, the overall cost is lower. In addition, job 5 cannot be assigned to a hypothetical machine; it requires a real machine. The Hungarian Method is therefore inaccurate for problems involving unbalance. However, a balanced problem is doable. A different approach, not the Hungarian Method as shown by the solved problem, can be used to discover the best solution to an unbalanced problem where the extra task can be sent to a real machine.","shahriar tanvir alam lecturer department of industrial and production engineering, military institute of science and technology. dhaka-1216, bangladesh. shahriar@ipe.mist.ac.bd, tanvir.shahriar.tro@gmail.com eshfar sagor, tanjeel ahmed, tabassum haque, md shoaib mahmud, salman ibrahim, ononya shahjahan, mubtasim rubaet department of industrial and production engineering, military institute of science and technology. dhaka-1216, bangladesh. eshfaripe@gmail.com, tanjeelahmed99@gmail.com, tabassumhaque07@gmail.com, shoaib09mahmud@gmail.com, salman.2000.bd@gmail.com, shahjahanttml@gmail.com, mubtasim.355@gmail.com",
248,Development Of A Cost-Effective Cyber-Physical Production  System For The Make-To-Order Industry,"this paper identifies the necessity of a cyber-physical production system development for the make-to-order industry. the uniqueness of the make-to-order industry is that orders are low in production volume but wide in product variety. thus, accurate and real-time data acquisition of the production activity is necessary to support decision-making to respond to customer orders and monitor production activities. the proposed cyber-physical production system utilizes rfid and current sensors to identify the parts and machine activities. the cyber-physical production system is proven cost-effective to the alternative controller-based cyber-physical production system. initial implementation has proven a viable solution and provides benefits to support decision-making in the make-to- order industry.","internet of things, make-to-order","This study has developed a cost-effective CPPS implemented for the MTO industry. The data acquired by the CPPS include part/order and machine activities on a real-time basis. The CPPS development was carried out through three steps: reviewing the as-is system, defining the to-be system, and identifying the gap analysis of the CPPS requirements. Initial implementation in the MTO industry proves that the proposed CPPS could monitor the production progress of customer orders and machining utilization, including setup and cutting time. The data acquisition also provides other potential decision support, such as direct cost evaluation (operator and machine) of each customer order. Future research and development will focus on utilizing learning algorithms to ensure that the response process of data collected by the CPPS can be executed intelligently and autonomously.","anas ma’ruf, rifqi qinthara and muhammad rafif rajendra wiradikara faculty of industrial technology bandung institute of technology bandung, 40132, indonesia maruf@itb.ac.id, rifqiqinthara@gmail.com, rafifrajendra123@gmail.com",
249,A Systematic Review Of The Implementation Of Lean Six  Sigma Tools To Improve The Logistics Of Retail Businesses,"currently, retail businesses must be as competitive as possible, and for this, their logistics system must be efficient and optimal; however, it is known that these have various problems such as longer delivery times, product delivery errors, offering a quality of service that meets customer expectations, etc. to solve these problems, the implementation of lean six sigma tools was proposed, and a systematic review of the literature was carried out to determine which lean six sigma tool is the most frequent and expose the benefits provided to the logistics system of retail businesses. a combination of",,"Based on our research objectives, it can be concluded that the LSS tool mostly used to try to solve the problems within the logistics system of retail businesses is DMAIC. With the application of this tool in the logistics system, it was possible to obtain a 30% reduction in the number of complaints (Nabhani and Shokri 2009), a 33% increase in complete deliveries, a 33% reduction in lead time, and finally, a reduction in annual operating costs of $600,000. It is important to mention that 86.7% of the academic articles studied in the systematic review applied their case studies in large companies in North America, Asia and Europe, which is why, when trying to apply the LSS tools addressed in this research in small companies, the results or indicators may not be as expected. It is worth noting that not many researches were found that applied the VSM or Kaizen tools, the latter has only 3 appearances, which is the least found in the systematic review of the 28 academic articles. Both tools should be considered in future research to discover the benefits they could bring to retail logistics systems. Finally, the main contribution of this research is that the application of the LSS methodology was mostly applied to the industrial sector. So our research demonstrated an original approach in the implementation of LSS to the retail sector in order to expose the benefits that this tools can provide.","renzo melgar torres, néstor javier plasencia machuca and rafael mauricio villanueva flores facultad de ingeniería y arquitectura universidad de lima, perú 20170944@aloe.ulima.edu.pe , 20171199@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, rvillan@ulima.edu.pe","references for Delivery Attributes in Online Retailing, Journal of Business Logistics, vol.

250,"Investigating The Customer Satisfaction On Food Quality,  Service And Environment Facility Of Restaurant X Using","the increasing number of restaurants in indonesia requires more careful monitoring of food safety. consumer perception of food hygiene is useful for assessing restaurant food safety practices. the purpose of this study is to investigate customer satisfaction in restaurant x using a food hygiene perspective. instruments involving three factors i.e., food quality, food service, and environment and facility were developed. the study was done at 3 franchised restaurants in surakarta involving 395 respondents. further, the importance-performance analysis (ipa) was utilized to analyze the data. in addition, as the customers’ demographics, such as gender and age may influence satisfaction, therefore these factors were also evaluated. the result shows that overall, 5 attributes that relate to restaurant facilities and environment, e.g., attribute number 16 (clean and well-maintained kitchen), 17 (clean and well-maintained service area), 21 (clean and tidy garbage disposal area), 22 (clean dining table and the cloth used to clean the table), and 25 (clean and well-maintained toilet), need to be improved. the result also reveals that compared to the male customers the female perceived that more attributes need to be improved. meanwhile, in groups based on age, customers above twenty require more attributes that need improvement compared to the others.","restaurant, food hygiene","An investigation to customer satisfaction on food quality, service quality and environment facility of a restaurant has been done. The result shows that there is a quite different perception on which attributes that need to be improved based on customer groups. However, all groups agreed that kitchen and service area cleanliness need improvement. This study evaluates the customer satisfaction based on demographic profiles. Since customers that have different level of hygiene knowledge may have different perception on restaurant food safety practices, hence forthcoming studies evaluating this factor maybe beneficial.","food hygiene perspectives gusti fauza, aas nurasyiah, kawiji, asri nursiwi and setyaningrum ariviani department of food science and technology faculty of agriculture, universitas sebelas maret surakarta, indonesia gustifauza@staff.uns.ac.id dwiningtyas padmaningrum department of agricultural extension and communication faculty of agriculture universitas sebelas maret, surakarta, indonesia hari prasetyo department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering, universitas muhammadiyah surakarta surakarta, indonesia",
251,Improving Msmes Operational Performance: The Role Of  Knowledge Management And Product Innovation,"in recent years, the fashion industry has experienced high-intensity changes that require innovation activities to support operational performance. although there have been many studies on operational performance, studies on operational performance involving small businesses, especially in the fashion industry in developing countries, are very limited. this study aims to examine the role of knowledge management and product innovation in improving the performance of msmes in the fashion industry. through a hierarchical regression analysis involving 100 msmes in yogyakarta, indonesia, this study finds that knowledge management and product innovation positively affect msmes' performance. in addition, this study also finds the role of product innovation in mediating the effect of knowledge management on the performance of msmes. in general, this study has two contributions. first, in light of the scant literature relating product innovation to the connection between knowledge management and performance, theoretically, this study investigates how product innovation mediates the relationship between these two variables. second, this study provides empirical evidence that can be used to develop policies, to encourage the increased operational performance of msmes in the fashion industry, through the implementation of knowledge management and product innovation.","product innovation, msmes","Although previous research on KM, product innovation, and operational performance has been conducted, there are still some research gaps, as explained in the introduction. Research proves theoretically that KM and product innovation are essential predictors in improving operational performance in the fashion industry in Indonesia. In addition, this study also demonstrates that product innovation has a vital role in explaining the effect of KM on operational performance through a partial mediation effect. Empirically, this study provides empirical evidence that owners and managers can utilize in developing policies to encourage the increased operational performance of MSMEs in the fashion industry through implementing knowledge management and product innovation. Based on the results of this study, owners and managers of MSMEs need to develop KM practices and product innovation to be able to respond to the rapid changes that occur in the fashion industry, related to the shortening of product life cycles due to changes in customer tastes and trends in this industry. Consequently, MSMEs need to invest in things that can improve KM practices and product innovation to respond to market changes with adjustments required by customers. Although the objectives of this study have been met, the study has several limitations. First, the number of respondents in this study is relatively small (100 respondents). Second, this research only focuses on MSMEs in the fashion industry in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. These two things are certainly an issue in the generalization of the results of this study. For this reason, it is necessary to execute similar studies conducted in other areas in developing countries with a more significant number of samples to strengthen the generalizability of this study’s findings in the future. In addition, this research only focuses on the fashion industry, so it is essential to conduct similar research in other industries to strengthen the theory and simultaneously give a thorough analysis of the impact of KM and product innovation on MSMEs' operational performance. 2374","baziedy aditya darmawan department of management universitas islam indonesia yogyakarta, indonesia baziedy@uii.ac.id","References

254,"Sterilizer Box Design For Online Store Courier Services  Dyah Santhi Dewi1, Pinkan Magarena Juanda2, Rahmat Hidayatullah3, Adhitya Galuh","the problems related to covid-19 have not been completely overcome in several counties and transmission is still happening. the covid-19 virus, which can survive for several hours or even days on the surface of objects, can increase the risk of transmitting the virus if the virus is attached to various surfaces of goods. during the pandemic, many people turn to online purchases where packages will be delivered by online courier services. in a pandemic condition like this, logistics companies are no longer only required to be able to deliver packages on time but are also expected to ensure that the delivered packages do not become one of the transmission media for the covid-19 virus or other viruses/bacteria. based on these problems, this study aims to design a sterilizer box to sterilize goods, especially food packages that can be carried by couriers so that packages can be sterilized during the delivery process and are safe for health when received by the recipient of the package. the results of this study provide ideas and initial design concepts of a food delivery service sterilizer box which can later be developed further until it can be commercialized.","covid-19, food package, logistics, online courier","From the results of a series of design stages, this study proposes a sterilizer box design that has several innovations that distinguish it from boxes currently on the market, including: The proposed box offers sterilizer mechanism which use UVC light which is proven to be effective in killing viruses and bacteria. Sterilization also takes place automatically using a magnetic switch sensor. Second, it is expandable box. Third, it is easy to assembly. The proposed material of the box made from canvas that is not too rigid will be easier to adjust. In addition, with the addition of a frame and box, it will make the box easier to install on the motorbike stably. Therefore, the combination of canvas, base box and frame will make the box easy to disassemble and install. It is also proposed to be an Ergonomic design. Boxes generally use canvas without a frame so it is comfortable to use even though it is not strong enough. On OXEN, there are attachments such as frames on the sides of the box to keep it strong when placed on the vehicle. In addition, attachment that is adjusted to the shape of the back will make the rider more comfortable or if when the courier takes the service between passengers, the passenger will feel comfortable even though the box is still installed on the vehicle. Next, is portable (using wheels and carrying luggage). At OXEN, the added features of wheels and luggage carriers that can be adjusted in length to make it easier for couriers to pick up food at a shop that is quite far from the motorbike parking lot, food delivered in large quantities, or the customer's house is far from the motorbike parking lot like in an apartment.","damayanti4, and reyhan ar-rizquanata5 industrial and systems engineering department, faculty of industrial technology and systems engineering, sepuluh nopember institute of technology, surabaya, indonesia. email: dyah@ie.its.ac.id",
255,Prediction Of Peruvian Companies' Stock Prices Using  Machine Learning,"nowadays, the challenges that covid-19 has generated to the financial community that operates within the stock market has generated a greater uncertainty in the profitability and consequently has made this practice more difficult. to overcome that problem the present study aims to develop a model that facilitates this work; this model uses the svr regression algorithm and through technical indicators provide us with the possible trend that the stock may take in the future and thus suggest that the investor in question buys, sells or holds the stock in view of that result. as a result of the project, it was proposed to use 7 technical indicators rsi, macd, roc, wma, obv, the williams indicator and the stochastic oscillator that determine the current market condition. after validating the model, it was concluded that there are different peruvian companies that have been able to overcome the difficulties of the pandemic with enough growth potential during this post-covid period.","machine learning, stocks, forecasting, python","It can be concluded that in this research a price prediction experiment has been conducted using the support vector regression (SVR) model. Technical analysis and fundamental analysis indicators have been used. The data are evaluated by statistical indicators such as RSI, Williams, WMA, MACD and OBV. The model in turn is validated by the confusion matrix which seeks to evaluate the errors and successes of the model. Once the results are obtained, a visual evaluation is made, contrasting the information previously obtained with the results of the matrix and the values that do not pass the matrix will be discarded. Likewise, the technical indicators that denote greater precision are those that involve moments when the market is overbought and oversold, such as the RSI, MACD, ROC, WMA, OBV, the Williams indicator and the stochastic oscillator, Most of these need a large amount of historical data to be validated since there are technical indicators that use up to 26 periods, so using stocks with historical data of less than 2 years results in values equal to 1 in the confusion matrix metrics, which would denote an error in the model.","jose antonio espíritu pera universidad de lima carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20170531@aloe.ulima.edu.pe alexis oneil ibañez diaz universidad de lima carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20173487@aloe.ulima.edu.pe yvan jesús garcía lópez and josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima instituto de investigación científica lima, perú ygarcia@ulima.edu.pe, jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",
256,An Assessment Of The Potential To Recover Gold From Ewaste As A Waste Management Initiative,"this study evaluated the potential to extract gold from e-waste mainly focusing on printed circuit boards (pcbs). e- waste was first separated physically and then went through dissolution. cyanide leaching and aqua regia leaching using various precipitating reagents such as zinc (zn), aluminum (al), na2s2o5, feso4, nabh4 on zn and nabh4 on al. the process was conducted at ph of 11.8 and 12.4. gold extracted through cyanidation leaching with nabh4 on zn precipitation resulted in gold extraction of 99.0% in comparison to leaching with aqua regia with nabh4 on zn precipitation to yield gold content of 91.9%. the e-waste processing plant was assumed to process 20000 tons per annum of pcbs with a gold yield of 1.4 tons and total power requirement of almost 203 000 kwhr. a total capital investment of usd 15 million was required with a payback period of 1.04 years and a return on investment of 0.96. e-waste can be utilized as a raw material to recover precious metals.","economic assessment, e-waste, gold recovery, leaching, metals recovery","Gold can be recovered from e-waste as a value addition strategy. From this study, 38.9% was recovered from the electronic waste mainly composed of the PCBs. Physical separation and hydrometallurgical processing of the e- waste using cyanidation and zinc precipitation resulted in a gold yield of 99.0 % at pH of 11.8 and 12.4. An economic evaluation of gold recovery for an e-waste input of 20 000 tons/year indicated capital investment requirements of USD 15 million. A return of investment of 0.96 was realized, with a payback period of 1.04 years and a breakeven of 33.9% of throughput capacity.

257,"Challenges In Automation A Review  Adil Dhawan,  Parv Jain, Ainesh Dhawan, Piyush Tilokchandani,  M.B.Kiran","automation lessens the amount of repetitive or boring labor that humans must do, which typically results in a better customer experience and lessened stress for your teams. it involves technology that transfers a function individuals perform to pieces of gear or software. a streamlined process with fewer or no manual stages is automation. automation comes in two flavors: attended and unattended. both may be combined in some automated processes. automation has benefits that are frequently attributed, such as higher production rates and increased productivity. less waste results from improved process control because materials are used more effectively. in comparison to human workers, automation systems often complete the production process with less variability. this translates to better safety and more control over the quality of the products. safety of the workers is an important reason for automating industrial processes. it also helps in overall reduction in work hours of factory workers. despite the advancements over the last ten years, businesses will need new automation technology to keep up with demand. personalization at scale will be made possible by integrating human touch into an automated process and using cutting-edge technology like ai and machine learning.","automation, forensics, internet of things, home automation","In contrast to fluctuations or errors caused by humans, an automated system can provide consistent high accuracy results. Productivity will increase, and any time-consuming task will be completed with ease. Automation is viewed as a one of the bigger factors in the market success of robotic systems. Because certain tasks are intricate and require high precision, pure predefined automation will not always be feasible, necessitating the use of real-time sensors and operations. When working in different environments, the robots should automatically recognize parts of it that are relevant to the construction they were designed to perform. When it comes to using automation to handle forensics, the majority of the criticism usually comes from relying too heavily on automated digital forensics which will result in some deterioration of expert level knowledge. When more complex tasks, such as analysis, are automated, the level of judgment rises, as investigators lose understanding of the nitty-gritty concepts of investigation. In the long run, this could lead to poor quality investigations. Internet of Things has enabled organizations to be more agile and forceful in their pursuit of finding new revenue streams. It can potentially change the conventional method of spending money on building, maintaining foundations for various products. In industrial automation, any unplanned stops that are caused due to failure in certain components can then cause production losses. Industrial automation ranges over various kinds of control systems and can be found in a variety of domains. The majority of cervical cancer causes and deaths in a single year occur in low-income countries. Machine learning has recently been used in research studies to aid in the initial screening phase of detection. These techniques necessitate the use of healthcare workers who are comfortable with technology, which is not always the case. The generalized data input practices need to be changed, which will take a lot of work. Data preparation is a time-consuming challenge that, if done incorrectly, might reduce the effectiveness of the model. Everyone involved in the process, including non-medical or non-technical stakeholders, should be able to understand it without any trouble. Institutions who want to modernize their libraries should make sure they have enough funds and time to implement the necessary adjustments to successfully convert to an automated e library. In order to avoid wasting time, money, or energy, planning library automation will include a proper practicality analysis of the project. In the event that the automated system malfunctions or has any issues, there should also be professionals. Automation can only supplement human labor and increase its effectiveness and productivity; it can never totally replace a human. This means that as automation progresses, the operator's skill must also be taken into account. When compared to outdated, unconventional methods, automated systems operate by humans 10 times more responsibly, which increases the risk of unanticipated incidents that are difficult to foresee and account for with fail safes. 2436","school of technology pandit deendayal energy university gandhinagar, gujarat, india adildhawan03@gmail.com","References

262,The Implementation Of Artificial Intelligence In Indonesia’S  Public Service: Challenges And Government Strategies,"artificial intelligence is one of the important parts of industrial revolution 4.0 which has huge potential in public service because it can accelerate processes, automate user tasks, and reduce the number of errors. not only that, but ai could also give $366 billion to indonesia’s gdp in 2030. in indonesia, the implementation of ai in public services—known as e-government—is carried out with the application of information technology. thus, the objective of this article is to explain the implementation of ai in indonesia, especially in public services. this article used the qualitative research method with a literature review design. in examining the materials related to the topic, the authors more focus on secondary data in the form of journal articles, online articles, or government documents. this article showed a result that there are several challenges in ai development in indonesia, including an unsupportive environment, lack of awareness and readiness among indonesian people to use ai technology, inadequate human resources, and poor information and communication technology infrastructures. besides that, indonesia is still depending on imported technology and data misuse happened. to cope with these challenges, indonesia has a plan to use ai technology in several priority issues, such as health, finance, defense, education, tourism, as well as food and biotech. indonesia has invested heavily in media, telecommunications, and information technology. ai can be applied in the help desk in the service unit, analysis of service complaints, directing complaints to the intended agency, and even answering complaints. furthermore, indonesia has succeeded in integrating the government system as a database in the implementation of e-government. its implementation also give a positive impact on local government performance, particularly in four aspects, namely costs, budget, time, and human resources. these four aspects become more efficient and effective in terms of assurance, infrastructure, and employment, so the community needs can be responded—and even fulfilled. the indonesian government needs a regulatory framework that directly supports the requirements and implementation of e-government technology.",e-government,"The implementation of e-government or AI-based public services in Indonesia is conducted through the application of information and communication technology. Indonesia decided to enhance its AI capabilities to keep up with the other countries that have started applying AI in various fields. By implementing AI in public services, the Indonesian government can increase its responsiveness and quality of service to the public, allowing the public to access the governments services more transparently and efficiently, and leveraging the scope and accessibility of government’s services and public infrastructures. However, Indonesia is lagging in the adoption of e-government compared to developed countries. This is Indonesia still struggles to fight some challenges, including (1) the technological literacy of public apparatuses is still low; (2) the inter-governmental system is not integrated; (3) lack of financial support; (4) difficulty to translate the National Development Planning System in digital space; (5) limited access to the Internet; (6) lack of e-leadership; and (7) conflict of interest. Indonesia then implemented several strategies to cope with those challenges. The Ministry of Information and Communication has created a scheme of the national information system which mentioned the relations established by e-government that involved three stakeholders, namely the government, the business sector, and citizens. Indonesia then published the National Strategy for AI (Stranas KA) in August 2020 to provide a blueprint for AI development’s long-term strategy in Indonesia. Besides that, the Ministry of Communication and Information will contribute to improving the utilization and adoption of AI technology in a trustworthy, thrifty, and prudent manner while adhering to the national identity. The government also established a roadmap for the successful deployment of e-government programs in Indonesia. 2478","dr. augustin rina herawati, mrs nina widowati and mrs maesaroh lecturer public administration, faculty of social and political science universitas diponegoro, indonesia augustinrina@lecturer.undip.ac.id, ninawidowati@lecturer.undip.ac.id, maesaroh@lecturer.undip.ac.id","References

269,Comparing Segmentations Based On Clustering Algorithms  To Classify Patients Of Intensive Care Units,"it is common to classify patients that arrive at an intensive care unit (icu) by means of a classification based on gender, age and health record. however, it is interesting and helpful to take advantage of additional data to propose alternative patient segmentation that might help allocate more efficiently the existing infrastructure, supplies, medical staff. in this investigation several icu patients’ segmentations were implemented and compared. different from a supervised task like classification, where datasets have to be a priori labelled to train and to test prediction models, clustering algorithms requires no labelling. instead, data are grouped according to their degree of similarity. the research was carried out following a 4-phase methodology: analysis, design, development, and validation. during the analysis, a large database with record of the medical care received by patients at the icu of a public hospital located in the south of chile was preprocessed and analyzed. during the design, several datasets were prepared to conduct experiments. at this point, the advantages and disadvantages of different clustering algorithms were analyzed and compared, selecting simple k-means algorithm (skma) and expectation-maximization clustering (emc) to proceed with the investigation. whereas skma creates clusters of equal variance, emc assumes a gaussian distribution of data. the phase of development was carried out using the data mining software weka 3.9.6. to complete the investigation, four datasets of five, ten, fifteen, and twenty thousand icu records were used. since no target class was defined, the clustering was the result of applying the selected algorithms: emc and skma. for both cases, different number of clusters (k) were required to establish a comparison. results revealed clear differences in the outputs generated by each clustering algorithm. for instance, with 5 clusters (k=5) emc distributes data in the following proportions: 19%, 15%, 10%, 43%, and 28%. with skma, instead, the proportion were: 44%, 13%, 10%m 9%, and 24%. in conclusion, the investigation showed that popular clustering algorithms such as emc and skma can be used for segmenting not only consumers but also icu patients according to criteria that are not easy to visualize with classical tools and techniques. an adequate segmentation can provide valuable information to help estimate the requirement of medical staff, supplies and infrastructure, and also to define specific healthcare services.","segmentation, machine learning","Contrary to classical segmentation approaches based on geography or demography where clusters are rather evident, segmentations generated using clustering require a deeper analysis. This investigation presented the experimental results of applying two popular clustering algorithms to segment the patients received the ICU of n public hospital. A database containing twenty thousand records was used in this work. Nowadays, clustering algorithms are widely used to identify patterns and classify unlabeled data by means of grouping similar data points in clusters that shares some degree of similarity. This application has been getting more attention in recent years because it can be of great help in decision making for different areas. Including that related to medical care and services. Both SKMA and EMC are iterative optimization methods to cluster data points. Depending on the needs and the number of iteration is possible to determine the optimal number of clusters. Although interesting, it is not always practical. In some cases, when the number of cluster is too large, while few of them concentrate much of the data, other clusters have only a few data points. In this research the optimal number was found to be 8 clusters. With EMC the proportion of the resulting cluster showed that one cluster had 49% of data and four had less than 5% of data. SKMA, instead, generated a more balance set of clusters with proportion that fluctuated between 5% and 30% of data point. An interesting fact is that the size of the larger datasets (DS-05, DS-10, DS-15, and DS-20) affected the proportions of the generated clusters. Is did not occur the same to the smallest dataset DS-05 (5,000 records), independently from the values of k. 2540","carlos hernández, jaime castillo departamento de procesos industriales universidad católica de temuco temuco, chile carlos.hernandez.zavala@uct.cl, jcastill@uct.cl","References

270,A Review On Optimal Planning While Constructing Ev  Charging Stations,"for many academics, determining the placement and size of an electric car charging station could be a brand-new challenge. this study builds a comprehensive objective function that considers geographic data, building costs, and running costs. the cost of the land and the distribution transformer is included in the objective part of construction costs. running costs take into account power supply losses and traffic flow restrictions, which accurately and thoroughly captures the core issue with the placement and sizing of electric vehicle charging stations. electric cars have their challenges of shape, structure, and further optimization. the feasibility of getting a charging station also plays a vital role in the greater effectiveness of these cars.","land cost, distance, supply losses","With the increase in Greenhouse Pollutions and environment degradation, EVs have proved themselves very beneficial. Although, it also uses natural resource which degrades environment but it has greater efficiency and can be optimized further. Cost is the main barrier to the EVs. The usage of petrol, diesel and other type of fuels are costly and soon will not be available. It may end after about a century or so. In lieu of the rising situations, it is necessary to take certain actions to save the planet. Government has also motivated people to use fewer natural resources and take a step towards environment through these different sources. With the tech a inch far, we may acknowledge people to use these type of vehicles and give a helping hand in saving the environment. So, educate the near ones to be smart and choose EVs over the natural vehicles.","dhanrajkumar parghi, mahak pandya, neelkumar patel, siddharth nair and m.b. kiran school of technology pandit deendayal energy university gandhinagar, gujarat, india mahak.pmc19@sot.pdpu.ac.in",
271,Challenges In The Implementation Of The Critical Path  Method-A Review,"critical path method (cpm) is prevalent in construction management. professionals (upper management) of the above discipline use this method to plan a construction project. the field team discarded the plan formulated using cpm because it is a paradox. the paradox is caused by the inability of the field team to adhere to the construction plan made by the upper management using the cpm. it is also the formal plan in the field of construction management and many government agencies perquisite cpm application for completing the project to disburse the first payment to the company. the cpm is cut short by on-site /work management plans which are short-term in nature to complete the project at hand. investigation for the potential drawbacks and their reasons should be done to increase the reliability and thus the efficiency of cpm. the investigation involves the study of action theory which helps in finding out the reasons behind the failure of cpm in completing the project on time parallelly reducing the project cost. deliberative action theory, a type of action theory, is typically used in the development of a project plan which requires planning each project activity by the project manager which is a drawback as proved by the situated action theory. the investigation is supported by visualizing a hypothetical scenario that showcases that the application of the critical path method to complete the project on time is ineffective. it takes an example of a construction company which uses cpm to develop a project plan such that the project is completed on time. based on the investigation hypothesis, some potential improvements for the effective and efficient application of cpm are suggested. the suggestion is supported by a case study that takes an example of a furniture manufacturing company that utilizes cpm and pert to develop a project plan to complete the project on time and at the same time reduce the project costs.","project management, project planning","CPM follows the Deliberative Action Theory because the project is simulated beforehand by the project manager. The problems on the way while using CPM are mentioned above in the overview of the CPM. The main problem is the repeated updating of the network diagram by the on-field management team to factor in the real changes in the network diagram. This is explained by the usage of the above-mentioned action theory in carrying out project planning. (Göksu, 2017; Senior, n.d.) The gap between planning and the ground reality is filled by updating the inputs (activities) to the plan. It comes to notice that updating is not a simple task. It involves a huge opportunity cost in terms of time (man-months) and money to carry out the updating and also finishing the project on time. This cannot be afforded by the client as well as the project manager. (Göksu, 2017; Senior, n.d.) The role of plans and instruction are both pre-decided by the project manager and is proven by the deliberative action theory. A good manager always set out eccentric to the plan and completes the project within the established time limits because he/she knows that perfectly follow of the plan and instructions is not possible because of a difference between the planned project environment and the ground reality. The project manager has also the burden of going awry and not finishing the project, in such cases, the manager has to introspect on his planning and change it accordingly so that future managers don't make such mistakes again. (Göksu, 2017; Senior, n.d.) Also, the nature of the world is hostile that is dynamic in nature preplanning is judged and is often termed as an absurd thing to do at the expense of resources and time.

272,"Challenges In Project Initiation   Tirth Zaveri, Mahatma Patel,  Vandan Shah,","there are various challenges which come in the way of successful project management. the success of any project is defined by how all challenges faced are dealt with. the challenges can even turn into opportunities with proper management and planning. project management is the implementation of specific knowledge, skills, tools, and procedures to achieve the desired project goals. there are five stages for the successful management of the project. this paper presents the major challenges faced in the project management’s step one- project initiation. the project initiation phase broadly defines the project goals. organization comes up with many ideas through brainstorming and then through proper planning ideas are turned into concrete goals for which the whole plan is built up. once the goal is set, stake holders are defined. there are many challenges faced even at the first stage. the few challenges are thoroughly explained in the paper. the major challenges faced during the project initiation stage are assignment of authority, list of task assignment, project cost planning, prioritizing goals and stakeholders list and their expectations. all are to be properly dealt with, else the success of the project is at risk. few research papers are critically reviewed to support the arguments stated. one talks about the “critical issues related to metro rail projects in india '' which specifically talks about the metro rail corridor in delhi. it evaluated the challenges faced by the project manager during the initiation phase of the metro rail project in delhi. the other is about the “automobile manufacturing industry” where the automobile manufacturing industry in india is discussed. it covers the various challenges faced during the setup of a manufacturing plant. these both papers also illustrate the solutions to the problems faced. keyword project management, initiation phase, case study, challenges. 1.introduction project management is one of the most crucial keys to the success of project development and completion. any project's work may be divided into stages, each of which has a set of related activities and builds toward a significant deliverable, making it easier to plan for and manage. once a project milestone is reached at the conclusion of each stage, the stage is considered to have been successfully completed. so, project management is categorized into five stages which are mentioned below in the figure 1: 2561",,"The life cycle of project management is broken down into five stages. Project initiation is the most critical and foremost stage in project management. The process of project initiation is very important. It will determine the success or failure of the project. A recent study revealed that there are five main challenges in project initiation. Know who has the authority or right to have decision-making power over your project. Also, make sure to create a list of all the people involved in this project. With each project, you'll need to identify the project's budget. Next, you must think about who will be affected by this project as a whole. Find out what their needs are, what they want, and what problems they're facing. A successful project is one where all the challenges faced are duly taken care of. Over here as you can see, we took one example of the Delhi metro rail project. Now as we discussed, project management has main five aspects like project initiation, project planning, project execution, project monitoring and control and last is project closure. The project initiation phase is the most crucial phase of any project management. Because successful completion of the project entirely depends on the project initiation phase, if the project manager makes a mistake in the project initiation phase the entire project is affected due to the same. Over here in this review, we assessed the challenges that occur in the project initiation phase of the metro line project in Delhi. Also mentioned the types of challenges that occurred and various solutions taken by the project manager. Project management turns out to be one of the most crucial aspects of any industry. Lack of management skills and incapability in implementing all the individual steps will lead to a decline in production and eventually closure of the plant. An elaborate study was conducted and five to six similar kinds of case studies were analyzed to obtain the details presented. All the steps from land acquisition to environmental clearance need to be followed for the successful implementation of any plant. All these build a foundation on which the future of that particular industry relies. Thus, it can be concluded that by observing all the associated norms and consistently following all the required steps, one can expect the establishment and initiation of an industry with a strong ground hold.","nainil patel, smit shastri and dr. m. b. kiran department of mechanical engineering, school of technology, pandit deendayal energy university, india tirth.zmc19@sot.pdpu.ac.in, mahatma.pmc19@sot.pdpu.ac.in, vandan.smc19@sot.pdpu.ac.in, nainil.pmc19@sot.pdpu.ac.in, smit.smc19@sot.pdpu.ac.in, mb.kiran.sot.pdpu.ac.in",

An Investigation Into Refresher Training Intervals For A,"base intuition tells us that if you don’t keep practicing a given skill set, it will continue to degrade the longer it goes unused. what does this mean for a skill set that only gets used infrequently? how can one be assured that when they need their skills, that they will be in a state that is reliable? this point becomes even more important when the skills set belongs to a technically skilled worker, within a maintenance facility. not only does this affect the quality of the work produced, but also the time taken to perform the task. in this study, learning curve theory is applied to the workforce of a military maintenance facility to firstly, identify the changes to job task time that can be expected due to knowledge and skill degradation, and secondly, to determine training intervention types that address the loss of knowledge and/or skill. through the use of computational experimentation based on discrete event simulation maintenance model output, it was observed that without refresher training intervention, job completion times increased between 14% and 27%. with intervention applied, this increase in completion time can be reduced and maintained at levels as low as 4.14%.","maintenance, workforce planning, defence",,"multi-skilled maintenance workforce capt andrew starka,b, amany aklb, hasan turanb, sondoss elsawahb electrical engineering student aschool of engineering and information technology b university of new south wales b canberra, australia b a.stark@unsw.edu.au, amany.mamdouh@adfa.edu.au, h.turan@adfa.edu.au, s.elsawah@adfa.edu.au",
275,Energy Efficiency In Systems For Pneumatic Conveying By  Solids Feeder,"dry granulate or powder material is transported using the pneumatic conveying of particles engineering method. adriano's doctoral dissertation's goal is to propose a modeling framework for optimizing pneumatic conveying systems' energy efficiency while taking into account the unique bulk properties of the product being transported. the foundation of this study is the technical optimisation of a workflow using information from an industrial operation that is controlled by a programmable logic controller (plc) that executes logical, sequential, and timed activities for plant control. in order to connect with the process operator through a graphical environment interface, the plc interfaces with a human-machine interface and a supervision and control system. it has been demonstrated on an industrial scale that it is possible to control a conveying system using only two input parameters by using mathematics to develop a systematic technique to choose the gas (air) pressure and flow required to operate a pneumatic conveying system in dense phase. as a result, opex is decreased while still operating at predetermined conveying rates with less electricity used. this study applies a methodical modeling technique to optimize energy efficiency in order to lower operational expenditure (opex). since pneumatic conveyance relies heavily on actual data, general models are challenging to develop. these restrictions mean that measuring energy efficiency is typically restricted to a particular experimental set of circumstances. this approach can be modified to increase the energy effectiveness of other kinds of systems for pneumatic conveying.","bulk solids, energy, energy efficiency, optimization",,"dr. adriano gomes de freitas and dr. luis alberto martinez riascos postgraduate program in energy federal university of abc (ufabc) santo andré, são paulo, brazil adriano.gomes@ufabc.edu.br; adriano.gomesdefreitas@monash.edu.au dr. jose eduardo munive-hernandez faculty of engineering and informatics university of bradford west yorkshire, united kingdom agomesde@bradford.ac.uk; jemunive@bradford.ac.uk dr. ruiping zou lab for simulation and modelling of particulate systems (simpas) monash university clayton, australia adriano.gomesdefreitas@monash.edu.au; ruiping.zou@monash.edu",

279,"Mapping Of 4.0 Industry Revolution Enabling Technologies  Catarina De Andrade Lucizano1, Adriano Gomes De Freitas1,2,3,","the manufacturing model developed in the third industrial revolution is going through a disruption process that will permanently change the way goods will be designed, manufactured and delivered to consumers. the fourth industrial revolution or industry 4.0 rises from two main factors: (i) the demands of a rising portion of consumers who are highly connected, whose hyper customized and immediate consumption patterns tend to favor services despite products, and (ii) the breakthrough of digital technologies that permeate various segments of the modern society. for this new industrial paradigm, the purpose is to merge physical and virtual worlds, building environments where data and information will become the great assets of business models and human intervention in the manufacturing process will be even lesser than what's envisioned for the third industrial revolution. however, bringing this concept into reality is not trivial and there is a need for extensive planning of the physical, technological, and organizational transformations that will be needed to achieve its goals. in this work, two aspects of the manufacturing industry's digitalization process will be exploited: its technical requirements and the demanded strategic competencies. in the technical sphere, there is a range of technologies generally considered by the literature as the backbone of industry 4.0. through exploratory research, these technologies will be evaluated, and their characteristics analyzed to identify how they interact with one another and if there are dependencies among them, determining an implementation roadmap that is technically coherent. within the strategic purview, the competencies enabled by these technologies will be associated with the competencies elected by the german academy of science and engineering on its industry 4.0 maturity index (schuh, günther et al., 2020) as necessary to reach this new model's strategic goals. once determining the technical and strategic interactions between the selected technologies, this work proposes a systemic roadmap for the implementation of industry 4.0 enabling technologies that defines a path for the digitization process of the manufacturing industry.",,"This work aimed to investigate the relationship between the technologies associated with Industry 4.0 and the strategic competencies that an industry in compliance with it must display. A set of eleven technologies was identified, among the ones appointed by authors both in the academic and corporate spheres and were considered as the enablers of this new model. It was also observed that most of these technologies have technical interdependencies, which naturally imposes a logical order of implementation. As for the strategic competencies, the ACATECH model of industry maturity assessment was used as a basis for relating the functionalities provided by each technology to the competencies expected in each of the maturity levels. The study accomplishes its objective of establishing a systemic roadmap for the implementation of the Industry 4.0 enabling technologies, however, there are considerations that should be made about its context. The model considers that the industry at issue should be at the highest level of maturity regarding the Third Industrial Revolution, no technical requirements were established prior to the first level of maturity for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Also, the model’s adherence should be tested on a concrete case to confirm whether the theoretical inferences made are applicable.","alexandre acácio de andrade1, júlio francisco blumetti facó ¹ ¹ postgraduate program in engineering and management of innovation ² postgraduate program in energy federal university of abc (ufabc) santo andré, são paulo, brazil catarina.lucizano@aluno.ufabc.edu.br; adriano.gomes@ufabc.edu.br; aacacio@ufabc.edu.br; julio.faco@ufabc.edu.br 3 lab for simulation and modelling of particulate systems (simpas) monash university clayton, melbourne, australia adriano.gomesdefreitas@monash.edu.au",
280,Corporate Compliance Approach To Discrimination-Free  Workplace,"the aim of this work is to analyze how racial diversity groups are structured within several brazilian’s companies. for this, the quantitative research methods building blocks and the indicators from the initiative of the center for studies on work relations and inequalities (ceert) of the ethos institute and of the institute for human rights and business (ihrb) were used. a racial diversity indicator and scrumban methodology were developed to assist in managing racial diversity in companies. due to the fact of the 155 responses obtained through an online form, 60% responded that they had no black employees, and about 71% of the participants reported that there were no objective strategies for increasing black professionals in companies. although there is an increase in the diversity management agenda among different sectors of society, the survey results show that 90% of respondents report that there are no career plans, goals or quotas to reverse the current data related to the lack of black professionals and black women in their organizations. furthermore 56% or about 120 million people—are afro-brazilian, making the country home to the largest black population in the americas.","compliance, equity, diversity","From this study, it can be concluded that there is a misconception when talking about racial diversity, that is, people who consider themselves white do not feel that they belong to a racialized group, and thus, do not discuss training involving racial issues. A relevant data in this study is about 55.40% (89 of the total of 155 participants in the survey) reported that their Institutions are diverse and 69.70% (108 people) believe that diversity is positive for organizations. In contrast, 30.30% (47 people) do not consider racial diversity important in their institution. 2625","jorge costa silva filho program in nanoscience and advanced materials federal university of abc, (ufabc) santo andré, são paulo, brazil jcsfilho@ufabc.edu.br dr. adriano gomes de freitas program in energy, federal university of abc, santo andré, brazil simpas, monash university, clayton, australia adriano.gomes@ufabc.edu.br, adriano.gomesdefreitas@monash.edu dr. rayane stephanie gomes de freitas program in nutrition, universidade federal de são paulo são paulo, brazil freitas.rayane9@gmail.com","References

Based on the Scopus database from 2010 to 2022, 155 articles were obtained from the original, more enormous collection of 218 articles. In the context of this research, this research presents a systematic and bibliometric that focuses on the resilience and design of a sustainable supply chain network taking into account the existence of uncertainty. Bibliometric analysis was performed to find out trends each year, the name of the publisher and the name of the most productive journal, citations and network visualization. Descriptive analysis for publishers who publish the most topics raised is Elsevier Ltd, while for the most journals from Industrial and Computer Engineering. The article by Klibi et al., published in 2010, had the highest total number of citations, but Govindan et al. (2017) had the highest citation ratio per year. A literature study was conducted to determine the methods used in previous studies, consideration of parameter conditions, indicators on economic, environmental and social aspects, and indicators and types of resilience strategies. The results show that this research area continues to grow yearly. It was found that the network design policy taking into account environmental, social, and disturbance aspects began to be done a lot. The various resilience strategies that have been carried out can be developed or combined between these strategies to get the best strategy. So, we encourage future studies in this area. We will also be interested in exploring network design strategies under stochastic conditions close to actual conditions. The limitation of this study is that this study uses a single database, namely Scopus and articles collected from 2010 – March 2022, where the topics discussed can continue to develop over time. Therefore, research on this topic must be repeated in the coming years. Future studies should use a larger sample size with the keywords used. Future research is needed to use mathematical modelling for SSCND to comprehensively consider the presence of disturbances and uncertainties. In addition, there is a need for a combination of resilience strategies in designing networks to obtain optimal goals.","rahmi yuniarti department of industrial and systems engineering, faculty of industrial technology and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember. department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, universitas brawijaya rahmi_yuniarti@ub.ac.id suparno and niniet indah arvitrida department of industrial and systems engineering faculty of industrial technology and systems engineering institut teknologi sepuluh nopember suparno@ie.its.ac.id, niniet@ie.its.ac.id",

299,"Contact Mechanics For A Ball Dropped On An Infinite Plate,  An Update","contact mechanics has been largely used for the prediction of the behavior of material internal stresses due to external interactions. the analysis of these problems in the elastic regime was first done by hertz, who focused on the behavior of the stresses in the near vicinities of the contact. the case of a ball interacting with an infinite plate is a special case of hertz’s theory, which was originally designed for the interaction between two spheres. for this case, classical equations for the prediction of maximum normal pressure and maximum reaction force are still being used, which date as back as 1948. these equations however, seem to significantly overestimate the maximum normal pressure generated by the interactions of these two bodies, an observation also induced by the authors which first derived these results. besides the presence of questionable theoretical basis, a significant proportion of the literature still takes these models as the only and irrefutable source of theoretical estimations. this paper shows the derivation of new contact mechanics equations for the case of a ball being dropped on an infinite plate of the same material. the derivation of these equations takes hertz’s theory as a fundamental preliminary. it assumes a sphere of radius r falling from a vertical distance h from the plate. the contact is assumed to be elastic, and so the work-energy theorem was used to calculate the work to be done by the plate on the sphere to decelerate it. given that the integral solution for the work experienced by the sphere using this method is significantly complex, a series expansion around the origin is used. additionally, given that the change in the independent variable is significantly small, the first term of this expansion results in a good approximation of the original solution. therefore, the proposed model is: 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝑣𝑣) = 𝐸𝐸൝𝑅𝑅2 −ቈ𝑅𝑅−൬5𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌𝑅𝑅2.5𝑣𝑣2 3√2𝐸𝐸 ൰ 0.4 ቉ 2 ൡ 0.5 𝑅𝑅(1 −𝜎𝜎2)𝜋𝜋 where 𝑝𝑝𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝑣𝑣) is the maximum normal stress experienced, e is the young’s modulus, 𝜎𝜎 is the poisson’s ratio, 𝑣𝑣 the speed of the ball right before contacting the plate and 𝜌𝜌 the material’s density. this model, compared to the classical equations, takes into account the ball radius and predicts much lower maximum normal pressures by predicting a lager contact area, as expected.","contact mechanics, dynamic contact, hertz’s theory","In order to prevent material failure, it is crucial to know the loads tolerated by the material and the possible mechanisms of failure. In the literature, very few researches show the derivations for theoretical prediction of load magnitudes in dynamic scenarios. Most of the literature show results derived in the 1940s’, without scrutinizing the validity of such models. In this research, the authors derive new equations for contact mechanics in a dynamic case. In particular, it was possible to derive an expression that predicts the maximum load and pressure experienced by a plate due to a ball hitting its surface after free fall. It was also possible to compare the proposed model with the model mostly used in the literature, fulfilling in this way the objectives of this research. It was observed that the proposed model predicts much lower maximum forces and pressures, being in average five times lower than Davies’ contact model, which has been found to estimate surprisingly high values for pressures and forces in dynamic scenarios. These findings represent a new approach to calculate the contact forces and pressures; an aspect that has been abandoned to date.","carlos garcia-mendoza and neyfe sablón instituto de posgrado universitdad técnica de manabí (utm) portoviejo, ecuador daniel.garcia@utm.edu.ec, neyfe.sablon@utm.edu.ec",

Meanwhile, the lowest correlation is shown in the indirect influence of teacher quality on student achievement through the quality of the learning process at State Madrasah Tsanawiyah Bantaeng. The high correlation of the influence of the role of parents on the quality of the learning process can be seen in the cultivation of high moral values towards students and the formation of good behavior through an emotional approach that is more carried out by teachers or teachers in school. The quality of the learning process achieved by teachers looks better with higher student compliance to follow the classroom and field learning. The learning process felt by students is better and more interesting because teachers can engage students emotionally without showing rigid teaching behavior. This encourages them to be more active in learning activities. Thus, the better the quality of the learning process felt by students, the better the role of parents in the school environment. On the other hand, the lowest correlation was found in the indirect influence of teacher quality on student achievement through the quality of the learning process because some teachers feel indifferent to learning activities and student activities. There are teachers to fulfill teaching obligations and do not want to know further the impact of learning they provide, whether it can improve the achievements of their learners or not.","suhardi, hasmin tamsah, mislia mislia, andi srimularahmah, mardin mardin, munir rauf and hasanuddin rauf sekolah tinggi ilmu ekonomi amkop, makassar, indonesia suhardi@gmail.com, hasmin@stieamkop.ac.id, mislia@gmail.com, andisrimularahmah@gmail.com, mardin@gmail.com, munirrauf@gmail.com, hasanuddinrauf@gmail.com",

314,Applications Of Blockchain Technology For Sustainable  Supply Chain Management Systems,"this paper explores the applications of blockchain technology for sustainable supply chain management systems with an attempt to address the challenges that are facing the manufacturing industry. the supply chain management systems should be viewed as three components, namely, the strategic component, the tactical component, and the operational component. therefore, an intervention requires the ability to trace the root cause(s) to ensure that technology-based solutions are tested through the three main components for usability. a systematic review was used for this paper to explore the applications of blockchain technology for sustainable supply chain management systems. this paper advocates for the application of blockchain on the basis that this technology is “the factory of the future” with the capability of creating transparency and traceability through all phases of the value chain from sourcing materials to final production. the findings suggest that blockchain increases auditing and compliance functionality, reduces costs, and creates a reliable ecosystem shipment process to prevent shipping fraud. it should be conceded that there are technical challenges that cannot be overlooked, hence the evidence still suggests that there is a reluctance to adopt blockchain, which is making the industry lag behind. furthermore, there is the possibility that some industries are still struggling with readiness assessment in order to justify and select the appropriate technologies.",value chain,"and future research The progress of blockchain technology as a field of study has gained popularity across disciplines and industries thanks to the advancement of technologies from healthcare, finance, renewable energy, supply chain, manufacturing, and agri-food value chain management, to name but a few. We also shed some insights on the emerging trends regarding the application of blockchain technology with the contributing factors for adoption and there is no doubt that blockchain is becoming prevalent in all industries’ value chains. Enabling visibility across processes and allowing customers to assess information and track products. Yet, seemingly are areas of improvement needed to address the barriers to the implementation of blockchain technology such as conducting a readiness assessment before the adoption. Furthermore, assessing the technologies’ actual potential within the context of the adopting organization. As a result, we believe that future research needs to investigate the approach or strategies that industries use to justify and select the appropriate technology with a particular focus on supply chain management.","nelson madonsela faculty engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg p.o. box 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa corner kingsway and university road, auckland park, south africa nmadonsela@uj.ac.za patrick toyo faculty engineering and the built environment, university of johannesburg p.o. box 524, auckland park, 2006, south africa corner kingsway and university road, auckland park, south africa nmadonsela@uj.ac.za",

316,Human Resources And Product Innovation Sustainability  With Employee Creativity Mediating Sme Sustainability,"the investigation of human resources and environmentally responsible creativity via the lens of organizational factors is a highly effective, albeit constrained, method for predicting the complex interconnections necessary for the growth of sustainability in small and medium-sized organizations (smes). in an effort to overcome these limitations, the author of this article proposes three models, each of which contains variables operating on two levels: creativity development (operating at the individual level), sustainable product organizational innovation (operating at the organizational level), and sustainability development. the structural equation model was utilized in order to provide feedback regarding the theoretical model. this demonstrates that one's knowledge, drive, and relationships with others can all function as predictors of creative output at the individual level. in addition to this, creativity is investigated in terms of its role as a mediator between the performance of sustainable product creation and human resources. with this approach, small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) have an easier time determining which human resource (hr) factors should be prioritized for product innovation sustainability (pip) performance. this is done with the intention of reducing the impact of the covid-19 problem and creating a more sustainable world. an online questionnaire was given to a selection of java-based small and medium-sized businesses (smes) in indonesia, and their responses were used to compile the necessary data. the conclusions of this investigation provide credence to the most important discoveries, which were: (a) one's knowledge, (b) one's motivation, and (c) one's relationships all have a positive impact on creative output; (d) according to the three models, creative output fully mediates the relationship between human resources and the performance of product innovation sustainability. this study makes a contribution to the existing body of research on human resources and the performance of product innovation sustainability by adopting an approach that draws from multiple disciplines, conducting research at two levels, measuring the majority of the internal aspects of employees (want, emotion, idea, and feeling), and elaborating on the role of employee creativity as a mediator.","creativity, human resources","This research demonstrates two significant conclusions: (a) To create a sustainable PIS, managers must manage and nurture innovation in their employees, regardless of their HR management approach (knowledge, motivation, or relationship). (b) This conclusion shows the models' consistency and stability by accurately finding a positive correlation between creativity and Product Innovation Sustainability in each of the three models investigated individually. The results indicate that regardless of the HR model used, creativity is always an antecedent variable of sustained PIS. The study demonstrates that it is essential that each model produces the critical success characteristics for the growth of creativity and, as a result, sustained PIS. Integrated management systems (intranet) let firms store important data and reduce inefficient management practices like paper use and storage. The findings suggest that inner and extrinsic motivation factors influence creativity and persistent innovation. The results show that formal and informal interactions explain creativity and sustained innovation. Meetings, teamwork, and shared spaces or workplaces have a big impact on fresh idea generation and sustained creativity. Three structural equation models show how knowledge, motivation, and relationships can be used to create corporate talent for Product Innovation Sustainability (Maes and Sels 2013). 6. Limitations and Future Research This could also lead to significant discoveries identifying the types of information, motivation, and relationships that have the greatest impact on creativity and, thus, on Product Innovation Sustainability. Future study should also address the possibility of unifying these three models in order to examine the impact of the HR dimensions in a single, comprehensive model. The work employs an advanced quantitative method, SEM, to evaluate the hypotheses, thus catering to the investigation of causal links with greater complexity. 7. Practical Implications This study underlines the importance of effective HR (knowledge, motivation, and relationships) to achieve the best degree of creative performance and generate more original and helpful ideas for any organization to develop or introduce. Hard assignments that require people to use their abilities and skills can create inner drive (which is important for creativity). To enhance creativity, a company needs a diverse workforce with various personalities. Managers must continuously invest in tacit knowledge (Field and Chan , 2018, Stankevičiūt and Savanevičienė, 2018), intrinsic motivation (Palm and Rosengren, 2020, Kalliath and Chan 2017), and informal connections (Zheng and Xie , 2017) without neglecting explicit knowledge. Innovation necessitates a ""group"" strategy that includes stakeholders (such as employees, customers, suppliers, and governments). On the one hand, interested stakeholders assist in defining criteria and developing new innovation initiatives. Companies are utilizing their highest levels of innovation and human resources to adapt and develop new materials and medical equipment at record speeds in order to combine their lawful commercial interests with the huge societal aims that this field of work necessitates via the ""invisible hand."" Most companies concentrate on a single development objective at a time, and research has not yet addressed how to better incorporate sustainability and human resources into the innovation dynamic (Muñoz-Pascua 2019, Fernandes et al, 2021).","mutmainah; umi marfuah industrial engineering department, universitas muhammadiyah jakarta, jl. cempaka putih tengah 27 no.27/10, rt.11/rw.7, cemp. putih tim., kec. cemp. putih, kota jakarta pusat, daerah khusus ibukota jakarta 10510 mutmainah@umj.ac.id, umi.marfuah@umj.ac.id leni triana management department, bina bangsa university jl. raya serang - jakarta, km, 03 no 1 b (pakupatan) serang-banten, indonesia leni.triana@binabangsa.ac.id andreas tri panudju industrial engineering department, bina bangsa university jl. raya serang - jakarta, km, 03 no 1 b (pakupatan) serang-banten, indonesia andreaspanudju@apps.ipb.ac.id, panudju2002@yahoo.com",

318,The Contribution Of Service Climate And Service Culture To  Service Performance: A Survey On Nadzir In Cirebon,,,"This research concludes that a work climate and work culture that is service-oriented can increase job satisfaction. In the long term it can make a significant contribution to service performance. This research only uses case studies in certain institutions so that in the future it can expand the scope of research using mixed methods. Likewise, the description of the variables used is still very limited and needs to be explored with open-ended questions. The managerial implication that can be contributed is that the nadzir are increasingly understanding and supporting the implementation of the waqf system in the future because they are optimistic that the public will be more confident in entrusting their waqf to the institution. The institution remains committed to managing its waqf to be more productive and beneficial for the welfare of the community. Institutions can continue to learn to become ceed centers for digital-based waqf management so that they can become best practices for other waqf management institutions in Indonesia. While the theoretical implications of this research can contribute to theories related to waqf management from the behavioral aspect of waqf managers, especially nadzir.

Eddy current sensor was tested with an artificial surface defects in order to set the working condition to apply for mass production and separated defective products which found with surface defects. This method can be applied in many various applications including manufacturing field as steel wire production, it can be set as a quality gate where the out-of-specification goods will be eliminated and improve the customer satisfaction. With this method, the failure rate occupied at 26.37% with 182 manufactured products, this defective rate will be calculated as a standard for the output yield. The detected surface defects were also verified by manually pulling back and compared the manual results to those obtained from eddy current sensor during production. There are two kinds of surface scratch, the first one is longitudinal defect with initial point and ending point and the second defect is diamond shape containing an external material. The novelty of this work is providing a state-of-the-art approach to defect the micro defect during a very high speed of machines, it helps to reduce the man power and replace human in terms of quality standard and reduce the failure risk at end user such as flat tire on the road, broken hose wires, etc. In the future works, surface scratches will be analyzed more detail such as cross-sectional, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis, dimensions in vertical and longitudinal direction as well, root cause/origin analysis and perform quality improvement.","kim sang tran vice president bilal global management consulting 10 bandy fields place salford uk kimsang91@gmail.com, kimsang@bilalconsultancy.uk",
320,Introduction Of Virtual Reality Therapy Exposure For  Undergraduate Students With Anxiety During The Covid-19,"social changes in education caused by the covid-19 pandemic have caused the online learning process to be more intensive which has led to an increased sense of isolation and independence, thus becoming a source of pressure for students. continuous pressure can lead to generalized anxiety disorder (gad), a serious mental illness that causes loss of work productivity and decreased quality of life. this mental disorder is most common in individuals with an age range of 18 to 24 years who are at the university level. the most common treatment technique used for gad is cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), as technology develops, this therapy has evolved into virtual reality exposure therapy (vret). the combination of exposure therapy and vr allows users to experience digital versions of anxious real situations. in the diagnosis of gad, psychologists use standard psychometric questionnaires as measurement methods such as the state-trait anxiety inventory (stai) and generalized anxiety disorder assessment (gad-7) questionnaires. recently, another incipient and imperative method of valuation of anxiety has been formed by considering the use of physiological constructs such as eeg. through eeg monitoring, the level of anxiety in individuals can be detected and measured efficiently. in this study, there are two groups of subjects one of which received two anxiety management techniques by vret (mindfulness and imagery) called treatment group and the other received one anxiety management technique by vret (imagery) called control group. the results of this study indicate that the two eeg channels used such as af7 and af8 channels in the treatment group and control group showed a significant decrease in power spectrum after receiving treatment using vret. the use of the stai psychometric questionnaire in this study was carried out to validate measurements with eeg which showed that in the treatment group before vret as many as 63% of the questionnaire results were subjects with high anxiety, and after receiving vret the level experienced a significant decrease which was dominated by subjects with low anxiety as much as 53%. in the control group before vret had questionnaire results as much as 72% of the subjects had low anxiety and the rest had moderate anxiety, then after receiving vret the subject experienced a decrease in anxiety which all subjects had low or minimal anxiety.",eeg,"The study offers interesting results. On the one hand, it confirms the possibility of using VR in the treatment of GAD in that both experimental groups improved clinical outcomes after the end of treatment. This is indicated by a physiological response in the form of a decrease in power on the spectogram which indicates that the subject experienced a decrease in anxiety after undergoing a VRET session. In addition, the results of the STAI Y psychometric questionnaire showed that the subject experienced a significant decrease in anxiety. In conclusion, this study shows that VRET can be used also in the treatment of GAD.

321,Dynamic Model Of Sustainable Development For A Coffee  Supply Chain,"peru has become one of the world's leading producers and exporters of organic coffee, so it is necessary to understand sustainable supply chain initiatives, which involve the 3 axes that encompass it (economic, social, and environmental). in this sense, the importance of risk factors within a supply chain to establish sustainable objectives is recognized. this research seeks to analyze and understand these factors and how they could impact the integration of sustainable development. for this, the methodology for modeling was system dynamics. the results of the research showed the importance of understanding these factors that impact a coffee supply chain, so that with this information the sustainable conditions of production can be improved, since this is the most important factor in a coffee company. in this sense, two scenarios of the possible variability of demand were also presented, at a linear and exponential level, based on the analysis of historical data. when evaluating the scenarios, the linear variation was the best, since it was coupled in a constant and not abrupt manner to the change of carrying out a sustainable management in a coffee logistic chain.",system dynamic,"It is concluded that it is possible to model a supply chain in a system dynamics software that helps to understand and analyze the behavior of the different parameters involved in a coffee logistics chain to integrate the sustainable management of the processes. In this sense, new knowledge was generated to introduce sustainability in a supply chain encompassing coffee production processes. For a better integration it was necessary to investigate and understand the main risk factors that influence a supply chain, finding that the main ones are the following: exchange rate, red-yellow plague, use of green technologies, service level of suppliers, compliance with regulations given by the Peruvian government and the quality of coffee that encompasses agricultural productivity. By identifying each risk, it was possible to understand the influence of each one. This was done to evaluate their impact in the two scenarios presented. First, linear variation of demand and second, exponential variation; the best scenario being the linear growth, since there are better production and customer service indicators.","lesly faustino lucas and ximena aragaki uema universidad de lima, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú 20182594@aloe.ulima.edu.pe, 20180101@aloe.ulima.edu.pe josé antonio taquía gutiérrez universidad de lima, instituto de investigación científica, carrera de ingeniería industrial lima, perú jtaquia@ulima.edu.pe",
322,Strategy Design To Improve Safety On Electronic  Manufacturing,"occupational health and safety are a major problem in manufacturing. from 2019 to 2021, there are still accident cases where there is an increase in the incidence of work accidents from 2019 until now, making it necessary to investigate factors that influence accidents to be able to protect workers. this research aims to investigate the many stressors affecting two forms of stress experienced by workers, physical stress and psychological stress, in order to enhance their performance in terms of safety in a hazardous working environment. using a structural equipment model, this study identified job demand, organizational stress, environmental stress, safety behavior, physical stress, psychological stress, and safety outcome. the study sample of 153 workers who completed questionnaires was developed according to the stressor relationship. based on the result, recommendations are made to workers on how to reduce the risk of injury or accident.","physical stress, safety, employers","In the current study, three regression models were developed to explore the relationships between the three dependent variables i.e., physical stress, psychological stress, and safety outcome and various sets of independent variables. R square values were obtained to explain the percentage of variance in the three dependent variables. The R square value of Model 3 is comparatively low and moderate. This result reveals that, besides the two types of stress identified in the present study, there may be other independent variables that predict safety incident e.g., environment, the job demand and culture of the organization, the individual safety behaviors of coworker, etc. Based on the accepted hypothesis, there are several strategy recommendations, rearranging the machine layout so that movement and handling become small, review and evaluate working hours and job allocation to workers regularly, improve the relationship between workers and superiors, review the guidelines for routine maintenance of personal protective equipment to avoid a decrease in safety behavior and to develop safety policies and practices (a safety program) in the organization.","bidenisa yulfarida siswoyo department of industrial engineering university of indonesia depok, indonesia bidenisayulfarida@gmail.com maya arlini puspasari department of industrial engineering university of indonesia depok, indonesia mayaarlini@ui.ac.id",
323,The Implementation Of Anti-Bribery Management System  Designed To Mitigate The Bribery Risk In State-Owned,"from 2004 to 2020, bribery has been known as the highest type of corruption that occurred in indonesia. at the level of organization and corporation, bribery might affect the execution of tenders and contracts. it also increases costs and risks faced by the organization. bribery has been known as one of the important issues that might lead to the deterioration of business operations and also the reputation of companies. anti-bribery management system (abms) is expected to be one of applicable bribery mitigation strategies that can be implemented widely especially in state owned enterprises (soes). iso 37001:2016 is one of the abms that is implemented by soes in indonesia. the joint decree or surat keputusan bersama (skb) of the indonesia’s corruption eradication comission (kpk), the indonesia office of the presidential staff (ksp), the ministry of home affairs of indonesia (kemendagri), the ministry of national development planning agency of indonesia (bappenas), and the ministry of empowerment of state apparatus and bureaucratic reform in 2018 stated that the implementation of abms in the government and private sector was part of the focus to prevent corruption in 2019-2020. thus, the ministry of soes in indonesia released a regulation that encouraged all soes to implement abms immediately in 2020. this study is intended to study the implementation of the abms in an soe operating in industry, specifically state-owned companies in the agribusiness industry. the implementation of the abms is expected to contribute to the effort to minimizing the risk of legal problems, improve cost efficiency, and also increase company competitiveness as a long-term vision. in this research, the analysis is carried out by analyzing the importance of variable in abms implementation in soes.",bribery,"The result from the data obtained shows that the Operation criteria is one that is considered as most of importance in the implementation of ABMS SNI ISO 37001:2016 in the company. Based on the understanding of operation criteria in the ISO 37001:2016, it implies it is important for the organization to apply both financial and non-financial controls to manage the risk of bribery associated with areas such as procurement, operations, sales, commercial, human resources, legal and regulatory activities. It is also important to supervise the implementation of business processes as well as the creation and implementation of work plans in accordance with the Standard Operational Procedures.

In order to improve the quality and productivity of workers, a specific solution is needed for adjusting the existing work environment at the workstation. From this study, a significant observation and analysis found that the cashiers were working in uncomfortable conditions and uncomfortable postures, as the study has found. This is because of a lack of education and understanding of ergonomics in small medium-scale industry. Several methods had been done to analyze the working condition of the four cashiers from four different companies. The methods include Rapid Upper Limb Assessment, Rapid Entire Body Assessment, Nordic questionnaire, anthropometry data and workspace envelope. This study had come out with a new ergonomic workbench for cashiers. The purpose was to eliminates or minimize the possibilities of getting ergonomics risks or injuries. Example of Musculoskeletal Disorder (MSD) that could be faced by the cashiers are stiffness, muscle strain, vertebral osteomyelitis and slip discs. From this study, the problems that related with ergonomics for the cashiers had been identified. Several methods were implemented to discover and analyzed the problems. A new workbench design also had been created in order to reduce those problems faced by the cashiers. Ergonomics risks can be reduced by implementing ergonomic workbench for workers that could lead to the highest productivity in SME. The new workbench design needs to be fabricated and tested by the cashiers. This could help in finding the flaws of the workbench if it is being tested. Besides that, more workers should be observed and analyzed for their working posture for the further studies. It is because the more the respondents in the study, the more information will be obtained. Limitation this study is the anthropometry data and working envelope measurements. These two data should be considered to obtain more information on the workstation on the suitability with the cahiers. Besides that, the workstation can be design efficiently when the anthropometry and working envelope data taken into account. Next, all industry should aware with ergonomics risks. The company should give proper briefing and training to improve the workers‟ awareness on ergonomics risks. Implementing ergonomic procedure helps to reduce the risk of developing Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs). A good culture of safety increases productivity, morale for workers and retention for workers. Strong integration in ergonomics prevents injury, and increases productivity. With these recommendations, the ergonomics risks in SME industry can be reduced.","halim ghafar, siti nur amalina mohd halidi and syazwan basiron lecturer center for mechanical engineering studies universiti teknologi mara, cawangan pulau pinang permatang pauh campus, 13500 pulau pinang, malaysia norsuhada2319@uitm.edu.my",

328,The Effect Of Split Sleep On Fatigue Based On The Ocular  Indicator: A Train Simulator Study,"fatigue was identified as a contributing factor to accidents in the rail sector. fatigue can be caused by a lack of quantity and poor quality of sleep due to split sleep. split sleep is common in train operations because of the limited rest time. at that time, train drivers had to sleep, pray, contact family, and commute. this study aims to examine the effect of split sleep on driving fatigue. fatigue was measured based on the blink duration and frequency through an eye tracker and subjective questionnaires, karolinska sleepiness scale (kss) and visual analogue scale (vas). nine participants underwent two sleep conditions, namely split sleep and consolidated sleep. split sleep divides sleep into two segments at 05.00–10.00 and 12.00–15.00. meanwhile, consolidated sleep is carried out continuously at 05.00– 13.00. participants were asked to drive a train simulator for 2.5 hours in the laboratory after each sleep state was executed. from this study, it was concluded that there were significant differences in the conditions of split sleep and consolidated sleep. this is caused by increased fatigue based on the blink duration and frequency. however, the kss and vas data did not show any difference between the two sleep conditions. therefore, split sleep can be carried out if needed by maintaining the quality and duration of sleep. improving sleep quality and fulfilling adequate sleep duration (7–8 hours) is carried out as a mitigation strategy to reduce the effect of fatigue due to split sleep. in addition, comfortable lodging in train station can support improving the quality and fulfillment of sleep duration.","fatigue, train driver, split sleep, injuries","This study concludes that split sleep has an effect on fatigue in train driving activities. This is indicated by the higher duration and blink parameters in split sleep than in consolidated sleep. The statistical test results also stated that the two sleep conditions differed significantly based on the blink parameters. However, the results of subjective measurements based on KSS and VAS values did not show a significant difference in the two sleep conditions. However, split sleep still has an effect to fatigue so this condition is not recommended. If the split sleep must be maintained due to the limitations of the train driver's work schedule, the effect of split sleep on fatigue can be reduced by mitigation strategies. The mitigation strategy that can be done is improving sleep quality and fulfilling sleep duration for 7-8 hours in the 24-hour period before driving. Improving the quality and duration of sleep needs to be supported by comfortable sleeping facilities. Comfortable sleeping facilities include a cool room temperature, minimal lighting, and a noise level of less than 30 dB.","sevty auliani, diva andara rahayu morianti, clementine emmanuele tarigantua, hardianto iridiastadi faculty of industrial technology bandung institute of technology bandung, indonesia sevtyauliani@gmail.com, andaradiva28@gmail.com, clementine.emanuele@gmail.com, hiridias@vt.edu",

The main findings are that corporate governance positively and significantly influences the company's performance. Independent commissioners and audit committees are essential in creating good corporate governance by reducing agency conflict. Family control proxied by family directors weakens corporate governance's positive influence on firm performance. It indicates that if the selected directors are not based on competence and only on family relationships will negatively affect the company's management.,"katiya nahda and rifqi kurniarsa faculty of business and economics universitas islam indonesia, indonesia katiya.nahda@uii.ac.id",
330,The Assessment Model To Rank Applicants For Research And  Development Job Position In Pt Abc,"staff turnover has a negative impact on an organization's progress and development. unfortunately, companies commonly experience difficulty replacing departing employees with qualified applicants that fit their job specifications. staff turnover is influenced by the recruitment and selection process, and effective recruitment and selection reduce employee turnover, which boosts an organization's profitability. therefore, organizations must consider getting competent people that fit the company's job specifications from the beginning of the recruitment process, demonstrating the importance of a well-organized and methodical hiring process. this article presents an assessment model to rank the applicants for research and development job positions in a company. the methods used in this model are the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (f-ahp), alfares' weighting method, and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (f-topsis). the selection criteria for research and development job positions were classified into subjective, objective, and absolute factors and customized for pt abc. the expert provided his judgments on the importance of the criteria in fuzzy pairwise comparisons, and the criterion weights were determined using f-ahp. the objective criteria weights were: education 0.039, working experience 0.083, analysis ability 0.274, research ability 0.290, and planning ability 0.312. at the same time, the subjective criteria weights were: interpersonal skills 0.267, software mastery 0.229, problem-solving ability 0.212, english fluency 0.053, and the weight of project management ability 0.239. the alfares method will be used to weigh the sub-criteria. the criteria/sub-criteria and their weights will be used in the assessment model for ranking the candidates in the research and development job to rank potential applicants using the f-topsis method.","applicants’ ranking, fuzzy-ahp, fuzzy-topsis, occupations","In this study, a multi-criteria assessment model was developed that would enable an organization to reduce staff turnover by implementing a well-organized and structured recruitment process. Subjective and objective criteria for the R&D field derived from a previous study have been adapted to the PT ABC condition and resulted in five criteria for each. The weights of the criteria were established using the F-AHP method, while the weights of the sub-criteria were obtained using the Alfares method. Finally, F-TOPSIS was used to calculate the closeness coefficient, and the applicants were ranked as follows: A2 in position 1, followed by A5, A1, A4, and A3. 7. Future Research The multi-criteria assessment method can use methods other than the existing methods in this research, and the company can set new subjective and objective weights according to future needs. Finally, another form of assessment for the model application can be used.

332,Acceptance Model To Use Household-Furniture Of Scrap  Wood Material,"indonesia is in the top ten country with the largest forest around the world in 2020. based on information, the total production of logs in indonesia is 64.42 million. the development of the wood industry is increasing along with the increasing population. the presence of waste from the production can not be used optimally. the production of furniture made from wood waste has basically been carried out. however, it have not known yet for the acceptance of these products in consumers. this research aims to model the acceptance of the use of household furniture made from wood scrap using smartpls. the indicators used in this research have not yet focused on consumer assessment of the characteristics of each product, both those using solid wood and products using wood scrap. so that the acceptance model in this research only focuses on consumer ratings of the two products in general perceived..","consumer behavior, acceptance model, wood scrap, in 1997-1998",,"azam ibrahim ghufran, djoko sihono gabriel and rahmat nurcahyo industrial engineering department faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia kampus ui depok, 16424, indonesia azamibrahim@ui.ac.id dsihono@gmail.com rahmat@eng.ui.ac.id","references, such as the statement (Memon, et al, 2020) that the minimum ratio 
cannot be less than 5 for each statement. This research has 21 observable variables that explain 6 latent variables. So 
that the minimum number of samples needed is 105 (5 x 21 = 105). The number of samples in this research was 216, 
so this number was considered sufficient for this research. 
 
The results obtained from distributing the questionnaires showed that man and woman respondents were almost equal, 
namely 51% for men and 49% for women. This is because the criteria specified in the filling are respondents who 
have experience buying furniture or are married. So that the resulting data is distributed fairly balanced. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Respondent demography (gender) 
 
The respondents who filled out this questionnaire had a fairly diverse age range, namely 35% (Figure 2) were in the 
age range 25-35 years, 26% were in the age range 36-45 years, 25% were in the age range 46-55 years (Figure 2), and 
there were respondents with an age range under 25 years and over 55 years. This is because, the experience of buying 
furniture does not require that someone is married and or someone who is married is not always in the same age range. 
 
5. Results and Discussion 
The specification of the structural model is the definition of the correlation between one latent variable and another 
latent variable. Meanwhile, path diagram is a combination of measurement model and structural model. In the model 
specification, the initial step is to specify the measurement model. This model consists of latent variables and observed 
variables, as well as the correlation of the two types of variables. specifications of the SEM model in research as 
explained in the previous chapter which explains the variables and indicators. In this case, the indicators in the table 
are the observed variables and the variable column is the latent variable. In this research there are 21 variables were 
observed. The following is an initial research model on the factors that influence the acceptance of household furniture

333,Lead Time Loading Dock Reduction In Refined Sugar  Company For Continuous Improvement,"the industry is growing rapidly by combining digital technology and the internet with traditional industries, and industrial production capacity is also increasing during the digitization process. demand for sugar in indonesia is increasing every year in line with the increasing population and the growth of the food and beverage industry, assuming a projected population growth of around 1.25 per cent and the growth of the food and beverage industry by 5-7 per cent per year. the more logistics needed to boost speed without sacrificing precision, the higher the demand. this study discusses the loading dock process and the required lead time. then it focuses on maximizing the loading process time by processing the loading registration process with a digitalization application at a refined sugar company in indonesia. implementing qr codes can speed up the delivery of information and data reports. it can cut down on time wastage by 66 minutes.","sugar, waste, e-kanban, vsm","Implementing QR codes in administrative services has many benefits, including the ability to reduce data input errors and speed up the sugar loading process, can help to identify a lack or excess quantity of goods, know the type of product, feasibility, and quality of the goods to be shipped, reduce human errors in goods inspection, use less paper, and expedite the issuance of the manifest for shipping. Additionally, QR codes can speed up the delivery of information and data reports. The system will be automatically updated in real-time with information from the Order Processing, Truck Weighing, Outbound Checking, Loading, and Stock Take / Opname to ensure that the data obtained is accurate. Thus, adding QR codes to the logistical management system can improve sugar-loading efficiency. To improve the efficiency of the logistics process, the warehouse must integrate this QR code technology into its logistics management system.","yaumil khairoh and farizal f industrial engineering department faculty of engineering, universitas indonesia depok, indonesia yaumil.khairoh@ui.ac.id, farizal@eng.ui.ac.id",
334,Personality Traits In Supply Chain Contracting  Ümmühan Akbay,"in this paper we study the correlation between a decision-making lab experiment on a simple supply chain setting and several personality traits of the decision makers which are measured using out-of-experiment surveys. we consider a scenario of a single manufacturer interacting with a single retailer who faces a newsvendor problem. the manufacturer determines the wholesale price, and the retailer determines the order quantity of the product with random consumer demand. we investigate the effects of self-esteem, regret tendency, (lack of) risk/loss aversion, and (lack of) inequity aversion on manufacturer’s pricing decisions, and retailer’s order quantity decisions. despite the small sample sizes of the experiment our findings indicate that there is evidence for correlation between these personality traits and the contracting decisions of the subjects.",newsvendor model,"In this study we examine the correlation between self-esteem, regret tendency, lack of risk/loss aversion, lack of inequity aversion and supply chain contracting decisions. Our findings show that there is some weak directional support for the hypotheses about the effect of self-esteem, regret tendency and lack of risk/loss aversion. Some of our hypotheses are rejected by the data. Here, we must note that the study is conducted with a limited number of subjects; there were 22 manufacturer-retailer pairs in this study. This sample size is quite small for comparisons we attempted to do in this paper. As a matter of fact the sample sizes in a similar study about newsvendor behavior conducted by Akbay(2016) is much larger and they were able to obtain significant results in their analyses. Hence a further study with a larger sample size seems necessary in order to come up with more definite conclusions. Nevertheless we believe with this study we made an important contribution to the behavioral operations study. 3153","department of management, işık university, istanbul 34980, turkey ummuhan.akbay@isikun.edu.tr murat kaya department of industrial engineering, sabanci university, istanbul 34956, turkey mkaya@sabanciuniv.edu","References

335,Medium-Term Capacity Planning In Servuccion Systems:  Case Study Specialized Outpatient Medical Services,"one of the great problems faced by organizations worldwide is how to guarantee sufficient production capacity to be able to respond efficiently, effectively and effectively to the demands of the different social interest groups that benefit from the supply of goods and / or services manufactured by them. understood capacity as the rate of production that is expected to be achieved and defined this variable with the main responsible for organizations remaining in force within the productive context, since what is not produced is not sold. taking into account the above, it is necessary to operationalize in organizations, methodologies that allow in the long, medium and short term to define in advance the behavior of production capacity and thus prepare organizations to face the high levels of variability faced by companies in terms of market behavior. thus, in the present work we develop a process of planning the capacity of servuccion in the medium term in an organization of specialized medical services (outpatient consultation), based on the aggregate planning of production and operations, also known as sales and operations planning, in which from the development and / or analysis of pure and combined strategies supported in heuristic techniques developed, it is intended to help organizations with similar characteristics, within the economic context where they operate, have sufficient resources, capable of responding to such demands at the lowest possible cost.",servuccion,"Through the development of this work, it can be concluded that: • In the case of health services, it could be said that they behave deterministically, since their daily production process has the clarity of how many patients they will attend, which allows them to somehow observe some stability in terms of sales behavior and this in turn allows the use of linear regression techniques as observed in the case study and especially in the context of the external consultation, with the certainty of obtaining successful results that allow for adequate capacity planning. • As for capacity analysis, it is impossible for the organization to develop a process with a single medical specialist. Since the offer characteristics defined by the IPS require a wide variety of specialists as of today, 21 are available. • It should be noted that from the strategy of fluctuation of demand and the analysis of capacity proposed in scenarios 1 and 2, it could be inferred that the institution under study could function adequately with fewer specialists, efforts should be focused on looking at the possibility of making stable contracts with the required medical specialists and in turn organize a good scheme of scheduling shifts or schedules that allow good availability for the attention to the population demanding the medical services offered by the institution.","hernando garzón saenz ciptec research group - faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias, colombia hernando.garzon@tecnologicocomfenalco.edu.co andrés redchuk etsii. department of computer sciences. university rey juan carlos. madrid. spain. director of operational excellence and process improvement institute. school of engineer. university of lomas de zamora. argentina. andres.redchuk@gmail.com josé manuel solana garzón ciptec research group- faculty of engineering - industrial engineering program - technology in industrial production fundacion universitaria tecnologico comfenalco cartagena de indias - colombia jsolana@tecnologicocomfenalco.edu.co",
336,Perceived Impact Of Hyflex Online Class On The Academic  Performance Of Graduating Engineering Students,"last march 2019, philippines suffered the first wave of covid-19 resulting in most, if not all, educational facilities seizing operations and swiftly shifting into the online learning environment most of us are familiar with. currently, the technological institute of the philippines quezon city (t.i.p qc) has adapted into more flexible learning approaches as the threat of covid-19 slowly dwindles away. with the standard learning approach shifting once again into the new normal, this study aims to explore the effects and impacts of a once again new modality of learning to a graduating engineering student’s academic performance. covid-19 has caused significant changes in how instructors impart knowledge and how students interact with higher education (he). different teaching and learning approaches have been adopted to account for social exclusion, learners' varied requirements, and the fact that they may live far from the he classroom. hyflex is one such mode. in hyflex, instructors instruct learners simultaneously in a physical classroom and synchronously online using video-conferencing tools. in this small-scale exploratory study, graduating students who took a six-week course through hyflex are interviewed about their experiences and opinions. despite communication difficulties between students who attended through various modalities, individuals did value the freedom it provided, according to the findings. the use of several aspects of video conferencing software and other digital tools was considered crucial to hyflex's effectiveness. a quantitative study was conducted using a unidimensional 4-point likert scale questionnaire disseminated through a google form link. respondents are limited to 50 graduating engineering students of t.i.p. qc campus. survey results are further validated through the use of frequency, percentage, weighted mean, t-test, standard deviation, interpretation, and ranking.","covid-19, hyflex, higher education",,"hanz jerald a. atok, kent francis barcelona, earl christian d. palma and donnavil t. valenzuela department of industrial engineering, college of engineering and architecture technological institute of the philippines - quezon city cubao, quezon city, philippines qhjatok1@tip.edu.ph, qkfbarcelona@tip.edu.ph, qecdapalma@tip.edu.ph, qdvalenzuela@tip.edu.ph",

340,Are The Knowledge And Skills Achieved By Students Through  The University Study Congruent With Their Future Career,"engineering professionals work in wide variety of industries and deal with many types of works including design, manufacturing, construction, management of products, processes, services, and supply chains considering the effective and efficient utilization of resources. unlike other majors, content of engineering major could be very wide and vast and involve day to day real life activities. engineering students, therefore, need to develop specific types of skillsets and prepare themselves for the real workplace. although there has been increasing emphasis in the universities to provide more real-life learning experience to their students, there is a lack of studies on the establishment of relationship between students’ career choices and related skills and whether universities are able to provide such skills to their students. no recent study in australia has investigated whether universities are properly equipping their students with necessary skills and knowledge with contemporary industries. a sample of mechanical and civil engineering students were surveyed using a well-designed questionnaire to address this research gap. results show that engineering students surveyed intend to pursue diversified professions and they require specific set of skills. it was found that level of skills achieved by the students widely varied- ranging from 40% to 85%. this study also examined the relationships between skill achievement and gender, cumulative gpa, country of origin and engineering majors.","civil engineering, career choice, skills","This paper examined engineering students’ potential career choice decisions and their perception of the achievement of the required skills and knowledge in pursuit of their career-choices. Working on the data collected from the mechanical engineering and civil engineering students at QUT, Australia, the study finds that mechanical engineering students have more diverse career choice decisions than the civil engineering students. Surprisingly, a number of students opt for non-mainstream engineering careers. The results show a varying level of skill achievement for the student surveyed. While only 27% of the respondents opined that they achieved 80% or above skills required for the chosen careers, more than 70% reported that they achieved 60% or lower of these skills. Interestingly, the skill achievement widely varied across gender, students’ GPA, country of origin and engineering major. The results warrant further comprehensive studies to extract key factors related to students’ skill achievement. Such findings will help universities in moderating curriculum and student support mechanisms to improve students’ knowledge and skills required in pursuit of their career choices. As it is a preliminary study with some limitations mentioned above, concrete conclusions cannot be made and/or findings cannot be generalized. It is expected that further research in this area will help universities in re-engineering the curricula and teaching-learning approaches so that real-life profession-oriented education, knowledge and skills are achieved by students during their study. As this study has been conducted on a single university, future research needs to be undertaken considering larger sample, in particular on the engineering students of more universities in the state or country.","choice? dr sabrina fawzia senior lecturer, school of civil engineering queensland university of technology, australia sabrina.fawzia@qut.edu.au dr kazi saidul islam lecturer, school of business and law cquniversity, australia k.islam@cqu.edu.au azharul karim professor, school of mechanical. medical & process engineering queensland university of technology, australia azharul.karim@qut.edu.au",

344,Relocation Activities For The Development Of Employment  And Competitiveness Situations,"the recent version of the european manufacturing survey (ems) responses was captured in finland by asking companies' ceos or cognizant personnel (n=123) to respond. this study aims to report the results of the following development of competitiveness and employment situations (dces) covering annual turnover (at), number of employees (ne), manufacturing capacity utilization (mcu), return on sales (ros) concerning corporations' operations: relocation activities (ras) converging to offshoring manufacturing performance (omp), backshoring foreign manufacturing (bfm); offshoring r&d (ord); and backshoring foreign r&d (bfrd). the defined research question, ""how do the dces and ras relate?"" was answered by seeking influences directly for at and ne corresponding to all ras positively except negative bfrd. large corporations can be said omp, but the sample also has smaller companies those that bfm. the reason for bfm could be the decreased ros with a statistically significant negative impact during the covid-19 fiscal year 2021.","industry 4.0, offshoring","To answer the first research question, based on the data from the research, companies' production outsourcing activities predicted the extent of total employment and competitiveness development outsourcing activities in terms of annual turnover, such that medium-sized companies with turnover typically transfer production. At the same time, the number of employees refers to reasonably large companies. Concerning the number of employees, the reason for moving operations abroad is primarily cheap labor (e.g., China) - but the printouts are very cheesy from their consistency, as it is only visible in some companies' manufacturing capacity utilization and corresponding returns. Furthermore, this shows that only some things can be successfully carried out in domestic markets, i.e., reasonably weak Finnish entrepreneurs offshore their operations abroad because it may be more profitable in the light of the research results but resembles a risk-taking. A small signal indicates that the production runs fluently and better in foreign operations. When the market is pulling either ostensively or performatively led, it appears as positive returns, so the given recommendation from the sample is to move operations overseas while keeping the core business innovation in Finland. To address the second research question and answer the prospects of companies' backshoring foreign manufacturing operations: whereby companies operating in Finland have recorded a response of forced or volunteering (not directly measured the cause- or reason) to transfer their business back to domestic trade has been processed. At this point, the changes to be announced are expected in the scope of the relocation activities operations for the development of employment and competitiveness situations perspective in terms of annual turnover positively but not equal statistically. However, in terms of the number of employees, there seems to be regularity, meaning that, by and large, companies of the same size belong to a cluster number of employees with a fairly strong connection. This cluster is also affected by a small rising production capacity utilization rate and negative return sales, statistically significantly showing the reason to move back because production costs have increased in the country of production. In order to answer the third research question, we discuss the expected total employment of R&D offshoring and the extent of transfer measures intended to develop competitiveness in terms of annual turnover, which is a fairly positive relationship without equality, i.e., companies have weaker and stronger actors that do not outsource R&D. However. It can appear as an ideal model for companies that do not do this. The motivating result is that if the company offshores R&D operations, the company has a lot to do with the number of employees, so it is worth outsourcing research, but with caution. The justifying factor may be that the company wants to increase its small production capacity. Finally, let us move on to the strict place exchange fence, the fourth research question, to answer how companies' use of backshoring foreign R&D expects the full extent of relocation activities intended to develop employment and competitiveness in annual turnover. It gave negative and statistically insignificant results, but it is a critical topic of conversation in practice. This means that some small companies are bringing their 3225","m.sc.(tech.) janne heilala dissertation researcher, mechanical engineering department of mechanical engineering university of turku, faculty of technology turku, joukahaisenkatu 3-5, 20520, finland janne.p.heilala@utu.fi phd (ie), dsc jussi kantola professor, mechanical engineering department of mechanical engineering university of turku, faculty of technology turku, joukahaisenkatu 3-5, 20520, finland jussi.kantola@utu.fi d.sc.(tech.) antti salminen professor, mechanical engineering department of mechanical engineering university of turku, faculty of technology turku, joukahaisenkatu 3-5, 20520, finland antti.salminen@utu.fi wallace bessa associate professor, smart systems department of mechanical engineering university of turku, faculty of technology turku, joukahaisenkatu 3-5, 20520, finland wallace.moreirabessa@utu.fi","References

345,An Early Supply Chain Model With Sustainable  Manufacturing Perspective To Empower Farmers As Post-,"in indonesia, farmers often become parties with a weak bargaining position, and usually, they can only get a small margin because they often sell their commodity in a raw condition without further process. it is necessary to empower the farmers to become also as post-harvest small and mid-size enterprises (smes) using new appropriate technology to make them enjoy a better margin. because the appropriate technology is a new one especially for farmers, the supply chain for this is still nascent. this paper proposes an early supply chain model with a sustainable manufacturing perspective to empower them. the case study was conducted on a community-based farmer of amorphophallus oncophyllus sp., (in bahasa indonesia called as porang), located in sukoharjo, indonesia. using an appropriate technology with a sustainable manufacturing perspective makes a more efficient and sustainable way to process the commodity for further products and resulting in cost reduction with better quality. using this model hopefully will make farmers enjoy a proper margin and have better bargaining positions.","farmer, sme",,"harvest small and mid-size enterprises in indonesia: a case study muhammad hisjam, cucuk nur rosyidi, eko pujiyanto and eko liquiddanu dept. of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering, universitas sebelas maret jalan ir. sutami 36a, surakarta, indonesia hisjam@staff.uns.ac.id",
346,Determining Vehicle Replacement Year Using Replacement  Model,"the objective of this research is to help the vehicle buyers while deciding of buying a vehicle. this research is based on studying and finding out the maintenance index value of a car. nowadays buying a new car is easier than maintaining it but what if we all had an idea of the maintenance cost and the product cost before buying a car. vmi or vehicle maintenance index is the value or a score number which will indicate the number in the aspect of maintenance cost, depreciation cost and resale value, so the number will lie between 1 to 10 and on that scale. three car companies were considered for this research based on the sales of the companies. for calculating or justifying the vmi we used replacement theory based on cost of asset, maintenance cost for 5 years with the increasing percentage value, the depreciation rates for the cars are kept same as per national insurance depreciation rate. vehicle maintenance index. considering india's car scrapping policy, the mini car has a 15-year lifespan and must be replaced within 15 years. therefore, 15 years it translates to 10 years and gives a certain rating. this rating helps customers choose the most durable vehicle and helps them decide when to replace their vehicle. we marked the vehicle maintenance metrics for three vehicles on the developed base chart. the car's vmi rating, make 1, got a swap rating of 5, so it got its first podium in year 13. this is acceptable, but now a scenario where both make 2 and make 3 got an index value of 3. if you dig deeper here, make 3 has an update year of 10 years, so it would be placed third, but make 2 has an update year of 11 years, so this machine would be placed second to it.","replacement model, automobile, survey, maintenance cost","The main objective of our proposal was to make A vehicle buyer’s life easy, many of us go under the confusion and we suffer in deciding. A customer’s Point of view is he/she likes a car but sometimes the car does not satisfy the budget, the mileage, the maintenance cost for the vehicle but the good thing is in the market the customer gets many more options and he/she can be satisfied. In India, Majority of the people look for better mileage, large space, less maintenance cost qualities in a vehicle with minimum purchase or On-road price. VMI, that needs to be considered while purchasing a new or old model of a Vehicle that can eventually lead to Maintenance free or less maintenance vehicle purchase. This approach helped us to make a difference between the overall maintenance cost proposed by the Company and the best service cost for overall performance. By conducting the survey from 60 people we concluded on a statement about the percentage of people owning Cars as compared to non-owners. Vehicle Maintenance Index number will give us a short idea of how the vehicle will require maintenance in the cost aspect and this research will be immensely helpful for new car buyers. So, when we took a survey and analyzed the data, we found that the customers in Indian are more over maintenance of the car over the other aspects. So, this Vehicle Maintenance Index will help these targeted customers in decision making while buying a Car. Talking about the future scope, this research will help in comparing Internal Combustion Engine cars and Electric Vehicles to give a brief idea that Electric Vehicles will score more in Vehicle Maintenance Index and will convince the customers to buy Electric Vehicles over Internal Combustion Vehicles. Future scope of this research, an online portal would be created were a customer can feed the data like vehicle price, maintenance estimated cost given by company, and customer can get the result of year of replacement for the 3238","dr. varsha karandikar professor, vishwakarma institute of technology, pune, savitribai phule pune university, pune, maharashtra, india varsha.karandikar@vit.edu sunit satpute, utkarsh patil, pranav pahilwan, atul shingade and pranav shinde bachelors in technology, industrial engineering vishwakarma institute of technology, pune, savitribai phule pune university, pune, maharashtra, india sunit.satpute19@vit.edu, utkarsh.patil18@vit.edu, pranav.pahilwan19@vit.edu, atul.shingade19@vit.edu, pranav.shinde18@vit.edu","References

347,Do Human Resources Management (Hrm) Practices  Impact On Seaport Competitiveness?,"efforts at modernising seaports and improve their operational service efficiencies for competitive advantage have remained unabated given the changing demands of shipping customers. to address seaport inefficiencies, most advance nations have generally adopted infrastructural and technological upgrades/implementations. however, this approach has failed to solve the lingering poor seaport performance in emerging economies, suggesting efforts must be directed at other areas to identify and explain the persistent inefficiencies at emerging economies’ seaports. this paper therefore examine whether there is a relationship between seaport inefficiency and hrm practices of the seaports. the study is based on a case study of the nigerian seaport, nigeria being the largest economy in africa. findings reveal that hrm practices have to be fully aligned with seaport business objectives for achieving optimal port competitiveness. specifically, the nigerian seaports’ hrm practices exhibits non- alignment with the business objectives due to unfair staff recruitment and promotion practices leading to poor staff morale, loyalty, commitment and productivity, thereby making the seaports uncompetitive, resulting in significant business diversion to neighbouring seaports. keyword human resources management (hrm) practices, workforce capability, seaport, competitiveness. 1. introduction there have been many challenges facing the users and operators of nigerian seaports over the years. these include corruption, poor management structure and mismanagement (emeghara et al. 2019); logistics and infrastructure deficiencies, regulatory and policy instability and multiple government agencies with overlapping purpose and responsibilities (lagos chamber of commerce and industry (lcci) 2018). these have resulted in the seaports’ inefficiency manifesting in the form of congestion, shortage of qualified manpower, missing cargo, prolong cargo dwell time caused by delay in cargo movement insecurity and illegal charges at the seaports; leading to high cost of operations (lcci 2018). these have led to high cost of trade and undesirable impacts on the competitiveness of the seaports (oruwari 2021), with significant effects on patronage, as cargo meant for nigerian market are now being diverted to neighbouring seaports (hellenic shipping news 2020). given the importance of seaports to the national economy and global competition between seaports for patronage, it is very important to identify and address the factors impacting seaport competitiveness (sc). despite the high importance of the seaport to the economy and several efforts at modernising the seaport at various times by the nigeria government, nigerian seaports remain inefficient and struggle to cope with the country’s volume of export and imports. many studies have been conducted to find the root cause of the inefficiency and many solution have been recommended based on findings. however, the proffered solutions have failed to solve the lingering poor performance of the seaports. this suggest that apart from the challenges associated with poor infrastructure and administrative structure, efforts must be directed at other areas to identify and explain the persistent inefficiencies at seaports that have defied many solutions. without proper identification of the key underlying issues, no meaningful and/or effective solutions can be found. this study therefore focuses on examining whether there is a relationship between seaport inefficiency and human resources management practices of the seaports. nigeria being the largest economy in africa with a gdp of $440.78 billion in 2021 (world bank (wb) 2022) and a very large market with a population of approximately 211 million people in 2021 and a projected population of 217 million people in 2022, has always been of great economic interest locally and internationally (wb 2022). with such potentials, it is expected that her seaports will be efficient to serve as an incentive for economic growth 3240",,"There are two broad implications of this study. These are theoretical and practical. Theoretically, there are two things it will contribute to literature. First is that investment in HR practices will have significant positive impact on workforce capability building in the context of a developing country. The second is that merit-based recruitment and promotion is very vital to improving workforce morale, loyalty, commitment, and productivity in order to improve seaport competitiveness Practically, there are learnings for the seaport managers to improve the competitiveness of seaports. They have to address issues with HR development. They must emphasize merit- based recruitment and promotion and also address issues with working condition of staff to improve productivity. Also, additional provision of modern seaport technology is required. If the issues with HR development and practices are addressed, then this can be used as benchmarking for other African seaports to become competitive. This study has two limitations. The first is that only one variable is considered under HRM practices and SC. Other variables could still be included to broaden the scope. The second is that only the views of seaport managers were sought during the interview. Views of other seaport stakeholders, such as seaport users and customs personnel could be included for triangulation.","kayode adeyemi, shams rahman and muhammad abdulrahman school of accounting, information system and supply chain royal melbourne institute of technology (rmit) university, melbourne victoria 3001 australia s3263857@student.rmit.edu.au, shams.rahman@rmitedu.au, muhammad.abdulrahman@rmitedu.au",

350,The Potential Of Floating House As A Solution For The  Utilization Of Water Area In Indonesia,"indonesia is a large country that has a large water surface and land area. various areas are almost found on the surface of the area. the natural potential has not been touched as a whole in the transportation sector. water transportation management is still limited to certain areas. in detail, indonesia's land area is 1,919,440 km². while the ocean area is about 3,273,810 km².the potential for water transportation can still be developed widely, including tourism potential. the use of floating homes as a means of transportation will develop well if there is innovation and management of water transportation in the territory of indonesia. variations structures and designs that adapt to the natural conditions of certain areas will further enhance other potentials and must be carried out from now on. in addition, it is also necessary to increase reliable human resources for the development of floating ship transportation and the availability of good port infrastructure adjustments","indonesia, floating homes","obtained is that the use of floating houses can be carried out in Indonesian waters. This is because there are already several water areas in Indonesia that have done and live in floating houses. The world's natural conditions are changing day by day, causing high water levels in land areas. The need for the construction of floating houses must begin to be carried out to prevent disasters if one day the surface of the land is submerged in water. The use of technology and the right structure is the main thing that must be considered in designing a floating building. Floating house planning is the use of components in the form of floating buildings to be symmetrical and using construction with light weight, floating shapes and plate materials that do not damage the environment, mooring systems must pay attention to changes in water on the site, and inter-circulation buildings to make it easier for users.

352,The Quality Of Work Life Development At Pt  Telekomunikasi Selular: An Evaluation,"quality of work life is one of the management system approaches to coordinate and connect the potential of human resources, where the quality of work life in the company is a management effort to meet the needs of employees simultaneously and continuously. implementing the right work quality program through fair career development opportunities, conducting proper supervision and working relationships, providing compensation, benefits and rewards in accordance with the salary market and 3ps as well as managing and guaranteeing working conditions and environment is very important, thus the company is expected to can retain the best employees, so that employee turnover is small, commitment, loyalty and optimal performance will be generated by employees.","career development, supervision, compensation","1. Whereas the aspect of career development opportunities must be one of the concerns for company management so that every employee has the same opportunity in developing a career through training organized by the company, but not a few employees have not been touched by career development patterns; the sub-aspects of career development have not gone well, and competency development is still a priority scale based on a high competency gap and active employee involvement. So, it can be concluded that the career development process based on competence has not gone well, as well as the sub-aspects of promotion, rotation, and mutation opportunities. And there is a trend that some promotions are not transparent and not objective, so that if this happens continuously, an unfavorable atmosphere will occur which will lead to low engagement and commitment. 2. Aspects of supervision and working relations carried out by the leadership have been going well, the sub-aspects of supervision and teamwork still need to be improved so that the company's performance will be better, but it is hoped that the company's leaders will continue to improve it. 3. Whereas the aspects of compensation, benefits, and rewards in general, employees have received their rights adequately. The sub-aspects of salary according to the market salary are concluded to be in accordance with the salary market in the telecommunications industry in Indonesia and have been reviewed regularly by adjusting the company's financial condition while compensation based on 3P (pay for person, position, performance) has also been carried out although it still needs improvement. 4. Whereas aspects of working conditions and environment, the company has tried to create a safe, comfortable, and healthy working environment and climate by ensuring employees work in safe and protected conditions including ergonomic facilities so that employees can work healthily, reducing stress and fatigue.","soraya agustina situmorang management department binus business scholl undergraduate program bina nusantara university jakarta, indonesia 11480 soraya.situmorang@binus.ac.id",

354,Mitigate Corrosion Through Cathodic Protection Of Steel  Structures Of Puma Energy In Png,"prevention of puma energy facilities/structures in east and west new britain provinces of papua new guinea from corrosion has solely been based on sacrificial anodes. according to tests and data collected, it has proofed that sacrificial anodes cathodic protection (cp) system do not effectively protects the structures from corrosion. this was one of the main problems faced by puma energy png limited across other cp terminals in papua new guinea. the sacrificial anodes system used by the company has ineffectively protected the structure due to its weak potential difference which solely emits from natural anodes (elements) without any external power supply source to effectively drive the current through. according to the research and study, the possible optimum replacement option is impressed current cathodic protection (iccp). the impressed current cathodic protection system is one of the best methods of protecting and preserving steel structures from corrosion. the impressed system potential is reinforced by external power supply source where anodes potentials further pushes protective current supplied from rectifier units and drive through electrolyte which profoundly protected the structure.",,"According to the data and graphs, it has been noted that both Rabaul and Kimbe CP sites of PNG Puma Energy facilities have been drastically reduced in cathodic protection. The sacrificial anodes potential has been limited and did not functions adequately and thus considered weak and fail as per international CP standard regulations AS2832.1.2015. It has been in dare need of recommendation for possible replacement option. This replacement option is impressed current where in larger structures or numerous quantities of structures, the only reliable techniques use to protect the structure with sufficient and adequate protection and thus its powered by external power supply source that continues to reinforce its potential which is the main advantage. The Puma Energy throughout the country require urgent intervention to phase-lift the sacrificial anodes to impressed current method.

355,Sacrificial Anode Cathodic Protection Of An Underground  Natural Gas Pipeline Using Comsol Multiphysics,"corrosion occurs typically when cathodic protection coating, or other preventative method failed or corroded. in this research, using corrosion and structural modules in comsol multiphysics, the model was created using finite element method. the preventative approach was taken by application of sacrificial anode cathodic protection to pipeline surface by using magnesium anode to protect the cast carbon steel pipeline under various soil types and analyze the safety potential and evaluations were made.","external corrosion, failure","Finally, this research offered a corrosion prevention method for the external part of underground natural gas pipeline. The SACP model were implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics utilizing the Secondary Current Distribution interfaces. In order to prevent these corrosions to occur on the pipeline surfaces, the Sacrificial Anode Cathodic Protection method (SACP) is applied using the COMSOL Multiphysics software. From the results it can be seen that the clay loam soil has a good electrolyte conductivity than sandy soil which has high resistivity. Therefore, SACP of underground natural gas pipelines can be best use in clay loam soil which has high electrolyte conductivity than sandy soil. This method is the simplest and low associated cost method to protect underground natural gas pipelines from corrosion.","ernest akimoula1, ora renagi2 and aezeden mohamed3 1,3department of mechanical engineering 2department of applied physics papua new guinea university of technology aezeden.mohamed@pnguot.ac.pg",
