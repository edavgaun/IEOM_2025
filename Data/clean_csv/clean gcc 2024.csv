The application of tools such as standardized work, the 5S methodology, and the Kanban system significantly reduced operational times and improved inventory management efficiency. Specifically, a 47% reduction in picking time, a 41% decrease in product obsolescence, and a 10.78% increase in service level, meeting industry standards, were observed. These results confirm that integrating Lean Manufacturing principles can generate substantial improvements in the competitiveness and sustainability of SMEs in the pharmaceutical sector.

8,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240025  Integrating Sustainability Into Engineering Education:,"material and energy resources of the world are dwindling, coupled with rapid environmental and ecological degradation. renewability and sustainability have become critical issues. sustainable engineering involves enhancing the design of products, systems, and services to achieve superior environmental and social performance while ensuring economic feasibility. the challenge lies in transforming this broad concept into a robust educational framework with well-defined methods, tools, and metrics for integration into engineering curricula and professional practice. to incorporate sustainability into their curricula, some institutions have experimented with problem-based and project- based learning (ppbl) as a tool. the premise is that use of ppbl promotes cooperative learning, critical thinking, systemic reasoning, creativity, and societal awareness, all key aspects of sustainability. however, developing a practical curriculum presents challenges, including establishing suitable physical learning environments, revising instructional methods and assessment norms, ensuring foundational ppbl knowledge for educators and students, securing institutional support, and more. one specific challenge is deciding whether to create a dedicated course on sustainable engineering or to integrate modules on environmental engineering, green engineering, pollution prevention, waste minimization, and design for the environment within existing courses. the first section of this paper introduces key issues in sustainable development and engineering, the intersection of sustainable, renewable, and recyclable concepts, education for sustainable development, and pedagogy for sustainability. the second section outlines the ongoing efforts to incorporate sustainability content in the mechanical engineering program at our university, detailing a roadmap for curriculum development and providing examples from courses in the applied mechanics and design, and materials and manufacturing streams. the final section touches upon significant challenges in sustainability education, including the practice of sustainability in academia, policy-making challenges, content overload, cultural considerations, and the nuanced distinction between environmental protection and sustainability.",instruction,"This paper explores the importance of integrating sustainability into engineering curricula and the methods for doing so.

The main findings indicate that applying Lean methodologies, such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM), the 5S methodology, standardized work, and Kaizen, significantly contributed to reducing waiting times, improving productivity, and optimizing patient flow. Specifically, there was a 39.3% reduction in waiting time for a consultation, a 97.6% decrease in time spent on reviewing medical histories, and a 33.3% increase in productivity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model in enhancing operational efficiency and service quality in these institutions. The importance of this research lies in its contribution to understanding and practically applying Lean tools in a sector traditionally resistant to significant changes in its operational processes. The study not only demonstrated that it is possible to adapt these methodologies, originally designed for manufacturing, to the healthcare services context, but it also highlighted the need for a systematic and disciplined approach to achieving sustainable improvements. The structured approach based on Lean Service not only enabled greater efficiency in resource management but also fostered a culture of continuous improvement among staff, which is essential for the long-term sustainability of the implemented improvements. In terms of contributions to the field of study, this research provides a comprehensive operational model that can be replicated and adapted in other healthcare SMEs, both within the Peruvian context and in similar settings in Latin America. The successful implementation of Lean tools in this study offers practical guidance for other researchers and professionals in the sector looking to improve operational efficiency and service quality in resource-limited environments. Additionally, by focusing on key areas such as reducing waiting times and standardizing work, this study lays the groundwork for future research exploring the adaptation of other continuous improvement tools in the healthcare sector. Finally, observations and suggestions for future studies are offered. The current research focused on a specific case study within the Peruvian context, so one of the key recommendations is to replicate this study in different types of healthcare SMEs across various geographic regions to further validate and refine the proposed model. Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate the long-term impact of the implemented improvements in terms of financial sustainability and patient satisfaction, which would require long-term follow-up.

10,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240027  A Simulation Approach For Risk Sensitive Selection Of,"in this study, we explore the impact of a system administrator's risk preference on the process of selecting the optimal maintenance policy for systems that experience continuous-time markovian deterioration and may encounter non- self-announcing failures. our focus lies in the comparative evaluation of various maintenance strategies. the decision maker periodically inspects the system at designated decision epochs, identifying its current state as good, poor, or failed. based on this assessment, the decision maker chooses an available action, such as doing nothing, repairing, or replacing the system. when the system fails, the failure may go undetected until the next inspection epoch. the primary objective is minimizing the expected long-run cost rate, encompassing various cost components, including inspection, downtime, and maintenance expenses. through simulation examples, we analyze the effect of various cost parameters on the optimum inspection period and policy using the mean-variance approach, demonstrating a practical application in the process. by examining the system administrator's risk preference, we aim to shed light on its influence on optimal policy selection, thereby providing valuable insights for effective maintenance decision-making in scenarios involving continuous-time markovian deterioration and non-self-announcing failures.",maintenance policy,"that we can draw from Figure 2(a) is that the expected duration of major repair is more critical to determination of the optimal decision between major repair and replacement actions in State 3 than the risk-return trade-off parameter. Figure 2(b) depicts the final two-way sensitivity analysis, where we simulated the impact of ratio 𝜆𝜆12/𝜆𝜆13 against the unit downtime cost 𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑, where 𝜆𝜆12 represents the rate of system transition from State 1 to State 2, and 𝜆𝜆13 from State 1 to State 3. Like in the majority of our previous analyses, trade-off is only between Policies Π3 and Π4 with Π3 appearing dominant in most cases except when 𝜆𝜆12is small compared to 𝜆𝜆13. A small ratio between 𝜆𝜆12 and 𝜆𝜆13 implies a much likely system behavior to fail when in State 1; therefore, a switch from Π3 to Π4 can only be explained by the system administrator's heightened sensitivity to downtime. As downtime costs increase, we also observe that the system administrator adopts Policy Π4 more frequently. 5. Conclusion This paper employs simulation techniques to examine five distinct maintenance policies for a three-state system exhibiting non-self-announcing failures. We model the expected downtime and incorporated it into each maintenance strategy for such a system, where transitions among states are governed by a continuous-time Markov chain. Utilizing renewal theory, we estimate the best inspection interval with the aim of minimizing the long-term average disutility of system operations’ cost. We analyze the implications of our model and assess the sensitivity of our results to variations in model parameters, including the risk preference of the system administrator. The main conclusions derived from this sensitivity analysis are as follows: 1) The optimal maintenance policy and inspection frequency are determined by the trade-off between minimizing downtime and maintenance/replacement costs. Shorter inspection intervals are favored when downtime costs are high to mitigate the impact of downtime despite increased inspection frequency. However, discerning clear trends in inspection frequency across varying replacement costs is challenging due to inherent simulation uncertainties. 2) The best maintenance policy choice is influenced by the interplay between the system manager's risk preference and the unit cost of downtime. More risk-averse managers favor policies that minimize downtime duration despite higher maintenance costs while risk-seeking managers opt for cheaper but longer repair options when downtime costs are low. As downtime costs escalate, policies prioritizing swifter interventions gain precedence across varying risk attitudes. 3) The meantime between major maintenance activities exhibits a transition point where policies favoring economical major repairs give way to swifter replacement actions as that time increases to mitigate escalating downtime costs. A region of uncertainty exists around this transition point, where optimal policies oscillate depending on risk preferences. A more precise theory-based analysis is needed to clarify this uncertainty. 4) When the transition from the initial state to the intermediate degraded state is infrequent, catastrophic failures become more prevalent, necessitating a policy that prioritizes swift replacements to minimize downtime impact. Conversely, policies favoring economical major repairs dominate when this transition is more frequent. As downtime costs escalate, policies emphasizing faster interventions gain precedence, particularly when the transition to the degraded state also increases in frequency. 5) While exhibiting similar trends, a notable decrease arises in the inspection intervals compared to prior work by Keleş et al. (2017), potentially attributable to the contrasting risk attitudes of the system administrators considered. Specifically, the present case's heightened risk aversion and downtime sensitivity likely contribute to the observed variation. However, the compounded impact of combining these risk factors remains unclear, presenting an avenue for further investigative efforts. The proposed model can be extended to encompass systems with additional states and maintenance policies, thereby enhancing its applicability to a broader range of scenarios. Furthermore, incorporating supplementary variables can facilitate the representation of more realistic operational environments, better capturing the intricacies and complexities inherent in real-world systems. However, it is advisable to implement automated data analysis techniques and optimization algorithms to mitigate the computational burden associated with such expansions and streamline the overall simulation process. These computational tools can efficiently identify and optimize the relevant simulation parameters, thereby reducing the overall simulation time and expediting the data analysis phase. Consequently, integrating automated methodologies can significantly enhance the model's versatility, accuracy, and computational efficiency, ultimately contributing to more robust and insightful analyses. 80","maintenance policies for a deteriorating system subject to non-self-announcing failures hamood al-jabri industrial engineer department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, sultanate of oman s122245@student.squ.edu.om niyazi onur bakır associate professor department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, sultanate of oman n.bakir@squ.edu.om","References

The primary findings indicated a marked improvement in key performance metrics following the integration of advanced methodologies such as Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP), demand forecasting, and the Kraljic Matrix. Specifically, the Fill Rate increased by 13.95%, the On Time in Full (OTIF) rate improved by 15.85%, and the cycle time was reduced by 25.49%. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of the proposed model in addressing the inefficiencies prevalent in the supply chain management of fast-food restaurants. The importance of this research lies in its contribution to the operational efficiency and strategic management of supply chains within the fast-food sector. Given the highly competitive nature of the industry, where customer satisfaction is closely tied to service levels and product availability, the study offers a valuable framework for fast- food companies aiming to enhance their supply chain performance. The application of S&OP methodologies, combined with demand forecasting and strategic supplier management, provides a robust approach to synchronizing supply chain activities with market demand, thereby minimizing disruptions and optimizing resource allocation. The contributions of this research extend beyond the immediate context of fast-food operations. By integrating established tools like the Kraljic Matrix with advanced forecasting techniques, the study bridges a critical gap in the existing literature on supply chain management for fast-food companies. It offers a replicable model that can be adapted by other sectors facing similar challenges in managing supply chain complexities. Additionally, the research highlights the role of process standardization in reducing variability and ensuring consistent service quality, a principle that is widely applicable across various industries. In conclusion, this study has laid a solid foundation for future research and practical applications in the field of supply chain management. The successful implementation of the proposed model in the case study demonstrates its potential for broader application in the fast-food industry and beyond. However, further research is recommended to explore the long-term impacts of these methodologies on operational sustainability and profitability. Additionally, future studies could investigate the integration of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, into the S&OP framework to further enhance the accuracy of demand forecasts and the efficiency of supply chain operations.

Specifically, overproduction was reduced by 89.66%, significantly lowering the costs associated with excess inventory. Additionally, the model improved the accuracy of demand forecasting, which resulted in a 75% reduction in the percentage of wrong deliveries, enhancing both inventory management and customer satisfaction. These results underscore the model's effectiveness in aligning production with actual market demand, thereby minimizing waste and increasing the overall efficiency of the operations. This research is crucial as it provides a robust framework for addressing the challenges faced by textile SMEs, particularly in inventory management and production efficiency. The significant reduction in overproduction and wrong deliveries illustrates how Lean tools, such as Kanban, Just-In-Time (JIT), and RFID technology, can transform traditional production processes into more agile and responsive systems. This transformation is essential for textile SMEs operating in highly competitive markets, where the ability to adapt quickly to market fluctuations is critical for maintaining profitability and ensuring long-term sustainability. The contributions of this research to the field of industrial engineering are noteworthy, particularly in applying Lean Manufacturing principles to SMEs within the textile sector. The study provided empirical evidence that Lean tools, when implemented effectively, can lead to significant enhancements in operational performance even within resource- constrained environments. Furthermore, the research highlighted the importance of continuous improvement and employee engagement in sustaining the gains achieved through Lean implementation. This underscores the need for ongoing training and involvement of all personnel in the Lean transformation process, which is vital for the long-term success of such initiatives. In conclusion, while the Lean Manufacturing model demonstrated significant efficacy in the case study, further research is necessary to validate its applicability in other sectors and regions. Future studies should explore the adaptation of the model to different operational contexts and cultures, as well as examine the long-term impact of Lean implementation on business performance. Additionally, there is a compelling need to investigate the integration of advanced technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), into the Lean framework. These technologies could further enhance operational efficiency and competitiveness, offering new avenues for innovation and improvement in the textile industry and beyond.","optimization: a case study in peruvian textile smes renzo rodrigo alexandro tisza-vargas bachelors in industrial engineering facultad de ingeniería, universidad de lima, perú 20152393@aloe.ulima.edu.pe",

20,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240041  A Stewardship Approach To Manage Safety And Quality,"stewardship is defined as the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one's care. it is about doing the right thing even when no one is watching. stewardship encompasses many day-to-day activities; it is not just about financial reporting only. every employee act as a steward as they manage the day-to-day affairs. in daily work, employees are faced with tough decisions, to follow complex or considered irrational policies and procedures. employees are caught between a rock and a hard place to choose whether to get the job done the right way or take the short cut. sadly, where safety and quality are involved, any miss or error could result in huge financial loss, sometimes even life. this paper studies the stewardship approach, in the case of a manufacturing industry, when executing tasks that affect safety and quality systems, to eliminate safety risks and eradicate quality related losses. it also seeks to demonstrate that stewardship is the cornerstone for business success. a case study and observation exercise were completed using task analysis technique. the results of the tasks studied are shared. the findings presented that violation of stewardship principles has severe consequences to safety and quality systems. the study concluded by implementing the stewardship plan to maintain high stewardship controls in safety and quality management systems.","leadership, quality, safety","Over the past couple of years, we have seen increased allegations of misrepresentation of data, failure to follow own procedures and poor stewardship examples making headlines. In some cases, product was recalled from the market causing business crisis. In this study, strengthening stewardship through the stewardship plan, prevented further potential business losses. The loss of $4,575,000 over four years is averaged annually at $1,143,750. Year 2023 at only two events at a cost of $15,000 is significantly the lowest at <1% compared to the previous years’ average. The stewardship plan contributed hugely towards this cultural change. The company stock grew by >10 points. Investors gained confidence and the business gained credibility. The learning is that stewardship, quality, and safety operate under the same principles and operating systems, with stewardship as the core value. Establishing working systems will avoid violations. Automating transactions will protect employees from temptation to take short cuts and eliminate room for errors. It was also discovered that there are employees who always behave right, strive to do what is right to protect the business from risks. These employees’ values are aligned with that of the business and such behaviours is identified already at hiring stage. There is a clear relationship between stewardship approach and effective management of safety and quality systems. Lack of stewardship has an impact on overall business results, profitability, and productivity. Good stewardship increases morale and motivation. High morale and motivation have a direct relationship with all other business measures. Morale is used to measure engagement metrices within the organization. High morale organizations tend to be productive. Happy employees are very productive, competitive, committed to their work and determined to succeed in their jobs. Creating an environment where each employee can contribute and perform at such high level keeps the entire organization engaged and ensures continuously improving business results. The organization achieved and improved its results in a systemic and sustainable way. Employees are continuously identifying risk elimination ideas in their area of work. They ensure losses are highlighted to their leaders and addressed.

While there are improvements in management systems designed to minimize these defects, many industries still face these quality issues. In the beginning, industry increase in process defects has concerned, prompting industry to investigate the root causes more seriously. These defects are often caused by various factors, including outdated machinery, inefficient workflows, and inadequate employee training. Although some strategies have been attempted, such as improving quality control measures and improving workforce development, many have led to increased production costs without corresponding improvements in defect rates. Consequently, the need for a more targeted and effective approach is urgent. To address these quality challenges, this research employs analysis of variance (ANOVA), a robust statistical method. Industries have applied ANOVA to identify key factors that contribute to variance in quality in the weaving process. This analysis allows for the comparison of different variables to determine which have the most significant impact on process results. Industries have checked the critical variables and materials that are related to defect rates, which are essential to develop targeted results. Understanding these relationships is vital to implement effective strategies that improve quality and reduce defects. The findings indicate that width and length contribute more than 45.22% to the variance in quality outcomes, establishing them as crucial areas for optimization. Improving these variables can increase performance and defect reduction efforts. Additionally, the type of thread accounts for 23.06% of the quality variance, further emphasizing its 247","case study yuana delvika mechanical and industrial engineering department, indian institute of technology roorkee, uttarakhand, india industrial engineering department, universitas medan area, indonesia yuana_d@me.iitr.ac.in akshay dvivedi professor, mechanical and industrial engineering department, indian institute of technology roorkee, uttarakhand, india akshaydvivedi@gmail.com","References

A thorough analysis of the vibrational behavior and structural dynamics of HAWT components has provided important new information about how to optimize design parameters for improved dependability and performance. This study has illuminated the complex links between design parameters and modal frequencies by utilizing sophisticated approaches like statistical optimization, 3D modeling, and FEA. This has opened the door to more robust and efficient wind turbine designs. The results of this study highlight how crucial modal analysis is to comprehending how HAWT blades dynamically react to different operating circumstances. A drop in frequency with increasing pole height and a positive association with blade span and pole diameter are two examples of the observed patterns in modal frequencies that demonstrate how design parameters affect structural stiffness and mass distribution. The design of HAWT configurations to reduce fatigue failure, decrease structural vibrations, and maximize energy output is greatly aided by these findings. Combining statistical optimization approaches provides a methodical way to find the best design parameters that result in better performance attributes.

This paper has discussed solar and wind energy resources and other possible resources such as natural gas and crude oil to supply green hydrogen economy demands in Oman. It also discussed the ongoing green hydrogen projects, strategic national hydrogen production plans, and different clean energy hydrogen policies and institutional capacities in Oman. Oman stands to achieve remarkable progress towards a sustainable hydrogen economy by 2050. In fact, it has secured multi-billion US$ investments in green hydrogen within the last three years and currently is auctioning hydrogen energy lands. Also, Oman has established hydrogen research and training institutions and enacted a robust hydrogen policy on land allocation of clean hydrogen to the developers. There are disadvantages concerning the use of electrolysis technology in Oman for the production of green hydrogen, given that these require highly demanded freshwater and may involve very difficult operational conditions. Moreover, Thermochemical cycles could leverage the country’s abundant solar energy and industrial flare gas as heat sources. These methods have a few advantages over conventional electrolysis, in the form of utilizing waste heat and renewable energy, increasing the energy efficiency, and reducing operational costs. They also help with water scarcity having an integrated desalination process. Oman will be able to further diversify its hydrogen production pathways and optimize its local resources with thermochemical cycles, allowing the country to emerge as a leader in sustainable energy as per the Vision 2040. National policies in the future must articulate these concerns and find ways to reduce potential socio-economic and environmental impacts. Further, it is worth investing in research programs for the development of local cost-effective electrolysers suitable for the Omani climate. However, the exploration of new and renewable pathways for hydrogen production (thermochemical route) must be taken into consideration due to its reliance on renewable energy (solar, wind, industrial waste heat).","decarbonization nawaz ahmed, afzal husain, tasneem pervez and sulaiman al obaidani department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, sultanate of oman s143272@student.squ.edu.om, afzal19@squ.edu.om, tasneem@squ.edu.om, sobeidani@squ.edu.om imran khan department of chemistry sultan qaboos university muscat, sultanate of oman imrank@squ.edu.om",

Finally, three scenarios for solutions were evaluated. The first one is to expand the bridge house, increase the width of the left lane, and remove the overhang so that the house becomes four lanes, like the bridge house in the opposite direction. The second proposal is to re-plan the bridge so that it becomes two lanes. The third solution is to close the bridge and divert traffic to the service road. The simulation and analysis program for the three scenarios showed that the first scenario was the best, followed by the second scenario and that the third scenario was not preferred at all and would cause serious traffic problems. In spite of this, it is imperative to recognize certain limitations of the study. The research insufficiently takes into account human behavior and its potential significant impact on the accidents that occurred. Therefore, distractions must be examined to achieve a comprehensive grasp of the underlying reasons.","saudi arabia: a survey-based study moahd khaled alghuson assistant professor department of industrial engineering, faculty of engineering university of tabuk tabuk 47512, saudi arabia malghuson@ut.edu.sa orcid: 0000-0002-3086-434x",
40,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240068  Optimization Of Energy Consumption In A Maritime Transit,"seaports are a major influencer on a country overall economy. saudi arabia is located at the pass ways between the east and the west. more than 90% of shipments are transported by ships. many manufacturers assemble their products in locations that are connecting shipping routes. this study aims to replace jebel ali port by saudi arabian ports while trying to minimize the total fuel consumption for a set of container vessels routes. the transshipment problem was solved through tora optimization software. the solution showed the importance of routing the container vessels through jeddah islamic port, being located to open routes (on the way between the red sea and the mediterranean sea) not like ports located in the arab sea (dead end) and the need for double turns. the results where simulated and animated via arena rockwell software. the results shows the need to re-innovate and expand jeddah islamic port. jeddah islamic port has to be marketed through the available crude oil refinery to motivate the routing of ships through it by lowering the hfo prices.","hfo, terminal, seaport, container vessel","and Recommendations 4.1 Conclusions This paper stated that the main problem is that due to economic competition among countries and that the sea ports are a key factor in the economic growth, and that due to closing of some seaports due to bad economic conditions, this paper tries to motivate the transshipment of container vessels through Saudi Arabian ports instead of “Jebel Ali port"" (One of the 10 most transit ports). This study tries to reduce fuel costs using the transshipment model. Fuel consumption is proportional to the speed of the container vessel. This paper aims to reduce the fuel consumption and re-scheduling traffic at Jebel Ali port to Saudi Arabian ports and try to simulate the results. The modeling and scheduling process of applying the transit model to the Saudi sea ports was tested. The modeled transit network has been simplified into a transportation network in which seaports are interconnected by direct point-to-point connections. The model's objective function is to minimize total fuel burned (MJ) for transporting model container vessels through a simplified route network, the solution of which determines the number of container vessels. The simulation results shows that the total time spent in Jeddah port by a container vessel is 48.79 hours and it is considered slow double the time spent by a container vessel in Jebel Ali port. To summarize, Seaports are under a high competition due to its importance in the overall economy. Many seaports are under bankruptcy due to negative performance. Industrial Revolution is based on many factors including the availability of a port that is active on the routes of shipping companies. Since then, this paper has developed a hub and spoke optimization model that routes the traffic through Saudi ports rather than Jebel Ali port (one of the top 10 transit points in the world). 4.2 Recommendations and Future Study This paper recommends the following: 1- Motivating the container vessels to connect through Jeddah Islamic Port by offering a lower HFO rates. 2- Allowing industrial and manufacturing firms to be located beside the port, to allow the assembly of units and re-export the assembled materials. 3- Supporting the national shipping industry by routing their container vessels through SAJED port. 4- Expanding the SAJED sea port. 5- Re-innovating SAJED port. 6- Benchmarking the Japanese sea ports, which is considered the fastest ports in the world? 335","network mubarak abdullah bahaithm and abdul zubar hameed department of industrial engineering faculty of engineering king abdulaziz university, saudi arabia","References

The things which are laid out in the research deal with PLA, ABS, and Nylon and explain how the layer thickness has to be determined together with the infill density and proper combination of the material that will allow for a suitable balance of strength, flexibility, and weight. The simulations done with MATLAB showed that each of the material has its strength and their characteristics are highly sensitive to the print settings. Stress and strain show how much attention must be paid to the choice of parameters, as excessive internal stresses, or strain weaknesses, for example, can be especially prevalent at material interfaces. Further, the role of weight control in multi-material printing has been highlighted in the study where amendments in layer thickness and infill density lead to significant variations even in the component weight. Therefore, the findings of the present study can improve the knowledge of how multi-material 3D printing can be used to produce parts with enhanced performance for industrial applications. Some of the conclusions made in this study are valuable for enhancing the efficiency of iterative 3D prints, and the findings made in the course of this study open up avenues for further research on novel material pairings and even higher levels of 3D printing. In totality, this research suggests that multi-material 3D printing has a great capability to change or enhance the current manufacturing capacity, due to flexibility provided by this technology, on condition that its design and process improvement are well planned.","complex mechanical components suhail al hikmani, pooyan rahmanivahid and moustafa sheikh salim department of mechanical engineering global college of engineering and technology muscat, sultanate of oman 202221119@gcet.edu.om, pooyan@squ.edu.om, moustafa@gcet.edu.om",

Therefore, proper resource allocation is imperative to reduce the makespan in processing task batches. GA and other biologically motivated techniques, which effectively solve NP-complete problems, often suffer from slow convergence when applied to high-dimensional data. To face these difficulties, an AGA-E technique is proposed for large-scale task scheduling in cloud environments, reducing the makespan and computational time. The method adopts a conditional approach to selecting and tuning parameters, which allows efficient and optimal allocation to multiple tasks with low computational overhead. The task scheduling problem is framed as an objective optimization challenge, in which the number of tasks defines the complexity of the problem. Experiments show that AGA-E outperforms traditional scheduling methods such as Min-Min, Max-Min, AIGA, and SGA in sophisticated large task volumes and provides more efficient solutions in less computational time. Future research will seek to develop an advanced mathematical model to understand the complexities of task scheduling on IaaS platforms, incorporating task dependencies and dynamic variations.

77,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240117  Investigation Of Clad Failures In Aluminum Smelters,"aluminum is a lightweight, durable metal known for its corrosion resistance and high conductivity, making it essential for industries such as construction, aerospace, and automotive. production of aluminum and its alloys is a major industry in oman and the gulf region, and worldwide. aluminum smelting is the process of extracting pure aluminum from its oxide, typically using the hall–héroult process, where alumina is dissolved in molten cryolite and electrolyzed to produce aluminum metal. the anode plant utilizes the söderberg method to produce anodes for the reduction line. a critical component in the anode is the clad, also called the electric transition joint (etj). the clad connects the upper part of the stem (made of aluminum) to the lower part, known as the bracket (made of steel). the middle section of the clad contains titanium, which is explosion-welded on one side and mig-welded on the other, creating a bond between the upper and lower parts. some regional smelting plants have reported repeated failures in the anode clad, which are characterized by elongation or bending. these defects could be caused by uneven stress distribution, high temperatures, and high electrical currents. clad failure resulting in a tilt of more than 16° in the stem can lead to smelting process failure. in one regional plant, there has been a significant increase in clad failures in recent years, despite no reports of such failures in earlier years. the main aims of this study were to investigate the clad failure problem in aluminum smelters, identify the main causes, and recommend appropriate solutions. various methods were used to investigate the clad failure, including visual inspection, x-ray inspection, chemical composition testing, welding strength testing, tensile testing, shear testing, and finite element analysis (fea). the primary causes of clad failure were identified as lack of fusion, lack of penetration, and porosity in the welded joints, as revealed through visual and x-ray inspections of sectioned samples. fea of different sections of the clad, considering the welding layer under mechanical, thermal, and electrical loads, showed that with proper welding quality, the assembly can handle all applied loads without failure. to prevent future issues, it is recommended that welders possess advanced skills (proper licensing and mig welding experience), welding parameters (such as current, welding speed, and shielding gas) be tightly controlled, and environmental factors (like dust and humidity) be minimized.","aluminum smelting, söderberg anode, clad failure, welding defects","This study provides a comprehensive analysis of clad failure in aluminum smelters, highlighting the critical role that welding quality and material selection play in the longevity of the clad. Through experimental analysis and FEA simulations, the study identifies the key causes of failure and proposes practical solutions to mitigate future occurrences. It was found that the main causes of clad failure were lack of fusion, insufficient penetration, and porosity in the welded joints, as confirmed by visual and X-ray inspections of sectioned samples. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of various clad sections, accounting for mechanical, thermal, and electrical loads on the welding layer, demonstrated that with high-quality welding, the assembly can withstand all applied loads without failure. Improvement in welding techniques and welder qualifications, enhancement of material quality of clad and related materials, and more stress on preventive quality control are some of the major recommendations. Implementing these recommendations will improve production efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance the overall reliability of aluminum smelting operations. 617","aadel al niyadi, sayyad zahid qamar, majid al maharbi and faroq al jahwari department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, oman adil.alniyadi@sohar-aluminium.com; sayyad@squ.edu.om, majidm@squ.edu.om, farooq@squ.edu.om","References

It can also be expanded to study the entire process, including both the SOFC stack and the auxiliary component of the plant. The model was calibrated with published data. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the cell's electrical voltage reaches a maximum value of 818 mV at 1050℃ and Uf at 0.85. Also, cell electrical voltage increased from 746 to 822 mV as operating pressure increased from 1 to 10 atm. However, the accuracy and flexibility of the model are limited by the methods and correlations used to calculate cell voltage, which rely heavily on semi-empirical relationships. To address this limitation, ongoing efforts are focused on developing a model grounded in fundamental phenomena rather than empirical relationships. This updated model is currently in development, with plans to refine the correlations based on its outputs.

The predictions were then inverse processed using the scaler to revert them to the original data scale, facilitating a direct comparison with the actual results. The models' performance was assessed using root mean squared error (RMSE), a prevalent statistic in regression tasks that quantifies the average amount of the discrepancy between predicted and actual values. Figure 2 plots a clear visual comparison of how closely each model’s predictions aligned with the true data points. The LSTM model’s predictions, shown in orange, generally followed the trend of the actual values but exhibited some lag during rapid market changes. The TPOT model’s predictions, shown in green, appeared to track closer to the actual values, particularly during periods of high volatility. The comparative analysis of the two models revealed several key insights. Firstly, both models demonstrated a strong ability to capture the overall trend in the financial time series data, indicating that both LSTM and TPOT are viable options for this type of forecasting. However, there were notable differences in performance, particularly in how each model handled periods of rapid market change. The LSTM model, despite its sophistication and ability to capture long-term dependencies, struggled slightly during periods of high volatility. This is likely due to the inherent difficulty of predicting sudden market shifts, which are often influenced by factors outside the scope of the data provided. In contrast, the TPOT option, by optimizing over a broader range of potential models and hyperparameters, was able to produce predictions that were more responsive to these changes. This suggests that the AutoML approach was effective in identifying a model configuration that better captured the dynamics of the financial market. Figure 2 illustrates the comparative forecasts of the LSTM and TPOT-optimized models, emphasizing market volatility over training epochs. This investigation evaluates the forecasts of both models during significant market occurrences. Periods of instability and economic announcements are characterized by significant fluctuations in real market prices. The TPOT model exhibits superior alignment with real data during high-volatility periods, underscoring the efficacy of AutoML in adapting to rapid market fluctuations. The LSTM model exhibits a delayed reaction to these fast changes, indicating constraints in its adaptability to sudden external factors. 645","effectiveness: a new frontier for volatile stock markets. mariam ait al, said achchab ensias, mohammed v university, rabat, morocco mariam aital@um5.ac.ma , s.achchab@um5s.net.ma younes lahrichi iscae, casablanca, morocco ylahrichi@groupeiscae.ma","References

To better understand the nature of innovative ecosystems, we developed an agent-based modeling simulation. This calibrated simulation model serves as a valuable what-if analysis tool, enabling policymakers to evaluate and validate their strategic recommendations without the need for real-world experiments, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. By allowing for the exploration of various scenarios and potential outcomes, the simulation offers insights into how different factors may influence the dynamics of the ecosystem. As such, it facilitates informed decision-making and strategic planning in the context of innovation. Looking ahead, our future work will prioritize the integration of real-world data into the model to enhance its calibration and operational effectiveness. This process will involve collecting empirical data from established innovative ecosystems, which will allow us to refine the model's parameters and improve its predictive capabilities. By utilizing actual data, we aim to make the simulation more representative of real-world dynamics, thereby increasing its accuracy and relevance. Gathering this data will entail collaborating with various stakeholders within innovative ecosystems, including businesses, research institutions, and government agencies. We will seek to understand the unique characteristics and performance metrics of different ecosystems, focusing on factors such as the types of collaborations, knowledge flows, and innovation outcomes that can impact the overall effectiveness of the ecosystem. Incorporating this empirical data will not only bolster the model's reliability but also enhance its utility for policymakers. By providing a data-driven basis for simulation, we can offer more precise insights into the potential impacts of different strategic decisions. This will empower policymakers to test various scenarios, evaluate the implications of their choices, and ultimately foster environments that promote innovation and economic development. Additionally, we envision that this iterative process of calibration will facilitate continuous improvement of the model. As new data becomes available and as innovative ecosystems evolve, we can update the model to reflect these changes, ensuring that it remains a relevant and powerful tool for analysis and decision-making. Ultimately, our goal is to create a robust framework that not only aids in understanding existing innovative ecosystems but also supports the development of new strategies for enhancing their effectiveness and impact. 657","management emad summad department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, sultanate of oman esummad@squ.edu.om mahmood al kindi department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, sultanate of oman kindim@squ.edu.om ichraq ouhmidou department of mechanical and industrial engineering sultan qaboos university muscat, sultanate of oman s117436@student.squ.edu.om alzahra al kindi gate10 amlak tower, floor p, 23rd july st muscat, sultanate of oman http://www.gate10.om/ alzahra@gate10.om","References

86,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240132  A Lean Six Sigma Approach To Continuous Improvement,"the lean six sigma approach to continuous improvement in the pharmaceutical industry emphasizes the importance of maintaining consistent quality and operational efficiency due to stringent regulatory requirements and the high cost of defects. this research investigates the practical implementation of lean six sigma methodologies, specifically the dmaic (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) framework, in optimizing the tablet compression process for a specific type of medicine in tablet form, referred to as abc tablets. the continuous improvement methodologies, rooted in the historical foundations of six sigma—which began with carl friedrich gauss's concept of the natural curve and later evolved through walter shewhart’s quality control charts—are employed to systematically identify and address variability issues inherent in the manufacturing process using statistical tools such as control charts and cause-and-effect diagrams. developed at motorola in the late 1980s by bill smith and mikhel harry, the aim of the six sigma approach is to reduce variation in major product quality characteristics to levels where failure or nonconformities are extremely unlikely. by employing targeted interventions inspired by both lean philosophy and six sigma principles, significant improvements in process capability, yield percentages, and defect rates are achieved. the findings also demonstrate a substantial reduction in variability, leading to increased process reliability and product quality; for instance, process capability indices improved, yield percentages rose from 85% to 95%, and defect rates dropped from 10% to 2%. this underscores the tangible impact of lean six sigma methodologies on enhancing operational efficiency and product quality in pharmaceutical manufacturing. additionally, the research highlights the importance of sustained improvements through rigorous control measures, ensuring long-term benefits and fostering a culture of continuous improvement within the industry. this research serves as a valuable case study for the broader application of lean six sigma in the pharmaceutical industry, providing a structured approach to process optimization and quality enhancement.","lean six sigma, dmaic, tablet compression","and Recommendations This research study demonstrates the significant benefits of applying Six Sigma principles, particularly through the DMAIC framework, within the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector. The systematic analysis of the tablet compression process revealed the impact of variability on product quality and identified key areas for improvement. By following the DMAIC approach, improvements were observed in process efficiency and product quality at various stages. The Define phase highlighted critical issues such as manual procedures and maintenance lapses, setting the stage for targeted solutions. In the Measurement phase, historical data provided insights into process performance, guiding improvement initiatives. The Analysis phase identified sources of variability and root causes of non-conformance, informing intervention strategies. The Improve phase focused on addressing identified issues through error-proofing and process enhancements, leading to significant improvements. The Control phase ensured the sustainability of improvements through rigorous monitoring and documentation, fostering a culture of quality and continuous improvement. Collaborating with a pharmaceutical firm validated the effectiveness of Six Sigma methodologies in driving operational improvements. The research-maintained validity through internal control, consideration of external applicability, and diverse data collection methods. In conclusion, the research underscores the impact of Six Sigma DMAIC methodology in optimizing pharmaceutical processes and improving product quality. The recommendation for pharmaceutical organizations is to consider adopting Six Sigma, focusing on DMAIC, to enhance operational efficiency and product quality.

88,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240134  Exploring The Adoption Of Emerging Technologies To,"public procurement systems play a critical role in the functioning and governance of national economies, responsible for acquiring goods, services, and infrastructure that support public services and national development. however, traditional procurement methods in many countries have faced significant challenges. these challenges include inefficiencies in the procurement processes, lack of transparency, limited accountability, and difficulties in managing increasingly complex procurement demands. traditional procurement systems are often decentralized, with individual public sector entities managing their own procurement activities. this decentralization can lead to inconsistencies in procurement practices, fragmented supply chains, and inefficiencies in resource allocation. additionally, traditional systems may suffer from extended procurement cycles, which delay project completion and increase costs. these systems also tend to lack transparency, making it difficult to track spending and detect irregularities, which can lead to corruption or mismanagement. in response to these challenges, many countries have begun transitioning to centralized procurement systems. a centralized system consolidates procurement activities across public sector entities, aiming to standardize processes, improve efficiency, and reduce costs through economies of scale. centralized procurement allows governments to streamline operations, negotiate better contracts, and improve oversight and accountability. despite these benefits, the transition to centralized procurement is not without challenges. some of the remaining issues include managing the integration of various stakeholders, ensuring compliance with new regulations, and fully optimizing the potential of centralized operations. recent research has investigated the potential of emerging technologies to address the limitations of both traditional and centralized procurement systems. technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (ai), and the internet of things (iot) are being increasingly adopted in public procurement to improve transparency, efficiency, and decision-making. blockchain offers a decentralized ledger that secures transactions, making procurement records tamper-proof and easier to track. ai is used to analyze procurement data, forecast demand, and automate processes, helping governments make more informed decisions and reduce cycle times. iot enhances inventory management by providing real-time data, allowing governments to monitor supply chains and minimize shortages or overstocking. this research aims to provide clear descriptions of both the traditional and centralized public procurement system, offering a comprehensive understanding of their structure and challenges. it also highlights 696",,,"enhance public procurement system: a preliminary investigation eng. omar alsiyabi and dr. mahmood al-kindi department of mechanical and industrial engineering, college of engineering, sultan qaboos university, al- khoud, muscat 123, oman dr. ahmed shaban department of mechanical and industrial engineering, college of engineering, sultan qaboos university, al- khoud, muscat 123, oman mechanical engineering department, faculty of engineering, fayoum university, fayoum 63514, egypt eng. thamir alkathiri an expert in procurement field, with 27 years of experience, muscat, oman",
89,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240135  Exploring The Factors Influencing Artificial Intelligence,"the quality of education is greatly improved using artificial intelligence (ai) technologies and tools. many organizations across the globe have incorporated the use of ai tools to enhance their teaching methods and prepare themselves against pandemics and other disruptions. on the other hand, practitioners do not completely understand the factors that influence the application of these systems. moreover, little research has examined the factors and challenges that facilitate the successful integration of artificial intelligence in higher education institutions in the sultanate of oman. as a result, there is a gap that this research identifies, defines, and assesses the key factors associated with ai integration in higher education. in this paper, we conducted semi-structured interviews with eight experts and extracted four factors. from these factors and challenges, we proposed a conceptual framework that was classified using the technological, organizational, and environmental (toe) framework and the technology acceptance model (tam) model. we used nvivo software after the categorization and involved eight experts in gathering the relevant data. the major findings were four factors and challenges: data readiness, educational transformation, financial readiness, and ethical anxiety. the study proposed a conceptual framework to investigate relationships between the factors and challenges and developed propositions for each. these propositions are crucial in understanding how these relationships impact the adoption of ai tools in the higher education sector. 698",,"This research identified key factors and challenges affecting AI adoption in Omani higher education, confirmed through literature and expert interviews, with some factors being notably more significant. Some factors and challenges were mentioned more frequently than others, highlighting the considerable effect of those specific factors and challenges. The top management of higher education institutions and the government should focus more on training and raising awareness of AI technologies to help change the behavior and perspective of the stakeholders and affect their intention to adopt AI tools. This study provides managerial insights and paves the way for the Omani government toward new horizons in the field of AI technologies, according to the vision of Oman 2040. Limitations included a shortage of experts which should be considered in interpreting the findings. As a foundation for further research, future work will utilize the TAM and TOE frameworks to assess institutions' intentions to adopt AI tools and develop strategies to address the identified challenges. Research endeavors should incorporate additional theoretical frameworks, such as the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and The Theory of Planned Behavior (TBP).

Recorded video lectures and supplemental reading materials emerged as the most effective tools, while limited peer interaction and challenges in understanding course material were identified as key areas requiring better support. These findings reflect the growing demand for flexibility in higher education, as many graduate students balance full-time work, family responsibilities, and academic commitments, making asynchronous courses not only an essential option, but one that requires further attention for improvement. The research offers practical recommendations to enhance the design and delivery of asynchronous courses. Incorporating structured opportunities for peer interaction such as small group discussions and peer review activities can foster collaboration and a sense of connection among students. Providing additional resources like interactive tutorials and practice problems can help students navigate complex concepts while offering more flexible office hours can ensure support is accessible for those with demanding schedules. These strategies aim to improve engagement, comprehension, and accessibility for students from diverse backgrounds. In the broader context of engineering education, this research highlights the importance of asynchronous courses in providing flexibility and access to a diverse group of learners. Addressing the identified challenges and implementing thoughtful improvements not only enhances the learning experience but also ensures courses remain inclusive and adaptable to students’ varied needs.

By measuring the dimensional accuracy of 3D-printed PLA discs and analyzing the data through Cp (process capability index) and Cpk (centering index), students gain hands-on exposure to the real-world application of statistical tools in manufacturing. The comparison of vertical and horizontal printing orientations highlights the importance of understanding and managing process variability. Students can see how data driven decisions, such as choosing the right print orientation, can significantly improve product quality. Patterns such as Cross and Concentric performed best in horizontal Printing, demonstrating how different design choices affect process outcomes, while vertical Printing showed challenges in maintaining consistent quality. This contrast provides a rich opportunity for students to interpret and analyze statistical results, identifying areas for improvement and optimization. Through this exercise, students apply statistical concepts like standard deviation, process capability, and Six Sigma and learn the importance of data collection, measurement precision, and critical thinking in addressing real-world manufacturing issues. This combination of theory and practice helps solidify their understanding of statistics and its role in ensuring quality in industrial applications. The hands-on exploration of 3D printing and process capability analysis offers students a rich learning experience that bridges theoretical concepts with real-world applications.

95,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240142  Investigating The Impact Of Correlated Demand On,"the complexity of supply chains, consisting of retailers, wholesalers, distributors, manufacturers, and suppliers, poses a significant challenge to effective coordination and management. one of the most widely recognized issues in these systems is the bullwhip effect, where small fluctuations in consumer demand can cause amplified variations in orders as they propagate upstream through the supply chain. this phenomenon results in distorted demand information, excessive inventory, increased production costs, and inefficient resource allocation, all of which compromise the overall performance of supply chains. the bullwhip effect is primarily influenced by factors such as order batching, long lead times, price variations, and demand signal processing, with the latter being one of the most critical contributors. in demand signal processing, forecasts at one stage of the supply chain are based on the orders received from the immediate downstream partner rather than the actual customer demand. previous research on the bullwhip effect has largely focused on multi-echelon supply chains with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) demand patterns, but the effects of correlated demand, where demand in one period is dependent on the demand in previous periods, remain underexplored— especially in multi-echelon systems. while some studies have addressed correlated demand in single-echelon systems, the gap in understanding its impact on multi- echelon supply chains under various operational conditions remains significant. this research aims to fill this gap by investigating the impact of correlated demand on the dynamic performance of multi-echelon supply chains. specifically, the research examines how correlated demand—modeled using a first-order autoregressive ar(1) demand process—affects the bullwhip effect in a multi-echelon system. the study also explores how collaboration and information sharing between supply chain partners can mitigate the adverse effects of demand distortion, providing insights into strategies for improving supply chain management practices. the research employs a simulation modeling approach to analyze these dynamics. the simulation model represents a multi-echelon supply chain operating under a generalized order-up-to (out) policy and integrates a moving average forecasting method at each echelon. this allows for a detailed examination of how correlated demand and varying levels of information sharing between supply chain partners influence the bullwhip effect and the overall performance of the supply chain. the model incorporates several key variables, including the nature of demand, forecasting techniques, and ordering policies, which are analyzed under different operational and collaborative scenarios. this research is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge on the bullwhip effect by providing a more comprehensive understanding of how correlated demand impacts multi-echelon supply chains. the study also highlights the potential benefits of collaborative practices such as information sharing of customer demand, forecasting method and ordering policies, which may help to reduce the negative consequences of demand amplification. by investigating these factors, the 749",,,"the dynamic performance of multi-echelon supply chains ahmed shaban department of mechanical and industrial engineering, college of engineering, sultan qaboos university, al-khoud, muscat 123, oman mechanical engineering department, faculty of engineering, fayoum university, fayoum 63514, egypt nasr al-hinai department of mechanical and industrial engineering, college of engineering, sultan qaboos university, al-khoud, muscat 123, oman",

Evolution of Maintenance Given the new wave of digital transformation and AI penetrating the industrial automation market, suppliers should ensure their readiness to commit to their customers’ needs. Optimizing parts replacements and upgrade replacements deliveries requires planning far in advance between the customer and the supplier. In this fast-paced economy, there is very little room for operational delays as every additional minute of downtime at a facility can be incredibly costly. A streamlined communication process between suppliers and customers can ensure a smooth transition for facility life extensions and revamps. Maximizing visibility of supplier installed base at customer facility allows the supplier and the customer to work together to devise obsolescence management roll outs within budget constraints, around routine maintenance activities, and with just-in-time deliveries.","supplier-customer collaboration mora issa and muhammad imran department of mechanical and industrial engineering rochester institute of technology dubai, united arab emirates mi5778@rit.edu, mxicad@rit.edu",

FSP is used to manipulate the mechanical properties of alloys to achieve superior characteristics in automotive and aeronautical applications. In this research, we concluded that first; we can improve the strength and toughness of the material, hence handling higher loads. Second, FSP can increase the hardness of the products via creating a more indentation resistant surface. Third, there is a direct link between the processing parameters with the mechanical properties. These conclusions are that a high spindle speed is directly linked to an increase in surface hardness and a low spindle speed, and a low feed rate setting can be directly linked to the increase in material strength. The latter is true since the process is considerably slow causing more friction to happen and more distortion to occur in the material leading to strain hardening.",on lm-25 aluminum alloy imad amine department of engineering and technology american college of the middle east kuwait college of engineering and technology american university of middle east kuwait imad.amine@acm.edu.kw,
104,Doi: 10.46254/Gc02.20240155  Blockchain Integration In Automotive Supply Chains:,"the automotive industry is among the sectors most significantly impacted by challenges related to its global supply chains, which are characterized by complex multi-tiered supplier networks and fragmented data systems. the integration of components from numerous suppliers, combined with reliance on a limited number of part-time providers, results in operational inefficiencies that compromise safety, quality, and brand integrity. these challenges manifest in issues such as restricted visibility, traceability concerns, and the proliferation of counterfeit parts. this study examines the potential for transforming automotive supply chains through the decentralization and enhancement of transparency, immutability, and audit capabilities afforded by blockchain technology. employing a theory-building qualitative research methodology, the paper elucidates how the integration of blockchain and smart contracts can facilitate end-to-end traceability and compliance enforcement across organizations, thereby strengthening the coordination between original equipment manufacturers (oems) and their suppliers. the primary insights reveal that the implementation of blockchain can diminish the risk associated with counterfeit components, enhance the efficiency of logistics operations, and optimize inventory management practices. the feasibility of the proposed framework is further substantiated through a case study of bmw's partchain initiative. the findings underscore the potential of blockchain technology to fundamentally transform the automotive industry by introducing enhanced efficiency, security, and transparency within the supply chain.","blockchain, smart contracts","The automotive supply chain can be radically transformed by using blockchain technology to increase transparency, security and operational efficiency. With a decentralized and immutable ledger at its core, businesses can enjoy full traceability through every tier of the supply chain — reducing counterfeit component risks and building trust among stakeholders. This paper analyses BMW's PartChain Initiative and provides evidence of tangible value from blockchain in current supply chain systems - smart contracts automating many logistics, inventory management, and compliance steps. While there are some technical challenges that remain to access and integrate reliable information and data for example on privacy protection, but these can be mitigated with adequate planning, stakeholder engagement/awareness processes and regulation. Ultimately, industry practitioners should consider getting all stakeholders in the supply chain involved early on in their adoption experience process, invest in interoperable blockchain platforms, and foster training to educate human resources with the technical expertise needed within organizations. More broadly, the next steps for research include long-term effects of blockchain use and cross-industry applications where the benefits can have a greater impact and technology improvements that help scalability and interoperability. The introduction of blockchain technology not only ensures high standards in quality assurance, but also reduces inefficiencies and fosters vital collaborations throughout the supply chain within automakers to drive innovation as the industry gears up for a rapidly growing global market. 789","overcoming challenges and revolutionizing industry practices swarup patil manufacturing engineer dakkota integrated systems, llc hazel park, mi 48030, usa sdpatil@umich.edu","References

We also improved the work environment in an office in Kuwait by addressing Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) among office workers. Using the modified NMQ, we collected data from 50 office workers and identified the most common areas of pain. Our findings suggest that the design of the workstation (e.g. chairs without lumbar support), and the lack of exercise and stretching during working hours are significant factors contributing to MSDs.

The smart box offers substantial benefits to both customers and logistics providers. For customers, it provides real-time updates on package status, precise delivery timing, and convenient, flexible access to shipments. Despite these advantages, certain challenges remain, including high initial costs and limited information about senders and package contents, which could affect transparency and user experience. From the perspective of postal operators, the smart box has the potential to streamline courier operations, facilitate feedback collection, and support data-driven insights to enhance delivery efficiency. It also opens new service possibilities, enabling operators to safely transport temperature-sensitive items such as food, pharmaceuticals, and laboratory samples. Notably, this technology can be utilized by the Saudi Post Office and other delivery companies, offering a versatile solution adaptable to different logistics networks. To maximize the impact of this innovation, testing and initial implementation should be undertaken at the local level, ideally through collaboration between delivery companies, academic institutions, and industry specialists. Such a collaborative approach would generate valuable insights, optimize the system, and ensure that the smart box is effectively tailored to the logistics needs of Saudi Arabia and aligned with the goals of Vision 2030. Future research could focus on improving the model by testing it in diverse urban and rural settings to evaluate its adaptability and effectiveness. In addition, addressing challenges related to smart box placement, and exploring the integration of IoT combability and maintenance aspects would further contribute to advancing modern last- mile delivery solutions.","smart parcel delivery with contactless innovation rakan khalid alkahlani, khalid hassan almaliki, ahmed namr abuduhair and hassan hijry department of industrial engineering university of tabuk tabuk, 47315, saudi arabia rakankh6@gmail.com, khaledalmaliki178@gmail.com, abu.duhir@gmail.com, hhegri@ut.edu.sa mohammed omar aljohani hse supervisor engineer el seif engineering contracting company tabuk, neom, saudi arabia mohammedoj54@gmail.com",

It indicates the maximum stress a filament can withstand before breaking, making it a critical property for applications where durability and stability are essential. For instance, when manufacturing filaments for 3D printers, precise specifications regarding tensile strength under various conditions are crucial. Experiments, such as those involving nozzle temperature, printing speed, and layer thickness variations, help determine optimal settings for achieving high tensile strength. These settings directly influence the manufacturability and reliability of printed objects. • Nozzle Temperature: Higher temperatures improve material flow and adhesion during extrusion, enhancing structural integrity. • Printing Speed: Slower speeds allow for better precision and stronger bond formation between layers, resulting in higher tensile strength. • Layer Thickness: Optimal thickness ensures the filament is neither too brittle nor prone to faults during printing. Identifying the right combination of these factors enables manufacturers to produce filaments that exceed performance expectations for various applications, from industrial parts to consumer products. Rigorous testing ensures the production of reliable and durable 3D printed products. Optimal Parameters for rPP/NDPP Composite Based on experimentation, the recommended parameters for using the bio-composite (rPP/NDPP) are a nozzle temperature of 270°C, layer thickness of 0.1 mm, and printing speed of 60 mm/s or lower. These settings positively affect tensile strength, with a 95% confidence interval between 19.249 and 22.405 MPa. Natural Factors and Future Considerations Figure 6.

However, to sustain success, SMEs should consider expanding their Lean practices to include more advanced tools like TPM and Kaizen, along with proper employee training to maximize implementation. • Continuous monitoring and data analysis were identified as critical for maintaining Lean improvements over the long term. By implementing KPIs to regularly track performance in productivity, waste, and cycle times, SMEs can adapt their Lean strategies as necessary. This ongoing evaluation ensures that the benefits of Lean are maintained in dynamic market conditions. • VSM and 5S were highly effective in reducing waste, improving production times, and increasing productivity by 14%, while reducing operational costs by 3,000 soles. To sustain these improvements, continuous training and regular process evaluations are recommended to embed Lean practices into the company’s culture. • The diagnostic phase and VSM implementation identified key areas for improvement, such as bottlenecks in the cutting and sewing stages, leading to reduced waste, defects, and higher productivity. To further maximize the impact, SMEs should use VSM alongside other Lean tools like 5S for comprehensive process optimization. • Lean Manufacturing tools positively impacted both economic outcomes, such as productivity and cost reduction, and fostered a culture of continuous improvement. The hypothesis was confirmed, but future studies should explore broader applications across multiple SMEs to validate long-term sustainability. • The success of Lean Manufacturing tools, such as VSM and 5S, depends on their adaptation to the specific needs and limitations of each SME. While these tools have proven effective in general, the study suggests that customization of Lean strategies, tailored to the size, resources, and operational constraints of the SME, is essential for maximizing results and ensuring long-term sustainability.","productivity of a peruvian textile sme santiago andrés zegarra rosell, sebastian career of industrial engineering faculty of engineering and architecture university of lima lima-perú 20183470@aloe.ulima.edu.pe sebastian dario ramos tenorio student career of industrial engineering university of lima lima, perú 20183129@aloe.ulima.edu.pe",
